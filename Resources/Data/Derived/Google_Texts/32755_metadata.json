A GOP consultant labeled him a show horse, and a strategist for a rival presidential campaign called him the Mitt Romney of 2016 \u2014 the Republican no other Republican can stand.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like the guy,\u201d former president George W. Bush, Cruz\u2019s old boss, told supporters at a fundraiser for his brother Jeb Bush last month.\n\nThe list of GOP politicians and operatives willing to take open shots at Cruz has grown long: Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, former House speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio), Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), fellow Texas Sen. John Cornyn, Sen. John Thune (S.D.), former senator Tom Coburn (Okla.) \u2014 and on and on.\n\nCruz does not appear to be bothered. The senator and presidential candidate seems to relish the fact that so many fellow Republicans love to hate him. On the trail, the Texas Republican fondly recounts his skirmishes. His campaign blasts out fundraising e-mails quoting the critical words. When Boehner called Cruz a jackass, his campaign\u2019s solicitation quoted him as saying, \u201cI will wear it as a badge of honor because I refuse to join their club.\u201d A super PAC supporting Cruz released a radio spot Tuesday boasting that Boehner referred to Cruz as a \u201ca pain in the you-know-what.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Cruz\u2019s status as persona non grata has become part of his political persona: He uses the enmity of others to paint himself as an outsider, someone whose role taking on Washington prompted an ugly backlash from the establishment that he counts as a point of pride.\n\n1 of 53 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Sen.

Darron Cummings/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nLook for him to relish the role at his next chance to get under his rivals\u2019 skin \u2014 at a debate hosted by Fox Business Network in Milwaukee on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI will acknowledge that when I\u2019m in the Senate dining room I\u2019ve sometimes wondered if I need a food taster,\u201d Cruz said to laughs in Fort Dodge, Iowa, last month. He added: \u201cIf you ain\u2019t never stood up to Washington, at any time in your life, you\u2019re not gonna suddenly discover the courage to do so if you happen to land at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\nMany of those who knock Cruz cite the same origins of their antipathy: Cruz is a grandstander, they say, who trashes fellow Republicans for his own gain. Once an admirer of John G. Roberts Jr., he now criticizes the chief justice \u2014 and Bush too, the president who appointed Roberts. He unsuccessfully tried to stop passage of a spending bill last year, forcing a series of weekend votes. He pointedly refused to endorse Cornyn in a primary race two years ago \u2014 a breach of Senate etiquette.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of love lost for the guy,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.). \u201cAnd it\u2019 s not what he\u2019s trying to accomplish or what he says he\u2019s trying to accomplish that bothers people,\u201d Holmes added. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s consistently sacrificed the mutual goals of many for his personal enhancement.\u201d\n\nKarl Rove, a former senior adviser to Bush, sees Cruz as someone who conveniently takes aim at former allies \u201cfor political purposes.\u201d\n\nRove said on Fox News recently that Bush soured on Cruz even though the younger Texan got his start on Bush\u2019s 2000 campaign. It happened in part because Cruz faulted Bush for appointing Roberts to the top spot on the Supreme Court \u2014 and criticized his father, George H.W. Bush, for appointing since-retired justice David Souter.\n\nThe ex-president \u201cthought it was a little opportunistic,\u201d Rove said.\n\nCruz has vowed not to speak ill of any other Republicans running for the presidential nomination, but the trail has not been free of quarrels.\n\nPaul, one of the first national figures to endorse Cruz for his Senate race but now a rival for the GOP presidential nomination, has waded into an increasingly bitter fight with Cruz. Both men proposed plans to cut funds for Planned Parenthood, and both failed, but Cruz described Paul\u2019s as a \u201cshow vote.\u201d In an interview with Fox News Radio, Paul attacked Cruz as a blunderer who\u2019d \u201cchosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names, which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate.\u201d\n\nHuckabee, another rival for the nomination, spent days organizing a rally celebrating the liberation of Rowan County, Ky., Clerk Kim Davis, only to find that Cruz would be stopping by. Huckabee\u2019s organization physically prevented Cruz from speaking onstage or to a scrum of reporters, which forced him to give impromptu remarks far from the media\u2019s glare.\n\nCruz has also alienated many in Congress with his 2013 fight against the Affordable Care Act, which led to a government shutdown. He has spent much of his time in the Senate openly warring with both parties.\n\n\u201cHe plays into the frustrations and passions of good people,\u201d said Graham, another rival for the Republican presidential nomination, \u201cand creates narratives that don\u2019t exist at the expense of others. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s leadership. I think that\u2019s demagoguery.\u201d\n\n[Cruz once clerked for a chief justice, but he\u2019s no longer a friend of the court]\n\nThat hasn\u2019t always been Cruz\u2019s style.\n\nLong before he slammed the chief justice after rulings upholding the Affordable Care Act and legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide (Roberts dissented in that 5-to-4 decision), Cruz once emulated Roberts\u2019s arguments and invited him to participate in the 2000 Florida recount.\n\nAnd in \u201cThank You, President Bush,\u201d a 2004 collection of essays, Cruz defended the president\u2019s spending and education records. Comparing Bush to Lincoln, Cruz argued that critics failed to understand politics and needed to tone down such extreme rallying cries as one to abolish the Education Department. When voters hear that, Cruz wrote at the time, \u201ca lot of voters just hear \u2018abolish education\u2019 and back away.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2015, when Cruz is campaigning to abolish the Education Department \u2014 and describing his days in the Bush orbit less happily. In his own memoir,\u201cA Time for Truth,\u201d Cruz wrote that he was cocky while working on the Bush campaign and overstepped his bounds.\n\n\u201cThey really didn\u2019t give a flip what some twenty-something kid thought might or might not be the right policy outcome,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a consequence, I burned a fair number of bridges on the Bush campaign.\u201d\n\nCruz also chronicled his Senate spats in the book, writing that the \u201cdriving force\u201d in Washington on both sides of the aisle is \u201crisk aversion.\u201d Government is \u201ccorrupt,\u201d he wrote, and telling the truth in Washington is a \u201cradical act.\u201d He recalled a lunch where he said he wouldn\u2019t go forward with a leadership plan on the debt limit.\n\n\u201cIn the two years I\u2019ve been in the Senate, nothing I have said or done has engendered more venom and animosity from my fellow Republicans than the simple objection I made that afternoon,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMore recently, Cruz has called McConnell a liar on the Senate floor, and he said on the floor and elsewhere that Republican leaders are \u201ceffective\u201d Democrats who provide a rubber stamp for President Obama.\n\nSome said Cruz makes a lot of noise in the Senate but gets little done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classic show-horse-\n\nversus-workhorse dynamic,\u201d said John Hart, former communications director for Coburn. \u201cIt\u2019s putting his own political ambition ahead of the interests of the country, and I hope voters see through it.\u201d\n\n[Presidential candidate Ted Cruz can\u2019t win in the Senate]\n\nCruz\u2019s actions have at times attracted a backlash.\n\nIn September, McConnell went out of his way to deny Cruz the chance to shut down the government over the funding of Planned Parenthood, and Republican senators celebrated Cruz\u2019s defeat.\n\nIn both July and September, senators denied Cruz a procedural courtesy granting him a roll-call vote, a rare rebuke illustrating his unpopularity among his colleagues.\n\n\u201cThat is different than anything I\u2019ve ever seen in my years here,\u201d said McCain, a longtime nemesis.\n\nCatherine Frazier, a Cruz spokeswoman, said the senator has \u201ca record of effectiveness\u201d in Congress and \u201cshined a light\u201d on the failures of the Republican majority.\n\n\u201cThese people keep shooting arrows at him, trying to take him out, and he\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d she said.\n\nTo some supporters, Cruz\u2019s skirmishes make the candidate more attractive.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s hated by the political establishment,\u201d said Chart Westcott, a Dallas biotech investor and Cruz donor. \u201cHe\u2019s got that original outsider status, and that\u2019s what I love and has made him attractive to so many swaths of Americans.\u201d\n\nDespite his bomb-throwing persona, Cruz is often a genial presence in person and on the campaign trail, cracking jokes, doing impressions and telling stories about his young daughters.\n\nRob Marks, a friend from Cruz\u2019s time at Princeton University, said he understands why some people might take the firmness in beliefs for arrogance.\n\n\u201cA lot of people did not like him, I think that\u2019s a fair statement. He got in controversies. He didn\u2019t shy away from them,\u201d Marks said of their years debating at Princeton University.\n\nBut Marks and another friend, David Panton, describe Cruz as fiercely loyal. Panton\u2019s father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and Panton thought Cruz didn\u2019t know; the senator and his wife found out and sent a spray of yellow carnations to the hospital room. Cruz called Panton shortly after the flowers arrived earlier this year to wish Panton a happy birthday and was one of the last people to speak to Panton\u2019s father before he died.\n\nPanton said he asked Cruz recently how he stands the constant criticism and deflects the barbs.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Ted, how do you deal with this?\u2019 \u201d Panton said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I believe in what I\u2019m doing.\u2019 Ted definitely has an incredibly thick skin.\u201d\n\nAbby Livingston and Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican presidential candidate says the enmity of others is really just a backlash to his effort to take on the establishment.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Republican presidential candidate says the enmity of others is really just a backlash to his effort to take on the establishment.", "title": "A lot of people just don\u2019t like Ted Cruz.
