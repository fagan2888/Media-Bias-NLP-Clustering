BOULDER — Officials at Naropa University and the University of Colorado confirmed Friday that plans are in the works to bring the Dalai Lama to speak on CU’s campus in October in what would be the Tibetan spiritual leader’s first visit to Boulder in 18 years.

Organizers are considering the 11,000-seat Coors Events Center for the appearance by the 79-year-old exiled Buddhist leader, CU Police Chief Melissa Zak said.

The date of the visit has not been announced.

“Naropa University is delighted that His Holiness the Dalai Lama is returning to Boulder in October 2015,” Naropa president Charles G. Lief said in a statement. “As a Buddhist-inspired university, Naropa’s connection with His Holiness and his work goes back to his first visit to the United States more than 30 years ago, when past and current Naropa staff and faculty were involved as organizers.
