In doing so, they signed their rights away. And now -- hit with soaring police costs that blew up this year when the force\u2019s 6,300 officers were awarded a whopping 8.55% raise -- they want a new deal that guarantees them a say in the price or in how their communities are policed.\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nResponse times are fine, crime is plummeting and the service provided is good, mayors of the 324 communities policed by the OPP agree -- but there\u2019s a big problem.\n\nThe cost is killing them.\n\nAs cities wrestle with increasingly unmanageable police budgets, the issue -- brought to a head with the recently announced 8.55% raise for 6,300 OPP officers -- has reached a breaking point in some rural communities.\n\nMayors of municipalities that switched to OPP to save money on administration and equipment updates -- dozens have traded in local forces during the past two decades -- say their towns are scraping by to pay the bills.\n\nTold they must pay anyway, they want change.\n\nAnd they have suggestions: Pull policing out of the municipal budget or give municipalities a say.\n\n\u201cSay for pay, that\u2019s what we want,\u201d said Norfolk County Mayor Dennis Travale, adding his community of 65,000 likely would have had a tax break if not for the OPP raise.\n\nInstead, Norfolk residents were slapped with a 1.4% hike.\n\n\u201cThe frustration is we don\u2019t have a chair at the table, so I have to throw rocks and grenades from the sidelines,\u201d Travale said.\n\nIt\u2019s become so bad some mayors have hinted at bankruptcy, while others mull returning to municipal forces. But for most that\u2019s not an option.\n\n\u201cYour upfront costs are going to be tremendous,\u201d Travale said. \u201cWe\u2019re in for the long run.\u201d\n\nThe way it works now, the province tells OPP-serviced communities what the police budget will be and how staffing will work.\n\n\u201cWe have no control over that money,\u201d said Peter Politis, mayor of Cochrane, in northern Ontario, and where households pay $820 this year for police services \u2014 triple what they paid a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThe province makes all the decisions . . . You can\u2019t have us pay for your service while you go and do whatever.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, Politis, Travale and four others formed the Mayor\u2019s Coalition for Affordable Sustainable Accountable policing. The group has grown to 150 members.\n\n\u201cWe want some control over how many police officers there are, and what they are doing,\u201d said Politis. \u201cDo we need three police officers to go into a school and tell kids to wear a bicycle helmet? No, we don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers are choking right now on the taxes they pay in this country.\u201d\n\njennifer.obrien@sunmedia.ca\n\ntwitter.com/obrienatlfpress\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nFor years now, Ontario communities have said they\u2019ve been handcuffed by the OPP, forced to pay soaring police costs with no say in how their communities are policed, how many \u201cboots are on the ground,\u201d so to speak.\n\nAnd under the OPP\u2019s complicated billing system, that has meant paying costs that varied greatly across the province -- with household policing bills ranging from nearly $1,000 in some towns to a jaw-dropping $9 in one tiny Manitoulin community.\n\nAdmitting the system isn\u2019t fair, the OPP has pitched a billing model under which every household would pay a base amount of $260, topped up by a calls-for-service cost starting in 2015.\n\n\u201cOur billing model has frankly been a mess,\u201d said OPP Commissioner Chris Lewis. \u201cIt was based on workload, so if you were in a rural township with a couple hundred houses, you virtually paid nothing. You got a police force, ready to go, but because they were never used you never paid for it.\u201d\n\nHouseholds in the next town -- which could be across the street according to the town line, such as the case in Bancroft, northeast of Peterborough, could pay hundreds of dollars more because schools, businesses and a hospital mean more calls for service.\n\n\u201cNow everybody on both sides of the road is going to be paying the same thing,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThough the new billing model has the support of a committee struck by the Assocation of Municipalities of Ontario, which hopes to make recommendations on implementing the model by the end of March, leaders of some towns that have enjoyed lower costs say a sudden hike could hurt their taxpayers.\n\nUltimately, the province will decide whether to implement the new system.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take those kinds of increases,\u201d said Bill Vrebosch, mayor of East Ferris Township, south of North Bay, who calculates policing costs on his taxpayers\u2019 bills -- now about $134 a year -- would more than double under the new system.\n\nVrebosch claimed the model essentially asks most municipalities to subsidize communities that are heavy users of OPP services. \u201cThis whole process is pitting municipality against municipality,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it\u2019s a start, said Mayor Peter Politis of Cochrane, northeast of Timmins, head of the Mayor\u2019s Coalition for Affordable, Sustainable, Accountable Policing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, what your justification is, you have to pay more than $9 for policing services,\u201d said Politis, referring to the situation on Cockburn Island, in the Manitoulin area.\n\n- With files from QMI Agency\n\n--- --- ---\n\nAnnual cost of policing\n\nThroughout Ontario: $3.8 billion\n\nCost of OPP policing: $1 billion\n\nCost of OPP policing in municipalities: $360 million\n\nAverage cost of policing, per household, in Ontario cities: $700\n\nAverage cost of policing, per household, in towns policed by the OPP: $368 (though it varies greatly)\n\n--- --- ---\n\nEqualized billing\n\nProposed equalized billing model to take effect in 2015: $260 base cost per household for police services, plus calls for service.\n\nUnder current model\n\nCost for police service varies greatly, with Cockburn Island at the low end -- paying $9 a year per household and Atikokan and Kenora at the high end, paying about $1,000 each .\n\n$9: Cockburn Island (there are some summer residences there, but no one lives there year round)\n\n$125: Tiny Township; pop. 12,000\n\n$134: East Ferris; pop. 4,500\n\n$580: Tecumseh; pop. 25,000\n\n$820: Cochrane; pop. 6,500\n\n$1,000: Atikokan; pop. 2,600\n\n--- --- ---\n\nOPP BY THE NUMBERS\n\n6,300 police officers\n\n2,300 civilian employees\n\n77 detachments (150 locations within them)\n\n87 satellite stations\n\n5 satellite stations\n\n5 communication centres with 911 call takers and dispatchers\n\n--- --- ---\n\nExpenses\n\nIn 2011/2012, OPP operating expenses totalled $979 million\n\nStaffing cost was 87% of that\n\nMunicipalities reimbursed $362 million of the total\n\n--- --- ---\n\nWhat the politicians said\n\nMadeleine Meilleur, Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services, said the government is doing its best to fix a complicated system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the right model. I don\u2019t think our model is transparent. It\u2019s difficult to understand and it\u2019s not fair to municipalities,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also said if mayors are counting on being able to negotiate with the province on how policing will actually happen in their communities -- and some are -- they should prepare for an uphill battle.\n\nTory MPP Steve Clark, his party\u2019s community safety and correctional services critic, said he\u2019s received a \u201cstack\u201d of letters from mayors who\u2019ll see tax bills rise in their communities if the OPP operation goes to an equalized fee model.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got chaos in the municipal sector, with people not knowing whether their billing will go up or down,\u201d said Clark, who raised the issue during question period Thursday.\n\nPeggy Sattler, the NDP\u2019s community safety and correctional services critic, could not be reached.\n\n--- --- ---\n\nAverage salary for a first-class constable\n\nOPP $94, 702\n\nLondon $90,215\n\nToronto $90,623\n\n--- --- ---\n\nOPP pay, by years of experience\n\n2-7 $90,623\n\n8-16 $93,342\n\n17-22 $96,061\n\n23+ $98,780\n\n--- --- ---\n\nDollars and cents\n\nAfter a two-year freeze, OPP officers received an 8.55% pay increase -- the result of a provincial government promise to make them the highest paid in Ontario.\n\n--- --- ---\n\nHow OPP is trying to reduce costs\n\n46 projects ongoing, including surveys, environmental scans and deployment analyses.\n\nHiring of 200 civilians to write reports (dictated over phone) so officers can remain out on patrol.\n\nAwaiting direction from the government\u2019s Future of Policing Advisory panel, which has representatives from 12 organizations -- half of them police associations and services.\n\nSource: OPP\n\n--- --- ---\n\nCriticism from auditor general in 2012:\n\nBetween 2004/2005 and 2011/2012, crime rates reported by OPP dropped 10%, Crashes: Fatalities down 45%, injuries 32%, calls for service stable. But costs were up 27%, mostly from hiring.\n\nOPP had little control over scheduling and most officers chose 12-hour shifts, resulting in overstaffing during slow hours compared to the busy afternoon hours.
