The bill had earlier passed the Republican-controlled Senate in a process known as \"reconciliation\" in order to duck a Democratic filibuster.\n\nAs an added bonus, the bill also bars any federal money for Planned Parenthood, as Congressional conservatives had been vowing to do ever since a series of heavily edited, though nonetheless appalling, videos on the sale of fetal tissue touched off a new fight in the Culture Wars.\n\nAs CNN reports, Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBecause we're a full-service operation, here's how your members of Congress voted on the lightning-rod legislation. You can send brickbats or laurels, according to your conscience:\n\nVoting aye were Republican U.S. Reps. Lou Barletta; Charlie Dent; Mike Kelly; Tom Marino, Glenn G.T. Thompson; Scott Perry; Mike Fitzpatrick; Pat Meehan; Bill Shuster; Tom Marino; Keith Rothfus; Ryan Costello; Tim Murphy and Joe Pitts.\n\nNo votes were U.S. Reps. Brendan Boyle; Bob Brady; Chaka Fattah; Mike Doyle and Matt Cartwright.\n\nThe rest of the day's news starts now.\n\nSomething something something controversial Kathleen Kane something something.\n\nState Sen. Rob Teplitz is running for re-election in what's expected to be a hard fought race.\n\nAnd this year's special elections, thankfully, will coincide with the spring primary, saving the taxpayers some dough.\n\nNo, you didn't win Powerball.
