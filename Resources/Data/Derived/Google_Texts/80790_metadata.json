We can understand that, because as we believe we have pointed out, they are crazy. Less explicable is the fact that the Des Moines Register, an actual journalistic newspaper enterprise, asked Trump to sit down for an interview just like he was a real political candidate or something!\n\nIn the interview, he explained that neither Jeb bush nor Mitt Romney has what it takes to win, which apparently is Being Donald Trump, and was particularly harsh on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, which should have squashed Barack Obama like a bug. A bug that was not even born in America, probably! He also said that he now regrets not actually making the transition from talking about running in 2012, which he was very good at, to actually running in 2012, which, on reflection, he believes he would have also been very, very good at:\n\n\u201cI was leading in every poll. \u2026 I regret that I didn\u2019t stay in,\u201d he said in an interview before a private dinner at the Stine Barn in West Des Moines. \u201cI would\u2019ve won the race against (President Barack) Obama. He would\u2019ve been easy. Hillary (Clinton) is tougher to beat than Obama, but Hillary is very beatable.\u201d\n\nWe like that \u201cI regret that I didn\u2019t stay in\u201d phrasing a heck of a lot, because it is so very close to being a fact, apart from the minor detail that he was never actually \u201cin,\u201d so \u201cstaying in\u201d is kind of something that never could have happened, except in the YOOGELY rich imagination of Donald Trump.\n\nTrump even explained why he didn\u2019t \u201cstay in\u201d the 2012 race, and he had some very compelling reasons: for one thing, he had a very, very important reality television show that he had just renewed a contract for, and you don\u2019t just go disappointing NBC by walking away from an intergalactically enormous hit like The Apprentice all willy-nilly (the signals should be reaching the Andromeda Galaxy in approximately 2,538,000 years, and when they do, the Andromedans will be bowled over). Also, he was in the middle of some very important golf course and hotel deals that haven\u2019t yet gone bankrupt. But with no renewal for The Apprentice, his calendar is pretty clear for 2016, so chances are he will continue to talk about running, for sure.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump spoke at the Steve King/Citizens United Moronic Convergence, and said many true things, the most newsworthy of which is that he got thunderous applause for his proclamations that neither Romney nor Bush should be the 2016 Republican candidate. Of Romney, Trump said,\n\n\u201cHe failed. He choked. He\u2019s like a deal-maker that didn\u2019t close the deal. He shouldn\u2019t be running again. He had a great opportunity to win against a president that was absolutely lame, and he didn\u2019t do it. \u2026 The 47 percent statement, which was a disaster, is not going away. Romneycare is not going away. All of his problems are not going away. He should get out and get out quickly.\u201d\n\nAs for Jeb Bush, Trump got even stronger applause for such witticisms as \u201cYou can\u2019t have Bush,\u201d \u201cThe last thing we need is another Bush,\u201d and the pithy \u201cFrankly we\u2019ve had enough of the Bushes. We\u2019re Bushed out.\u201d Those with especially strong stomachs can watch the whole thing:\n\nWe liked the part wher Trump said that every single part of Obamacare is a lie, which came as news to us since we rather enjoy having insurance, but apparently it does not actually exist. Also, when Donald Trump is President, he will personally build \u201ca very, very powerful border,\u201d which we assume will go bankrupt after a few years. He also pledged to \u201cfight China\u201d somehow, although he was a bit fuzzy on the details. Best of all, he will not knuckle under to the Lamestream Media and pronounce Qatar as \u201ccutter,\u201d but will instead proudly say \u201ccatarrh,\u201d the way an American should.\n\n[Des Moines Register / Politico]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump was in Iowa this weekend making noises from his mouth hole about the possibility that he will keep talking forever about running for president, and", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Doktor Zoom", "og": {"url": "http://wonkette.com/573890/president-trump-recalls-how-easy-beating-obama-was-in-2012", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Trump-iowa.jpg", "title": "President Trump Recalls How Easy Beating Obama Was In 2012"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump was in Iowa this weekend making noises from his mouth hole about the \u2026", "creator": "@wonkette", "url": "http://wonkette.com/573890/president-trump-recalls-how-easy-beating-obama-was-in-2012", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Trump-iowa.jpg", "title": "President Trump Recalls How Easy Beating Obama Was In 2012", "site": "@wonkette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd17\"", "article_summary": "Also, when Donald Trump is President, he will personally build \u201ca very, very powerful border,\u201d which we assume will go bankrupt after a few years.\n\u2026 I regret that I didn\u2019t stay in,\u201d he said in an interview before a private dinner at the Stine Barn in West Des Moines.\nOf Romney, Trump said,\u201cHe failed.\nHe had a great opportunity to win against a president that was absolutely lame, and he didn\u2019t do it.\nDonald Trump was in Iowa this weekend making noises from his mouth hole about the possibility that he will keep talking forever about running for president, and people at Steve King\u2019s CrazyRama actually applauded him."}
