He said the most important thing he would do as president is to put good judges on the Supreme Court.\n\nPerry talked about the remarkable journey he\u2019s been blessed to be on that ultimately put him in a position to do something about abortion. He said he originally wanted to be a veterinarian but that God, in his \u201cremarkable sense of humor\u201d led him to politics instead.\n\n\u201cThe privileges and freedoms we have are so special and our founding fathers understood this so well\u2013 that the rights that we have come from God and not fro government,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the most basic right that we have emanates from our Creator and it is that unalienable right to life. We stand firmly on the principle that from conception until the last breath is drawn, life is sacred.\u201d\n\nPerry also took on pro-abortion Obamacare and told the pro-life audience that the states can do a better job at delivering better health care to people than the federal government.\n\n\u201cSuccess isn\u2019t how many people are forced to buy health care insurance but how many people have access to good quality health care,\u201d he said.\n\nThat matters, Perry said, because better access to health care is important for pregnant women and unborn children who may not be able to afford to have good prenatal care for themselves and their babies.\n\nGovernor Perry said he is most proud of his pro-life record as governor of Texas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of what we did to protect life,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI signed a parental consent law I sighed an ultrasound law so mothers facing that agonizing choice can actually see. And I know that it works. On my iPad, there is that 20 week picture of my first grandkid. And her mother understands now the most preciousness of life, that that\u2019s not a mass or something that ca be discarded. You see it right there in those beautiful toes and that beautiful nose and mouth. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s been a more powerful tool in the great repiotiire of technology than that sonogram to protect the life of the innocent in America.\u201d\n\nHe said his pro-life record as president would be one where his record would exceed his rhetoric \u2014 \u201cthis will be a show me presidency.\u201d\n\nPerry said the pro-life movement was successful in Texas because the opposition is attempting to use the courts to overturn the pro-life laws he signed.\n\n\u201cWe must pick a candidate to be our nominee who not only will win but who understands how to pick credentialed conservatives to the United States Supreme Court,\u201d Perry said. \u201cOur record is not pure\u201d on picking good justices, he said of previous presidents.\n\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter. Follow @LifeNewsHQ\n\nPerry said he picked six of the 9 justices on the Texas Supreme Court and said they are credentialed conservatives.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do squishy,\u201d he said.\n\nPerry said the pro-life movement must also seek out women who have been injured by abortion and let them know there is healing and forgiveness.\n\n\u201cAs long as Roe v. Wade is the law of the law we must stop abortion one pregnancy at a time, one woman at a time and I challenge you to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no such thing as a unwanted child in God\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to his record on pro-life issues, Perry was a consistent pro-life leader who went to bat numerous times for the cause of unborn children. In 2013, Perry signed a ban on late-term abortions into law.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s signing builds on our continued commitment to protecting life for more than a decade. This is an important day for those who support life and the health of women in Texas,\u201d Perry said. \u201cSigning HB2 further solidifies the foundation on which the culture of in Texas is built.\u201d\n\n\u201cHB2 brings improvements to the quality of care women receive,\u201d Perry added. \u201cHB2 protects unborn babies after the fifth month of pregnancy.\u201drequires a doctor providing abortions to secure admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and lastly, requires a doctor to personally administer the abortion-inducing drugs to the patient.\n\nAfter the Texas House voted, Perry issued a statement saying: \u201cThe tremendous outpouring of support for this legislation has demonstrated how Texas stands for life, and I commend everyone who wore blue, turned out and spoke up in support of life in our state. Now is not the time to waver, however, as the Senate continues its important work in support of women\u2019s health and protecting the lives of our most vulnerable Texans.\u201d\n\nPerry issued a call for a special session of the Texas legislature to pass the bill that a pro-abortion mob and Wendy Davis\u2019 filibuster prevented the legislature from passing.\n\n\u201cI am calling the Legislature back into session because too much important work remains undone for the people of Texas. Through their duly elected representatives, the citizens of our state have made crystal clear their priorities for our great state,\u201d Perry said.\n\n\u201cTexans value life and want to protect women and the unborn. Texans want a transportation system that keeps them moving. Texans want a court system that is fair and just. We will not allow the breakdown of decorum and decency to prevent us from doing what the people of this state hired us to do.\u201d\n\nBefore that, Perry delighted pro-life advocates when he made a bill to allow women to see an ultrasound of their baby before an abortion one of his legislative priorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to imagine people of good conscience sitting idly by through this, and in Texas we haven\u2019t,\u201d he said, saying the Supreme Court decision to allow virtually unlimited abortions, Roe v. Wade, is a \u201ctragedy.\u201d\n\nThat made it easier for the legislation to move through the legislative process after having been stalled for years, and Perry ultimately signed the pro-life bill into law. When used in pregnancy centers, ultrasounds convince more than 80 percent of women considering an abortion to keep their baby or consider adoption.\n\n\u201cGovernor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\u201d said Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for the governor.\n\nDays before signing the ultrasound legislation, Governor Perry signed into law the Choose Life license plate bill giving Texas motorists a life-affirming option on their vehicles. Under the legislation, motorists would be able to purchase Choose Life license plates to express their pro-life views and help support programs helping pregnant women.\n\nPerry has not only signed legislation but he has frequently stepped up to the plate to raise funds for pro-life efforts \u2014 including supporting Heroic Media, a group that spread the pro-life message via television and radio advertising. During a fundraising event, Perry joined in on exposing Obama\u2019s pro-abortion record and focused on him overturning the Mexico City Policy and forcing Americans to pay for funding groups that promote and perform abortions overseas.\n\n\u201cAmerica is in the business of exporting abortion. I\u2019m not happy about that,\u201d Perry said and, saying of unborn children, \u201cToo bad we can\u2019t protect them from the federal government.\u201d\n\nPerry\u2019s record has earned the support and praise from pro-life Texas leaders like Joe Pojman of Texas Alliance for Life, whose group endorsed him in his bid for re-election saying he \u201chas passionately supported laws protecting unborn babies and their mothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cTexas needs a leader who is unrelentingly pro-life,\u201d Pojman said. \u201cUnlike his opponent, Governor Perry has never given an inch to the life-threatening precepts of Roe v. Wade, whether verbally or by his actions as an elected official. He is a loyal advocate for the protection of unborn babies and their mothers, and TAL is eager for him to continue his dedicated and effective leadership of our state.\u201d\n\nColleen Parro, the former head of the Republican National Coalition for Life, previously told LifeNews.com that Perry has always been on the side of pro-life advocates.\n\n\u201cGovernor Perry has been a supporter of pro-life legislation and has signed into law whatever pro-life bills were passed by the Texas legislature,\u201d Parro says.\n\nPerry supported the Woman\u2019s Right to Know Act (2003), the Prenatal Protection Act (2003), the parental consent law (2005), and funding for alternatives to abortions (2005, 2007, 2009). Perry also signed a bill that allows criminals to be prosecuted for killing or injuring unborn children during the course of an assault against a pregnant woman.\n\n\u201cGovernor Perry\u2019s signature on these pro-life bills marks history for Texas women, their health, and their unborn children,\u201d Elizabeth Graham of Texas Right to Life told LifeNews.com at the time. Graham said Texas Right to Life worked closely with Perry on the legislation and the bills had his strong support throughout the legislative process. \u201cGovernor Perry recognized the deficiency in Texas that the unborn children of pregnant women were not protected under Texas law,\u201d Graham explained.\n\nIn addition, Gov. Perry has also strongly endorsed public funding for adult stem cell research. He has opposed embryonic stem cell research, which has developed no treatments or cures and requires the destruction of human embryos.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Former Texas Governor Rick Perry brought his pro-life values to the National Right to Life convention in New Orleans, Louisiana today and he told the audience a", "title": "Rick Perry: As a Pro-Life President I Will Put Good Judges on the Supreme Court. \u201cI Don\u2019t Do Squishy\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/07/10/rick-perry-as-a-pro-life-president-i-will-put-good-judges-on-the-supreme-court-i-dont-do-squishy/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rickperryz.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw=="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c01\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m really proud of what we did to protect life,\u201d Perry said.\nThis is an important day for those who support life and the health of women in Texas,\u201d Perry said.\nGovernor Perry said he is most proud of his pro-life record as governor of Texas.\nHe said the most important thing he would do as president is to put good judges on the Supreme Court.\n\u201cGovernor Perry has been a supporter of pro-life legislation and has signed into law whatever pro-life bills were passed by the Texas legislature,\u201d Parro says."}
