Eric Gray, 36, was taken into custody, the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a Facebook posting, and deputies found another man dead. Gray is being held at the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office jail on investigation of first-degree murder. The name of the man killed has not been released.\n\n\u201cThis unfortunate, isolated situation is the result of one neighbor being unable to communicate appropriately with another,\u201d Lt. John Feyen said, according to the release.\n\n\u201cEngaging a mediator to help reduce tensions and de-escalate disagreements is always preferred to avoid such tragic results,\u201d Feyen said.\n\nLoveland police said late this week that they were investigating possible connections between the fatal shooting Wednesday night of a man near his house and two other shootings in recent months that appeared to be random. A Windsor town employee in May was shot twice, killing him, while he was bicycling along a county road. And in April, a woman survived a gunshot to the neck while she was driving on I-25.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Argument led to fatal shooting in Loveland", "title": "Argument led to fatal shooting in Loveland", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/07/argument-led-to-fatal-shooting-in-loveland/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150607__lovelandp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150607__lovelandp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-07T14:18:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:07:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc806\"", "article_summary": "A fatal shooting Saturday afternoon near Loveland was the result of an argument between neighbors, according to the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nGray is being held at the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office jail on investigation of first-degree murder.\nThe shooting at 5:15 p.m. is not believed to be related to a recent spate of random shootings in Northern Colorado, a Larimer County sheriff\u2019s spokesman said.\nEric Gray, 36, was taken into custody, the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a Facebook posting, and deputies found another man dead.\nLoveland police said late this week that they were investigating possible connections between the fatal shooting Wednesday night of a man near his house and two other shootings in recent months that appeared to be random."}
