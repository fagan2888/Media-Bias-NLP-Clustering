Scott DesJarlais of South Pittsburg faces a heated challenge from state Sen. Jim Tracy of Shelbyville as he seeks a third term. DesJarlais came to Capitol Hill as part of the tea party Republican class of 2010 and has had to overcome an onslaught of negative publicity he received in late 2012 about past relationships, when documents from his divorce in 2001 were released. The disclosures have hampered fundraising that usually comes easy to an incumbent. In his legislative work, DesJarlais was one of the first House members to point to a wording issue in the Affordable Care Act that has become the basis of four federal lawsuits against the legislation.\n\nHis main challenge in the Republican primary is state Sen. Jim Tracy of Shelbyville, who mirrors DesJarlais' staunch conservatism on budget and social issues. Tracy has maintained a large fundraising advantage.\n\nOther Republicans running are David Tate of Whitwell, Robert Dogart of Signal Mountain, John Anderson of Bell Buckle, Michael Warden of Fayetteville, Oluyomi \"Fapas\" Faparusi, Sr. of South Pittsburg and Steve Lane of Mufreesboro.\n\nThe only Democrat running is Lenda Sherrell of Monteagle, who will face the Republican winner in November.\n\nScott DesJarlais, Republican\n\nAge: 50\n\n50 Home: South Pittsburg, Tenn.\n\nSouth Pittsburg, Tenn.

Meanwhile Rick Peppers, a Lascassas cattle rancher who has played host to Carr's annual T-Bones & Politics fundraiser, and Bryan Terry, a physician from Murfreesboro, have each raised more than $50,000, through self-financing and outside donations.\n\nThe GOP winner ought to have the upper hand in the general election.

After questioning the female driver, showing her his TBI badge and releasing her, she reported to the Murfreesboro Police Department that a police imposter had pulled her over and cursed at her.\n\nAfter a TBI investigation into the incident, Armour requested that his rank and pay be reduced, according to his personnel file. His superiors granted the request.\n\nTramel was fired in June 2013 for violating the department's policy against harassment and discrimination.
