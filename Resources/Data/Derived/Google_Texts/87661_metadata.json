He\u2019s returning to the political sphere to vie for the 8th district\u2019s Congress seat.\n\nHe says he doesn\u2019t believe the incumbent, Larry Bucshon (R-8th) has been representative of the 8th district, especially economically.\n\n\u201cToo many people work hard, play by the rules, but they can\u2019t make ends meet,\u201d Orentlicher says. \u201cThey\u2019re not earning enough money to meet their family\u2019s needs nor to make sure THAT their children have the opportunities they had and that their children should have.\u201d\n\nOrentlicher says he\u2019ll focus on economic issues, such as raising the minimum wage. Orentlicher says improving the economic situation of working Hoosiers is a top priority.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not earning a sufficient amount of money, that we give them a tax credit that brings their income up,\u201d Orentlicher says. \u201cSo we have a couple of tools to make sure people who are working hard can earn enough money to take care of their families.\u201d\n\nBucshon and Orentlicher are both physicians and Orentlicher says he expects the Affordable Care Act to play a significant role in the campaign.\n\nOrentlicher says both candidates agree it isn\u2019t the perfect way to go about healthcare reform, but says he differs from Bucshon in that reworking the act -- instead of repealing it -- is the solution.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Elections & Politics", "description": "Former state lawmaker David Orentlicher has announced his return to politics.
