Yet walk through its glass doors, and it reveals a centre buzzing with creativity, passion and community spirit.\n\nThe ground-breaking design project \u2013 the latest in a series of innovative schemes initiated by the town \u2013 was prompted by the closure of the factory in 2007. Dairy Crest was one of the last big employers in the town and its exit led to the loss of 162 jobs and opened the area up to opportunistic developers looking to cash in.\n\nBut the famously independent town was not prepared to see the land transferred to the hands of another faceless investor or national chain. Instead, a small group of residents put forward the novel suggestion that the community submit its own plans for the site.\n\nThis planted the first seeds of what eventually became the Atmos Project, and several years down the line the town is well and truly taking control of its future.\n\n\u201cOur slogan from the beginning has been \u2018the heart of a new economy\u2019 \u2013 how can we use this whole thing to really stimulate the economy here,\u201d explains project director, Rob Hopkins.\n\n\u201cIf we want communities like Totnes to have more control over their economic development, the way you do that is not just by opening the town up to Lidl, or Aldi or some other chain. You have to make sure a development is working as hard as possible for the town, rather than for distant shareholders.\n\n\u201cFor many people the starting point for developments is when they go to a consultation, are shown the designs and asked whether or not they like it. But you can\u2019t do really good development unless community is central to it from the beginning.\n\n\u201cHere, we are genuinely saying to residents \u2018this is a blank slate\u2019 and asking what they want to see happen to it.\u201d\n\nThe project is the result of seven years of campaigning by residents as they sought to secure the factory site for the community. In 2012, they formed the Totnes Community Development Society to coordinate their actions, and in August last year Dairy Crest agreed to sell them part of the land for just \u00a31.\n\nSince then, society trustees and volunteers have been engaged in consultation and outreach events to generate a picture of what local people want from the space. By the end of the process they hope to distil the many thousands of ideas and suggestions submitted by community members into a single, coherent development plan for the site.\n\nBringing together the diverse views of thousands of Totnesians has been no mean feat. Fellow project director Anna Lodge said the combination of outreach events and an interactive exhibition at the hub \u2013 created by local design company Encounters \u2013 had been crucial to their success.\n\n\u201cNo one really knows how to bring together over 8,000 people living in Totnes and ask them what they want, and then take those ideas to a group of professionals to turn into a formal plan,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe architects and other teams can go away and do their jobs, but they have to reflect those people\u2019s principles in the site.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been completely overwhelmed by the care people have taken to think about their role in this process \u2013 that\u2019s the really moving thing.\n\n\u201cAnd what the process has done is show that actually we can satisfy a lot of what people want. Even if they can\u2019t see the specific element they suggested, they can see it has been accounted for in the broader concept.\u201d\n\nThe plans for the area are still in the early stages, but clear priorities have already emerged. These include an emphasis on economic and ecological sustainability, a mix of social and commercial spaces, and the incorporation of \u201cgenuinely affordable\u201d housing.\n\nThese principles will be drawn up into a formal plan and submitted as a Community Right to Build order (CRtB) in mid-May, which is believed to be the first application of its kind to be submitted independently.\n\n\u201cOther applications have gone through a formal neighbourhood planning process, but this presents Totnes with an alternative route,\u201d explains Mrs Lodge. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a real responsibility and opportunity here.\u201d\n\nIt will then be put to a local referendum in October and if it passes, trustees hope to see building commence \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.\n\nThere is little doubt that Atmos has transformed the way people regard the development process in Totnes. But the project has also acted as an inspiration to towns up and down the country, many of whom have already been in contact with trustees for their experiences and advice.\n\nMr Hopkins said he would like to think their efforts were helping to make it easier for groups looking to follow in their footsteps.\n\n\u201cTotnes historically has been a laboratory town in lots of ways, whether it\u2019s local currencies or this. Some of those things don\u2019t go any further than Totnes, and some of those things do take off,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHopefully Atmos will be really important in changing the national narrative around development and who it\u2019s for - it\u2019s so important for communities to drive development.\n\n\u201cAnd I would say to anyone considering a community build \u2018go for it\u2019, because I think this is the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to be brave, you have to hold your nerve and you have to have difficult conversations\u201d added Mrs Lodge. \u201cBut that means you will build the right thing.\u201d\n\nMore information about the Atmos Project can be found at www.atmostotnes.org.\n\nThe Atmos Timeline\n\n2007: Dairy Crest closed its Totnes factory, after taking it over from Unigate in 2000.\n\n2012: Residents set up the Totnes Community Development Society (TCDS), and the town launched a campaign to secure a sustainable future for the Dairy Crest site.\n\n2014: In August, TCDS agreed the sale of part of the old factory site for \u00a31. In the following months, the first round of consultations was held.\n\n2015: Further consultations took place in January and April. These will be used inform the final plans, the first phase of which are due to be submitted as a CRtB in May.\n\n2015 onward: The CRtB plans will be put to a referendum in the summer. If the vote is in favour, building will start on the first phase of development as soon as possible.\n\nPlans for the second phase will be submitted via conventional planning processes.\n\nIn brief: Community Right to Build Orders\n\nCommunity Right to Build Orders (CRtBs) were introduced under the 2012 Localism Act. They allow communities to undertake small-scale, site-specific developments without going through the normal planning application process. Members of the community must set up a corporate body to manage the project. Plans must meet be approved by more than 50% of voters in a local referendum to succeed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the South West, development is sometimes regarded as a dirty word, synonymous with industrialisation, destruction of habitat and overbearing corporations.\n\nBut a determined network of residents in...", "og": {"site_name": "Western Morning News", "description": "In the South West, development is sometimes regarded as a dirty word, synonymous with industrialisation, destruction of habitat and overbearing corporations.\n\nBut a determined network of residents in...", "language": "en", "title": "Meet the Devon town taking control of its development", "url": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Meet-Devon-town-taking-control-development/story-26514370-detail/story.html", "image": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276272/Article/images/26514370/10076855.jpg", "type": "article", "section": "UK news"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the South West, development is sometimes regarded as a dirty word, synonymous with industrialisation, destruction of habitat and overbearing corporations.\n\nBut a determined network of residents in...", "title": "Meet the Devon town taking control of its development", "url": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Meet-Devon-town-taking-control-development/story-26514370-detail/story.html", "image": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276272/Article/images/26514370/10076855.jpg", "site": "WMNNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-16", "site": {"domain": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk"}, "fb": {"admins": "627876018,720666011,1064606560,100000421938678", "app_id": 376137025924193}, "msvalidate.01": "C1FC943041AC66B017981683C4A59C1E", "article": {"tag": "Western Morning News", "published_time": "2015-05-16T08:55:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-16T09:05:28+01:00", "author": "http://www.westernmorningnews.co.ukhttp://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/people/Western Morning News/profile.html"}, "y_key": "375f1bbd5088049b", "decorator": "newspaper-standard"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6b0\"", "article_summary": "This planted the first seeds of what eventually became the Atmos Project, and several years down the line the town is well and truly taking control of its future.\nBut a determined network of residents in Devon is staging a revolution as they fight to put people back in the heart of the development process.\n2012: Residents set up the Totnes Community Development Society (TCDS), and the town launched a campaign to secure a sustainable future for the Dairy Crest site.\n\u201cBut that means you will build the right thing.\u201dMore information about the Atmos Project can be found at www.atmostotnes.org.\nIn 2012, they formed the Totnes Community Development Society to coordinate their actions, and in August last year Dairy Crest agreed to sell them part of the land for just \u00a31."}
