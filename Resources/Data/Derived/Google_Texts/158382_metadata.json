(Video via Warner Bros., Flintstones Bedrock City)\n\nThe owner, Joe Speckels, is retiring and told the press, \"It's been really great. I've enjoyed it, but I'm tired.\"\n\nThe site sits on 62 acres. That includes the theme park made to look like Bedrock, the campgrounds and a drive-in diner.\n\nThe park apparently sold for $1.5 million to a local hotel operator who says the campground portion will be staying open.\n\nThe theme park may not be closed forever, though. The new owners say they are going to negotiate with Warner Bros., so they can continue to use the characters and scenes from the show.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 50 years, a theme park based on \"The Flintstones\" animated series is closing its doors.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "After 50 years, a theme park based on \"The Flintstones\" animated series is closing its doors.", "title": "Bye, Bedrock!
