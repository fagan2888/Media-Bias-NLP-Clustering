So there is a natural law \u2014 Mike Huckabee would say it\u2019s God\u2019s law \u2014 that is higher than positive law.\u201d\n\nBuchanan, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s harsh anti-LGBT laws, said his own father, as a Catholic, would have defied the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate to provide \u201cabortifacients and contraceptives to his employees.\u201d\n\nThe host said Buchanan and other conservatives seemed to be picking and choosing which laws they wished to follow.\n\n\u201cI think (Davis) did the right thing,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cShe defied the law and went to jail and paid the price \u2014 that\u2019s the price of civil disobedience of an unjust law.\u201d\n\nBuchanan, a former staffer for presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, said elected officials had a right to disobey laws they didn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in the Nixon White House, I urged the president to defy court orders mandating court-ordered busing from counties into cities, which were tearing apart cities and towns,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201c(I told Nixon to) defy the court and work with the Congress of the United States to really circumscribe the jurisdiction of the court under Article III, Section II of the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, it would be a constitutional confrontation, you\u2019re exactly right,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree with that, if you believe your position is correct.\u201d\n\nWatch the entire segment posted online by RWW Blog:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/msnbc_mj_buchanan_140804a-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Pat Buchanan on Kim Davis: She reminds me of that time I told Nixon to defy court on de-segregation"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen I was in the Nixon White House, I urged the president to defy court orders mandating court-ordered busing from counties into cities, which were tearing apart cities and towns,\u201d Buchanan said.\n\u201cThe people who sat in at the lunch counters, the people who defied court orders for marches, and all of these \u2014 they broke the law repeatedly, again and again, because they said the law is an unjust and immoral law,\u201d Buchanan told Newsmax TV.\n\u201cI think (Davis) did the right thing,\u201d Buchanan said.\n\u201c(I told Nixon to) defy the court and work with the Congress of the United States to really circumscribe the jurisdiction of the court under Article III, Section II of the Constitution.\u201d\u201cIn other words, it would be a constitutional confrontation, you\u2019re exactly right,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with that, if you believe your position is correct.\u201dWatch the entire segment posted online by RWW Blog:"}
