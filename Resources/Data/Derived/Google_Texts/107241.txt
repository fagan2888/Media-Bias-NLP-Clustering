Clovis said that Trump won't be championing any changes for now. But, he added, "We have to start taking a look not just at Medicare and Social Security but every program we have out there, because the budgetary discipline that we've shown over the last 84 years has been horrible."

That should be music to Ryan's ears. The House Speaker has not only championed reductions in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but also endorses steep cuts to a number of other lifelines like food stamps, K-12 education, Pell Grants, and welfare.

There are other areas where Trump and Ryan can still find common ground. Take taxes. Last year, Trump released a detailed tax plan that would hand the wealthy nearly 40 percent of the benefits and just over 16 percent to the bottom three-fifths of the country, in the end costing the government nearly $10 trillion over a decade. That's not so different from changes Ryan has put forward himself. The tax cuts in his 2013 budget would have cost $6 trillion, and while there weren't as many details, it would have handed "extremely large new tax cuts" to the rich, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, while potentially requiring increases on families who made less than $200,000.
