Story highlights Republicans repeatedly argue that any action by the Obama administration to transfer prisoners violates the law

President Barack Obama recently signed a spending bill and a series of defense bills that blocked the ability to make any additional moves from Gitmo

Washington (CNN) House Republicans hired a prominent Washington law firm to advise Speaker Paul Ryan on potentially suing the Obama Administration over its effort to close down Guantanamo Bay and transfer detainees to the United States, according to a senior House GOP leadership aide.

House GOP leaders approved a contract to spend up to $150,000 to attorneys at the Jones Day law firm to "explore legal options should the administration move forward," the aide told CNN.

Politico first reported on the move to retain the outside firm. Former House Speaker John Boehner used outside counsel to sue the Obama Administration over Obamacare and his immigration executive orders.

Republicans repeatedly argue that any action by the Obama administration to transfer prisoners violates the law because President Barack Obama recently signed a spending bill and a series of defense bills that blocked the ability to make any additional moves from Gitmo.

"Congress has spoken and the President does not have the authority to import Gitmo terrorist into the United States.
