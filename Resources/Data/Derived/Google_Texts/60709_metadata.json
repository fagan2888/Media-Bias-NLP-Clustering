(Ignore the fact that President Obama has been declared Liar of the Year by mainstream media \u201cFact Checker\u201d pundits for promising you could keep your health insurance policy and your doctor.)\n\n2: Avert your eyes from the millions of victims of the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act and remember there are 317 million Americans so the five million or more crushed by higher costs while their new Obamacare plan excludes their doctors and hospitals don\u2019t really matter. We\u2019re liberal Democrats and we have to break a few million eggs to make an omelet.\n\n3: \u201cAccept Ambiguity.\u201d Yup, that\u2019s your actual marching order Number Three from leading liberal activist and New Republic Magazine senior editor Jonathon Cohn.\n\n4: People losing insurance or paying a lot more is good because some other people will get insurance policies really cheap or free. Change is good no matter how many people suffer.\n\n5: Insurance premiums were going to go up anyway, so let\u2019s pretend Obamacare just makes the costs increase more slowly. Why? Because we can\u2019t really predict the future of Obamacare costs and we\u2019re supporting this no matter what happens!\n\nI\u2019m obviously paraphrasing while keeping the meanings accurate.\n\nJonathon Cohn is well-known to the left for his writing and big-government activism. He is an influential liberal, much like Kevin Drum of Mother Jones, Ezra Klein of MSNBC (and The American Prospect) and Jonathon Chait.\n\nThese are his talking points designed to be easily ingested and regurgitated by the faithful who are undaunted by the harsh realities millions of Americans are facing everyday due to this legislation.\n\nHe actually writes in his \u201c5 Rules for Talking about Obamacare in 2014,\u201d \u201cWhen the stories about higher premiums and plan cancellations first began appearing in October, my first reaction was \u2018This is news?\u2019People who follow health policy understood, from the beginning, that reform had to reorganize the market for people buying on their own \u2014 and that, as a result, some small portion of Americans would not be able to buy the same policies for the same prices.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s repeat the haughty sniff one more time in italics, shall we?\n\n\u201cPeople who follow health policy understood, from the beginning, that reform had to reorganize the market for people buying on their own \u2014 and that, as a result, some small portion of Americans would not be able to buy the same policies for the same prices.\u201d\n\nSo if you actually believed President Obama when he said you could keep your doctor, your hospital and your insurance policy, you obviously haven\u2019t followed health policy.\n\nThese liberals do more than just infer that you are a stupid cow if you believed the lies of the President, his staff and leading Democrats. And so, you deserve whatever befalls you due to this Democratic legislation.\n\nMoo.\n\nWe are also to presume the estimated 1 million to 5 million Americans whose excellent medical insurance policies are being cancelled and replaced with inferior policies for higher premiums don\u2019t matter in this liberal world. After all, this governmental policy only afflicts \u201csome small portion\u201d of the 317 million people in this country and still fails to offer coverage to 30 million Americans.\n\nIn cities across America, you Democrats who voted for Barack Obama are writing to your local newspapers sharing your terrible voters\u2019 remorse as your policies are cancelled and/or being gouged for a new policy. The few of you who have signed up are unsure if you really have a policy and, while you rightfully worry about having to make a claim, the liberal elites hand you talking points to defend the indefensible.\n\nAgain, they exhort you to cry, \u201cMoo.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nRick Jensen is Delaware\u2019s Award-Winning Conservative Talk Show Host on 1150AM WDEL and 93.7FM HD3, Streaming live on WDEL.com from 1pm \u2014 4pm EST.
