(CBS) \u2013 Unless clarified by the IRS or amended by Congress, the Affordable Care Act could shut down volunteer fire departments through out the country including the 60-member company in Stone Harbor.\n\nMike Donohue is a lawyer who recently let local fire chiefs know that a provision of the Affordable Care Act may require departments of 50 firefighters or more to pay health insurance to their volunteers.\n\n\u201cThe reason that local elected officials should be concerned is they may be facing huge costs to their volunteer companies that they simply couldn\u2019t cover.\u201d\n\nAt 20 to 30 thousand dollars a pop to provide their volunteers insurance, the Stone Harbor fire company would be on the hook for more than a million dollars.\n\nChief Roger Stanford, of Stone Harbor volunteer fire company says,\u201dWe\u2019re funded through donations through our town people and obviously we can\u2019t raise a million dollars for healthcare so we\u2019d have to look at other options.\u201d\n\nBack in September, national firefighter groups got involved pressuring the IRS to interpret the Affordable Care Act to make sure volunteer fire companies are exempt from the employer mandate.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s radio silence.\n\nWith the word \u201cvolunteer\u201d right in the name it\u2019s understood that volunteer firefighters don\u2019t get paid but because some departments offer stipends that\u2019s where the employment status gets confusing, and that\u2019s where firefighters are looking for clarification from the IRS.\n\nRight now some experts interpret the law to read that if a volunteer works 30 hours in a week for a department with 50 or more firefighters those volunteers are considered a full-time employees and eligible for healthcare insurance under the ACA employer mandate.\n\nDonohue says, \u201cI\u2019m hoping the IRS does the right thing and makes the right choice and classifies us not as employees so that we don\u2019t have to pay the healthcare.\u201d\n\nThis week, several members of Congress announced a bill that would amend the ACA to make sure volunteer first responders aren\u2019t included in the employer mandate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unless clarified by the IRS or amended by Congress, the Affordable Care Act could shut down volunteer fire departments through out the country including the 60-member company in Stone Harbor.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/12/11/aca-could-shut-down-volunteer-fire-departments-throughout-the-country/", "image": {"width": 368, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/stone-harbor-aca.jpg?w=368", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/stone-harbor-aca.jpg?w=368", "height": 208}, "type": "article", "description": "Unless clarified by the IRS or amended by Congress, the Affordable Care Act could shut down volunteer fire departments through out the country including the 60-member company in Stone Harbor.", "title": "ACA Could Shut Down Volunteer Fire Departments Throughout The Country"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/stone-harbor-aca.jpg?w=368", "description": "Unless clarified by the IRS or amended by Congress, the Affordable Care Act could shut down volunteer fire departments through out the country including the 60-member company in Stone Harbor.", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ACA Could Shut Down Volunteer Fire Departments Throughout The Country"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "heard on, local, new jersey, news, syndicated local, watch + listen, affordable care act, cleve bryan, healthcare, new jersey, stone harbor, volunteer firefighters", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, cleve bryan, healthcare, new jersey, stone harbor, volunteer firefighters"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca379\"", "article_summary": "By Cleve BryanSTONE HARBOR, N.J.
