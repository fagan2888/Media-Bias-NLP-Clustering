It is clear it cannot be fixed.\u201d\n\nCalling the bank the \u201cbridge to nowhere\u201d of corporate welfare, the group argued Ex-Im has failed to comply with reforms mandated in Congress\u2019 previous reauthorizations and noted that there are still 31 open fraud investigations at Ex-Im.\n\nIn addition to the fraud investigations, one former loan officer at the agency, Johnny Gutierrez, was indicted and pled guilty to accepting bribes on 19 different occasions between 2006 and 2013. His criminal charges\u2014and the possibly for more indictments in the remaining fraud cases\u2014have been cited multiple times by lawmakers opposing Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization.\n\n\u201cIts daily operations and its core mission do not align with free market principles. It is clear it cannot be fixed,\u201d said House Freedom Caucus members of #ExIm.\n\n\u201c[Ex-Im] is a classic example of crony capitalism,\u201d the House Freedom Caucus said.\n\nThe caucus also pushed House Republican leadership to refrain from bringing a bill reauthorizing the bank directly to the House floor.\n\nMichael Steel, spokesman for Speaker John Boehner, told The Daily Signal that House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas and his committee are continuing to lead discussions with Republican members on the issue.\n\n>>> House Panel Questions Export-Import Bank on \u2018Unacceptable\u2019 Delay of Information Requests About Ties to Clinton-Backed Firm\n\nHensarling\u2019s committee maintains jurisdiction over the 80-year-old agency, which provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s charter expires June 30, and policymakers are currently embroiled in a debate over whether to reauthorize it. Despite the concerns cited by the House Freedom Caucus and many other bank opponents, supporters believe it supports jobs in the U.S. and helps small businesses compete globally.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, serves as chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and has been one of the bank\u2019s more outspoken opponents. The group, which launched earlier this year, currently has approximately 40 members and bills itself as a caucus of House Republicans working to give a voice to \u201ccountless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them.\u201d\n\nMembers include Reps. Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho, John Fleming of Louisiana, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Matt Salmon of Arizona.\n\nIn addition to members of the House Freedom Caucus, a number of top Republicans have spoken out against reauthorizing Ex-Im. Two members of Republican leadership\u2014House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise\u2014said this month they oppose the bank. Scalise told CQ Roll Call on Monday Ex-Im was \u201con track\u201d to expire.\n\nAdditionally, Hensarling and Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have both called on Congress to allow Ex-Im\u2019s charter to expire.\n\nA number of Republican presidential contenders have also joined the chorus of GOP policymakers in advocating for Ex-Im\u2019s end. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, along with Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, have all voiced their opposition to its reauthorization.\n\nThe Republican Study Committee, which the House Freedom Caucus is a complementary group of, has not yet taken an official position on the bank\u2019s reauthorization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House Freedom Caucus has come out in opposition to the Export-Import Bank.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House Freedom Caucus has come out in opposition to the Export-Import Bank.", "title": "House Freedom Caucus Comes Out Against Ex-Im", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150429_FreedomCaucus_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-29T17:48:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DWJdP0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The House Freedom Caucus has come out in opposition to the Export-Import Bank.", "title": "House Freedom Caucus Comes Out Against Ex-Im", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150429_FreedomCaucus_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-04-29T15:12:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T17:48:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, House Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan, Jeb Hensarling, Johnny Gutierrez, Michael Steel, Steve Scalise, Kevin McCarthy, John Boehner, Paul Ryan"}, "article_summary": "It is clear it cannot be fixed,\u201d said House Freedom Caucus members of #ExIm.\nIn addition to members of the House Freedom Caucus, a number of top Republicans have spoken out against reauthorizing Ex-Im.\nRep.
