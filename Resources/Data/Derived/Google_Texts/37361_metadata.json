This includes surgery, imaging and laboratory services, and inpatient care for patients with heart disease, neurological issues and orthopedic injuries. This phase began in 2011 and is expected to be completed in the fall of 2014. Second phase: Renovations will begin at the current Broadway campus of Boulder Community Hospital. Construction at Broadway is expected to begin in November and include the consolidation of the outpatient services and business operations currently provided at the Mapleton Center for Rehabilitation at the renovated Broadway location. This second phase is expected to cost approximately $15 million, depending on how plans develop. Source: Boulder Community Hospital\n\nCORRECTION: This story originally misidentified Ron Secrist, president of Boulder Community Hospital Foundation\n\nSince its beginnings in 1922, Boulder Community Hospital's site off Broadway and Balsam Avenue has seen its share of changes.\n\nThe subsequent decades brought expansions and additions, and plenty of remodels and renovations, but the cobbling together of facilities was not sustainable for the long term, hospital officials eventually concluded.\n\nLater this year, Boulder Community Hospital's Broadway campus will experience the most significant transformation in its nearly 100-year history.\n\nCome October, Boulder Community will move the emergency, surgery, acute care and other main services currently housed at Broadway to its newly expanded and remodeled campus off Foothills Highway and Arapahoe Avenue in east Boulder.\n\nThe move is part of a 10-year, $125 million comprehensive plan unveiled in 2010 to create a state-of-the art hospital facility designed to meet the needs of the Boulder region and to improve efficiencies amid the passage and enactment of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"It's a big move,\" said Ron Secrist, president of Boulder Community Hospital Foundation. \"It's a once in 50 years, 100 years type of project.\"\n\nThe expected fall 2014 completion of the Boulder Community Foothills Hospital project \u2014 which started in 2011 and will result in the addition of 123,000 square feet of space and the renovation and repurposing of 89,000 square feet of existing space \u2014 will wrap up the first phase for the multi-pronged effort.\n\nBoulder Community's project is slightly behind schedule and slightly above cost projections, Secrist said, attributing the higher costs \u2014 which are on the scale of 2 percent to 3 percent \u2014 to regulatory changes that have taken effect since 2010 and also the increasing expense of new technology.\n\nThe project is funded by Boulder Community's existing savings, the issuance of bonds and community fundraising efforts.\n\nAs for the time table, officials initially projected that the opening of the expanded Foothills campus would occur by May or June of this year.\n\n\"A lot of that is actually snows from last season,\" he said of the delays.\n\nSeveral concrete pours were snowed out as a result of the wintry storms, he said.\n\nThe Foothills campus, however, did escape unscathed after the historic rains wreaked havoc throughout Boulder and surrounding regions in September. Secrist credited the master-planning process behind the development and expansion of Foothills.\n\nThe major construction at Foothills should be concluded in July with the supplying of rooms and training taking place in August.\n\nCommunity tours and public events most likely will be set for September, with the operating opening slated for October, he said.\n\nThere will be little downtime before the next phase of the project as officials plan to start renovating the Broadway facility in November.\n\nThe Broadway work is projected to take about 15 months. But, if all goes as currently planned, those efforts could wrap up as early as the end of 2015, Secrist said.\n\nMoving patients, critical services\n\nRegistered nurse Jamie Teasley, left, works on her computer last week at the emergency department of the Boulder Community Hospital's Broadway campus. (JEREMY PAPASSO / DAILY CAMERA)\n\nThe second phase, expected to start in November, will consist of the renovation of the west Boulder campus, which will serve as the new home to the rehabilitation and behavioral health services currently housed at the hospital's Mapleton Center for Rehabilitation facility at 311 Mapleton Ave.\n\nBoulder Community Hospital recently sold the Mapleton Center property \u2014 first home to the Boulder-Colorado Sanitarium in the late 1800s \u2014 to a private development group for $12.9 million. Plans for the Mapleton Center property have yet to be disclosed or submitted to the city of Boulder.\n\nThe sales agreement with the Mapleton Center's buyer includes a lease-back arrangement for the hospital to continue utilizing the facility through the completion of the Broadway renovation, Secrist said.\n\n\"The sale is not accelerating our departure from Mapleton,\" he said.\n\nMost of Boulder Community Hospital's facility activity could be completed by 2016, but the remaining years of the comprehensive plan involve the hospital adjusting to and accommodating the various changes \u2014 to services such as medical services, reimbursements and billing \u2014 that could come from health care reform, Secrist said.\n\nBut first, officials have to move through the task at hand: moving a hospital's critical services and patients.\n\n\"We're making some big decisions, some big efforts this year,\" Secrist said. \"You know how important it is to do it right, and we intend to.\"\n\nHospital officials already are working on a coordinated plan for the transition, which includes the moving of some equipment and services in September and the transport of acute care patients over the course of one day in October.\n\nMoving emergency and critical care services \u2014 and, especially, patients \u2014 three and a half miles east will be a heavily orchestrated process.\n\nAs October grows closer, most likely over the course of a month, Boulder Community's two hospitals will take a hotel-like approach. Foothills will start taking on more new admissions while Broadway's bed count slowly will lessen as patients' regularly scheduled discharges take place.\n\nAfter a certain cut-off date, the patients remaining at Broadway will be moved to Foothills via ambulances and other emergency service vehicles over the course of one day.\n\n\"You hope you get down to where you're moving very few patients,\" he said.\n\nIntent of design\n\nSeveral of the functions and departments previously housed at Broadway have already moved to Foothills including about 75 percent of the laboratory services, Secrist said. The hospital will maintain a reference lab at Broadway in addition to some imaging services.\n\nAfter the opening, Foothills will have more than 130 beds, including those for acute care. About 35 to 40 beds will remain at Broadway to serve the needs of the rehabilitation and behavioral health departments.\n\nBoulder Community Hospital currently has 165 beds.\n\n\"As you see how the medical technology, surgical procedures and recovery times have changed, you'll see most hospitals are not adding more beds \u2014 it's not about in-patient stays,\" Secrist said, adding those are combined with a greater focus on costs and concern about hospital-borne infections. \"The hospital of the future will have less in-patient beds and much more out-patient services.\"\n\nHospital officials applied \"Lean\" design techniques to improve flow and reduce constraints to patient care, he said. Architects, doctors and nurses came together to design patient rooms, configure departments and floor layouts, and determine the most efficient movements and walking routes.\n\nIn the newly renovated Foothills hospital, the operating room is adjacent to the intensive care unit, which is adjacent to the step-down unit.\n\nAt Broadway, those units are located on different floors in opposite wings.\n\n\"The major focus of the Affordable Care Act was to try to deliver medicine in a more efficient manner,\" Secrist said. \"This hospital allows us to do that. At the same time, we're able to go in and do some renovations at the Broadway campus.\"\n\nThe space is designed in such a way as to easily accommodate for the addition of new technologies and services and to serve Boulder residents and those from surrounding communities.\n\n\"Clearly the emergency room is now moving toward the center of the population served as opposed to the center of Boulder proper,\" he said, noting the emergency room at Foothills will be larger than the existing emergency rooms at Foothills and Broadway combined.\n\nSecrist and hospital officials say that ambulance response times are expected to improve for the overall community.\n\n\"First, Foothills Hospital has a more centralized location for many city and county residents,\" said Richard Sheehan, Boulder Community Hospital spokesman. \"Second, Foothills hospital has greater accessibility for ambulances since Foothills Parkway and Arapahoe Avenue are both multi-lane roads with fewer stoplights than the section of north Broadway ... near Boulder Community Hospital.\n\n\"Ambulances responding to the northern section of the central core can use Foothills Parkway to reach that area.\"\n\nEmergency services\n\nThe Broadway campus renovations also include the construction of a shelled-out space that can accommodate a future urgent care center. However, that space most likely would not be build out in the near-term, Secrist said, noting that Boulder Medical Center plans to continue operating its facility and urgent care center at 2750 Broadway.\n\n\"As long as Boulder Medical Center is going to do it, we're not going to replicate it across the street,\" he said. \"If they would ever stop running an urgent care center, then we would come back and put one at Broadway.\"\n\nBrad McKee, chief executive officer of Boulder Medical Center, said his organization has no plans to change the facilities or existing operations along Broadway and at Boulder Community Foothills Hospital.\n\n\"We hope to maintain the same relationships we currently have with (Boulder Community),\" he said. \"We think that we are in a strategic location in west Boulder.\"\n\nThe relocation of primary services to Foothills may cause some changes to the traffic pattern of some Boulder Medical Center physicians and staff, but the Broadway facility \u2014 including its primary care, speciality care and urgent care offerings \u2014 will remain, McKee said. Boulder Medical Center opened the Broadway office in 1949.\n\nBoulder Medical Center also is not currently planning significant changes to the operating hours or structure of its urgent care facility.\n\n\"Our intent is to keep urgent care pretty much as it is now,\" he said. \"We often staff up with physicians during peak periods.\n\n\"It will remain an urgent care and not an emergency room. We're really an out-patient facility.\"\n\nChanging landscape\n\nAs Boulder Community has shifted eastward, so has the nonprofit's property holdings.\n\nIn recent years, the hospital and its foundation have sold several of the hospital's west Boulder buildings and are expected to make another round of transactions in the coming months by selling a cluster of neighboring residences that were acquired near Broadway an Balsam, Secrist said.\n\nAlternatively, the hospital also has been snapping up office properties near the Foothills campus.\n\nBoulder Community currently owns eight of the 12 small office buildings in the Riverbend Office Park, which is located across Arapahoe Avenue from the Foothills hospital, Secrist said, adding the hospital plans to acquire more.\n\nThat Riverbend area would be the next area of expansion for Boulder Community Hospital if the needs change in the future, he said.\n\n\"The Foothills campus will be completely built-out (by later this year) under the provisions that the city allows and under zoning,\" Secrist said. \"Clearly, hospitals are not static institutions; they're dynamic institutions. They tend to be growth institutions.\"\n\nHow Boulder Community's changes might shape western and eastern Boulder is yet to be seen, but the city of Boulder should consider some comprehensive planning for the area, said Mary Young, newly elected member of the Boulder City Council.\n\nYoung said she believes that efforts made during the planning of the Junior Academy parcel at 2641 Fourth St. could have been broader in scale.\n\n\"It was a missed opportunity in terms of being able to have a more holistic view of the area and come up with a broader plan that would have encompassed this area because we knew even then that things would eventually change with the hospital,\" she said.\n\nAs it stands now, Young said she hopes city officials develop a plan to address potential residential and traffic changes in west Boulder.\n\n\"I actually would like to see us, the city, really step back and do a plan that ... really thinks about that area in the context of our housing needs on a broader scope,\" she said.\n\nSome early steps have been taken toward that goal, she said, noting how city officials are currently in the process of developing a Comprehensive Housing Strategy plan that will be presented to council later this year. The plan could include changing to zoning and planning processes, as well as affordable housing programs.\n\nContact Camera Business Writer Alicia Wallace at 303-473-1332 or wallacea@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_24888587/boulder-community-hospital-enters-critical-phase-its-eastward", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace \n \n  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24888587:view"}, "startDate": "2014-01-12T15:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Since its beginnings in 1922, Boulder Community Hospital's site off Broadway and Balsam Avenue has seen its share of changes.", "title": "Boulder Community Hospital enters critical phase of its eastward shift", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_24888587/boulder-community-hospital-enters-critical-phase-its-eastward", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0110/20140110__13dcbcovw_TEST~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "modificationDate": "2014-01-13T13:49:26-0700", "endDate": "2024-01-10T18:03:37-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "byline": "By Alicia WallaceCamera", "pubDate": "2014-01-12T01:40:50-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-01-12T15:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Community Hospital enters critical phase of its eastward shift", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0110/20140110__13dcbcovw_TEST~1_300.jpg", "description": "Since its beginnings in 1922, Boulder Community Hospital's site off Broadway and Balsam Avenue has seen its share of changes.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_24888587/boulder-community-hospital-enters-critical-phase-its-eastward", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Since its beginnings in 1922, Boulder Community Hospital's site off Broadway and Balsam Avenue has seen its share of changes.", "title": "Boulder Community Hospital enters critical phase of its eastward shift"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0110/20140110__13dcbcovw_TEST~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2cc\"", "article_summary": "\"First, Foothills Hospital has a more centralized location for many city and county residents,\" said Richard Sheehan, Boulder Community Hospital spokesman.\nSource: Boulder Community HospitalCORRECTION: This story originally misidentified Ron Secrist, president of Boulder Community Hospital FoundationSince its beginnings in 1922, Boulder Community Hospital's site off Broadway and Balsam Avenue has seen its share of changes.\nLater this year, Boulder Community Hospital's Broadway campus will experience the most significant transformation in its nearly 100-year history.\nSecond phase: Renovations will begin at the current Broadway campus of Boulder Community Hospital.\nThat Riverbend area would be the next area of expansion for Boulder Community Hospital if the needs change in the future, he said."}
