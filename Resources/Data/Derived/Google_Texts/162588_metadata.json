People who transition from female to male can compete in the male sporting categories with \u201cno restrictions.\u201d\n\nBut for people who transition from male to female, the guidelines are stricter. Trans female athletes must have a testosterone level below 10 nanomols per liter for at least one year before her first competition, and those levels \u201cmay\u201d be subject to testing, the document says.\n\nBuzzfeed noted that these guidelines seem to suggest that biological characteristics often associated with the male sex, such as elevated testosterone, are an advantage for athletes.\n\nThe new rules came after triathlete Chris Mosier became the first transgender athlete ever to join a U.S. national team matching their gender in June. Mosier will compete in the World Championships in Avila, Spain, this summer. Mosier tweeted his support for the new guidelines Monday.\n\nThank you!
