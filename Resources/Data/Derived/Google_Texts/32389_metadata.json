The interview works better that way,\u201d Kelly began. \u201cFive million people have already been canceled. So I\u2019m not talking about the seven million who you guys\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a reliable number,\u201d Emanuel immediately interrupted.\n\nWhen Kelly tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and theoretically reduced the number to three million, Emanuel again disputed the number and said the estimates aren\u2019t \u201creliable.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly on Fox is it five million,\u201d Emanuel snarked.\n\n\u201cOK, fine. So let\u2019s go with three million. You can deny the problem all you want, sir, but the data is out there,\u201d Kelly shot back.\n\nThe TV host went on to point out that the Obama administration needs about 156,000 people to sign up every day just to break even in regards to the people who are losing their insurance plans. And \u201cthat\u2019s not even talking about the seven million you needed from the get-go to make Obamacare work,\u201d Kelly added.\n\nEmanuel again told Kelly that she had the \u201cnumbers wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven million includes the people who were expected from the individual market to come on as well. So it\u2019s not just \u2014 seven million and the number from the individual market. That\u2019s the first point,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second point is you have to remember in the individual market before Obamacare the insurance companies were canceling people all the time.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether it was \u201cforeseen\u201d that the individual market would \u201cessentially collapse\u201d in order to make Obamacare work, Emanuel said \u201cinsurance companies always cancel policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s spin,\u201d Kelly said, calling him out for dodging the question. \u201cYou know as well as I do that the mass cancellations we have seen are hurting a lot of Americans. They are very upset and their relationship with their doctor has been severed as a result \u2013\u201d\n\nAs Kelly got more animated, Emanuel at one point asked her to \u201cstop yelling at me.\u201d\n\nHe argued that health plans get cancelled all the time, insinuating that Obamacare isn\u2019t fully to blame for the millions of Americans who are losing their plans.\n\n\u201cSo the two things are totally disconnected?\u201d Kelly pressed.\n\n\u201cYou keep interrupting me. Isn\u2019t there any manners here,\u201d Emanuel said condescendingly.\n\nEventually Kelly was able to get Emanuel to essentially admit that he foresaw people losing their health insurance plans, though he placed the blame on insurance companies. He said that \u201cwhen you change the market, things change,\u201d later adding that he \u201csaw [Americans] going to the exchanges because it\u2019s better for everyone, including them.\u201d\n\nKelly briefly lost her cool when Emanuel claimed that it was \u201cirrelevant\u201d whether or not they predicted that \u201cinsurance companies\u201d would drop people from their plans.\n\n\u201cStop saying that!\u201d she shouted. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s relevant to me my viewers\u2026 so can\u2019t you just assume with me that I\u2019m right and give us an answer?\u201d\n\nWatch the rest of the fiery segment, including his \u201canswer,\u201d via Fox News below:\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Megyn Kelly geared up for round two against Obamacare \"architect\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel on Wednesday as the two again battled over the terrible rollout of the Affordable Care Act.
