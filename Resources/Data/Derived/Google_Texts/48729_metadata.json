This past week former President George W. Bush brought together wounded veterans and active soldiers to honor them with a mountain bike ride. The message was clear \u2013 even when you leave active duty, we will still care for you.\n\n\n\nGetting back on the bike after a fall was more than just a metaphor for recovery \u2013 it was a crucial part of it. The leader who sent these men and women to war was showing the compassion and commitment needed to help them return to society and resume a meaningful life.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Every vet here has had to overcome difficult circumstances and they are now riding difficult bike trails and the symbol is you can succeed,\" Bush said to me in an interview.The healing message of the three-day bike ride was something the Veterans Affairs would not have had the sensitivity to encompass. It is clear that non-governmental solutions are needed to support our vets in a more personal way.\n\n\"Bush Institute research has identified that there is a significant enduring role for the private sector, philanthropies and non-profits,\" said Colonel Miguel Howe (retired), director of the new Military Service Initiative at the Bush Institute. \"They are critical to stepping in where the government cannot and creating a successful transition for all our post 9-11 veterans and their families.\"\n\nBush described the VA as \u201ca large bureaucracy.\u201d \u201cAnd sometimes with large bureaucracies,\u201d he said, \u201cits hard to create efficiencies. And so I understand the frustrations people have about the VA. The good news is that there is a group of private sector NGOs (non-governmental organizations) that are helping to fill the void.\u201d\n\n\n\nNGOs along with the Bush Institute are helping the vets to retool in an effort to find jobs. \"We are also helping bridge the language gap between employer and employee,\u201d Bush said. \u201cFor example, if a guy writes on his employment form, I'm a sniper, well an employer\u2019s going to say, well I don\u2019t need to hire a sniper. If he were to put on it my skill set in the military required patience, discipline, practice, he (the employer) might say well that\u2019s the kind of person I want to hire.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe bike ride was supported this year by non-governmental organizations including Wasatch Adaptive Sports, Hire Heroes USA, and the Green Beret Foundation. Hire Heroes USA is helping the vets get jobs. The Green Beret Foundation is actively researching the use of hyperbaric oxygen to treat veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury.\n\n\n\nThe Military Services Initiative is focusing this year on the need to destigmatize post-traumatic stress, while the VA has come under criticism for its inadequate recognition and treatment of the condition.\n\n\u201cSome of the people riding mountain bikes here have PTS (post-traumatic stress),\u201d Bush said. \u201cMountain biking is helping them get back to as normal a life as possible. And that\u2019s not a VA function, its a private sector function.\u201d\n\n\n\nBush wants to drop the \u201cD\u201d for disorder, because \u201cif its called a disorder, somebody\u2019s likely to say I don\u2019t want to hire somebody with a disorder.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowe said that \u201cpost-traumatic stress comes in a number of different ways. It\u2019s an injury of war but it\u2019s a treatable injury.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe outdated VA system is \u201cfull of people who care a lot about our vets,\u201d President Bush said. But at the bike ride the optimism was almost palpable and it seemed to me that many vets were getting more from riding with their brethren or working with a foundation to retool than from waiting on line at the VA for services that often don\u2019t solve their problems.\n\nSiegel is a professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center.
