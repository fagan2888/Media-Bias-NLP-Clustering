Photo by Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nIn a dispatch on King v. Burwell, the closely watched Obamacare challenge, NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg observed that the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, Michael Carvin, argued before the Supreme Court with \u201cred-faced passion.\u201d Indeed, Justice Sonia Sotomayor hadn\u2019t even finished the preamble to her first question when Carvin interrupted her to finish an earlier thought. He then caught himself and apologized, at which point Sotomayor tempered him: \u201cTake a breath.\u201d\n\nCarvin needed that moment, because Sotomayor was about to ask a bombshell question about federalism, a subject that later dominated a key portion of the hearing. In setting it up, she said she was \u201cconcerned\u201d by Carvin\u2019s reading of the Affordable Care Act\u2014in essence, that Congress wrote it so that only states with their own insurance exchanges receive federal subsidies. The problem with that reading, Sotomayor noted, is that lawmakers gave states a \u201cchoice\u201d: set up exchanges of your own, or let the federal government do it for you via healthcare.gov.\n\nSotomayor curiously name-dropped a case that has twice reached the Supreme Court in recent years.\n\nThat choice is not at issue in King. The dual system of federal and state exchanges is a feature of the law. And to Sotomayor, this choice cannot be squared with Carvin\u2019s interpretation that tax subsidies are available only to people participating in state-run exchanges. That\u2019s a constitutional problem. \u201cIf we read it the way you\u2019re saying,\u201d she said, \u201cthen we\u2019re going to read the statute as intruding on the federal-state relationship, because then the states are going to be coerced into establishing their own exchanges.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the bombshell. Because if Carvin is correct and a state chooses not to set up its own exchange\u2014and thus loses federal subsidies\u2014Sotomayor said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have the death spiral that this system was created to avoid.\u201d And she went on to list the parade of horribles that would follow from this so-called choice, including destabilized insurance markets and skyrocketing premiums. \u201cTell me how that is not coercive in an unconstitutional way?\u201d Sotomayor asked.\n\nThe question captivated Justice Anthony Kennedy, the perceived swing vote in this case. A number of outlets rightfully placed the fate of Obamacare in his hands. One wonders how things would\u2019ve played out Wednesday had Sotomayor not broached the issue in such stark terms. \u201cDeath spiral,\u201d after all, is the kind of thing that grabs headlines and is sure to grab the justices\u2014Kennedy himself brought it up later\u2014when they cast their preliminary votes in King, which could happen as soon as their private Friday conference.\n\nBut Sotomayor wasn\u2019t done. She curiously name-dropped a case that has twice reached the Supreme Court in recent years, Bond v. United States. The case had nothing to do with health care, but its two iterations did offer grand pronouncements on federalism\u2014a constitutional principle respecting the dividing line between federal and state governments. More interesting still, the first Bond decision was authored by Kennedy and the second Bond decision was authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, who provided the vote that saved Obamacare in a previous case, NFIB v. Sebelius, and who is the other possible swing vote in this case. In their Bond decisions, both had very thoughtful things to say about the proper balance between federal power and state autonomy. Seizing on that principle, Sotomayor continued, \u201cWe said [in Bond] that it is a primary statutory command that we read a statute in a way where we don\u2019t impinge on the basic federal-state relationship.\u201d\n\nThose words must have been music to Kennedy\u2019s ears because he later ran with them and pressed Carvin in his pensive, considered style: \u201cIt seems to me that under your argument, perhaps you will prevail in the plain words of the statute; there\u2019s a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your argument.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cserious constitutional problem\u201d was easily one of the most quoted Kennedy lines from Wednesday. But for Kennedy, the federalist, it is also an untenable result that needs to be reconciled if Obamacare is to survive. That is, the law needs to be read so as to not deal a blow to the states. And for Roberts, this blow is akin to the \u201cgun to the head\u201d of the states that he expressly condemned in NFIB v. Sebelius in 2012. Under this principle, the position of Carvin and the King challengers falls apart. It is simply \u201cnot a rational choice for the states to make,\u201d Kennedy later told Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. And because state coercion is unacceptable under the Constitution, Kennedy suggested that \u201cconstitutional avoidance\u201d counsels adopting the federal government\u2019s view of the statute: that Obamacare provides subsidies for all, even those states that chose not to set up their own health care exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "How she backed Kennedy and Roberts into a corner.", "fb-share": "If Obamacare Survives, Thank Sonia Sotomayor", "sailthru.author": "Cristian Farias", "description": "In a dispatch on King v.
