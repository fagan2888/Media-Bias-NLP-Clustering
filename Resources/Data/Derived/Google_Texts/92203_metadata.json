Anonymous atheist parents asked the state's Supreme Court on Sep. 4, 2013 to ban pledge recitation statewide because they contend the phrase \" under God \" violates the rights of students who do not believe in God.Attorney David Niose, representing the parents and the American Humanist Association (AHA), stated that \"children every morning are pledging their national unity and loyalty in an indoctrinating format, in a way that validates God belief as truly patriotic and actually invalidates atheism.\" Niose argued that some children are therefore \"denied meaningful participation in this patriotic exercise.\"Several failed challenges to the Pledge have been made in the past, including Elk Grove Unified School District, et al. v.

That presents a challenge for the plaintiffs, says Boston College Law School church-state law expert Greg Kalscheur: \"Participation is voluntary. Nobody can actually be forced to participate.
