Some observers predict little aggregate effect, but others believe that 2014 will mark the beginning of the end for our current system of employer-sponsored insurance. We use theoretical and empirical evidence to address the question, \u201cHow will employers\u2019 offerings of health insurance change under health reform?\u201d First, we describe the economic reasons why employers offer insurance. Second, we recap the relevant provisions of health reform and use our economic framework to consider how they may affect employers\u2019 offerings. Third, we review the various predictions that have been made about those offerings under health reform. Finally, we offer some observations on interpreting early data from 2014.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "NOODP", "citation_id_from_sass_path": "32/9/1522", "citation_collection_id": 61, "citation_issn": "1544-5208", "HW.ad-path": "/cgi/content/abstract/32/9/1522", "citation_date": "09/01/2013", "DC.Date": "2013-09-01", "citation_pdf_url": "http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/32/9/1522.full.pdf", "citation_author_institution": "3Helen G.
