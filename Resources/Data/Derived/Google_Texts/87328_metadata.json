His entire presidency is a prolonged effort to tear the United States away from free-market economics and decentralized political power (what the French deride as the \u201cAnglo-Saxon model\u201d) toward the kind of socialist, government-dominated society that France has achieved.\n\nFrance is Obamaland. Government sucks up 56 percent of GDP. The state offers cradle-to-grave subsidies for child care, health, disability, unemployment, old age, and more. The welfare state discourages work in myriad ways \u2014 most French retire at age 60, and many at 55. The work week is 35 hours. (Obamacare defines it as 30 hours.) France\u2019s labor code is 3600 pages long (sound familiar?) and makes it practically impossible to fire anyone. Shockingly, businesses are wary about hiring. France\u2019s growth rate has averaged .3 percent annually since 2008.

The system suits students who are terrific test-takers (grades don\u2019t matter much), but their system would never be tolerated here. Students are culled through high-stakes tests starting at age 15. The American ideal of second chances and \u201cit\u2019s never too late\u201d doesn\u2019t translate.

France has a modified single-payer system, with tremendous regulation and red tape from the central government. In 2010, according to an OECD study, 47 percent of French patients had to wait four weeks or longer to see a specialist compared with 20 percent of Americans. That, of course, was before Obamacare, so don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll likely catch up. Then there\u2019s this nugget from Businessweek: \u201cAnita Manfredi got nine massages and 18 mud baths at a luxury spa in November. The French government paid two-thirds of the $1,022 bill.\u201d She feels much better, you\u2019ll be glad to know. French taxpayers also pay for taxi rides to and from clinics and other luxuries. Businessweek quotes a London financier who describes France\u2019s system as \u201csimply unaffordable, unsustainable, and . . . a huge burden on the economy.\u201d\n\nDoubtless Mr. Obama admires France\u2019s approach to immigration. For decades, France has been absorbing millions of Muslims from the Middle East and North Africa and now finds that a small but dangerous minority of those newcomers are jihadists bent on destroying libert\u00e9, egalit\u00e9, and especially fraternit\u00e9. Unemployment in the banlieues (the suburbs where most immigrants reside) is 40 percent among the young. In 2005, the banlieues were the site of three solid weeks of rioting.\n\nThere are cultural problems integrating Muslims into French society, and economic stagnation has led many, immigrant and native-born alike, to lose hope. A young man whose parents immigrated from Tunisia told the Telegraph \u201cWhen my parents came here, France had lots of work. Now it has lots of fascists.\u201d\n\nSocialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s idea \u2014 almost indistinguishable from Mr. Obama\u2019s \u2014 was to impose a 75 percent tax on millionaires. Mr. Hollande sold it as an effort to make the rich pay their fair share. It was signed into law in 2013. One year later, it was quietly buried.
