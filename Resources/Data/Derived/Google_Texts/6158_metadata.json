Political allegiances among both poor and working-class voters have shifted in recent years.\n\nWhy did the white working class abandon the Democrats?\n\nThe conventional answer is that Republicans skillfully played the race card.\n\nIn the wake of the Civil Rights Act, segregationists like Alabama Governor George C. Wallace led southern whites out of the Democratic Party.\n\nRecommended: Are the rich getting richer? Take our quiz on inequality and incomes.\n\nLater, Republicans charged Democrats with coddling black \u201cwelfare queens\u201d (Ronald Reagan popularized the term), being soft on black crime (George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ads in 1988), and trying to give jobs to less-qualified blacks over more-qualified whites (the battle over affirmative action).\n\nThe bigotry now spewing forth from Donald Trump and several of his Republican rivals is an extension of this old race card, now applied to Mexicans and Muslims \u2013 with much the same effect on the white working class voters, who don\u2019t trust Democrats to be as \u201ctough.\u201d\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Democrats also abandoned the white working class.\n\nDemocrats have occupied the White House for sixteen of the last twenty-four years, and in that time scored some important victories for working families \u2013 the Affordable Care Act, an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Family and Medical Leave Act, for example.\n\nBut they\u2019ve done little to change the widening structural imbalances in the economy that have hurt the working class.\n\nBoth Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ardently pushed for free trade agreements, for example, but didn\u2019t provide the millions of blue-collar workers who thereby lost their jobs means of getting new ones that paid at least as well.\n\nThey also stood by as corporations hammered trade unions, the backbone of the white working class. Clinton and Obama failed to reform labor laws to impose meaningful penalties on companies that violated them, or enable workers to form unions with a simple up-or-down votes.\n\nI was there. In 1992, Bill Clinton promised such reform but once elected didn\u2019t want to spend political capital on it. In 2008, Barack Obama made the same promise (remember the Employee Free Choice Act?) but never acted on it.\n\nPartly as a result, union membership sunk from 22 percent of all workers when Bill Clinton was elected president to fewer than 12 percent today, and the working class lost bargaining leverage to get a share of the economy\u2019s gains.\n\nThe Obama administration protected Wall Street from the consequences of the Street\u2019s gambling addiction through a giant taxpayer-funded bailout, but let millions of underwater homeowners to drown.\n\nBoth Clinton and Obama allowed antitrust enforcement to ossify \u2013 with the result that large corporations have grown far larger, and major industries more concentrated.\n\nAnd they turned their backs on campaign finance reform. In 2008, Obama was the first presidential nominee since Richard Nixon to reject public financing in his primary and general-election campaigns. And he never followed up on his reelection campaign promise to pursue a constitutional amendment overturning \u201cCitizens United v. FEC,\u201d the 2010 Supreme Court opinion opening the floodgates to big money in politics.\n\nWhat happens when you combine free trade, shrinking unions, Wall Street bailouts, growing corporate market power, and the abandonment of campaign finance reform?\n\nYou get an economic structure favoring the wealthy and a political system favoring the powerful \u2013 while workers without college degrees suffer declining real wages and dwindling job security.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t Democrats done more? True, they faced increasingly hostile Republican congresses. But they controlled both houses of Congress in the first two years of both Clinton\u2019s and Obama\u2019s administrations.\n\nIn part, it was because Democrats bought the snake oil of the \u201csuburban swing voter\u201d \u2013 so-called \u201csoccer moms\u201d in the 1990s and affluent politically-independent professionals in the 2000s \u2013 who supposedly determined electoral outcomes.\n\nMeanwhile, as early as the 1980s they began drinking from the same campaign funding trough as the Republicans \u2013 big corporations, Wall Street, and the very wealthy.\n\n\u201cBusiness has to deal with us whether they like it or not, because we\u2019re the majority,\u201d crowed Democratic representative Tony Coelho, then head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, when Democrats assumed they\u2019d continue to run the House for years.\n\nCoelho\u2019s Democrats soon achieved a rough parity with Republicans in contributions from corporate and Wall Street campaign coffers, but it proved a Faustian bargain.\n\nNothing in politics is ever final. Democrats could still win back the white working class \u2013 putting together a coalition of the working class and poor, of whites, blacks, and Latinos.\n\nThis would give them the political clout to restructure the economy \u2013 rather than merely enact palliative programs papering over the increasing concentration of wealth and power in America.\n\nBut to do this they\u2019d have to stop obsessing over upper-income suburban swing voters, and end their financial dependence on big corporations, Wall Street, and the wealthy.\n\nWill they? If not, a third party might emerge that does it instead.\n\nThis article first appeared at Robert Reich.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "345db35dbb390c122bf33357bfdd40a9", "sailthru.author": "Robert Reich", "description": "Why did white, working-class voters decide to leave the Democratic Party?", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/01/959181_1_11916-homeless-in-hawaii_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "Why did white, working-class voters decide to leave the Democratic Party?", "title": "Opinion: Who lost the white working class?", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Robert-Reich/2016/0119/Opinion-Who-lost-the-white-working-class", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/01/959181_1_11916-homeless-in-hawaii_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@csmonitor", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/01/959181_1_11916-homeless-in-hawaii_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "Why did white, working-class voters decide to leave the Democratic Party?", "card": "summary", "title": "Opinion: Who lost the white working class?"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-19", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-19T14:00:04-05:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/Business/Robert-Reich/2016/0119/Opinion-Who-lost-the-white-working-class", "sailthru.tags": "section-robert-reich,section-business,class-blog-post,storysource-guest-blogger", "article": {"section": "Robert Reich", "published_time": "2016-01-19T14:00-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Jae C.
