From the Daily Mail story:\n\nDoctors are being told to ask all patients over 75 if they will agree to a \u2018do not resuscitate\u2019 order. New NHS guidelines urge GPs to draw up end-of-life plans for over-75s, as well as younger patients suffering from cancer, dementia, heart disease or serious lung conditions. They are also being told to ask whether the patient wants doctors to try to resuscitate them if their health suddenly deteriorates, The NHS says the guidance will improve patients\u2019 end-of-life care, but medical professionals say it is \u2018blatantly wrong\u2019 and will frighten the elderly into thinking they are being \u2018written off\u2019. In some surgeries, nurses are cold-calling patients over 75 or with long-term conditions and asking them over the phone if they have \u2018thought about resuscitation\u2019.\n\nGood grief! A DNR is an \u201callow to die\u201d order in the event of a cardiac arrest. It should only be signed when one understands the specific circumstance under which it would be applied.\n\nAnd don\u2019t tell me there won\u2019t be some \u201cpersuasion.\u201d It\u2019s like the dinner guest who overstays his welcome and the host looks at her watch and asks how long a drive it is to get home.\n\nThe NHS is a socialized system, but it is relevant to the USA because of the aspect of centralized control. Don\u2019t be surprised if one day doctors receive just such a memo from our Obamacare overlords. And don\u2019t forget that the technocrat, Jeb Bush, has already called for mandatory signing of advance medical directives for everyone on Medicare.\n\nNot yet, but one day\u2013unless we smarten up and dismember the growing federal power over standards of care.\n\nReprinted with permission from National Review.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "A DNR is an 'allow to die' order in the event of a cardiac arrest.
