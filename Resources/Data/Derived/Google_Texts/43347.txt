Is your city a sanctuary city?

The Center for Immigration Studies has released an interactive map depicting cities, counties and states that are “sanctuaries” for immigrants who are in the country illegally.

The map shows over 200 sanctuary cities, counties and states nationwide.

Sanctuary cities are cities or jurisdictions where local authorities have chosen not to act in accordance with federal immigration laws.

According to the Center for Immigration Studies, “these state and local jurisdictions have policies, laws, executive orders, or regulations allowing them to avoid cooperating with federal immigration law enforcement authorities”:

[The cities] ignore federal law authorizing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to administratively deport illegal aliens without seeking criminal warrants or convictions from federal, state, or local courts. Although federal law requires the cooperation, the Department of Justice has never sued or taken any measure, including denying federal funds, against a jurisdiction.

According to the map, North Dakota and Rhode Island are sanctuary states.

David Inserra, a research assistant at The Heritage Foundation, said that it is a “no brainer” for local and state officials to aid federal agencies in enforcing federal laws.

“Not enforcing the law results in lawlessness,” Inserra said.
