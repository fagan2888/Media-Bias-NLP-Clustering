The exception has been Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who visited Trump in his Manhattan office over the summer (at Cruz\u2019s request, as Trump made clear) and has spoken favorably of Trump in many public settings.\n\nThe two even shared a stage during a rally near the Capitol building meant to drum up support in opposition to President Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nRelated: Trump Gets and Endorsement from Putin\u2019s Crimean Crony\n\nIn a Thursday night radio interview, though, Cruz came out and said that not only does he expect that Trump will lose the primary election, but that when he drops out, most of his supporters will throw in their lot with the Cruz campaign.\n\n\u201cI like Donald, I respect him,\u201d Cruz told WABC\u2019s Rita Cosby. \u201cThere have been other candidates in this race who have gone out of their way to try to smack Donald with a two-by-four, and I haven\u2019t been one of them. I am glad he\u2019s in the race.\u201d\n\nHad Cruz stopped there, it would have sounded much like many of his other comments on Trump\u2019s controversial candidacy.\n\nBut he continued, \u201cI think his involvement in the race has been tremendously helpful to my campaign because it\u2019s framed the central question of this primary as \u2018Who will stand up to Washington?\u2019 And if that\u2019s the central question, the natural next question the voters will ask is, \u2018Well, who actually has stood up to Washington? Who has a record in that regard?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you believe eventually you could beat him based on your principles?\u201d Cosby asked.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Donald Trump Is the \u2018Mean Girl\u2019 of the GOP\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s right,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIn time, I don\u2019t think Donald is going to be the nominee and I think in time, the lion\u2019s share of his supporters end up with us. And I think the reason is what I was just saying. If you look to the records of all the Republican candidates, there\u2019s a big difference between my record and that of everyone else. If you ask who has stood up to Washington who has taken on not just Democrats but leaders in their own party?\u201d\n\nNow, when it comes to Donald Trump, there are some things you just don\u2019t do unless you mean to incite a storm of abuse, and one of them is to call him a loser (even prospectively). The other is to suggest that he\u2019s being played for a sucker \u2013 in this case, that his campaign is little more than a tool for gathering eventual Cruz voters.\n\nRelated: Why Donald Trump Is Vladimir Putin\u2019s Favorite Presidential Candidate\n\nAfter midnight Friday morning, Trump senior adviser Dan Scavino Tweeted out a preliminary reaction to Cruz\u2019s comments.\n\n.@TedCruz expects 2get #Trump2016 supporters...saying @realDonaldTrump will not get the #GOP nominee.
