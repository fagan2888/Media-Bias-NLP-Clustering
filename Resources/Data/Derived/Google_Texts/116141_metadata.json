The BPCIA, part of the Affordable Care Act, created a pathway for the FDA to approve follow-on biologic drugs, or biosimilars. Thus far, the FDA has approved one biosimilar under that law.\n\nThe groups said, \u201cWhile our communities are eager for new and affordable treatments, patients with rare and chronic diseases are keenly aware of the possible risks associated with biologics and biosimilars, including immunogenicity and the lack of long-term safety data for new treatments.\u201d The groups include the Arthritis Foundation and the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.\n\nGreater Transparency Needed\n\nThe patient groups said they believe that \u201cgreater transparency is needed surrounding the development and implementation of the biosimilars approval pathway.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has accepted eight biosimilar applications and approved one biosimilar drug, but hasn't yet issued final guidance on \u201ccrucial patient safety issues such as naming, labeling, interchangeability standards, and indication extrapolation,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe would like to see those guidances issued and finalized with full input from those who will take and prescribe biosimilars\u2014patients and their health professionals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe complexity and uniqueness of each biologic medicine requires that FDA ensure that all biologics and biosimilars are thoroughly tested and meet the highest safety standards,\u201d the letter said. \u201cGiven the importance of this issue to patient safety and the impending actions by the FDA both to develop biosimilar approval standards and consider pending applications, we urge you to schedule BPCIA oversight hearings before your committee early this year and ensure patient voices are represented at such hearings.\u201d\n\nIn March 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar in the U.S. That biosimilar product is Zarxio, a Sandoz biosimilar of Amgen's cancer drug Neupogen (filgrastim) (45 HCDR, 3/9/15).\n\nThe FDA told Bloomberg BNA in a Jan. 8 e-mail that it doesn't have a comment on the letter.\n\nBiotech Industry Weighs In\n\nDaniel Seaton, a spokesman for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), told Bloomberg BNA Jan. 8 that BIO \u201cshares the concern voiced by these patient groups on the need for final guidance from the FDA on the implementation of the BPCIA, including on naming, labeling and interchangeability standards.\u201d\n\nPatient safety \u201cis dependent upon a regulatory framework which provides full, transparent and distinguishable information for all biological products, and we urge the FDA to issue final guidance providing for such,\u201d he said. \u201cTo that end, BIO would support a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to ensure that stakeholder perspectives, particularly those of provider and patient groups, are heard and their concerns incorporated as the FDA continues implementing the biosimilars approval pathway contained in the BPCIA.\u201d\n\nA representative of a generic drug industry group declined to comment on the letter.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Bronwyn Mixter in Washington at bmixter@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Janey Cohen at jcohen@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/groups-house-panel-n57982066009/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Twenty-three patient groups Jan. 6 sent a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee asking for hearings on biosimilar drugs and patient safety as the FDA creates regulations to implement the biosimilars approval pathway.", "title": "Groups Want House Panel to Hold Biosimilar Hearings"}, "csrf-token": "Y6ZS5N389dTZznZdLS-vwYGvyewlgmCK1JBxR2wIAYpEsRkEcnY8fGUbSx-GFyWN4Cxes0YRpEMhgvF6HYu1fufk9dhGe1LS--TuLKFwLgg1:rOTLgZdTa8RFd1xRwV-OVwvLQYzMHUOmRsI7TS0ynNuqdyKtPOF0TOF--0OpDaaUTyQo15rTvjr05dQecai6CNj_zQl5uAhzAJhnfvU2Dmw1", "description": "Twenty-three patient groups Jan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1eea\"", "article_summary": "Jan. 8 \u2014 Twenty-three patient groups Jan. 6 sent a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee asking for hearings on biosimilar drugs and patient safety as the FDA creates regulations to implement the biosimilars approval pathway.\nThe groups, all members of the Patients for Biologics Safety & Access (PBSA), said they are requesting the hearings \u201cto assure that patient safety is being fully protected as\u201d the Food and Drug Administration implements the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.\nThe BPCIA, part of the Affordable Care Act, created a pathway for the FDA to approve follow-on biologic drugs, or biosimilars.\nThe FDA told Bloomberg BNA in a Jan. 8 e-mail that it doesn't have a comment on the letter.\nThus far, the FDA has approved one biosimilar under that law."}
