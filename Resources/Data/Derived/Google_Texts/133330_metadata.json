Sullivan gave the tax agency a month to submit the explanation in writing. Sullivan said he is also appointing a federal magistrate to see if lost emails can be obtained from other sources.\n\nSullivan issued the order as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group. He said the IRS declaration must be signed, under oath, by the appropriate IRS official.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to hold tight to that Aug. 10 declaration,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThe IRS says it lost the emails in 2011 when Lois Lerner\u2019s computer crashed. At the time, Lerner headed the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status. She has since retired.\n\nLerner, who refused to answer questions at two House committee hearings, has become a central figure in several congressional investigations over the handling of tea party applications.\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen has testified on the lost emails before Congress at least three times. Each time he was under oath.\n\nKoskinen said he first learned there was a problem with Lerner\u2019s computer in February, but didn\u2019t learn that emails were lost until April. The IRS notified Congress June 13.\n\nJudicial Watch lawyer Ramona Cotca complained that the IRS never informed her group or the court about the lost emails, even though Sullivan had ordered the IRS to produce documents related to the information request on a rolling monthly basis.\n\nGeoffrey Klimas, a Justice Department lawyer representing the IRS, said the agency had no legal obligation to tell Judicial Watch about emails that may have been destroyed two years before the group filed its request for information.\n\nJudicial Watch filed a series of requests with the IRS shortly after the tea party controversy erupted in May 2013. Among its requests, the watchdog group wanted communications Lerner had with others concerning the handling of applications for tax-exempt status since Jan. 1, 2010.\n\nJudicial Watch filed a lawsuit against the IRS in October, saying the agency didn\u2019t produce any documents. Since then, the IRS started to produce some documents in February, Cotca said.\n\nOn Thursday, Cotca asked Sullivan to conduct a limited discovery to determine what happened to the emails, perhaps compelling testimony from IRS officials. But Sullivan said that would be premature.\n\nKlimas noted that the tax agency\u2019s inspector general is conducting an investigation into the lost emails. Klimas said the inspector general has asked the IRS not to question witnesses that may have information about the lost emails to avoid interfering with its investigation.\n\nSullivan said the sworn IRS statement should include information about the inspector general\u2019s concerns.\n\nSullivan said he would assign federal magistrate John Facciola to look into ways of obtaining the IRS records from other sources, though it is unclear how much information could be recovered.\n\nIn 2011, the IRS had a policy of backing up emails on computer tapes, but the tapes were recycled every six months, Koskinen told Congress. He said Lerner\u2019s hard drive was recycled and presumably destroyed, after technicians in the agency\u2019s criminal investigations unit tried unsuccessfully to restore it.\n\nThe IRS was able to generate 24,000 Lerner emails from the 2009 to 2011 period because she had copied in other IRS employees, Koskinen said. As part of the congressional investigations, the IRS said it is producing a total of 67,000 emails to and from Lerner, covering the period from 2009 to 2013.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge ordered the IRS Thursday to explain under oath how it lost a trove of emails to and from a central figure in the agency\u2019s tea party controversy.\nU.S. District", "title": "Judge orders IRS to explain lost tea party emails", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/john1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-6191865\"}", "sailthru.tags": "congress,irs,lawsuits,tea-party,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-10 15:55:18", "sailthru.title": "Judge orders IRS to explain lost tea party\u00a0emails", "nypost-section": "News", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/john1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge ordered the IRS Thursday to explain under oath how it lost a trove of emails to and from a central figure in the agency's tea party controversy.\r\n\r\nU.S. District Judge Emmet G.
