Bloomington, MN

Organizers of a police brutality protest are planning to rally at the Mall of America, despite warnings that the facility is private property.

The group Black Lives Matter Minneapolis is planning a peaceful gathering Saturday in the mall's rotunda. It's part of protests that have taken place across the country following decisions against charging police officers who killed unarmed black men in Missouri and New York.

Mall of America officials have sent letters to organizers to tell them that protests aren't allowed on private property, and they tried to redirect the group to a nearby parking lot.

The letter warns that a violation of mall policies could lead to removal.

Organizers have said they won't be intimidated and would go ahead with their protest as planned.
