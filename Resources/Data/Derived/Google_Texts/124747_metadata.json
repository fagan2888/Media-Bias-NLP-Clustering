Am I a homer for saying that? Not this time, sorry. Jarome Iginla was called for a pathetic interference call near the end \u2013 which drew a vociferous objection from Iginla, which almost never happens from him \u2013 and another one in overtime on Alex Tanguay for a no-big-deal hit on Kings D-man Brayden McNabb, who will probably always be best remembered for a pathetic cheap shot on Avs prospect Joey Hishon in the 2011 Memorial Cup.\n\nMcNabb is one of those marginally talented punk players who might just make himself a nice living in the NHL. Be prepared to hate him. A lot. Matt Cooke would think he\u2019s a good player, in other words.\n\n\u2013 The penalty kill was credited with blanking the Kings tonight, but, man they still make things way too tough on Semyon Varlamov. He had to stand up to withering assault on the final two phantom Kings PPs. Doesn\u2019t matter how they happen \u2013 the Avs need to make it easier on Varly when a penalty is called. Clear the puck! Why is this not one of Patrick Roy\u2019s chief tenets to his team by now? The Avs were 24th in the league last year in killing penalties and they look even worse now.\n\n\u2013 Dennis Everberg scored a goal for the Avs. That could clinch a spot on the opening night roster, at least while John Mitchell, Jamie McGinn, Patrick Bordeleau and Jesse Winchester continue to convalesce with injuries.\n\n\n\n\u2013 Matt Duchene started to click more tonight. This is a good sign.\n\n\u2013 Really, the Avs outplayed the Kings for most of regulation, until the referees took control and put them on the defensive. Hey, most of the time the Kings should outplay the Avs without the referees, and they probably will at some point again. But tonight, the Avs showed that they won\u2019t be an easy team to beat when all things are equal. The penalty kill is the NUMBER ONE PROBLEM ON THIS TEAM STILL, AND MUST BE ADDRESSED, if they are to get to the next level.\n\n\u2013 Other than pre-existing conditions to McGinn and Mitchell, the Avs escaped the preseason mostly unscathed when it came to injuries. That\u2019s a win. Winchester remains out with a concussion, and I don\u2019t have any idea how long it will be. But aside from that, it is over and let\u2019s drop the puck already for real.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dennis Everberg,Jamie McGinn,Jarome Iginla,Jesse Winchester,Joey Hishon,John Mitchell,Matt Cooke,Matt Duchene,MGM Grand Garden Arena,Patrick Bordeleau,Patrick Roy,Semyon Varlamov", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "The Colorado Avalanche finished the NHL preseason with its only win over Los Angeles, in Las Vegas", "title": "Avalanche beats Kings 3-2 in NHL shootout in Las Vegas", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/10/04/avalanche-beats-kings-3-2-shootout-conclude-preseason-winning-note/19605/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/10/avs-kings.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Colorado Avalanche finished the NHL preseason with its only win over Los Angeles, in Las Vegas", "title": "Avalanche beats Kings 3-2 in shootout to conclude preseason on winning note", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/10/04/avalanche-beats-kings-3-2-shootout-conclude-preseason-winning-note/19605/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2014/10/avs-kings.jpg", "creator": "@adater", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Colorado Avalanche finished the NHL preseason with its only win over Los Angeles, in Las Vegas"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd415b\"", "article_summary": "\u2013 The penalty kill was credited with blanking the Kings tonight, but, man they still make things way too tough on Semyon Varlamov.\n\u2013 Really, the Avs outplayed the Kings for most of regulation, until the referees took control and put them on the defensive.\nMcNabb is one of those marginally talented punk players who might just make himself a nice living in the NHL.\nHey, most of the time the Kings should outplay the Avs without the referees, and they probably will at some point again.\nBut tonight, the Avs showed that they won\u2019t be an easy team to beat when all things are equal."}
