It was here that the city was propelled to prosperity as a major hub in the business of transatlantic slavery, profiting from the \u201ctriangle trade\u201d by shipping goods and weapons to Africa; shackled slaves to America; and sugar, cotton, and rum back to Liverpool.\n\nThis dark history is still echoed in some of the city\u2019s street names. Penny Lane, made famous by The Beatles, is believed to have been named after James Penny, one of the city\u2019s most prominent 18th-century slave traders. The Cunard Building, built in a style intended to recall grand Italian palaces \u2014 complete with marble imported from Tuscany \u2014 sits on The Strand, formerly known as Goree Piazza, named after the island off the coast of Senegal that was used as a base to trade slaves.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the docks hosted a more contemporary meeting of British traders: an \u201cInternational Festival for Business\u201d pitched by the government\u2019s export promotion arm as the country\u2019s \u201cmost significant international trade and commerce showcase since 1951.\u201d Over 50 days in June and July, the business festival hosted tens of thousands of British firms and entrepreneurs \u2014 all eager to break into new overseas markets \u2014 for workshops and networking events promising an \u201coutstanding opportunity for businesses to forge new international commercial partnerships.\u201d\n\nIn the Cunard Building \u2014 built during World War I as the headquarters for the eponymous company famous for its luxury steamships that would ferry the rich across the Atlantic \u2014 Nigel Peters stepped up to the podium and cleared his throat. In a historic ballroom with period detailing and vaulted ceilings, before an audience of men and women in business suits sitting around circular tables with pristine white tablecloths, Peters asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s it worth?\u201d Standing on a temporary stage, he announced that there was \u201c$70 to $100 billion of business out there.\u201d\n\nHe could have been talking about global cybersecurity industry (worth approximately $75 billion) or the international magazine publishing market (about $100 billion). But no. Peters was speaking as the head of the Aid-Funded Business Service at UK Trade and Investment, a government-funded body geared to help British companies export. As the director of this special unit until 2015, Peters specialized in helping British companies profit from contracts funded by international aid \u2014 taxpayer money that is intended to help end global poverty. This is a side of aid that few have ever seen \u2014 the companies, the products, and the business models that circle around this multibillion-dollar market, angling for a larger piece of the pie.\n\n\u201cThe development and humanitarian aid business is there, it\u2019s significant business, and we\u2019re here to help you win some of that,\u201d Peters grinned. A slide projected beside him bore the names of global aid agencies and development institutions like the World Bank and the UK\u2019s Department of International Development (DfID). The men and women in the audience sat straight and still in their seats, focused on every word, moving only to take notes or get a closer look at the screen. \u201cWelcome to the world of aid-funded business,\u201d said Peters to applause.\n\nWhen governments pledge aid money, it is rarely handed directly over to poor countries in cash, despite the rhetoric from both the right and the left about how much money is \u201cgiven\u201d each year. Budget support \u2014 the technical term for aid that is in fact given to poor country governments directly, to manage and spend themselves \u2014 amounted to just $9.5 billion out of a total global aid spending of $165 billion in 2014, or less than six percent. Where does the rest go? Donor countries like the United Kingdom or the United States spend much of their aid money through NGOs, multilateral organizations like the UN, and private contractors. Billions of dollars each year are spent buying goods and services \u2014 everything from drugs to consultancy.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of business opportunities around the work the UN does in peacekeeping, famine relief, disaster relief, emergency aid,\u201d Peters tells his audience. \u201cWe see a lot of good opportunities for those of you in products in terms of famine and disaster relief related to both man-made disasters, which today we\u2019re seeing in countries like Syria and Iraq with refugee camps, and of course natural disasters.\u201d\n\nFor some companies, aid is a valuable income stream but still one of many. For others, it is the entire business model. A small group of private contractors, primarily based in the Washington, DC area and known as the \u201cBeltway Bandits,\u201d have long dominated the aid-funded business coming out of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the leading (but not only) US government agency that spends aid money. Across the Atlantic, one of the biggest beneficiaries of UK\u2013aid-funded business is Crown Agents, a company that grew out of the infrastructure of the British Empire; it was privatized in 1997, moving seamlessly from being a merchant of empire to profiting off the postcolonial world. Other companies have started up specifically to take advantage of these business opportunities.\n\nMany European cities now host regular events like the one in Liverpool. On the outskirts of Brussels in November 2014, hundreds of men and women in smart business suits swarmed around an array of exhibition stalls, sipping glasses of wine and picking up bags filled with glossy corporate brochures and USB keys stamped with the logos of multinational corporations. Overhead, large banners bearing the names of major car companies \u2014 Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota \u2014 hung from the ceiling.\n\nThis is AidEx, the \u201cleading international event for professionals in aid and development\u201d and a \u201cmajor platform for networking, making new contacts and doing business.\u201d At the center of a large convention space, the marketing managers at their stalls were pitching their goods at the host of acronyms \u2014 UNHCR, UNDP, ICRC, and many NGOs \u2014 that make up this aid-funded market and together have billions of dollars to spend each year. On offer was everything from different types of tarpaulin to the services of private security firms. In a pop-up caf\u00e9 on the edge of the exhibition area, attendees huddled in small groups, comparing notes on who won what from the different aid agencies in the previous year.\n\nAidEx says exhibiting at its conference helps companies to \u201craise brand awareness,\u201d \u201cgenerate new leads,\u201d and \u201creceive personal PR services from our Brussels-based team.\u201d A two-minute promotional video uses cartoon figures and a cheerful pop soundtrack to make the point clearer. \u201cHow are we going to sell all of these products?\u201d Mr. Apprehensive asks. A light bulb appears over Miss Opportunity\u2019s head: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we exhibit at AidEx?\u201d Dozens of cartoon shipping crates pile up on the screen. \u201cThere will be buyers there who want to buy all of THIS!\u201d\n\nBack in Liverpool, the audience claps as Eleanor Baha, Peters\u2019s colleague, takes the stage. Based in Geneva, amid one of the largest clusters of UN agencies, Baha is one of the UK Aid-Funded Business Service\u2019s attach\u00e9s. \u201cWhy should you be looking at UN business? What\u2019s the point? Well, for you as companies it\u2019s a good export market. And for you and your colleagues, there\u2019s a definite \u2018feel good\u2019 factor, this is part of your CSR,\u201d she smiles. \u201cAnd finally, perhaps most importantly, you are sure to get paid. The UN only places business with companies when the budget is already secure.\u201d\n\nThe Corporate Aid Bonanza\n\nThere has long been an \u201caid industry\u201d \u2014 the swarm of for-profit companies and consultants that take cuts of government aid earmarked for the world\u2019s poorest people. In some donor countries, aid has been officially \u201ctied\u201d: aid-funded contracts that are required to go to companies from the rich country that is \u201cgiving\u201d this money. In the United States, the world\u2019s largest official donor, \u201ctying\u201d aid has led to extreme cases of giant multinationals profiting off this protected business. Among the main beneficiaries of the multimillion dollar US food aid budget are the huge grain traders Cargill, ADM, and Bunge, who have won the lion\u2019s share of the contracts to provide wheat and other commodities to be shipped from America to poor countries on US-flagged ships. (The shipping industry also benefits.)\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the United Kingdom formally \u201cuntied\u201d its aid 15 years ago, on the heels of scathing criticism from a powerful civil society campaign that wanted to see aid disconnected from Britain\u2019s commercial interests, and instead focused on ending poverty in developing countries, not supporting businesses at home. Despite the fact that all UK aid is officially \u201cuntied,\u201d however, it appears that British companies still win the majority of this business. A 2014 peer review of the UK aid program, by the OECD group of donors, reported that over 90 percent of the largest British aid-funded contracts go to UK firms. (It politely suggested there may be \u201cunintended or implicit impediments\u201d to foreign companies winning this business.)\n\nBut since 2000, and particularly since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the visibility and power of large corporations in international aid and development efforts has taken on even larger proportions. Now, CEOs of major multinationals sit on UN panels charting the future of global development; USAID is partnering with Walmart and Chevron; and NGOs like Oxfam and Save the Children have joined hands with corporate behemoths Unilever and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). With traditional aid budgets under pressure, donors are increasingly turning to the private sector to fill the gap. Today, if you\u2019re a company, there\u2019s a growing menu of ways for you to benefit from aid and global development efforts. In fact, the 21st century has witnessed a corporate takeover of aid: US and European corporations not only making millions off foreign aid budgets, but using aid and global development institutions to break into new markets and influence public policy in the developing world. Big NGOs are striking deals with multinationals too. The expectation is that these engagements will only grow.\n\nIn New York in September 2015, UN member states adopted a new set of 17 \u201csustainable development goals\u201d to replace the \u201cmillennium development goals\u201d that guided much of the world\u2019s aid and development efforts over the last 15 years. The new goals include grand objectives to \u201cend poverty everywhere\u201d and provide \u201cquality education for all.\u201d The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon called them a \u201cto-do list for people and planet, and a blueprint for success.\u201d Along with these new goals, development institutions have talked about the need to move \u201cfrom billions to trillions\u201d in financing commitments to pay for this agenda. Teaming up with big businesses is being sold as the only option.\n\nIn a briefing with journalists ahead of the UN meeting in September, the chief US negotiator on the \u201cpost-2015 development agenda,\u201d Tony Pipa, said:\n\nThe breadth and the ambition of this agenda [\u2026] it\u2019s going to require government resources. Yes, it\u2019s going to require political leadership, and political will on behalf of leaders of governments. By the same time, the resources are going to have to go beyond what governments themselves can provide.\n\nPipa said this shift to work more with companies was only natural, as aid to many developing countries now pales in comparison to the amount of foreign investment they receive. The United States, he added, is already \u201cincreasingly using our [aid] as a way to leverage and catalyze other resources. [\u2026] [so] it \u2018crowds in\u2019 other types of investment.\u201d\n\nThe corporate takeover of aid is not just about co-financing projects with aid donors, however. Large corporations are also increasingly involved in the design and delivery of projects, and, again, in shaping policy and setting the agenda. Jen Kates at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said: \u201cthere really has been a concerted shift and change in the conversation around the private sector.\u201d And \u201cwhether it\u2019s self-interest, economically driven, or due to their sense of being part of a global community,\u201d she said, companies are now involved in aid and development in a \u201cway that wasn\u2019t there 20 years ago, 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nOn a section of The Guardian\u2019s website sponsored in part by Pearson, the publisher and education multinational, companies make the case for getting involved in development. Allan Pamba, vice president for GSK in East Africa, says: \u201cdeveloping medicines and vaccines and making sure they are accessible is the contribution we can make.\u201d David Kyne, CEO of KYNE, a consultancy firm specialized in \u201chealthcare communications,\u201d says companies need to \u201crecognise it\u2019s in your interest to act,\u201d giving the example of an East African flour mill that launched a malaria control initiative, distributing mosquito nets to its workers and making diagnostic tests and medicines available. \u201cMalaria-related absences have dropped by 80 percent.\u201d Tara Nathan, executive director for international development at MasterCard, said people should just let the private sector do what it does best:\n\nProfitability is sustainability, aid is temporary. The 2 + 2 = 5 happens when the private sector is tapped to utilise our full compliment of assets \u2014technologies, people, expertise, innovation capability \u2014 not just money \u2014 to help make development dollars go further.\n\nAddressing the issue of why companies bother to get involved in aid, Pipa commented:\n\nThat question of sustainability is something that I think they are struggling with themselves. From their own perspective as businesses, how are they going to maintain and continue to grow over time? [\u2026] Frankly, they also likely see opportunity in emerging markets and areas of the world that are growing. Africa has a coterie of some of the fastest growing economies in the world.\n\nThe question, he suggested, was not whether to work with businesses, but: \u201cHow can we find the intersection between private investment and private business to both stimulate and maintain development gains over time in a way that\u2019s sustainable? That\u2019s sustainable economically, that is also sustainable environmentally.\u201d\n\nOf course, a traditional way of making sure companies act responsibly and sustainably is to regulate them. Countries around the world have enacted minimum wage laws, for example, and environmental regulations, to do precisely this. But much of the official narrative of why companies are increasingly involved in aid assumes, or takes advantage of, short memories. It presumes that we have forgotten the context: that of decades of deregulation and failed attempts to hold transnational corporations to account for their actions. Instead of laws limiting the power of transnational corporations, we have voluntary initiatives and corporate social responsibility projects. While companies have been embraced as key \u201cpartners\u201d in aid and global development, the language on accountability has grown increasingly weaker. As Ranja Sengupta, senior researcher at the Third World Network has noted: \u201c[I]f the big private sector [entities] will pay taxes honestly, transfer technology and allow policy space for developing countries to pursue development objectives, development issues will be solved to a large extent.\u201d\n\nA sad reminder of this reality was provided in the months ahead of the UN summit in September 2015, when the new global goals were agreed upon. At a separate international conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on how to finance development moving forward, proposals pushed by developing countries to set up a new intergovernmental tax body \u2014 under the authority of the UN, giving poor countries equal say in how global tax rules are designed \u2014 failed to pass amid opposition from some of the rich states present. Instead, the Addis Ababa conference\u2019s final \u201coutcome document\u201d puts private finance front and center as the future of development, encouraging public-private partnerships and other forms of private investment. Language ensuring that this actually supports sustainable development, advances human rights, and is accountable to poor communities is sparse.\n\nIn London, Nuria Molina, director of policy at the ActionAid UK NGO, said corporations have emerged as increasingly prominent players in development efforts precisely because of deregulation, not in spite of it. \u201cCorporate social responsibility emerged a few decades ago, as a department in each multinational, precisely as a response to deregulation. If you have laws and policies, you just comply by the rules, you don\u2019t need this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe private sector increasingly and as a result of the neoliberal paradigm operates in a ruleless world, so corporate social responsibility is seen as a way to make up for this lack of rules, and to combat perceptions that they are really ruthless.\u201d\n\nFor aid donors and NGOs, the cash that corporations can contribute for development projects is certainly appealing. But, Molina suggests, it is accompanied by an ideology \u2014 the belief that \u201cjobs\u201d and \u201ceconomic growth\u201d can only come through the private sector:\n\nI think partially it\u2019s a very reactive trend \u2014to fiscal trends in donor countries, to where to get money. There\u2019s also an element of inferiority complex. I think development and public sector civil servants have had, since the neoliberal turn, a very strong sense of inferiority, thinking the private sector is so much better, so much smarter, so much more glamorous. The idea that the less state involvement the better, this has become very entrenched.\n\nAs a result, development agencies \u201cimplicitly back the whole agenda of deregulation, which \u2014 including in developed countries\u2014 has been an absolute failure.\u201d\n\nIn New Delhi, Indian economist and professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University Jayati Ghosh laments that sometime in the 1980s discussions about development as more than \u201csimply reducing deprivation, but essentially about transformation\u201d receded into the background and \u201cdevelopment economics, even of the mainstream variety, suffered a fate similar to Keynesian economics in developed countries, of being first reviled, then ignored, and finally forgotten. Its place was taken by a focus on \u2018poverty alleviation.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe UN\u2019s development agenda, with its myriad goals and targets, is the epitome of this new reality, Ghosh says, focused on \u201cameliorating the conditions of those defined as poor, rather than transforming the economies in which they live.\u201d In a 2015 paper, she noted that \u201ceven the focus on poverty alleviation takes a very limited view of what poverty is or how it is generated.\u201d It is abstracted from \u201call the basic economic processes and systemic features that determine poverty,\u201d she said, so that no one in the global development industry talks about class or defines the poor by their lack of assets, as this \u201cwould then necessarily draw attention to the concentration of assets somewhere else in the same society.\u201d The result? A misguided, narrow \u201cfocus [\u2026] on specific interventions \u2014 micro solutions that are seen to work in particular cases,\u201d and on \u201cconsidering how they can be modified and scaled up.\u201d In a few words, \u201csearching for magic silver bullets.\u201d\n\nCracking New Markets\n\nOn a frozen February morning last year, we went to Myanmar\u2019s embassy in London to interview the ambassador before our trip to the country. The embassy is located on Charles Street in the chichi Piccadilly neighborhood of central London, not far from Oxford Street. As we come up to the embassy, the ambassador exits a black Mercedes and walks into the building. It\u2019s a palatial five-story townhouse, and we move up from the consular services on the first floor to a large sitting room with long sofas.\n\nThe embassy has arranged for Keith Win, the founder of the Myanmar-British Business Association (MBBA), to be in on the interview. We start with questions about human rights and \u2014 apropos of nothing \u2014 the ambassador gets up without a word and walks out. Ten minutes pass, then 20, then half an hour, and we\u2019re running out of questions for Win. An assistant who is sitting in on the interview says she doesn\u2019t know if the ambassador is coming back. Fifteen minutes on, another young assistant runs in and speaks with Win in Burmese. Win says the ambassador has had an emergency and won\u2019t be returning. A follow up email to the embassy, to rearrange the interview by phone at a later date, is also not returned.\n\nWin is a smart-sounding businessman, who is part-Burmese and part-English. A chartered accountant, he set up the MBBA in 1995 with the late Peter Godwin, a banker and advisor to the UK government\u2019s Department of Trade and Industry (now the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills). The association\u2019s aims are \u201cto promote commercial dialogue between Myanmar and Britain\u201d and provide \u201ca forum and networking opportunity\u201d for businesses from the two countries. \u201cMyanmar has of course now opened up and gone to a market economy. It\u2019s early stages yet, but it\u2019s heading in that direction, and it\u2019s looking very positive.\u201d He adds,\n\nThe country has huge advantages \u2014 it\u2019s strategically located between India and China, two of the world\u2019s most populous nations. [\u2026] [There is] dynamic growth in the region, so it would do very well. Everyone is extremely busy, there\u2019s so many laws that have been passed, the reforms in place, government officials have been brought up to scratch, multilateral agencies are bringing in outside training. It all takes time. A lot of British businesses are interested, from education, services, architects, accountants, lawyers, lots of lawyers now looking at opportunities, Rolls Royce, power companies, some of the oil and gas [companies]. [\u2026] Opportunities are endless.\n\nIn 2011, Myanmar (also known as Burma) swore in a nominally civilian government, ending more than 40 years of military rule. The next year, the United States began to ease sanctions on doing business in the country, followed by similar moves by the European Union. Foreign investors began scouring the country for opportunities, with Myanmar increasingly advertised as a quintessential resource-rich \u201cfrontier market.\u201d\n\nMany aid agencies have been on hand to help, selling foreign investors and multinational companies as key \u201cpartners\u201d in Myanmar\u2019s future. About an hour outside Yangon, the country\u2019s former capital and still its main commercial hub, lies a vast expanse of land along the coast that has been set aside for foreign investors. This is the Thilawa Special Economic Zone (SEZ), a flagship project of the Japanese government aid agency, JICA, which is helping to finance the zone along with a consortium of primarily Japanese companies.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, the Thilawa SEZ was still a huge construction site, stretching as far as the eye can see, with pick-up trucks scouring the mud and rubble. On the edge of the area set aside for the zone, however, the project had already left its mark, displacing hundreds of families now left facing an uncertain future. A 56-year-old former farmer named Daw Win was one of those displaced to make way for the project, intended to entice foreign investors into the country with top-notch infrastructure and other \u201cincentives.\u201d She told us: \u201cI can\u2019t even sleep at night, because of the stress,\u201d explaining that she used to grow fruits and raise livestock but now, having lost her land to the SEZ, lives \u201cday to day, worrying about meals.\u201d\n\nSitting in his office in Yangon, Winfried Wicklein at the Asian Development Bank presented the role of private businesses and foreign investors in the country\u2019s development as a fait accompli:\n\nHow do you finance development? Hardly anyone is paying taxes. [\u2026] Then you have international donors and they give you grants if you\u2019re lucky \u2014 and at the moment this country is getting a lot of goodwill \u2014 then you have the concessional lenders, like us, but then there is not much left. [\u2026] So that leaves the private sector \u2014 there\u2019s just no question about it.\n\nWicklein smiled broadly when listing the opportunities Myanmar offers for investors and outlining how the country has already changed. By 2030, half of the world\u2019s \u201cconsumer class\u201d will live within a five-hour plane ride of Myanmar, he said by way of example, opening up a whole range of possibilities for tourism industries and exports. And, he said: \u201cThere is huge interest from the private sector. It\u2019s amazing who is coming through in this country.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Myanmar government has been rushing through dozens of new laws and programs to make the country more \u201cattractive\u201d to foreign capital. Thilawa is just one of several SEZs being built, others include Dawei in the south and Xiapu in the contested Rakhine state. Market-oriented reforms are a key part of Myanmar \u201cemerging from decades of isolation,\u201d according to the World Bank, which has called for greater progress on \u201cremoving barriers\u201d for businesses.\n\nAlong with other multilateral institutions like the ADB where Wicklein works, the World Bank closed their offices and halted their projects in Myanmar in the late 1980s, after international sanctions were imposed on the country. But some international NGOs have worked in Myanmar for decades. Others entered the country more recently, in the wake of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which killed more than 100,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta. The government\u2019s immediate response, forbidding the entry of foreign aid agencies, shocked the world. But this approach later thawed, and, in the words of International Crisis Group, the devastation \u201cprompted a period of unprecedented cooperation between the government and international humanitarian agencies.\u201d\n\nPerhaps alive to the fact that NGOs were among the primary foreign organizations with a significant and growing footprint in the country, corporations have been eager to strike up partnerships with them in Myanmar. \u201cWhen I arrived, there weren\u2019t very many foreign businesses,\u201d explained one British worker for a big development NGO in Yangon. She said her organization \u2014 which has been working in the country since before international sanctions were lifted \u2014 has had \u201ccorporate organizations coming to us on various different issues.\u201d But, she said: \u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s a difficult area to navigate because you know, you have to be careful, you have to fully understand the background of the company and their interests and their engagement. [\u2026] I think it\u2019s a minefield.\u201d More broadly, she said she was concerned:\n\nAre we moving too fast? And getting the balance right with development and investment? If either through aid or corporate investment, you\u2019re going into an area that\u2019s still in a fragile situation where people don\u2019t know their rights, don\u2019t know how to protect themselves. [\u2026] There\u2019s a danger that you can do harm.\n\nThe ongoing peace process in the country, she fears, has been sidelined in a rush to invest, build, and develop large-scale infrastructure projects.\n\nAcross the city, at the offices of another international NGO, one staffer lamented that \u201cthere is not enough thought or consideration being given to the type of [economic] growth that is going to happen, the type of investments and how they will impact on people, the type of employment, the type of skills that are needed.\u201d She warned: \u201cBasically the rule of law and governance environment here are very, very weak and offer very little protection.\u201d\n\nOthers have taken aim at the aid industry itself. Myanmar, since 2011, has been a hot spot \u2014 \u201cEvery respectable aid agency and international NGO in the world is planning to initiate or expand operations in Myanmar,\u201d is how one report from the Nathan Associates consultancy firm put it in 2013. \u201cThe best and the brightest in these organizations are pushing to be posted in Yangon or to manage the Myanmar account.\u201d\n\nIn a 2014 article published by The Irrawaddy website, Ramesh Srestha, former UNICEF country representative to Myanmar, warned that:\n\nWith the Nargis relief in 2008 and additional external assistance with the inauguration of a quasi-civilian government in 2011, hundreds of millions of dollars have been channeled through these international NGOs, ostensibly for the benefit of Myanmar\u2019s people\u2014and with only a trace of sustainability. Sustainability is lacking because these organizations\u2019 efforts are ignoring national systems and networks, with only a few exceptions. Many of these NGOs are actually creating a parallel and competing system, weakening the national systems rather than complementing the government\u2019s efforts. Little NGO aid has gone toward strengthening public institutions or building human resources therein.\n\n\u201cToo often local NGOs and community-based organizations are approached by big donors to implement their own preformulated programs according to their own agendas and foreign policies. These practices effectively exclude the local organization and undercut local initiatives,\u201d added a prominent local civil society activist, in a separate 2015 interview with The Irrawaddy. \u201cThis means a big gap arises between donor requirements and real development needs. For us, development needs are about people\u2019s lives, and social processes\u2014they are not about a project \u2018market\u2019 and its related administrative bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nDevelopment Business\n\nSince the financial crisis, the visibility and reach of so-called \u201cdevelopment finance institutions\u201d (DFIs) has also exploded. The premier DFI is the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the branch of the World Bank that lends money to private companies (as opposed to developing-country governments). In Myanmar, one of its largest investments is a multimillion-dollar financing package for the expansion of the Shangri-La property empire, including renovations to a five-star hotel where guests can gorge themselves on fresh lobster at the ground-floor restaurant\u2019s extravagant buffet and unwind upstairs at a well-stocked period bar.\n\nAs part of the World Bank, the IFC is supposed to help meet the institution\u2019s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. But for years, the IFC has been criticized for investing in projects that \u201cstretch the very meaning of development\u201d and have dubious impacts on the poor communities they are supposed to be helping. The IFC also buys shares in companies and advises governments on business-friendly regulatory reforms. It has an asset management wing and spends much of its money through private equity funds. These aspects of its business have earned it comparisons with mainstream investment banks, with observers questioning whether it is driven by na\u00efvet\u00e9 or blind ideology.\n\nLess attention has gone to the clear beneficiaries of this finance. While the benefits of much of this spending seem to rely on a discredited trickle-down theory of development, the advantages for corporate profits are crystal clear. In central and eastern Europe, we found that the IFC and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have, together, provided as much as $1 billion in loans over the last decade to the German discount supermarket giant the Schwarz Group \u2014 which owns Lidl, sometimes called \u201cEurope\u2019s Walmart\u201d \u2014 to expand in countries including Poland and Romania, despite claims of labor rights violations and negative impacts on shops and local farmers.\n\nThe IFC justifies each of its investments based on what development impact it expects it will have. It said supporting Lidl\u2019s expansion would create jobs and give low-income consumers more access to cheap, quality food. In February 2013, the then recently appointed head of the IFC, Jin-Yong Cai, told us that creating profitable companies and tackling poverty should not be seen as contradictory goals. Sitting in the lobby of a plush hotel in central London, he argued that larger companies often create more \u2014 and more sustainable \u2014 jobs than smaller firms, and that there are also \u201cmultiplier effects\u201d on supply chains and distribution networks, which employ others along the way. \u201cWe\u2019re very much focused on evidence,\u201d he insisted. (Cai, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has since returned to the mainstream banking world, having resigned from the IFC in 2015).\n\nAnd so when the IFC announced a multimillion-dollar investment in a rich diamond mine at Mwadui, Tanzania, about 87 miles from the shores of Lake Victoria, it was described as a deal in \u201crecognition of the important socio-economic benefits that this operation brings to its local community.\u201d First discovered in 1940 by mercurial adventurer and diamond buccaneer Dr. John Thoburn Williamson, better known as \u201cDoc,\u201d the Williamson mine in northern Tanzania has since changed hands many times. Today it is run by a South African company, Petra Diamonds, which is listed on London\u2019s FTSE 250 exchange, in partnership with the Tanzanian government, which holds a 25 percent stake.\n\nPetra took over in 2009 from De Beers \u2014 which controversially, and some allege falsely, claimed to have been taking a loss on the asset for the past 14 years \u2014 and sought to bring up low levels of production and expand the mine. The next year, the IFC approved a $40 million loan for Petra\u2019s expansion of the Williamson project and took an almost $20 million equity stake in the company as well. The IFC insists that it \u201coperates on a commercial basis, invests exclusively in for-profit projects in developing countries, and charges market rates for its products and services.\u201d But Omari Hwin\u2019dadi, the financial manager of the Williamson mine, says Petra got a better deal with financing through the IFC than it would have with commercial banks that were \u201ccharging higher [terms].\u201d The IFC has also been \u201cvery considerate,\u201d says Hwin\u2019dadi, in readjusting the company\u2019s repayment schedule.\n\nThe IFC\u2019s investment in Petra was the first time it financed a diamond mining group. \u201cWe are pleased to be able to support the company in its African expansion plans,\u201d said Tom Butler, the IFC\u2019s top official working on mining, describing Petra as \u201ccommitted to working with local communities and implementing projects that follow best practice environmental and social standards.\u201d Local communities, however, say benefits promised by the companies and government over the past decades have not been delivered to many people living around the mine. The Mwadui hospital on the mine\u2019s campus is available to anyone working for Petra, but locals have to pay a fee if they want to be treated there, and though small, many are so poor they cannot afford it. The school is likewise open to any of the children of the workers on the mine, but not to others in local communities, unless they pay another fee.\n\nAt a government school, which is a succession of rudimentary brick buildings in nearby Masagala village, a class of 108 children, crammed into one room, is being taught by Joseph Makoba. He says Petra has paid for desks and two teachers\u2019 quarters at his school. But, Makoba adds: \u201cThese investors are in our country and they are reaping a lot of fruit, so they should at least provide something. [\u2026] What the company is bringing to us is peanuts.\u201d Another teacher, Veronica Masinga at Su Buchambi primary school in another nearby village, said:\n\nI am not happy that we have to live on hand-outs and donations like this. It\u2019s because the community around [the mine] does not know their rights, they are in the dark, they are uneducated, so when we get these things we feel happy even though we are just being given hand-outs.\n\nIn the area around the mine, Petra runs a so-called \u201ccommunity development program,\u201d which it said the IFC had encouraged, under which certain nearby villages have been given a budget of roughly $90,000 among them to be spent each year. Joseph Kasaa, who runs Petra\u2019s corporate social responsibility programs, said this has been a successful way of smoothing over relationships with villagers that weren\u2019t always supportive of the project. \u201cThey started from an area where there was nothing and there was some kind of negativity from the community over the mine because they didn\u2019t see anything useful coming from it,\u201d he said. In other words, the main purpose of the company\u2019s community initiatives appears to be clearing the way for it to focus on its real work \u2014 its commercial enterprise; its development program seems to be little more than a form of PR.\n\nPrivatizing Aid\n\nTanzania was also party to one of the largest \u201ccompacts\u201d signed between a developing country and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a project of the George W. Bush administration to run aid more like a business. The idea behind the MCC was to set up a new type of aid agency \u2014 one that had a CEO at its head \u2014 that was funded by public money but acted autonomously, with a corporation-style board composed of financial experts who knew how to make money.\n\nThe MCC is chaired by the Secretary of State and composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, three other US government members, and four private members effectively appointed by the White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a venture capitalist on the board, the head of Capital Reed services, so it\u2019s a range,\u201d said Jonathan O. Bloom, vice president for Africa at the MCC, from his office in Washington, DC. \u201cBut it is specifically intended to be a non-government voice in guiding policy, so it\u2019s a corporation in that sense, but it\u2019s not General Motors.\u201d\n\nDaniel Yohannes, an Ethiopian-American businessman with a background in banking and financial services, was CEO of the MCC from 2009 to 2014. In an interview with The Guardian\u2019s development professionals network while still in that post, he said: \u201cMy background complements the role, because what I do here is very similar to what I did in the private sector.\u201d He continued:\n\nIf you want to do aid effectively then you have to approach development like a business. MCC wants to make sure that every single dime \u2014 whether $100m or $400m \u2014 is getting the best returns, both for American tax payers who have trusted us with their funds and for its partner countries.\n\nBloom explained that the MCC will \u201conly work with selected countries.\u201d He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t work with everybody. It\u2019s not based on US foreign policy priorities but a set of criteria that reflect countries that are basically well run, politically, democracies, market-based economies, and invest their money in their people.\u201d (MCC countries have so far included Albania, El Salvador, and Ghana.) The idea is that once specific projects are identified, the MCC and the country involved would sign a \u201ccompact\u201d committing to complete them by a certain deadline. If they don\u2019t finish in time, the money is cut off. So the incentives are clear. So far, these compacts have been worth anything from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nTanzania\u2019s first \u201ccompact\u201d was signed in 2008 during then-President Bush\u2019s whirlwind tour of five African countries in six days. It focused on transportation, water, and energy supply, and was worth a total of $698 million. As with any contract, it came with important terms and conditions. Bloom said \u201cconditionalities\u201d attached to compacts are typically \u201cpolicy related to whatever sector we\u2019re working on.\u201d He explained:\n\nThere are a set of conditions both before we approve and during implementation, but [in Tanzania] they relate to things like the government paying the arrears it owes to the electrical utility so that the electrical utility is solid, but it leads to keeping the tariff structure reflective of real cost so that the utility can invest and reinvest in household connections.\n\nWhat the MCC essentially does is find a policy reform that the government is already invested in itself and try to hold them to it. This obviously incentivizes countries to have US-friendly reforms, such as energy privatization, in the works if they want to qualify for MCC money. Bernard Mchomvu, CEO for the Tanzania compact, said:\n\nWe had a few reforms here and there, tariff reforms mainly. Before, power generation was done by Tanesco \u2014 the [state-owned] electric supply company \u2014 but the government decided to open it up. When the MCC came, we were already in the process, but then they said, \u201cthis is a good thing, why don\u2019t you open up?\u201d So whoever wants to invest in power is allowed now, earlier it was a monopoly of Tanesco.\n\nJohn Sakia, a project manager at Tanesco, drove us to the coast, not far from the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam, to see one of the MCC\u2019s flagship projects in the country \u2014 a 100-megawatt submarine transmission cable that connects the island of Zanzibar, famous for its tourist resorts and white sand beaches, to the mainland\u2019s electrical grid. Part of the construction work was contracted out to an Indian company. A Japanese firm was involved in laying the submarine cable. Sakia says his job was to see that these companies implemented the project as the MCC had outlined.\n\nThe chief beneficiaries of the new Zanzibar cable will be the tourists who visit the island in increasing numbers. In a country where only two percent of people in rural areas have access to electricity, it might seem a strange place to spend millions of aid dollars. Sakia says there were plenty of other electricity projects given for consideration to MCC that were rejected. \u201cMost of the projects which were rejected were distribution projects. This is a transmission project. Distribution projects, most of them were dropped by the MCC because they said the funding was limited,\u201d he said.\n\nTo get electricity out into the rural areas, distribution is what needs to be focused on. Mchomvu was, however, unashamedly clear about whom this project benefitted:\n\nIf you go to Zanzibar now, the hotels are very happy because they have very good power supply. Earlier it was frustrating for tourists because the hotel power went off at 10 p.m., then you have to start using candles in the hotels. You don\u2019t come from Europe all the way to Zanzibar for candles.\n\nBuying Silence\n\nIn early November 2014, the readers of the Financial Times\u2019s \u201cHow to Spend It\u201d section opened up the glossy supplement that prides itself on being \u201cthe benchmark for luxury lifestyle magazines\u201d to a profile of Justin Forsyth, the then chief executive of Save the Children UK. Over the last decade, the NGO sector has \u201cprofessionalized\u201d and cozied up to big business in unprecedented ways. Forsyth, former advisor to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, was widely credited with ushering in a new wave of grand partnerships with corporations. He also \u201cincreased the charity\u2019s income by \u00a350m per year since 2010,\u201d according to the congratulatory subhead on the \u201cHow to Spend It\u201d profile. The piece is a tour of Forsyth\u2019s favorite tapas restaurants, the Royal Opera House, walks in Primrose Hill. Forsyth smiles for the camera, one hand in his pocket, the other arm leaning on the counter of an upscale gelateria in London\u2019s Borough Market \u2014 a genial portrait of the cosmopolitan businessman.\n\nCorporate funding of international NGOs is nothing new. CARE USA has collaborated with Coca-Cola for three decades. But corporate-NGO tie-ups are flourishing. Oxfam says it \u201cis proud to be at the forefront of partnerships between the business sector and the NGO community.\u201d A section of the website for Save the Children UK beckons corporations to \u201cwork with us\u201d with a menu of options from straightforward financial donations to \u201ccause-related marketing.\u201d The NGO says:\n\n\u201cTeaming up with Save the Children to market a new or existing product could boost your sales, profile and customer base.\u201d The sales pitch continues: \u201cAssociating your brand with the world\u2019s leading independent organisation for children could be really beneficial for your business and stakeholders.\u201d\n\nSave the Children is seen as being on the forefront of this corporate-partnership wave in Britain. Molina, now head of policy at ActionAid UK, used to work at Save the Children. In a 2014 article for an academic development studies journal, she described how, when preparing a campaign against companies aggressively marketing baby formula in developing countries, it looked at:\n\nthe allegations made against the target companies to check legal risks, to assess the potential links with the company of offices and aid workers in relevant case study countries, and to ensure the tone of the activities and outputs involved in the campaign did not put the broader corporate engagement strategy of the organization at risk.\n\nThe NGO\u2019s most famous corporate deal was announced in May 2013, when Save the Children unveiled an unprecedented \u00a315 million partnership with the pharmaceutical multinational GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). One former staffer described the deal as \u201ca car crash\u201d and said that claims about the number of children\u2019s lives impacted by the partnership were \u201cnonsense\u201d and more about PR than anything else. GSK was at the time mired in controversy, with allegations of bribery and other murky activities across countries where they operate. In 2012, the company was fined $3 billion in the United States after pleading guilty to criminal charges, including bribing doctors and encouraging the prescription of the antidepressant Paxil to children, even though the drug was unsuitable and unapproved for this use.\n\nThe former staffer said the financial crisis of 2008 is still having an impact on charity donations from individual members of the public and that \u201ceven for some of the bigger NGOs the aftermath is continuing to create financial difficulties. Difficult choices are being made of the sort that really haven\u2019t been made for best part of 15 years.\u201d The consequence, he said, is the turn to corporations: \u201cLet\u2019s say perhaps five years ago, the internal argument about whether to kind of hold your nose and take the money would have been more likely to tip against it, those conversations are now tipping the other way.\u201d While it\u2019s often unclear how exactly these partnerships impact the work of NGOs, he suggested:\n\nI think in general [\u2026] [it\u2019s] more about a kind of self-censoring than the changing of positions, so it\u2019s just being a little bit more careful about the way that you approach the different business or about the general framing or maybe even doing things that a corporate partner wouldn\u2019t want you to do \u2026 but just deciding to be a bit careful in case.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, many big NGOs \u2014 including Save the Children \u2014 are dependent on government funding for significant chunks of their budgets. This may have ratcheted up the pressure to be open to business. Justine Greening, the minister for international development, has insisted that: \u201cFor everyone in development, the private sector must be key partners. At DFID [the UK\u2019s Department for International Development] our relationship with business has never been closer.\u201d DfID is working with companies including Coca-Cola, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), and Pearson, and is promoting the role of private sector partners including in health and education projects.\n\nAnother of DfID\u2019s partners is Unilever, the enormous Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company whose products include food, drinks, cleaning supplies, and deodorants. In September 2014, the UK government announced a partnership with the multinational to \u201cuse new social business models to improve health, hygiene, and livelihoods for 100 million people by 2025\u201d that would include each side contributing \u00a35 million to \u201ca research and innovation programme focused on affordable sanitation and safe drinking water.\u201d Greening said at the time:\n\nBritish businesses have the potential to make an enormous contribution to the fight against extreme poverty around the world. This partnership, the first of its kind, will combine our expertise and networks to help millions of the world\u2019s poorest people find jobs, improve water and sanitation and, ultimately, end dependency on aid. This is not just good for the developing world, it is good for Britain. The frontier economies we will be working to improve are ultimately Britain\u2019s future trading partners.\n\nUnilever owns hundreds of household-name brands, including Dove, Knorr, Hellmann\u2019s, Lipton, Marmite, and Lynx. Under Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever since 2009, the company has moved boldly into the corporate-led global development space. Polman, who joined the multinational from Nestle, where he was chief financial officer, is now a regular on the global summit circuit. Among other privileges, he was given a spot on UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s exclusive 27-member \u201cHigh Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda,\u201d appointed to help steer the process of deciding the UN\u2019s new global goals. (With few exceptions, the panel was comprised of former and current senior politicians and diplomats including UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Queen Rania of Jordan.)\n\nPolman, and Unilever, have become standard-bearers for a so-called \u201cenlightened capitalism\u201d that does good while making money. (And lots of money: Unilever says it has sales in over 190 countries and 174,000 employees, and in 2015 its revenues exceeded \u20ac53 billion, with over half of the company\u2019s business in \u201cemerging markets.\u201d) At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2016, Polman helped launch a new Global Commission on Business and Sustainable Development, to \u201carticulate and quantify the compelling economic case for businesses to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals, mapping the ways that businesses can get involved, build competitive advantage and flourish.\u201d Under Polman, Unilever has also announced commitments to, for example, cut calories in its ice-cream products and eliminate coal from its energy usage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the world\u2019s biggest NGO,\u201d Polman told his audience at a 2014 event organized by the Washington, DC\u2013based Center for Global Development think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re a non-government organization. The only difference is, we\u2019re making money so we are sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst and foremost I am a businessman; I cannot deny that,\u201d Polman continued. \u201cWe have 2 billion consumers using us every day; we are in seven out of 10 households globally. [\u2026] If you have that scale and reach, it\u2019s an enormous possibility to transform markets.\u201d\n\nBut Unilever\u2019s good words and much-feted focus on \u201csustainability\u201d recently clashed with news from India, where it has been at the center of scandals around mercury poisoning connected with its subsidiary Hindustan Unilever Limited\u2019s thermometer factory in Kodaikanal, in the hills of the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year a music video, \u201cKodaikanal Won\u2019t,\u201d went viral, accusing Unilever of failing to clean up its mercury waste. Borrowing the tune of Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cAnaconda,\u201d then 28-year-old Indian rapper Sofia Ashraf exclaimed: \u201cKodaikanal won\u2019t step down, until you make amends now.\u201d Within weeks, the video had been viewed more than 2 million times and tens of thousands of people signed a petition calling on Unilever to resolve the long-running controversy. (In March 2016, the company reportedly agreed on an undisclosed settlement with former workers at the factory, ending a 15-year legal battle.) Polman has also protested against proposals \u2014 debated as part of a new national strategy to combat childhood obesity \u2014 to introduce a \u201csugar tax\u201d in the United Kingdom.\n\nUnilever has also signed on to an initiative launched by President Obama at the Camp David G8 Summit in 2012, the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in Africa. This program is supposed to bring together aid donors, corporate partners, and African governments to reduce poverty and help Africa\u2019s small-scale farmers. The sums pledged by aid donors and the companies involved were staggering \u2014 billions of dollars promised for long-neglected agriculture projects. As part of the deal, African countries put dozens of legal and policy reforms on the table, promising to change seed laws, land laws, and other regulations seen as limiting the power of big agribusiness to help change the continent\u2019s fortunes.\n\nFour years on, however, it\u2019s become increasingly unclear how much of the money that was pledged was actually new money. A recent report from the UK government\u2019s own independent aid watchdog, the Independent Commission on Aid Impact, found that, of the roughly \u00a3600 million the United Kingdom said it would put toward the New Alliance, \u201cthe majority of this expenditure, approximately \u00a3480 million, consists of pre-existing agriculture programmes which have been relabeled as New Alliance programmes.\u201d Companies, it added, were \u201cmostly submitting existing investment plans to garner favor with governments, secure a seat in policy dialogue or to win good publicity.\u201d\n\nThe last decade has seen a proliferation of different voluntary standards for corporations, codes of conduct, sustainability principles, corporate social responsibility initiatives, and so on. But the limits of these voluntary commitments should be obvious, relying as they do on the goodwill of corporate bosses. Who monitors whether these pledges actually translate into any substantial change for poor communities? Who has the capacity to police and hold to account all of the companies that are moving into this space? The focus on the individual company and what good it may do, voluntarily, also draws attention away from the real issues of social, economic, and environmental justice. There is no global regulatory system for transnational corporations, and instead companies continue to lobby governments to influence public policy and protect their interests.\n\nThe UK government\u2019s aid watchdog has warned that: \u201cDfID needs to recognize that the private sector is not a developmental panacea.\u201d It has also criticized UK aid-funded partnerships with businesses for lacking concrete targets and detailed operational plans for how these projects will help poor communities in developing countries \u2014 the intended beneficiaries of this spending. But the government\u2019s message has remained: join hands with companies. In a speech last summer at the Overseas Development Institute think tank in London, Greening said:\n\nI also want to work with civil society partners that recognise that the private sector is an intrinsic partner in successful development. Because \u2026 the reality is that everywhere in the world, people want jobs. And companies that aren\u2019t making any money don\u2019t tend to recruit or grow. In fact as I know from my family\u2019s experience growing up, when companies lose money, people lose jobs.\n\nBut the problem, Molina says, is that, thus far, many corporate partnerships have been undertaken by NGOs in a \u201cvery unsophisticated, unsavvy way.\u201d She explained:\n\nWe still have a higher moral standing in the eyes of the public. Basically the sector has tended to partner with corporations selling this intangible but very valuable asset for very little and for sometimes for dubious projects. They [companies] are much better than us at negotiating so they [have] got what they wanted from us very cheaply.\n\nShe added: \u201cYou get company A offering to do some small school in Ghana or something \u2026 but what is the rest of the development footprint of this company? Is it lobbying at the WTO on intellectual property?\u201d\n\nHer paper in 2014 noted that: \u201cNGOs, like many other institutions and companies, also tend to measure their success and influence in terms of size and income.\u201d For Nick Dearden, director of the campaign group Global Justice Now, this is a dangerous trend that could upend NGOs\u2019 positive contributions completely:\n\nThe increased professionalization of NGOs over my lifetime is very noticeable, and with that has come this tendency to judge yourself like a business, how much you\u2019re growing. Now fundraising just rules organizations and campaigning has become something you do to get funds. Campaigning has become a form of marketing, how you get your brand out there, how you raise more money, this whole idea that our purpose is to expand, to raise more money, at the same time as the government saying \u2018this is how development is going to be.\n\nMeanwhile, he lamented: \u201cThere\u2019s no structural criticism of business.\u201d\n\nThe result of the corporate takeover of aid is this image: the CEO of a major multinational on stage with the UN secretary-general. Last year, the company received a multimillion dollar loan from the World Bank\u2019s private sector arm. The CEO winks to a man in the audience from USAID \u2014 another partner. NGOs who would otherwise be expected to campaign against the company for environmental destruction are also its \u201cpartners\u201d and their increasingly professionalized staff give the CEO a hearty round of applause. The journalists in the front row write for a newspaper that is also heavily dependent on money from the company, through advertising and increasingly direct \u201csponsorship\u201d of content. Everyone in the room is happy, but a critical analysis of corporate power is the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind. The company has won a carte blanche pass from the institutions that used to be a check on their operations to go forth and make their profits.\n\nThis is the myth of corporate-led global development: that companies have \u201cseen the light\u201d and become more progressive, and therefore should be embraced as partners. While they may sing hymns about their development \u201cimpact\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d operations, many of these same companies continue to avoid taxes and fight against regulation. The fact that this embrace of corporations in aid and development has happened in the wake of the global financial crisis, and amid increasingly mainstream questioning of deregulated capitalism, is astonishing. It is a grand accession of power, good for profits, but delivering questionable short-term benefits for the poor and worrying long-term impacts for the world. It is a many-sided hall of mirrors that is meant to blind good-willed people and the aid agencies they work with to the reality of unchecked corporate power.\n\n\u00a4\n\nTravel funding for this article was provided by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\n\u00a4\n\nClaire Provost is a fellow at the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London.
