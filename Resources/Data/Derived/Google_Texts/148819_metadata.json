A video that recently surfaced online exposes the alleged deceptive marketing strategy Subway implores to trick customers into thinking its sandwich choices are a healthier option compared to other fast food chains.\n\nThe video, allegedly created by former Subway employee Arun Singhal, 30, was leaked by an unknown third party and could be in breach of a restraining order filed against Singhal this past May. Singhal, who formerly owned a Subway franchise in Melbourne, Australia, claims the company tricked him into closing his store by promising ownership over another store location in a popular area. However, when the company denied Singhal his new location, the disgruntled employee cooked up a $35 million blackmail scheme in exchange for his silence.\n\n\u201cAfter they took my authorization to close the store and I closed the store, then they completely changed their words,\u201d Singhal told the Daily Mail. \u201cI was told that they don't have any new location right now and I might have to wait for two to three years for a new location. Here a family man lost $350,000 in Subway's investment. They left me with no option then to declare bankruptcy. I told the \u2018Sandwich Mafia\u2019 that if you don't compensate me for the loss of business, I am going to media to tell everyone about my story.\u201d\n\nIn light of Singhal\u2019s threat, Subway filed a restraining order with the Supreme Court in Victoria back in May that prohibited the ex-employee from releasing any information that would reveal the company\u2019s recipes or method of operation. While the video that was released this past Tuesday would clearly be in violation of the restraining order, Singhal claims the copy was stolen off of his laptop and posted by an anonymous user.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "disgruntled, subway, employee", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Disgruntled Subway employee exposes unhealthy secrets and deceitful marketing strategy in viral video.", "title": "Subway Exposed: Ex-Employee Warns Of Chain's Alleged Health Food Trickery [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/former-subway-employee-releases-video-exposing-sandwich-chains-deceptive-marketing-297166", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/subway.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Disgruntled Subway employee exposes unhealthy secrets and deceitful marketing strategy in viral video.", "title": "Subway Exposed: Ex-Employee Warns Of Chain's Alleged Health Food Trickery [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/former-subway-employee-releases-video-exposing-sandwich-chains-deceptive-marketing-297166", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/subway.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/subway.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-08-08T10:38:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T10:38:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Disgruntled Subway employee exposes unhealthy secrets and deceitful marketing strategy in viral video."}, "article_summary": "A video that recently surfaced online exposes the alleged deceptive marketing strategy Subway implores to trick customers into thinking its sandwich choices are a healthier option compared to other fast food chains.\n\u201cAfter they took my authorization to close the store and I closed the store, then they completely changed their words,\u201d Singhal told the Daily Mail.\nThe video, allegedly created by former Subway employee Arun Singhal, 30, was leaked by an unknown third party and could be in breach of a restraining order filed against Singhal this past May.\nSinghal, who formerly owned a Subway franchise in Melbourne, Australia, claims the company tricked him into closing his store by promising ownership over another store location in a popular area.\nWhile the video that was released this past Tuesday would clearly be in violation of the restraining order, Singhal claims the copy was stolen off of his laptop and posted by an anonymous user."}
