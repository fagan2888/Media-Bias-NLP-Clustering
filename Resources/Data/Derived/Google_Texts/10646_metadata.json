For over a generation, whichever party controlled the White House invariably lost in the commonwealth. And in Virginia this year, Democrats nominated a gubernatorial candidate who\u2019d never held public office, didn\u2019t have deep political roots in the state, and wasn\u2019t especially well liked by voters.\n\nIt looked like a recipe for GOP success. It wasn\u2019t. As the dust settles on Election Day, Terry McAuliffe (D) has narrowly won Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race, Ralph Northam (D) was easily elected Virginia\u2019s next lieutenant governor, and Mark Herring (D) very narrowly leads the still-uncalled race for state attorney general.\n\nThe Tea Party wing of Virginia\u2019s Republican Party got the extremist candidates they wanted, and it looks like they lost in a clean sweep.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of relevant angles to the Virginia elections, but there are two of particular interest. The first relates to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who knew he was losing, condemnations of \u201cObamacare\u201d became the driving message of his entire campaign in the race\u2019s closing weeks. The GOP gubernatorial hopeful said, over and over again , that the gubernatorial race would be \u201c a referendum on Obamacare .\u201d As recently as Monday \u2013 the day before the election \u2013 Cuccinelli said , \u201cTomorrow in Virginia is a referendum on Obamacare. Let\u2019s send a message and say \u2018no\u2019 tomorrow to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAt the same event, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told Virginians, \u201cThis is the first election in America since the full impact of Obamacare has been felt. This is the first chance that people in America have to speak clearly at the ballot box about the impact this law is having on their lives and our economy.\u201d\n\nAnd then Cuccinelli lost, at which point the right said that the race was close because Virginians don\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s worth pausing to remind Republicans what the word referendum means : \u201can event in which the people of a county, state, etc., vote for or against a law that deals with a specific issue.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to sound picky, but folks shouldn\u2019t call a race a referendum, lose, and then say the referendum proves how right they were \u2013 at least if they want to be taken seriously.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s important to realize just how significant women\u2019s health was in this race, which McAuliffe won thanks to a sizable gender gap. Dahlia Lithwick explained overnight, \u201cAn official who consistently used his elected office to promote policies that shamed, marginalized, and patronized women and other minorities was met with a \u2018no.\u2019 This wasn\u2019t just about money, or the shutdown, or Star Scientific, or Terry McAuliffe\u2019s fancy Clinton-era friends. It was about voters and what they know to be true.\u201d\n\nIrin Carmon added some important context\n\nDemocrats already generally enjoy an advantage with female and non-white voters, and particularly with voters who fall in both of those categories. But the 2009 race in Virginia was dominated by concerns about the economy and anger at Obama, which in the tradition of Virginia off-year elections, wound up being predictive of the 2010 midterms. In 2012, the focus on a broad range of women\u2019s issues, including an unapologetic position in favor of abortion rights, helped Barack Obama. The gift to the McAuliffe campaign was that the McDonnell administration, with Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli as a faithful warrior, went on to put restricting reproductive rights front and center on the legislative agenda.\n\nIf recent history is any guide, the right will come up with a variety of creative excuses for failure, explaining why their defeats were really victories if you close one eye and tilt your head just so. But reality is stubborn \u2013 Republicans in a competitive, \u201cpurple,\u201d battleground state nominated right-wing candidates, alienated the voting mainstream, and lost races they probably should have won.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In theory, Virginia Republicans were poised for major victories this year.
