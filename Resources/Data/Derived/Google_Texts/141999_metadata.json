He points out the funding is not a one-time thing, but will be granted to the health centers each year.\n\n\n\nMarans adds that community health centers help keep health care costs down by treating people before their health conditions require expensive hospital care.\n\n\n\n\"If there's not an opportunity for these patients to receive primary and preventive care, they wait until issues become larger and they end up in an emergency room, where they have a bill that they can't pay,\" he explains.\n\n\n\nHealth and Human Services is providing just over $100 million in Affordable Care Act funding to about 160 new health center sites in 33 states. The centers are projected to increase access to health care services for nearly 650,000 patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroy Wilde, Public News Service - UT", "article_metadata": {"description": "OGDEN, Utah \u2013 Thousands of people in Utah, including the homeless, are expected to benefit from $2.3 million in Affordable Care Act (ACA) funding to expand nonprofit community health centers.
