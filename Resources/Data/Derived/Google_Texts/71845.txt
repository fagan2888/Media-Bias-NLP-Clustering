Never underestimate the power of free speech loving, American patriots who use social media.

“Absolutely astonishing” is how the Facebook administrators for the “Boycott A&E Until Phil Robertson Is Put Back On Duck Dynasty” described hitting 1 million “Likes” in less than 24 hours.

The page was established Wednesday to “show support for the freedom of speech of Americans,” and supported by people who agreed: “Unless Phil is reinstated to the show, we refuse to watch the A&E Channel!”

This was important to the administrators because the despicable powers-that-be at A&E aired a “Duck Dynasty” marathon Friday night.

As of this writing, in less than 30 hours, the page has 1.3 million “Likes” and is on track to hit 2 million, possibly by the end of Friday, the administrators wrote.

A fun fact reported by Truth Revolt:

In its first 24 hours, a Facebook page launched with the goal of reinstating Phil Robertson to Duck Dynasty has gathered hundreds of thousands of more supporters than Obamacare had enrollees in that program’s first two months. In its first two months, Obamacare had just under 365,000 enrollees. The Obama administration originally aimed for 3.3 million enrollees by the end of December.
