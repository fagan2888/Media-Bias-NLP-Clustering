Police who went to check on an Old Bridge man at Bayshore Community Hospital over the weekend say they found he had more than 200 bags of heroin in his pants.

Matthew Spyer, 29, of Forest Avenue, Laurence Harbor, also had nine bags of crack cocaine and a Xanax pill when he was taken into custody at 7:15 p.m. Sunday, according to police Lt. Michael Pigott.

Patrolman Frank Sigismondi charged Spyer with possession with intent to distribute heroin, crack cocaine and Xanax and possession of heroin, crack cocaine and Xanax, Pigott said.

Sigismondi responded to Bayshore to meet with staff who were treating Spyer because he had come to the hospital after being involved in a car accident in Old Bridge, Pigott said.

Sigismondi’s investigation led to the discovery of the drugs, Pigott said.

Bail for Spyer was set at $200,000 and he was taken to the Monmouth County Jail in Freehold Township, where he remained Tuesday.

The Asbury Park Press asked police for a photo of the suspect, but they refused. State law allows authorities discretion in releasing suspect photos, but they often refuse to do so, saying they are prohibited by the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.
