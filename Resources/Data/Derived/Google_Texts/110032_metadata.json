Linda McKinney began to worry to the eagle was suffering so she called the game warden for help.\n\nA Norman couple finds an unexpected visitor in its backyard. And rather than sit back and enjoy the sighting of a rare golden eagle, the husband and wife duo went straight to work.\n\nThe eagle did not have broken wings or visible injuries, but as one Norman couple explained, it took only one look to see something was wrong.\n\nLinda McKinney not only caught a glimpse of a golden eagle, she also discovered another meaning for bird watching.\n\nFor two days, this golden eagle spent most of her time on the ground instead of perched in the tree. McKinney began to worry to the eagle was suffering so she called the game warden for help.\n\nThe rescue is the first step toward recovery. The golden eagle is now in good hands at Wildcare, a non- profit organization working to rehabilitate sick and injured animals so they can eventually be released back into the wild.\n\nRondi Large with the Wildcare Foundation believes this bird is suffering from the West Nile Virus. The eagle will go through rehab for at least a month - before she is free to fly again.\n\nWildcare is one of only two organizations in the state that are allowed to take in golden eagles.\n\nLearn more information on Wildcare and how you can help.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "A Norman couple finds an unexpected visitor in its backyard.
