Remember I told you that 56-year-old human reflexes were no match for 11-month-old kitten reflexes? Well, if you throw in a bad back, it's game over. Unless these guys are snoozing, I'd guess that only about one picture in ten is even close to catblogging material these days.

Still, one in ten is one in ten, so here are today's pictures. On the left, Hopper is sitting on the window sill, waiting for a bird to fly by and entertain her. On the right, Hilbert has taken up shop on Marian's chair in our newly rearranged living room (rearranged to make room for a more back-friendly chair for Kevin). He actually spent most of the night on Wednesday sleeping in our bed with us. Progress!

In other news, my sister recommends that all of you with cats try this. She's coming over to visit tomorrow morning, so we'll try it then. Let us know in comments how it goes.
