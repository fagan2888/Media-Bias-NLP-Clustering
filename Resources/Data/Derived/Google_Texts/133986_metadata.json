The myhealthfinder interactive feature provides personalized recommendations for users that the Affordable Care Act requires most health insurers to cover free of charge.\n\nA May pilot project found that by integrating the myhealthfinder application into CVS Health's MinuteClinic site, traffic to myhealthfinder more than tripled. In the first six weeks, more than 2.5 million patients visiting MinuteClinic used myhealthfinder, compared to the 600,000 patients who visited myhealthfinder via healthfinder.gov. Healthfinder.gov now offers a widget that enables other sites to link to the portal, increasing visibility for the resources it offers.\n\n\"Because of retail pharmacies' consumer and convenience focus, and their important role in connecting patients to and sustaining their relationships with primary physicians, retail pharmacies add valuable perspective and insight to the assessment of preventive care,\" the post reads. \"HHS hopes to continue to collaborate with non-Federal entities as a key pathway to making prevention more convenient and easier to navigate for patients.\"\n\nMore articles on health IT:\n\nMassachusetts launches digital health hub initiative to grow state's healthcare startup market\n\nStartup Insider: Clover Health\n\nGun control overhaul sparks change in HIPAA\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
