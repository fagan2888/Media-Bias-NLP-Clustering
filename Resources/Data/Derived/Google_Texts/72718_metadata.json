However, she dismissed the idea of closing the borders, which her GOP counterpart Donald Trump had proposed.\n\n\u201cWell Savannah, you\u2019re right that we\u2019re not sure yet but it\u2019s also true that we have been confronting the threat of terrorism for quite some time,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd this is the latest terrible manifestation of it. We\u2019ve got to tighten our security. I\u2019ve talked about our visa system and our passenger name reference system. When I was secretary of state, we often had some difficulties with our European friends because they were reluctant to impose the kind of strict standards we were looking for. That\u2019s after Paris has changed and we need to do much more to tighten things up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I know our security professionals are working to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s unrealistic to say we\u2019re going to completely shut down our borders to everyone. You know, that would stop commerce for example and that\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interests. But we have to do a much better job in coordination with the Europeans on tracking and following anyone who has any connection with terrorist activity or terrorism.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary: \u2018Unrealistic to Say We\u2019re Going to Completely Shut Down Our Borders\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hillary: \u2018Unrealistic to Say We\u2019re Going to Completely Shut Down Our Borders\u2019", "title": "Hillary: \u2018Unrealistic to Say We\u2019re Going to Completely Shut Down Our Borders\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/hillaryBEN.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/22/hillary-unrealistic-to-say-were-going-to-completely-shut-down-our-borders/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary: \u2018Unrealistic to Say We\u2019re Going to Completely Shut Down Our Borders\u2019", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/hillaryBEN.jpg", "title": "Hillary: \u2018Unrealistic to Say We\u2019re Going to Completely Shut Down Our Borders\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Brussels, Hillary Clinton, terrorism,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton,Hillary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2016-03-22T06:42:01-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut it\u2019s unrealistic to say we\u2019re going to completely shut down our borders to everyone.\n\"It's unrealistic to say we're going to completely shut down our borders\" - @HillaryClinton on TODAY #Brussels https://t.co/Lgst4hZzPoSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTuesday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton reacted to the apparent terrorist attack that resulted in at least 31 dead and 130 injured in Brussels earlier in the day.\nHowever, she dismissed the idea of closing the borders, which her GOP counterpart Donald Trump had proposed.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton talked about tighter security.\nI\u2019ve talked about our visa system and our passenger name reference system."}
