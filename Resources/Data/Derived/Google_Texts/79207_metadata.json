John Koziol\n\nLittleton River District revitalization effort gets $500k grant for infrastructure improvements\n\n\n\nLITTLETON \u2014 Already off to a great start, the effort to revitalize the downtown along the Ammonoosuc River recently received a $500,000 grant from the New Hampshire Community Development Finance Authority.\n\n..\n\nTaylor Caswell, who is the CDFA\u2019s executive director and a Littleton native, on Nov. 12 presented a large ceremonial check to town officials during a brief gathering on the covered pedestrian bridge that spans the Ammonoosuc.\n\n..\n\nCaswell good naturedly and immediately dismissed any hometown favoritism, saying Littleton \u2014 through its River District Commission \u2014 has a proven track record of improving its part of the community, and has a solid plan for that to happen.\n\n..\n\nThe CDFA grant will be used to pay for a new roadway, sidewalks and sewer lines on Mill Street, which, along with Saranac Street and Ammonoosuc Street, parallels both the Ammonoosuc and Main Street in the downtown.\n\n..\n\nThe River District, according to the commission, is important to Littleton because it is key to enhancing the beauty of the town; creating new business opportunities; complementing existing Main Street businesses; preserving historic assets; extending pedestrian/cycling trails; and re-inventing Littleton as a tourist destination.\n\n..\n\nThis year has seen the construction of Harmony Park on the Riverwalk, where visitors can play a variety of percussion instruments year round, and expansion of the Riverwalk to include more than two miles of walking trails. Plans are in the works to build a second bridge over the Ammonoosuc that would accommodate pedestrians as well as bicycles and small motor vehicles.\n\n..\n\n\u201cThis is a huge step\u201d for improving the River District, said John Hennessey, the chairman of the River District Commission, of the CDFA grant. He added that the money will ultimately create jobs while stimulating economic activity.\n\n..\n\nState Sen. Jeff Woodburn, D-Dalton, welcomed Caswell back to Littleton and presented him a book about northern New Hampshire, telling Caswell that, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re bringing money to the North Country, you\u2019ll get a present to come.\u201d\n\n..\n\nLater, Woodburn, while happy for Littleton, said he\u2019d like to see the CDFA award more grants to North County municipalities.\n\n\n\nIn the current round of block grants, the CDFA disbursed a total of $1.8 million statewide.\n\n..\n\nCaswell said the CDFA\u2019s decision to award a grant to Littleton was \u201cfairly easy\u201d to make given that the town, since 2012, has shown it is committed to improving the River District.\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Already off to a great start, the effort to revitalize the downtown along the Ammonoosuc River recently received a $500,000 grant from the New Hampshire Community Development Finance Authority.", "title": "Littleton River District revitalization effort gets $500k grant for infrastructure improvements | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Already off to a great start, the effort to revitalize the downtown along the Ammonoosuc River recently received a $500,000 grant from the New Hampshire Community Development Finance Authority.", "title": "Littleton River District revitalization effort gets $500k grant for infrastructure improvements | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151116/NEWS0621/151119459/0/OPINION01", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20151116/NEWS0621/151119459/AR/0/AR-151119459.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "State Government", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "date": "2015-11-16 00:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "keywords": "Environment, Outdoors, Local and County Government, Littleton,", "twitter": {"description": "Already off to a great start, the effort to revitalize the downtown along the Ammonoosuc River recently received a $500,000 grant from the New Hampshire Community Development Finance Authority.", "title": "Littleton River District revitalization effort gets $500k grant for infrastructure improvements | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151116/NEWS0621/151119459/0/OPINION01", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20151116/NEWS0621/151119459/AR/0/AR-151119459.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "..\u201cThis is a huge step\u201d for improving the River District, said John Hennessey, the chairman of the River District Commission, of the CDFA grant.\nJohn KoziolLittleton River District revitalization effort gets $500k grant for infrastructure improvementsLITTLETON \u2014 Already off to a great start, the effort to revitalize the downtown along the Ammonoosuc River recently received a $500,000 grant from the New Hampshire Community Development Finance Authority.\nThe Town of Littleton recently received a $500,000 community development block grant from the New Hampshire Community Development Finance Authority for infrastructure improvements along the Ammonoosuc River.\n..Caswell said the CDFA\u2019s decision to award a grant to Littleton was \u201cfairly easy\u201d to make given that the town, since 2012, has shown it is committed to improving the River District.\nThe CDFA grant will be used to pay for a new roadway, sidewalks and sewer lines on Mill Street, which, along with Saranac Street and Ammonoosuc Street, parallels both the Ammonoosuc and Main Street in the downtown."}
