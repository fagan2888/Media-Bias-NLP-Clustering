Let\u2019s round that up to 5 million.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he said, according to the Wall Street Journal, only about 100,000 people have signed up for Obamacare. Furthermore, of that number, only about half have successfully completed their online insurance policy purchase. The rest have merely placed a policy into their website \u201cshopping cart\u201d without buying it.\n\n\u201cSo the real numbers are five million cancellations compared to 50,000 insurance plans bought,\u201d said Limbaugh.\n\nThat would mean 100 policies have been canceled for each new purchase under Obamacare.\n\nThen Limbaugh noted that most health insurance polices cover spouses and children along with the primary policyholder.\n\n\u201cSo when they say that 4.8 million plans have been canceled,\u201d Limbaugh said, \u201cwe may be talking about families of two all the way up to four. The number of people who\u2019ve had their insurance canceled could be three times that number.\u201d\n\nAccording to the radio host, that means that the total number of uninsured Americans is now approximately 35 million, up from the 20 million uninsured before Obamacare was signed into law.\n\nLimbaugh mocked former President Bill Clinton for calling on Obama to keep his repeated promise that every citizen who was satisfied with their existing healthcare plan could keep it even after the passage of the Affordable Healthcare Act.\n\n\u201cYou see where Bill Clinton has said that Obama needs to keep his word about keeping our insurance plans if we like \u2019em? Can you imagine being lectured to about honesty and integrity from a convicted perjurer, Bill Clinton? Literally, how far has one fallen when that is the case?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another point, too, he said: Reality.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very well for Slick Willy to say,\u201d Limbaugh remarked, but \u201cthese plans that have been canceled are gone by virtue of the law. I don\u2019t know how you turn back the hands of time. (\u2026) They aren\u2019t in a lock box waiting to reinstated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the lie Obama told is so fraudulent,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis was not just your average little political lie. This was a lie steeped in fraud with the specific intent of deceiving people into voting for Obama.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, was sold to the American people based on the premise that it would provide desperately needed health care coverage to the nation\u2019s estimated 20 million uninsured.
