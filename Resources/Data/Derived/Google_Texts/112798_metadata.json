Randolph Lowry (Photo: File/The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nUndocumented students looking for a path to higher education often turn to private universities that have more freedom to offer special scholarships and programming that make tuition more affordable.\n\nFor undocumented Nashvillians, Lipscomb University can be a lifeline.\n\nThe university began admitting undocumented students in 2008. Over time, it broadened its efforts, working alongside YMCA Latino Achievers and other community groups to recruit students.\n\n\"We welcome everybody here,\" said Lisa Steele, assistant dean of intercultural development. \"Nowhere in the Bible does it say love your documented neighbor only. It says love your neighbor.\"\n\nOfficials also encourage students to do community service that benefits other undocumented Nashvillians. Lipscomb students do volunteer translating at Colt Elementary School.\n\nBecause undocumented students are not eligible for federal aid or loans, Lipscomb offers special Latino Achievers scholarships that offset the full cost of tuition.\n\nLipscomb President L. Randolph Lowry said the university's efforts are a reflection of its Christian mission.\n\n\"We think it's part of our mission as an institution to reach out to those in need who can benefit from an education,\" Lowry said. \"We look back in time and look at Jesus and how he reached out to people in the community. That's what we think we might be doing with these students.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1GsTSVB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The university began admitting undocumented students in 2008.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The university began admitting undocumented students in 2008.", "title": "Lipscomb offers lifeline for undocumented students", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2015/04/25/lipscomb-offers-lifeline-undocumented-students/26341019/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The university began admitting undocumented students in 2008.", "title": "Lipscomb offers lifeline for undocumented students", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce9758497bdfcf7e5b4d732397b781cdb78b2040/c=0-154-1255-1409&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317019664Z.1_20150424214504_000_GN8AJPR9C.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Lipscomb University", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Lipscomb University", "title": "Lipscomb offers lifeline for undocumented students", "author": "Adam Tamburin", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/education", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68d85a1e3806c0377147ecbd4d7ca558c29e6a88/c=0-98-1255-1772/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317019664Z.1_20150424214504_000_GN8AJPR9C.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f991eb0a5f2c001a8fea668b016a5bee8263e041/c=0-154-1255-1409/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317019664Z.1_20150424214504_000_GN8AJPR9C.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c25212fc59c9fe4303c93184207014a1d4557cbd/c=0-326-1255-1270/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317019664Z.1_20150424214504_000_GN8AJPR9C.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dca745745d1c19f095a4c376c115d02b59fa7504/c=0-459-1255-1168&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317019664Z.1_20150424214504_000_GN8AJPR9C.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-25T18:02:05.187000-05:00", "shorthed": "Lipscomb a lifeline for undocumented students", "articleid": 26341019, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/301951ca110c92ddbcda7374a3c313ccf82ba169/c=0-459-1255-1168/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317019664Z.1_20150424214504_000_GN8AJPR9C.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/802e9286ed05a0876ff3832edd979d271a3c7ea9/c=98-0-1161-1890/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/24/B9317019664Z.1_20150424214504_000_GN8AJPR9C.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "lipscomb university, undocumented students, immigrants, latino, christian"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf93\"", "article_summary": "Because undocumented students are not eligible for federal aid or loans, Lipscomb offers special Latino Achievers scholarships that offset the full cost of tuition.\nFor undocumented Nashvillians, Lipscomb University can be a lifeline.\nLipscomb students do volunteer translating at Colt Elementary School.\nThe university began admitting undocumented students in 2008.\nLipscomb President L.
