But if you\u2019re even slightly confused, come with me for a trip into the magical world of Karl Rove via his Crossroads GPS way-way-back machine.\n\nThe setting for Rove\u2019s latest campaign ad is a suburban kitchen, presumably somewhere in Jefferson County, because all Colorado elections are decided in kitchens somewhere in Jefferson County.\n\nwww.youtube.com/embed/tn5GhW2ajpw\n\nWe zoom in on a coffee cup and then, strangely, on a woman\u2019s, uh, profile \u2014 possibly to signal the viewer that this campaign ad is about women drinking coffee. And as the camera pulls back, it reveals four such women standing around one of those granite-top kitchen island things, doing what Jefferson County women presumably do \u2014 stand around and complain about Mark Udall\u2019s Senate campaign\u2019s insistence on talking about, you know, female stuff (personhood/abortion/birth control) instead of the real issues, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute.\n\nThese are actors, you quickly realize. There are at least two giveaways.\n\nOne, real people don\u2019t actually talk this way. Here\u2019s a sample piece of caffeinated conversation in Rove\u2019s world o\u2019 kitchens: \u201cUnfortunately, after 15 years in Washington, political scare tactics are all Mark Udall has left.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitical scare tactics\u201d are, of course, words that have never been said consecutively in anyone\u2019s kitchen, but they are a handy euphemism for personhood/abortion/birth control, which is all Udall talks about because, well, you know. Not surprisingly, \u201cpersonhood/abortion/birth control\u201d are words the Karl Rove stand-ins never utter.\n\nAnd two, as the 30 seconds slip agonizingly by, you realize something else: that maybe too much caffeine is involved. These women are, well, miffed. No, they\u2019re more than that. They\u2019re angry. And it\u2019s not just your everyday stressed-out anger at the world, it\u2019s more like they are auditioning for a guest spot on Hannity.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything you know about affable Mark Udall, the mountain-climbing senator, it\u2019s that, whatever else, no one is mad at the guy. Except, I guess, Karl Rove, who imagines that Jefferson County women are \u2014 dare I, a reconstructed male, use the word in 21st century America? \u2014 this annoyingly, umm, shrill.\n\nIt\u2019s not me who\u2019s saying it (really, it\u2019s not). It\u2019s Karl Rove, who is betting Crossroad GPS millions that these are the kind of women that Jefferson County\u2019s female voting population \u2014 or any other population \u2014 could relate to or even recognize.\n\nThis is less a coffee klatch than it is a desperate cry for an anger-management class. And what are the Jeffco Four so mad about? It\u2019s not the Hobby Lobby kitchen decor. And it\u2019s not the cookies and fruit put out with the coffee and cream. They\u2019re tired, they say, of being treated as single-issue voters.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t Mark Udall talk about the issues?\u201d one woman asks.\n\n\u201cUdall voted against Keystone,\u201d one replies.\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is the only issue discussed. I\u2019m serious. One woman does say that Udall voted 99 percent of the time with Obama, as you may have heard Cory Gardner mention once or twice. But for issues in this kitchen, it\u2019s Keystone and Keystone only. I guess Rove doesn\u2019t know that if you hear people talking about Keystone in Colorado, they\u2019re probably discussing next season\u2019s ski package and not a proposed pipeline that would come nowhere near the state.\n\nAnd yet, Karl Rove apparently envisions unaffiliated voters in kitchens across Colorado slamming their hands on their kitchen islands, even at risk of spilling the coffee, and screaming, \u201cDammit, when is Udall gonna come clean on Keystone??!!!!\u201d\n\nYes, Keystone. Not immigration reform. Not Obamacare. Not over-the-counter birth control. Not ISIS. Not entitlements. Not the debt. Not guns. Not NSA. Not long-term unemployment. Not equal pay for women. Not same-sex marriage. Not the economy. Not income inequality. Not Broncos-Seahawks.\n\nYou get the feeling that somebody is ripping Rove off? The last Crossroads GPS commercial I remember starred a woman called \u201cRichelle\u201d asking Udall to repeal Obamacare because the program had forced her to go back to work. Except that simple fact-checking (by KDVR\u2019s Eli Stokols) showed that she had gone back to work before there was an Obamacare because, she said, her family needed the money. Whatever financial problems her family had, they had nothing to do with Obamacare (or, just guessing, Keystone).\n\nIf you\u2019re going to make the argument that Democrats won\u2019t talk about anything but abortion rights and birth control, do you make it by talking about pipelines?\n\nMichael Bennet beat Ken Buck by 17 points among women in the last Colorado Senate race. That number underlies the thinking in every Udall ad. What the strategists understand is that personhood is not just about personhood. The reason Gardner is desperate to change the subject is that personhood stands for every issue in which so many middle class suburban women find Colorado Republicans standing somewhere in the last century.\n\nThat\u2019s why in Udall\u2019s latest commercial, he asks people \u2014 including these same Rove-targeted women, who may not, in fact, spend their lives standing in a kitchen \u2014 to check their calendars. Let\u2019s face it, that granite-top kitchen island is right out of the 1990s.\n\nMike Littwin writes for ColoradoIndependent.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Aurora Sentinel", "description": "Yes, Keystone.
