Last week Progress Colorado, headed by misogynist Alan Franklin, produced a series of heinously sexist and degrading advertisements to promote Obamacare.



One ad with a woman holding a package of birth control pills and standing next to a man reads, "Let's get physical. OMG, he's hot! Let's hope he's as easy to get as this birth control. My health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers."



Another of a young woman standing next to a male cutout says, "Hey girl. You're excited about easy access to birth control and I'm excited about getting to know you."

Today, White House Senior Communications Advisor Tara McGuinness endosed the ads on her Twitter page.

I thought the White House was fighting the "war on women?" Not only are millions of women losing their health insurance thanks to Obamacare, they're also being portrayed as simple sexual objects by progressive groups and now the White House.

In case you're wondering women, young women in particular, aren't impressed.
