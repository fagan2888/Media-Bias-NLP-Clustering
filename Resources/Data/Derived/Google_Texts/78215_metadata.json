But it has been far less aggressive in recouping hundreds of millions of dollars from fraud committed by some private Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nData obtained by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center of Public Integrity through Freedom of Information Act requests show that the government has yet to complete any audits of Medicare Advantage plans that it had planned to complete by 2014.\n\nAbout 600 private Medicare Advantage plans offer an array of supplements and alternatives to government Medicare coverage. They have about 17 million enrollees, about a third of all Medicare enrollees.\n\nAccording to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the threat of audits and a requirement of the Affordable Care Act have resulted in Medicare Advantage plans returning about $1 billion to the treasury since 2010. That\u2019s good as far as it goes, but it also indicates how much recoverable money might still be out there.\n\nYet CMS has committed to conducting only 30 audits a year \u2014 5 percent of the 600 Medicare Advantage plans \u2014 even though documents obtained by the Center for Public Integrity state that the agency has the capacity to conduct up to 80 audits each year.\n\nThose audits are all the more crucial because of the formula under which Medicare pays the Medicare Advantage plans. It includes few safeguards and one CMS memo refers to it as being akin to an \u201chonor system.\u201d\n\nHistory shows that honor rarely is adequate to protect large amounts of public money. The administration should aggressively pursue as many audits as possible of Medicare Advantage billing and spending.", "article_metadata": {"author": "By the Editorial Board", "title": "Aggressively audit Medicare Advantage plans", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By the Editorial Board", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1988103"}}, "keywords": "Editorial", "DC.subject": "Editorial", "DC.title": "Aggressively audit Medicare Advantage plans"}, "article_summary": "About 600 private Medicare Advantage plans offer an array of supplements and alternatives to government Medicare coverage.\nThose audits are all the more crucial because of the formula under which Medicare pays the Medicare Advantage plans.\nBut it has been far less aggressive in recouping hundreds of millions of dollars from fraud committed by some private Medicare Advantage plans.\nThe administration should aggressively pursue as many audits as possible of Medicare Advantage billing and spending.\nAccording to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the threat of audits and a requirement of the Affordable Care Act have resulted in Medicare Advantage plans returning about $1 billion to the treasury since 2010."}
