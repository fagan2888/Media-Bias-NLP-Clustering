Headed by former Trader Joe\u2019s president Doug Ranch, The Daily Table will attempt to educate Americans about food freshness by repackaging and selling expired products that would otherwise end up in the trash. Ranch hopes that the project will help consumers realize that a product with an October 1 \u201csell-by\u201d date won\u2019t kill them if they eat it on October 2.\n\nThe awareness effort comes in response to recent statistics indicating that about one-third of the world\u2019s food goes to waste every year. In the U.S., the number is even higher, as almost half of the inventory gets thrown out in the supply chain. Raunch believes that a new type of supermarket offering perfectly fine, expired products and discount prices will help address this problem.\n\n\u201cIt's the idea about how to bring affordable nutrition to the underserved in our cities,\u201d he said, speaking to NPR. \u201cIt basically tries to utilize this 40 percent of this food that is wasted. This is, to a large degree, either excess, overstocked, wholesome food that's thrown out by grocers, etc. ... at the end of the day because of the sell-by dates.\n\n\u201c[So we] bring this food down into a retail environment where it can become affordable nutrition,\u201d he added.\n\nRaunch envisions a hybrid between a grocery store and a restaurant. The idea, he says, is to acquire expired food from retailers and consumers, prepare it, and offer it at competitive prices comparable to those of fast food chains. Besides hot meals, locations will offer fruit and vegetables several days past the use-by date.\n\nRight now, the main obstacle is the widespread misconception that an expired product will sicken anyone who tries to eat it. Many generalize their fear of soured milk or spoiled seafood to include everything in their kitchen, habitually throwing out \u201cexpired\u201d bread, cereal, soda, condiments, and other products that are safe to eat weeks after the sell-by date. However, Raunch believes that the public will realize that the practice is nothing new.\n\n\u201cFood banks for years have done this,\u201d he said. \u201cI might say, without naming the names, one of the leading, best regarded brands in the large, national, food industry \u2014 they basically recover the food within their stores, cook it up and put it out on their hot trays the next day. That's the stuff that we're going to be talking about.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Table\u2019s first location will open in Dorchester, Mass. early next year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "expiration dates, the daily table, doug raunch trader joes, sell-by date, use-by dates", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Daily Table will acquire, prepare, and sell expired food in an effort to combat global food waste.", "title": "Selling Expired Food", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/selling-expired-food-former-president-trader-joes-hopes-daily-table-project-will-educate-consumers", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/food.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Daily Table will acquire, prepare, and sell expired food in an effort to combat global food waste.", "title": "Selling Expired Food", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/selling-expired-food-former-president-trader-joes-hopes-daily-table-project-will-educate-consumers", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/food.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/22/food.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-22T19:43:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-22T19:48:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Daily Table will acquire, prepare, and sell expired food in an effort to combat global food waste."}, "article_summary": "This is, to a large degree, either excess, overstocked, wholesome food that's thrown out by grocers, etc.\nThe Daily Table will repurpose the massive amount of \"expired\" food that goes to waste annually.\nThe idea, he says, is to acquire expired food from retailers and consumers, prepare it, and offer it at competitive prices comparable to those of fast food chains.\nRaunch believes that a new type of supermarket offering perfectly fine, expired products and discount prices will help address this problem.\nHeaded by former Trader Joe\u2019s president Doug Ranch, The Daily Table will attempt to educate Americans about food freshness by repackaging and selling expired products that would otherwise end up in the trash."}
