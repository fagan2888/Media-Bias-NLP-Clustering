The domestic realm, which became a drag on \u201cHomeland\u201d whenever the focus diverted to the offspring, has been held to the background on \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Until now.\n\nThe kids, a source of extra tension but, so far, no sentimental plot detours, are about to be drawn into the spy game.\n\nAs the award-winning \u201cAmericans\u201d returns Feb. 26 for season 2, son Henry is unknowingly dragged into one of his dad\u2019s undercover gambits and daughter Paige is increasingly curious about what her parents may be hiding.\n\nNot to worry. We\u2019re not approaching a Dana-like roadblock.\n\nThe good news is that, judging by the first five episodes, the familial focus doesn\u2019t take away from the taut storytelling.\n\nEven when extreme coincidences mar the plotting \u2014 did FBI agent Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) really need to live across the street from the undercover Russians? \u2014 creator Joe Weisberg\u2019s tale has us hooked.\n\nAs the new season begins, this series continues to be among the best of the extraordinary number of great TV dramas vying for attention.\n\nThe appeal of the couple at the heart of \u201cThe Americans\u201d can\u2019t be underestimated. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys, as Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, KGB agents in an arranged marriage, masterfully blending in with the neighbors, are credible, not to mention gorgeous (even in their endless supply of bad wigs).\n\nThe depth of the characters and the narrative sweep in season 1 was astounding. Now flashbacks to earlier relationships continue to fill in the histories and motivations. Elizabeth\u2019s uneasiness on the topic of motherhood and her relationship to her own family is increasingly coming into focus; Philip\u2019s awareness of his mostly brainwashed past and his disconnect from his actual feelings is dawning.\n\nPerhaps the best news for season 2 comes in the fourth episode when the couple\u2019s former KGB contact Claudia (Margo Martindale) returns.\n\nThe tricky balance of marital issues, secret identities, cover stories (even a cover marriage for Philip), violent action scenes, FBI politics, Russian Embassy politics \u2014 plus the kids \u2014 continue to make \u201cThe Americans\u201d a rich experience. Let\u2019s hope many, many episodes elapse before the kids get to the truth of what goes on in that laundry room.\n\nImagine, the two sides battled valiently for years without cellphones: the series is faithful to Reagan-era technology, using radio signals, hand-written number codes and drop boxes, to illustrate the world pre-GPS and internet hacking.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how often Cold Warriors had to hurry to public phone booths.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans\u201d return for season 2, Cold War spies with kids", "title": "FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans\u201d return for season 2, Cold War spies with kids", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/24/fxs-the-americans-return-for-season-2-cold-war-spies-with-kids/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140224__AMR-S1-HDGallery-_0000_1p1.jpg", "height": 364}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140224__AMR-S1-HDGallery-_0000_1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-24T09:48:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:44:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7fe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Americans,\u201d the riveting Cold War spy thriller on FX that combines period drama and action/romance, has so far avoided the misstep that tripped up \u201cHomeland,\u201d another suspenseful thriller about national security and political intrigue.\nThe kids, a source of extra tension but, so far, no sentimental plot detours, are about to be drawn into the spy game.\nLet\u2019s hope many, many episodes elapse before the kids get to the truth of what goes on in that laundry room.\nAs the new season begins, this series continues to be among the best of the extraordinary number of great TV dramas vying for attention.\nPerhaps the best news for season 2 comes in the fourth episode when the couple\u2019s former KGB contact Claudia (Margo Martindale) returns."}
