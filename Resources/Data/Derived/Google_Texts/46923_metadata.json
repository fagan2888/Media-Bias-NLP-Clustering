Samuelson writes for the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate significance of what happened in 1965 is that it gave government the major role in overseeing the health-care system, now nearly a fifth of the economy. It has been an uneasy \u2014 and unsuccessful \u2014 stewardship. Health care is intensely personal, but all those personal decisions have enormous collective consequences for the nation.
