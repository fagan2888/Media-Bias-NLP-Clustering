He mentions his favorite quote from his former high school coach: \u201cDiscipline is doing what you don\u2019t want to do when you don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about wrestling, all that\u2019s involved in it, getting your tail kicked in front of your family and in front of your peers, how dealing with all that, it\u2019s good for a person,\u201d Jordan told RealClearPolitics in an interview at the Cleveland event. \u201cSo hopefully that makes a difference in the way I try to fulfill my responsibilities as a member of Congress. I hope it means I just try to do what I told the voters I was going to do.\"\n\n\u201cDo what I told the voters I was going to do\u201d is a common refrain from Jordan, one he repeats often \u2013 including at least six times in his interview with RCP.\n\nThat attitude has helped him accrue significant influence in the House, which led to the creation of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly three dozen conservatives who have pushed congressional Republicans to the brink on a number of issues, from the 2013 government shutdown over the Affordable Care Act to the near temporary closure of the Department of Homeland Security in February over the president\u2019s immigration executive orders to the departure of Speaker John Boehner earlier this year.\n\nJordan, the group\u2019s recently re-elected chairman, has been at the center of each of those fights. His fellow Freedom Caucus members said it\u2019s a group effort but praised Jordan\u2019s ability to keep the three dozen members together. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said that Jordan keeps his opinions quiet when helpful, but steps in forcefully when needed, calling his style \u201can iron fist and a velvet glove.\u201d\n\nAsked what led to Jordan being re-elected unanimously, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) put it succinctly: \u201cWhy change the coach if you\u2019re winning?\"\n\nRep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), who ousted then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary last year, headlined a county Republican barbecue in Jordan\u2019s district last week. He said Jordan called him shortly after his election, volunteering to be his mentor, and has helped him carve out a space in the House in his short tenure. Brat said that much of the Freedom Caucus\u2019 success can be attributed to Jordan\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everything by consensus, we all get along, everyone likes everyone in the group,\u201d Brat said. \u201cWhoever the leader of that group is, when everybody likes each other \u2026 there\u2019s 40 politicians or whatever and there\u2019s no backstabbing, that\u2019s called leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Freedom Caucus\u2019s influence within the conference put them in a powerful position when Boehner announced his resignation, and their eventual support of Paul Ryan helped persuade him to take the speaker\u2019s job. Jordan praised Ryan in the interview with RCP, saying the Wisconsin lawmaker is off to a great start and is \u201cone sharp individual\u201d who\u2019s the right person to voice House Republicans\u2019 message. It\u2019s only been a month however, and major deadlines and issues lie ahead.\n\nBack in Ohio\n\nJordan\u2019s political career started in the Ohio General Assembly in 1994, where he served three terms before running for state Senate, winning the primary over a Republican that most of the state party had coalesced around. Matt Huffman, a longtime friend and political ally of Jordan\u2019s, said that while his opponent racked up high profile endorsements across the state, Jordan went door to door, meeting voters and gaining their support. He won the race and served for six years before making the leap to Congress in 2006.\n\nAt an Allen County Republican dinner last week in Lima, a city of 40,000 in Jordan\u2019s district, many of the attendees said their congressman is always visible back home. They call him a \u201cbulldog,\u201d a \u201cpit bull\u201d and a \u201cfighter.\u201d Several brought up the recent hearing of the Select Committee on Benghazi, praising Jordan\u2019s aggressive line of questioning of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cWhat I like is he does what he says he\u2019s going to do and I think that\u2019s what people are tired of in politics, just all the verbiage of people saying [things], then nothing ever happens after that, but I believe Jim Jordan [when he] says what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d said Lisa Kroehler, a small business owner from Lima.\n\nAs for being labeled a pit bull and bulldog, Jordan joked, \u201cThey could say worse things about me.\u201d\n\nHis methods have, in fact, ruffled feathers on Capitol Hill. Many in his own party, including former Speaker Boehner, have criticized Jordan and fellow conservatives for being unrealistic about halting the Affordable Care Act or blocking executive orders using government funding, calling the strategies unhelpful and damaging to the party.\n\nIn 2013, just prior to the government shutdown over the ACA, a strategy that Jordan and other Freedom Caucus members supported (though the group had not yet formed), Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) labeled them \"lemmings with suicide vests.\"\n\nBoehner, shortly after announcing his retirement to avoid another protracted battle over government spending, this time with defunding Planned Parenthood as the goal, didn't specifically criticize the Freedom Caucus, but said some Republican members were unrealistic about what could be achieved.\n\n\"The Bible says, beware of false prophets. And there are people out there spreading noise about how much can get done,\" Boehner said, adding that the shutdown strategy to get rid of Obamacare in 2013 \"never had a chance.\"\n\n\"We have got groups here in town, members of the House and Senate here in town, who whip people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things that they know, they know, are never going to happen.\"\n\nIn Lima, the heart of Jordan\u2019s district, the message is a little different.\n\n\u201cBack home here, I get the complete opposite of his critics,\u201d said Allen County GOP Chair Keith Cheney. \u201cI get the \u2018Hey, way to go Jim,\u2019 \u2018Glad he\u2019s hanging in there for us, glad he\u2019s standing firm with us.\u2019 That\u2019s the way his constituents back home believe.\"\n\nMoving Forward\n\nJordan and his fellow Freedom Caucus members are pleased with the changes coming from Ryan, including shuffling the panel that selects committee assignments for members, opening up the floor for amendment votes and consulting with individual members on big policy decisions.\n\nJordan, who was friendly with Ryan before his colleague became speaker, said he\u2019s been \u201cgreat\u201d so far, and praised Ryan\u2019s decision to get out in front on messaging, increasing his media presence and being a voice for House Republicans.\n\nJordan and Ryan have a similar vision for major policy proposals: significant tax reform, an Obamacare replacement plan, welfare reform and others. These ideas likely won\u2019t pass the Senate and almost certainly won\u2019t be signed into law by President Obama, but will allow House Republicans to set the tone on major policies in a presidential election year.\n\n\u201cDemonstrating how we would do things different, I think that\u2019s critical,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if we could pass them in the House, they probably won\u2019t get 60 votes in the Senate, but at least it\u2019s out there helping frame the debate.\u201d\n\nFirst, however, they\u2019ll have to get through next week. Government funding runs out on Dec. 11 and Congress will have to pass an omnibus appropriations bill before then to keep the lights on. Though the spending levels are set by the budget deal from earlier this year, policy riders \u2013 defunding Planned Parenthood and blocking Syrian refugees, among others \u2013 could throw a wrinkle into the process.\n\nJordan said there will need to be \u201csignificant policy changes\u201d to get conservative members on board with the increases in spending, though it remains unclear at this point what will actually be added to the bill next week.\n\nRepublicans hope to avoid the contentious and divisive past fights over government funding. One key to keeping things from blowing up this time is communication between conference factions.\n\nIt starts with weekly lunches featuring Ryan, Jordan, fellow Freedom Caucus member Mulvaney, moderate Reps. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) and Bob Dold (R-Ill.), and Ryan allies Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas and Tom Price (R-Ga.).\n\nBrendan Buck, a spokesman for Ryan, said the lunches are designed to keep the lines of communication open and to make sure there are no surprises on where different factions of the conference stand.\n\n\u201cI think when everybody understands where everybody is coming from it makes it easier to get the type of outcomes we\u2019re all seeking,\u201d Buck told RCP. \u201cThe speaker understands that Mr. Jordan has a lot of credibility and he\u2019s earned it, and there are people who are going to look to him for clues on which way to go on things and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we\u2019re working together as a team on these things.\u201d\n\nBuck said that Jordan\u2019s buy-in will lend credibility to Ryan\u2019s vision for the conference to draft major policy proposals and try to set the agenda.\n\nNext year will mark a decade on Capitol Hill for the Ohio lawmaker, who said he plans on staying in the House for now. He says he likes the camaraderie within the Freedom Caucus and his committees, where he\u2019s grouped around like-minded people with similar goals.\n\nSo what are his expectations for the Freedom Caucus next year?\n\n\u201cStay focused on the goal, and the goal is, all the people who feel like Washington has forgotten \u2019em,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cStay focused on doing what we told them we were going to do so that they don\u2019t think the town has forgotten them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "CLEVELAND \u2013 Jim Jordan is in his element.\nThe fifth-term congressman from Ohio stands on stage last Tuesday in an upstairs room of Hofbruhaus, a German microbrewery downtown, speaking at a...", "title": "Jim Jordan Vows to Keep Pushing House GOP | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/12/03/jim_jordan_vows_to_keep_pushing_house_gop_128910.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/333492_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CLEVELAND \u2013 Jim Jordan is in his element.\nThe fifth-term congressman from Ohio stands on stage last Tuesday in an upstairs room of Hofbruhaus, a German microbrewery downtown, speaking at a...", "title": "Jim Jordan Vows to Keep Pushing House GOP | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Jim Jordan Vows to Keep Pushing House GOP | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "House Republicans,Jim Jordan,Freedom Caucus,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15d5\"", "article_summary": "His fellow Freedom Caucus members said it\u2019s a group effort but praised Jordan\u2019s ability to keep the three dozen members together.\nSo what are his expectations for the Freedom Caucus next year?\nHe says he likes the camaraderie within the Freedom Caucus and his committees, where he\u2019s grouped around like-minded people with similar goals.\nIt starts with weekly lunches featuring Ryan, Jordan, fellow Freedom Caucus member Mulvaney, moderate Reps.
