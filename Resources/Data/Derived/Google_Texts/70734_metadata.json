Rumors Swirl About Monday's Big Speech\n\nUnlike the Democrats, the GOP really does have a strong bench this electoral season, especially once you get past a hopeless Rinosaur like Jeb Bush, fringe candidates like Rand Paul and no-hoper retreads like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, Wisconsin's Scott Walker has already made an impressive splash; now Texas conservative firebrand Ted Cruz may be ready to throw his hat into the ring:\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz is set to deliver a speech on Monday at Liberty University that is stirring speculation about a possible presidential announcement. Allies to the likely GOP 2016 hopeful are reaching out to political reporters and encouraging them to attend what they\u2019re billing as a major address at the evangelical school about 150 miles from D.C.
