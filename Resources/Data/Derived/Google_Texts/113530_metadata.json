The rating agency expects outpatient volume growth to outpace inpatient admissions in 2016, as for-profit hospital operators invest in urgent care centers and ambulatory care centers.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act is changing hospital operators' investment decisions and leading them to acquire and invest in outpatient facilities in the markets and networks in which they operate,\" said Dean Diaz, a Moody's senior vice president.\n\nMoody's also noted that for-profit hospital operators' earnings could be constrained by the pending acquisition of Cigna by Anthem and Humana by Aetna.\n\n\"Consolidation among health insurers will increase their scale and bargaining power, which could ultimately reduce reimbursement rates for hospitals,\" said Mr. Diaz. \"To maintain their bargaining power, consolidation could increase among hospital providers, but this could also force the exit of providers in markets where they lack negotiating leverage.\"\n\nMore articles on healthcare finance:\n\nHow CHS, Tenet, UHS, LifePoint and HCA fared in Q4\n\n3 ways hospitals can increase profitability in 2016\n\nMayo operating income dips 36.9% as expenses rise\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
