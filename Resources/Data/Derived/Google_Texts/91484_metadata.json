To adapt the tool to assisted living, project organizers chose components identified as most relevant for seniors in assisted living. Key elements were the STOP and WATCH and SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendations) communication tools, as well as advance care planning resources, according to a press release.\n\n\u201cThe program worked because it combines the observation and timely reporting of health changes with the STOP and WATCH tool,\u201d Kevin O\u2019Neil, Brookdale\u2019s chief medical officer and pilot project co-director, said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe development and implementation of a comprehensive care transition management technology platform was another crucial component of the pilot, O\u2019Neil said. The training of complete community teams on how to use INTERACT was also key, O\u2019Neil said, explaining that Brookdale educated every associate\u2014from caregivers to bus drivers to wait staff\u2014because they all work with Brookdale residents on a daily basis.\n\nUnder Affordable Care Act policies, hospitals have started to see Medicare payments reduced if too many patients are readmitted. That and other policies are positioning assisted living and other senior care providers as valuable partners to hospitals and health systems\u2014if they can successfully keep residents from transferring to the acute care setting.\n\n\u201cThe pilot\u2019s results demonstrate the important role that assisted living can serve in containing health care costs while providing greater quality of life to seniors,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cAssisted living offers the tremendous benefit of a home-like environment. With the availability of onsite home health and therapy services and appropriately trained staff, assisted living can be a lower-cost care option than skilled nursing.\u201d\n\nBrookdale is currently examining implementing the program into more of its assisted living facilities.\n\nWritten by Mary Kate Nelson", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "brookdale senior living, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "The nation\u2019s largest senior living provider previously announced it reduced hospitalizations and cut costs\u00a0during its pilot of a checklist tool in assisted living\u2014and now it has shared some new numbers demonstrating its success.
