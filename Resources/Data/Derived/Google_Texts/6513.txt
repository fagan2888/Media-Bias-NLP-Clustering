NEW YORK — How close did CVS Health's Helena Foulkes come to breaking the mold in sports journalism a la Phyllis George? Fortune magazine on Friday featured Foulkes in a “3 questions” segment where Foulkes shares what feeds her drive for consumer healthcare.

Foulkes is No. 14 on Fortune's list of "Most Powerful Women," serving as a change agent for one of the largest consumer facings for healthcare.

Foulkes is setting the stage for CVS Health to be a key player in an evolving healthcare paradigm that will “empower the consumer to be in control of her own healthcare,” she told Fortune.
