When former top CIA attorney John Rizzo appeared on NBC’s “Today” show on Friday to talk about his memoir, “Company Man,” he found himself being interrogated by chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell.

Mitchell described the book as “an insider’s account of the CIA” that exposed “key decisions that led to waterboarding and other controversial techniques that were later outlawed.”

“All from this veteran CIA lawyer who offers no apologies and few regrets,” she said.

Rizzo worked as an influential attorney with the CIA during the post-9/11 era, when interrogation methods were often considered controversial.

“Extraordinary measures had to be taken,” Rizzo said.

Mitchell’s contempt was obvious throughout the interview.

“Extraordinary measures?” she said. “You mean what was later decided to be torture?”

But Rizzo, who said throughout the interview that he had no regrets, didn’t flinch.

“No,” he said. “If it had been torture, we wouldn’t have done it.”

Mitchell continued to grill him with obvious disdain, asking, “How can you live with yourself knowing that what you did and what you got approved by the Justice Department was to many people, not only morally repugnant, but illegal?”

“Looking back on the times and what I had to do, my conscience is clear,” Rizzo said.
