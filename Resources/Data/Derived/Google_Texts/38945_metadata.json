Of course, everyone knows that the writing of this mess has been an on-going process for liberals for decades and it just didn\u0092t get written after Obama\u0092s election.\n\nIf Obamacare is so great, then why did the President have to buy off many of his liberal voting blocks and special interest groups by giving them waivers so they do not have to participate in this great program? That fact all by itself speaks volumes to just how bad this legislation really is!\n\nThis socialist power grab/mess should apply to everyone or it should apply to no one! Every waiver that has been given for political purposes should be revoked... Every single one of them, but especially those that have been given to federal employees, bureaucrats and our elected officials!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis disaster should apply to everyone \u0097 including the president and his family \u0097 or it should be thrown out!\n\nJEFFREY SCOTT\n\n\n\nTroy", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Letters, Letters news, Macomb Letters news, MI Letters news, US Letters news, world Letters news.", "title": "Obamacare an example of partisan politics", "og": {"url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20131007/NEWS/131009663", "image": {"width": "363px", "identifier": "http://www.macombdaily.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MD/20131007/NEWS/131009663/AR/0/AR-131009663.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "330px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare an example of partisan politics"}, "twitter": {"domain": "macombdaily.com", "description": "Mr. Chad Selweski stated that \u0093Obamacare the myth has become Obamacare the reality.\u0094 I would differ in that statement and say the myth of Obamacare has become a forced disaster that will only grow in its economic meltdown affect.", "title": "Obamacare an example of partisan politics", "url": "http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20131007/NEWS/131009663", "image": {"src": "http://www.macombdaily.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MD/20131007/NEWS/131009663/AR/0/AR-131009663.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@macombdaily", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551763849", "iphone": "id520209090", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.macombdaily"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Letters, Letters news, Macomb Letters news, MI Letters news, US Letters news, world Letters news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Mr. Chad Selweski stated that \u0093Obamacare the myth has become Obamacare the reality.\u0094 I would differ in that statement and say the myth of Obamacare has become a forced disaster that will only grow in its economic meltdown affect."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae18\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Chad Selweski stated that \u0093Obamacare the myth has become Obamacare the reality.\u0094 I would differ in that statement and say the myth of Obamacare has become a forced disaster that will only grow in its economic meltdown affect.\nThis socialist power grab/mess should apply to everyone or it should apply to no one!\nAdvertisementThis disaster should apply to everyone \u0097 including the president and his family \u0097 or it should be thrown out!\nThat fact all by itself speaks volumes to just how bad this legislation really is!\nIf Obamacare is so great, then why did the President have to buy off many of his liberal voting blocks and special interest groups by giving them waivers so they do not have to participate in this great program?"}
