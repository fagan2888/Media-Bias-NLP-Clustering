As the Department of Health and Human Services ties 50 percent of Medicare payments to value by 2018, about 59 percent of Humana's individual Medicare Advantage members have access to primary care physicians who are part of value-based relationships, it said. The goal is to raise that number to 75 percent by the end of 2017, Humana said.

"Putting the physician/patient relationship at the center of care, combined with the transformative power of the value-based reimbursement model, is helping people with Medicare Advantage achieve their best health," said Bruce Broussard, Humana's President and Chief Executive Officer.
