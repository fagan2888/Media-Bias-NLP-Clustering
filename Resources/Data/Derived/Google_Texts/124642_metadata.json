WMTW NEWS EIGHT POLITICAL REPORTER PAUL MERRILL REPORTS. \"The last time a Republican held Maine's Second Congressional District seat was 20 years ago when Olympia Snowe left it to go serve in the United States Senate. Since then, it has been held by Democrats: first, John Baldacci and, then, Mike Michaud. With Michaud taking a run at the Blaine House this year, Bruce Poliquin is hoping to take this district back for the GOP.\" -NATS- POLIQUIN BRINGS A HIGH-ENERGY INTENSITY TO HIS CAMPAIGN FOR CONGRESS. Congressional Candidate:) \"We need to make sure we get the pieces right in Maine and the pieces right in Washington to have less wasteful government spending, less debt, lower taxes, fewer regulations, and cheaper energy.\" DURING OUR CONVERSATION, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE WAS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE JABS AT HIS DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT; HE DID SO REPEATEDLY. Congressional Candidate:) \"But career politicians like my opponent, Emily Cain, they're trained to bicker and to point fingers.\" Congressional Candidate:) \"Problems, frankly, were created by extreme liberals like my opponent, Emily Cain.\" Congressional Candidate:) \"She doesn't understand Maine. She's not from Maine. She's too extreme for Maine.\" WE ASKED POLIQUIN ABOUT THE UNPROVOKED ATTACKS ON HIS ADVERSARY. Congressional Candidate:) \"I don't look at that as an attack. I look at that as being a very clear contrast.\" POLIQUIN IS 60 YEARS OLD AND LIVES IN OAKLAND.

WHILE WALL STREET INVESTORS PLAYED A ROLE IN CAUSING THE RECESSION, POLIQUIN DOESN'T SEE HIS BACKGROUND IN FINANCE AS A LIABILITY IN THIS CAMPAIGN. Congressional Candidate:) \"Not only were the people in the financial business to blame but the regulators in Washington - career politicians who created those rules - were to blame also.\" AS RECENTLY AS THIS SUMMER, POLIQUIN HAD BEEN PUSHING TO REPEAL AND REPLACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, BUT, SINCE WINNING THE PRIMARY, HE'S MOVED TO THE MIDDLE ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE.

CARE. Congressional Candidate:) \"Obamacare is the law of the land. We need to make sure that we address this healthcare issue, which is very complicated, for all Americans. There are parts of Obamacare that work that we should keep. There are other parts that we really to focus on to replace.\" A BIG PART OF WHY POLIQUIN'S RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IS TO HELP PAVE THE PATH FORWARD FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE HIS SON, SAM. Congressional Candidate:) \"My vision for our Second District and for Maine and for America is a more limited government that doesn't waste money and starts paying down its debt, has lower taxes, lower energy costs, lower health insurance premiums. That will encourage businesses to invest, create more jobs, so our families in the Second District can stay here and their kids can stay here and make it.\" \"Tomorrow night, our political focus shifts statewide as we take a look at the contest for the United States Senate.
