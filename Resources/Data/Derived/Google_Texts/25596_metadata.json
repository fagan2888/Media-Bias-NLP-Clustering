In response, I have introduced legislation to hit the brakes on runaway legislation: the Read the Bill Act. At a minimum, our constituents expect Members of Congress to read and understand legislation before taking a vote. The public also needs sufficient time to in order to communicate with their representatives.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe justifiable backlash from conservatives against the Omnibus has reinvigorated calls for House GOP leadership to restore \u201cregular order\u201d to funding the government: twelve spending bills brought forward one-by-one under open-amendment rules. Regular order is a first step toward restoring legislative sanity, but real process reform requires a \u201csafety valve\u201d which prevents leadership from jamming through massive bills at the last minute.\n\nCurrently, the House operates under the so-called \u201cThree Day Rule.\u201d This rule supposedly prevents a bill from being brought to the floor and voted on in the same day.\n\nThe public mistakenly thinks the Three Day Rule gives Members a minimum of 72 hours to review bills. House Leadership, however, often \u201ccomplies\u201d by introducing controversial legislation late Tuesday night and holding votes Thursday morning. Even so, sometimes Leadership overrides the fake Three Day Rule by passing a so-called \u201cMartial Law\u201d rule to allow same-day consideration of any bill. Only in Washington D.C. can politicians write a new rule to override another rule which they (temporarily) don\u2019t want to follow.\n\nWe saw the fake Three Day Rule in operation with the Omnibus.\n\nHouse Leadership introduced the Omnibus at 2:00 AM on Wednesday, December 16 and we voted that Friday at 10:00 AM. In other words, we had only 56 hours to review 2,000 pages of legislation. My bill would stop this madness first by requiring 24 hours review time for every 100 pages of legislative text with a guaranteed minimum of 72 hours for every bill.\n\nIt also clarifies that \u201chours\u201d means \u201cworking\u201d hours so Leadership can\u2019t run the clock during weekends and days when Congress is out of session. The longer the bill, the more time Members and the public would have to understand what\u2019s in it. These time requirements would have forced House Leadership to wait a calendar month between dropping the 2,000 page Omnibus and scheduling the final passage vote. I have no doubt the Omnibus would have died if the public had a full week to rally against it, let alone 30 days.\n\nTo ensure Leadership\u2019s compliance, the Read the Bill Act includes an enforcement procedure which would invalidate any law passed using fast-track procedures. It creates a cause of action for Members \u2013 or even taxpayers \u2013 to sue and make sure such laws have no force or effect.\n\nReading 100 pages a day doesn\u2019t seem like much.\n\nHowever, actually understanding legislative text is equivalent to deciphering hieroglyphics. It\u2019s not just the length of bills, but also their sheer complexity \u2013 riddled with mind-numbing jargon, legalese, and bureaucratic gobbledygook \u2013 which keeps everybody in the dark.\n\nFor example, two seemingly innocuous short provisions in the Omnibus (Sections 601 and 602) give a partial bailout for Puerto Rico. Of course, these two sections don\u2019t say: \u201cU.S. mainland taxpayers shall provide an $865 million bailout to Puerto Rico.\u201d Instead, the Omnibus legislative text amends eight paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses and sub-clauses in a completely different bill \u2013 the (amended) Social Security Act of 1935 \u2013 and three other obscure provisions in the 2009 Obama stimulus bill to achieve the same purpose.\n\nAnalyzing half-page provisions shouldn\u2019t take hours and a law degree. We don\u2019t just need more time; we need bills that are readable. Members cannot do their jobs without readable legislation, nor can our constituents hold us accountable.\n\nThe Read the Bill Act requires that all bills include a comparative print which shows changes made to all other laws. Comparative prints are similar to the \u201ctrack changes\u201d functions used in everyday word processing programs. The House is already moving toward mandating more readable legislation. In fact, new House Rules already require comparative print appendices, but only for bills passed out of committees. The Read the Bill Act expands the existing readable legislation requirement to all legislation considered on the floor \u2013 even 2,000 page bills drafted in secret with zero committee involvement.\n\nI encourage my House colleagues to join with me to start a better process which would, in turn, lead to better legislation: short, readable, and with plenty of time to digest it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Read the Bill Act would require 24 hours review time for every 100 pages of legislative text and a minimum of 72 hours for every bill.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Read the Bill Act would require 24 hours review time for every 100 pages of legislative text and a minimum of 72 hours for every bill.", "title": "The 'Read the Bill Act' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/AP_499493035655.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/06/the-read-the-bill-act/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Read the Bill Act would require 24 hours review time for every 100 pages of legislative text and a minimum of 72 hours for every bill.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/AP_499493035655.jpg", "title": "The 'Read the Bill Act' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, gang of eight, laws, omnibus, regular order,Big Government,Read the Bill Act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "regular order", "published_time": "2016-01-06T13:23:01-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In response, I have introduced legislation to hit the brakes on runaway legislation: the Read the Bill Act.\nThe Read the Bill Act requires that all bills include a comparative print which shows changes made to all other laws.\nTo ensure Leadership\u2019s compliance, the Read the Bill Act includes an enforcement procedure which would invalidate any law passed using fast-track procedures.\nThe Read the Bill Act expands the existing readable legislation requirement to all legislation considered on the floor \u2013 even 2,000 page bills drafted in secret with zero committee involvement.\nAt a minimum, our constituents expect Members of Congress to read and understand legislation before taking a vote."}
