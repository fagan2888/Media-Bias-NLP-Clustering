The Democrat was perhaps best known for shepherding through bipartisan campaign finance reform, and casting the lone \u201cno\u201d vote against the Patriot Act, after the 9-11 attacks.\n\nFeingold served three terms, until Republican Ron Johnson, a wealthy Oshkosh business owner, won the office in November 2010. It was two years into Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, and the country remained in the grips of the Great Recession. Johnson was among the Republicans campaigning against the president\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cWe need to restore fiscal sanity to this nation. Certainly one of the ways we can restore fiscal sanity is to repeal the health care bill,\u201d Johnson said at his victory party.\n\nThe same evening, in Feingold\u2019s concession speech, he promised supporters he would not disappear from the political landscape.\n\n\u201cI hope and I intend to continue to work with all of you in future as much as possible. It\u2019s on to the next fight,\u201d Feingold said.\n\nFeingold remained in public service, as an envoy to Africa for president Obama. Yet the former senator stayed largely out of the public eye. That changed, with his campaign announcement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMy desire to serve is stronger than ever,\u201d Feingold said in a video to supporters. He added: \u201cPeople tell me all the time that our politics in Washington are broken and that multi-millionaires, billionaires, and big corporations are calling all the shots.\u201d Feingold says he\u2019d restore independence and bipartisanship to the Senate.\n\nSen. Johnson\u2019s campaign website labels Feingold a career politician, who would contribute to Washington\u2019s problems.\n\nJohnson has made a name for himself as chair of the Senate homeland security committee. He\u2019s championed border security, and called on the United States to better protect itself from terrorist threats.\n\nJohnson also touted his reputation in an interview posted on YouTube in February, asking: \u201cDo you want to send (to Washington) somebody like myself who\u2019s a citizen legislator, somebody who comes from the private sector, understands it\u2019s in the private sector where long-lasting, self-sustaining, good-paying jobs are really created?\u201d\n\nUW-Madison political science professor David Canon notes that both candidates are trying to portray the other as the political insider. He thinks their campaigns also will focus on the economy, national security and the Affordable Care Act, with Johnson weighing in firmly on the right, and Feingold, on the left.\n\nCanon expects the issues to evolve over the months, in the wake of national and global events.\n\n\u201cSay there\u2019s another major economic crisis, there could be another terrorist attack. Any one of those things could emerge as a top issue that right now we\u2019re not thinking of,\u201d Canon says.\n\nWhat may be more notable than the issues, however, is the timing of the race. That\u2019s according to Christopher Murray, of Marquette University\u2019s Les Aspin Center for Government in Washington, DC. Murray says the contest will take place in a presidential election year, likely favoring Feingold.\n\n\u201cMidterm elections advantage Republican candidates and presidential elections advantage Democratic candidates, by virtue of who the different types of people are who show up,\u201d Murray says.\n\nMurray says the other factor of note in the race is how it fits into the national political picture. Republicans grabbed control of the Senate last year by just a few seats. Johnson\u2019s is expected to be one of six that Democrats pursue in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "The outcome of next year\u2019s battle between former senator Russ Feingold and incumbent Ron Johnson could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
