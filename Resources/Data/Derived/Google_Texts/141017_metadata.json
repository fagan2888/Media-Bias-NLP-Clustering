The vote follows one last year which approved British airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq. Prior to that, in 2013, Parliament voted down proposed airstrikes against Syrian government positions.\n\nThe defense minister, Michael Fallon, said British fighter jets hit seven targets among oilfields in eastern Syria, dealing a \"severe blow\" to ISIS, while Cameron warned his country of a lengthy anti-ISIS campaign. \"It is complex and it is difficult what we are asking our pilots to do,\" Cameron said, \"and our thoughts should be with them and their families as they commence this important work.\"\n\nThe British government, like the U.S., insists the Assad government in Syria be replaced by \"a new Syrian state including some of those who are fighting it helping on the ground,\" as Fallon explained today.\n\nActivists in the Syrian city of Raqqa, which serves as the de facto capital of ISIS and which the UK says would not yet be targeted in airstrikes, said they fear civilian casualties from the British campaign, while the Royal Air Force insists there would be no civilian casualties from its operations in Syria. \"In over 400 airstrikes that the RAF has carried out in Iraq, we have had absolutely no civilian casualties reported,\" Captain Richard Davies, who also said he was \"absolutely confident\" there would be no civilian casualties in Syria, insisted in a BBC interview.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Cameron says the airstrikes would keep Britain safe.", "title": "United Kingdom Bombing ISIS in Syria, RAF Captain 'Absolutely Confident' There Would Be No Civilian Casualties", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/03/united-kingdom-bombing-isis-in-syria-raf", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14491643308734.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cameron says the airstrikes would keep Britain safe.", "title": "United Kingdom Bombing ISIS in Syria, RAF Captain 'Absolutely Confident' There Would Be No Civilian Casualties", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14491643308734.jpg", "creator": "@edkrayewski", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "War on Terror", "published_time": "2015-12-03T17:49:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ed-krayewski"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "\"In over 400 airstrikes that the RAF has carried out in Iraq, we have had absolutely no civilian casualties reported,\" Captain Richard Davies, who also said he was \"absolutely confident\" there would be no civilian casualties in Syria, insisted in a BBC interview.\nAirstrikes began shortly after the parliamentary vote, which approved airstrikes only against ISIS targets in Syria.\nThe vote follows one last year which approved British airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq.\nPrior to that, in 2013, Parliament voted down proposed airstrikes against Syrian government positions.\nThe British ambassador to the United Nations informed the Security Council of the country's decision today, saying it fell within the parameters of Security Council Resolution 2249."}
