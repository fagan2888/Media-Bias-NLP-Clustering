The new record had yet to be given a title or release date, spurring the singer to denounce the leaks as \u201ca form of terrorism\u201d and \u201cartistic rape.\u201d She\u2019s now taken matters into her own hands, revealing the album\u2019s title\u2014 Rebel Heart \u2014and releasing for download six brand-new, completed songs as an \u201cearly Christmas gift\u201d to fans.\n\nOf course, some of these tracks aren\u2019t actually new given the leaks, but half of those leaks were barely finished and the other half won\u2019t be on Rebel Heart at all. The officially released songs feature a murderer\u2019s row of producers\u2014Diplo, Avicii, and Kanye West, to name a few\u2014and suggest a very dance-heavy record, with plenty of vocal reverb and jagged EDM beats. Still, despite the club-friendly sound, it\u2019s the country-tinged \u201cDevil Pray\u201d and reggae-influenced \u201cUnapologetic Bitch\u201d that stand out.
