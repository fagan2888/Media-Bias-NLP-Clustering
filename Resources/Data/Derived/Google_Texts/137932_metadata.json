Reuters/Lucas Jackson/Files\n\n(Reuters Health) - A therapeutic program of weight-bearing exercise reduces pain and improves joint function, at least for two to six months, for people with osteoarthritis, according to a review of previous trials.\n\n\u201cWe had a systematic review for Cochrane from 2008 and 2009, but there were much less articles,\u201d said Dr. Martin Van der Esch, who coauthored the review. Since then, many more studies have been published, and confirm the benefits of exercise for arthritis pain, he told Reuters Health by phone.\n\nOsteoarthritis, the breakdown of joint cartilage over time, causes pain, swelling and reduced motion, usually of the hands, knees, hips or spine. Joint injury, excess weight and older age increase the risk for osteoarthritis, which affects more than 50 million adults in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor the new Cochrane review, Van der Esch, of the Reade Centre for Rehabilitation and Rheumatology in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and colleagues analyzed 55 randomized controlled trials comparing a land-based exercise program with no exercise among subjects with osteoarthritis. The trials varied in type, duration and intensity of exercise programs.\n\nIn general, the exercise programs significantly reduced pain and moderately improved physical function of the knee immediately after treatment. Some studies also found that general quality of life improved.\n\nTwelve studies followed up with participants two to six months later and found that knee pain was still reduced, as the authors explain in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive that exercising a painful joint could reduce pain, Van der Esch said.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that if you have more muscle strength, then the knee is more stable and you have less wear and tear,\u201d he explained.\n\nLand-based, weight-bearing exercise strengthens the muscles around the knee, he said.\n\n\u201cAvoiding activities because of pain leads you to lose more muscle strength and have muscle weakness and unstable joints, so more wear and tear,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOften people believe that activity \u2018wears out\u2019 joints, and patients can sometimes experience (a worsening) of symptoms after exercise or activity,\u201d said Danielle A.W.M. van der Windt, an arthritis expert at Keele University in Staffordshire, U.K.\n\nBut \u201cthe vast majority of people will not have any adverse reaction to controlled, supervised exercise, and people with significant osteoarthritis can ride a bicycle, go swimming or exercise at a gym with often minimal discomfort,\u201d she told Reuters Health by email.\n\nVan der Windt was not part of the new review.\n\nOutside of exercise, the only real treatments for osteoarthritis are simple painkillers or, in severe cases, joint replacement surgery, Van der Esch said.\n\nSome recent studies suggest that exercise could be as effective as medication for pain relief, and exercise has no pharmaceutical side effects, he said.\n\n\u201cIn the review we couldn\u2019t find really specific exercises that are best, the type of exercise program is not really most important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important factor is exercising regularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cInternationally we always say you have to move at least 30 minutes per day,\u201d he said.\n\nWater-based exercise does improve fitness, which has some benefit, but doesn\u2019t put a load directly on the knee itself so is less beneficial than land-based exercise, he said.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1N4xd80 British Journal of Sports Medicine, online September 24, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config":
