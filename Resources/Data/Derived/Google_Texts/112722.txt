For Gail Newton, she said Republican Presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson had a personal impact on her family's life.

"My great nephew, he did surgery on him in 2007. He was 6 months old," Newton said. "So, my little great nephew sent Dr. Carson a picture of him now and short little note."

Newton joined hundreds of others from all around the area who came out to Panama City Sunday for a book signing with Carson.

As national polls show he's one of the front runners for the Republican Party, he plans to stick with a campaign style that he says is working for him.

"My campaign strategy is simply to tell the truth and to talk about things that are important to this nation, and particularly for the children and the grandchildren," Carson said at the book signing.

For Al Ramsey, he called the moment an opportunity he said is uncommmon for Bay County.

"I would definitely say it was one of those things you'd want to do in your lifetime," Ramsey said. "If it's somebody you're really passionate about, they don't come around very often. So, when you see someone who fits your ideology of what we need to do to fix this country, it's worth waiting in line for a few hours."

And for newton, she said it ultimately gave her an opportunity to show not only her political support, but also her gratitude.

"I thank him from the bottom of my heart for saving my little great nephew's life, and from my whole family," Newton said. "He really touched each and every one of us."

Carson will be in Tallahassee Monday, and will continue to make stops throughout the state.
