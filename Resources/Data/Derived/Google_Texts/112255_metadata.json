Without consulting each other beforehand, they sprinted for the water. The flailing woman was separated from her two young children by about 10 yards.\n\n\u201cBy the time we got there, one other guy was holding the mother up,\u201d Norton says. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he came into the picture, but he was just barely able to keep her head above water. Jesse and I grabbed the mother, and Dan and the other guy each grabbed a kid.\u201d\n\nAccording to Norton, the woman was so weakened by the ordeal that she was unable to stand up even after he and Sandole returned her to knee-deep water. \u201cWe literally carried her onto the beach,\u201d he says. Paramedics arrived a few minutes later.\n\nNow 26, Norton believes he was a more capable swimmer a few years ago. But the rescue was powered by adrenaline. \u201cMy adrenaline was going so much, I was asking Jesse afterward where he was,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Norton never learned the woman\u2019s name, he\u2019s confident she weathered the incident without sustaining any serious physical harm. And, he adds, \u201cit\u2019s pretty apparent that she was probably not from here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "167 Raw owners save woman from drowning, Blogs, \r\nBlogsFP LatestNews, \r\nFood, \r\nRaskin Around, \r\nRaskin Around, 167 Raw", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The same familiarity with the seashore that informs the lobster roll and fish taco at 167 Raw may have saved a woman\u2019s life earlier this month.", "title": "167 Raw owners save woman from drowning", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150525/150529901/167-raw-owners-save-woman-from-drowning", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150525/PC0301/150529901/AR/0/AR-150529901.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150525/PC0301/150529901/AR/0/AR-150529901.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The same familiarity with the seashore that informs the lobster roll and fish taco at 167 Raw may have saved a woman\u2019s life earlier this month.", "title": "167 Raw owners save woman from drowning", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150525/PC0301/150529901/AR/0/AR-150529901.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150529901}}, "keywords": "167 Raw owners save woman from drowning , Blogs, \r\nBlogsFP LatestNews, \r\nFood, \r\nRaskin Around, \r\nRaskin Around, 167 Raw", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-25T05:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T19:40:00Z", "author": "Hanna Raskin"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The same familiarity with the seashore that informs the lobster roll and fish taco at 167 Raw may have saved a woman\u2019s life earlier this month."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15c9\"", "article_summary": "Norton, Sandole and Sandole\u2019s cousin, Dan Sampsonis, were at a friend\u2019s house when they heard a woman screaming.\nThe same familiarity with the seashore that informs the lobster roll and fish taco at 167 Raw may have saved a woman\u2019s life earlier this month.\nWhile Norton never learned the woman\u2019s name, he\u2019s confident she weathered the incident without sustaining any serious physical harm.\n\u201cBy the time we got there, one other guy was holding the mother up,\u201d Norton says.\nThe flailing woman was separated from her two young children by about 10 yards."}
