With that in mind Monday, what was so bright about the Broncos\u2019 future that drew the veteran defensive tackle to sign with Denver?\n\n\u201cI am excited. Every piece that you need is on this team, and I know what (coach Gary) Kubiak, (defensive line coach) Bill (Kollar) and (defensive coordinator) Wade (Phillips) can do with a good quarterback and good offense. It will be a dangerous combination,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI believe wholeheartedly we have a chance of making the last dance.\u201d\n\nWhen the Oakland Raiders released Smith last week, Kollar called him as soon as the news scrolled across the bottom of his TV screen. Problem was Kollar had an old number. The Broncos talked to Smith later that night, accelerating a process that resulted in a one-year, $2-million contract.\n\nSmith, 33, brings experience and durability. He played 791 snaps last season. In Denver, a little less time could lead to more production. Kollar told Smith he views him as a pass-rushing weapon in the nickel package. Given the league\u2019s aerial pyrotechnics, Smith will play a critical role, forcing teams to decide whether they can double team Von Miller or DeMarcus Ware on the outside.\n\n\u201cThe best friend of an inside (pass rusher) is ends who can get off the edge and rush up field,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBoth outside and inside guys can have excellent seasons helping each other. Kollar told me he watched the film, and he knows I can still get after the quarterback.\u201d\n\nIn Smith, the Broncos also added a locker-room rudder. This can\u2019t be ignored in an offseason when leaders Terrance Knighton, Jacob Tamme, Rahim Moore and Mitch Unrein signed elsewhere. Smith will be surrounded by relatively inexperienced players \u2014 Sylvester Williams, Derek Wolfe and Marvin Austin \u2014 whom the team is counting on heavily to improve.\n\n\u201cAnything they need from me \u2014 advice, help. \u2026 I\u2019m an open book. \u2026 I take pride in teaching the craft,\u201d Smith said. \u201c(After having mentors in Arizona) I always kind of vowed that I would be that kind of guy. I am not going to not educate you because one day you may take my job. I don\u2019t keep secrets.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
