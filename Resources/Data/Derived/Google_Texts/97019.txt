A Topeka health care system has become the first in Kansas to join a partnership with Minnesota's renowned Mayo Clinic.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports patients of Stormont-Vail Healthcare can benefit from the expertise of the Mayo Clinic's doctors without having to travel hundreds of miles.

The Mayo Clinic is a destination for people with unusual and complex medical conditions because of its extensive research. Its Mayo Clinic Care Network was created about three years ago and lets doctors at participating hospitals receive second opinions from Mayo experts within 48 hours.

Stormont-Vail's partnership took effect April 1, after nearly a year's work with Mayo officials. Network medical director David Hayes said Mayo looks for hospitals around the country that share its culture and put patients first.
