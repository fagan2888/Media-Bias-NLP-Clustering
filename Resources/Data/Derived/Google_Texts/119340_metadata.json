While Thomas was crossing the field in one direction, Welker was crossing in the other, and on the way he ran into Aqib Talib, by far New England\u2019s best defensive back.\n\nTalib was forced from the game with what first was described as a rib injury but in the second half was announced as a knee ailment. The Broncos had only three points to that point, and Manning was, for him, a pedestrian 8-for-12 passing. He finished 32-of-43 for 400 yards as the Patriots clearly missed Talib\u2019s presence.\n\nThe hit was purely accidental, Welker said.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a rub play, and I was trying to get him to go over the top and I think he was thinking the same thing and wanted to come underneath, and (we) just collided,\u201d said Welker, who played in the Super Bowl in 2007 and 2011 with the Patriots. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a deal where I was trying to hit him or anything like that. I hope he\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nSaid Patriots coach Bill Belichick, \u201cAs it turned out, that was a key play.\u201d\n\nAs whether he thought it should have been a penalty on Welker, Belichick said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to look at it on the film.\u201d\n\nIf Belichick\u2019s actions on the sideline were any indication, he thought it was a penalty.\n\nThere was no gloating by Welker about the victory against the team that let him loose as a free agent last winter.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a great team, a great organization and I\u2019ve got nothing but love for those guys over there,\u201d he said.\n\nWelker gave what witnesses said was an inspiring pep talk to the team Saturday night. Broncos coach John Fox asked him to say something.\n\n\u201cI spent all day Saturday putting something together, watching a little film and different things like that of how I think the game needed to be played,\u201d Welker said. \u201cThe guys just went out and executed and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d\n\nAfter Welker\u2019s talk, Thomas said, \u201cI wanted to go play right then and there.\u201d\n\nFox seemed surprised when asked about Welker\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still wondering how that got out, but, yeah, I have a player speak every Saturday night,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI figured out in my time doing this they get sick of listening to me talk. It\u2019s personal, so I won\u2019t get into the exacts, but he answered the bell pretty well.\u201d\n\nWelker knows he doesn\u2019t need to be the wise sage of the locker room, as Manning has Super Bowl experience as well. But he expects he\u2019ll talk with teammates about what to expect.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to seize the opportunity and take advantage of it. Anytime you get a chance to go back to a Super Bowl, it\u2019s a huge thing for the team, for the guys,\u201d Welker said. \u201cWe persevered to get to this point, and we\u2019ve earned it. Now we\u2019ve just got to go finish it.\u201d\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wes Welker\u2019s collision turns tide for Broncos in beating New England", "title": "Wes Welker\u2019s collision turns tide for Broncos in beating New England", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/19/wes-welkers-collision-turns-tide-for-broncos-in-beating-new-england/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140119__BN20140120_Z00_BNSP20FBNBROSIDE2p1.jpg", "height": 524}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140119__BN20140120_Z00_BNSP20FBNBROSIDE2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T18:48:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:53:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2239\"", "article_summary": "Wes Welker hurt the New England Patriots\u2019 secondary Sunday in the way one would expect \u2014 and in another way one might not.\nAnytime you get a chance to go back to a Super Bowl, it\u2019s a huge thing for the team, for the guys,\u201d Welker said.\n\u201cThe guys just went out and executed and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201dAfter Welker\u2019s talk, Thomas said, \u201cI wanted to go play right then and there.\u201dFox seemed surprised when asked about Welker\u2019s speech.\nThe Broncos had only three points to that point, and Manning was, for him, a pedestrian 8-for-12 passing.\nThe collision happened on a second-and-9 play with 13:36 left in the second quarter, a play when wideout Demaryius Thomas dropped a short pass from quarterback Peyton Manning."}
