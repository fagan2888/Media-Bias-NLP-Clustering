They held candles, sang, wept and prayed before photos of the victims.\n\n\u201cIt is incomprehensible for our minds to understand how any human being could do such a thing to another. We stand together to mourn our brethren and pray for peace,\u201d community spokesman Neb Asfaw said. \u201cThe terrorists will not break our spirit. We stand together with our faith strengthened by the courage our brothers showed.\u201d\n\nIt is a community that knows terror too well, rooted in the Cold War-era flow of refugees fleeing famine and political persecution in Ethiopia. Soviet-backed rulers used systematic torture. Resettling in Denver, the refugees thrived, starting families and businesses that range from restaurants to car dealerships.\n\nA 29-minute video circulated last Sunday by the Islamic State showed dozens of militants holding separate groups of migrants captive in Libya. Islamic State operatives described the captives as \u201cfollowers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church.\u201d They were lined up and shot in a desert. A dozen were filmed as militants marched them along a beach before beheading them. Images of bloody severed heads appeared on Internet videos. Some videos now have been removed from websites.\n\nThe killings followed beheadings of 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in Libya.\n\nLast week, Ethiopians also were among those slaughtered in southern Africa as mobs turned on migrants.\n\nAcross metro Denver, Ethiopian-Americans who gazed at the videos \u2014 some saying later they regretted this \u2014 described difficulties eating and sleeping. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty shaken up, seeing the videos. It is just cruel, and people are really depressed,\u201d Asfaw said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep for three days. I couldn\u2019t sleep. Not because they are Ethiopians. They are people. And there were people walking around with heads.\u201d\n\nIslamic State fighters said they were waging jihad against Ethiopia. Asfaw noted the Ethiopian forces fighting Islamists in neighboring Somalia. \u201cThey were saying: \u2018This is just the beginning.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThey contend smarter and bolder action must be taken to confront the Islamic State as the movement expands beyond Iraq and Syria.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mike Coffman and former state Rep. Joe Miklosi attended the vigil and agreed with Ethiopian-Americans that more must be done to stop the Islamic State as it spreads beyond Syria and Iraq into lawless areas in Africa. \u201cISIS is like a cancer. \u2026 America must show leadership,\u201d Coffman said.\n\nHe said the U.S. should help coordinate air support and send \u201csome special operators\u201d to fight. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that we blunt the momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are attracting new recruits, to include elements in the United States.\u201d\n\nDenver Muslim and Jewish community members may attend a memorial Sunday. Ethiopians also plan a rally at the Capitol on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll also try to raise awareness of the persecution of Christian minorities in the Middle East and xenophobia against African migrant workers in South Africa. In South Africa, migrant workers are being killed by mobs, and some are being put on fire live,\u201d Asfaw said. \u201cThose videos are circulating around the Internet.\u201d\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700 or bfinley@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver\u2019s Ethiopian community mourns countrymen killed by Islamic State", "title": "Denver\u2019s Ethiopian community mourns countrymen killed by Islamic State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/25/denvers-ethiopian-community-mourns-countrymen-killed-by-islamic-state/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150425__CD24ISISVIGIL__1AO5960xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150425__CD24ISISVIGIL__1AO5960xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-25T19:18:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T05:19:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf108\"", "article_summary": "The beheading and shooting of 30 Ethiopian migrants by Islamic State fighters last week in Libya is tormenting metro Denver\u2019s 30,000-strong Ethiopian-American community.\nA 29-minute video circulated last Sunday by the Islamic State showed dozens of militants holding separate groups of migrants captive in Libya.\nIslamic State operatives described the captives as \u201cfollowers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church.\u201d They were lined up and shot in a desert.\n\u201cThey were saying: \u2018This is just the beginning.\u2019 \u201cThey contend smarter and bolder action must be taken to confront the Islamic State as the movement expands beyond Iraq and Syria.\nIn South Africa, migrant workers are being killed by mobs, and some are being put on fire live,\u201d Asfaw said."}
