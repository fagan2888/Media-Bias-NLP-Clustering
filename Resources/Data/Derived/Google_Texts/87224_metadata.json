A bankruptcy aid program was eliminated, and the Chief Counsel\u2019s office was denied a $10 million software purchase that would have eased document retrieval in litigation. \u201cThe IRS was recently sanctioned in court and ordered to reimburse a plaintiff $12,500 for the cost of depositions because it did not have the technical capability to produce appropriate documents for discovery,\u201d GAO noted.\n\nThe auditors also faulted the IRS for its $3.2 billion information technology budget request for fiscal 2016, saying it used inaccurate data on investments and unclear definitions of terms such as \u201clife-cycle cost\u201d in its budget justification to appropriators. \u201cAs a result, Congress does not have accurate, reliable, and complete data on IT investments to inform its budget decisions or aid in its oversight,\u201d GAO said.\n\nThe report was requested by Senate and House leaders of the Finance and Ways and Means panels, which have justified the budget cuts as punishment for alleged political bias in the IRS\u2019s Exempt Organizations unit. Some lawmakers suggested the IRS should use its budget more flexibly to make up for cuts in customer service areas such as call centers that field taxpayer questions.\n\n\u201cWhile IRS cannot transfer resources from one appropriation account to another without specific statutory authority to do so, the agency still has some flexibility because fund centers may receive funds from more than one appropriation account,\u201d GAO noted. In fiscal 2014, IRS transferred $416 million in funds from user fees collected from taxpayers needing special help and from return preparers subject to quality controls. The agency recently formed a new office and committee to inform budget formulation and execution.\n\nPresident Obama in February requested a $2 billion hike in the IRS budget of $10.9 billion last year.\n\nGAO credited the IRS with progress on most of 88 outstanding recommendations for improvements, notably its cost estimate on implementation of Obamacare.\n\nIts new recommendations included asking the agency to add controls to make information on its IT investments more accurate. Agency managers agreed.\n\n(Image via Creativa Images/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
