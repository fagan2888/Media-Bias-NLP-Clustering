The Boston Bombings: One Year Later

As we approach the one year anniversary of the Boston Marathon Bombings, we'll have a special discussion from Boston with first responders about the impact that day had on the city, its people and security in America. The Meet the Press panel will include historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), and former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis. David will also talk with Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki and former New England Patriots player Joe Andruzzi.
