It was learned that the heroin distribution network spanned between Opelousas and New Orleans.\u201d\n\nArrested so far are:\n\n\u2022 John Q. Davis, 30, 1000 Emma St., Opelousas, charged with two counts of distribution of schedule II drugs (heroin and crack cocaine) and three counts of possession with intent to distribute schedule I and II drugs (heroin, crack cocaine and ecstasy).\n\n\u2022 Kevin Davis, 25, 1000 Emma St., Opelousas, possession of schedule I drugs and contempt of court.\n\n\u2022 Clarence Hamilton, 21, 1619 Brown St., Opelousas, possession of schedule I drugs and contempt of court.\n\nGallow said the arrest warrants against these men were executed Friday by his officers in cooperation with the Louisiana State Police, the Lafayette Drug enforcement Administration Task force, the Louisiana office of State probation and parole and the Opelousas City Marshals office.\n\n\u201cThis was the culmination of several months of a highly intensive investigation on a major narcotics trafficking organization in the City of Opelousas, which involved the trafficking of heroin, crack cocaine, and marijuana,\u201d Gallow said.\n\n\u201cThe operation centered on the execution of arrest warrants for distribution of heroin and crack cocaine, as well as the execution of two search warrants on residences set up to be houses for distribution,\u201d Gallow said.\n\nHe said those search warrants of houses at 1116 S. Railroad Ave. and 1619 Brown St. turned up 20 grams of heroin with an estimated street value of $3,000.\n\nAlso seized were 15 rocks of crack cocaine, 8 ounces of marijuana and seven ecstasy pills.\n\nGallow said the raid also turned up about $5,000 in cash, believed to be the proceeds of drug transactions.\n\nGallow said the investigation continues and police expect to make more arrests.\n\nHe said the operation resulted from the efforts of the Opelousas Police Department\u2019s Special Operations Unit along with the Louisiana State Police Region II narcotics and the Lafayette Office of Drug Enforcement Administration Task force.\n\nGallow also thanked individuals who assisted by providing \u201cvaluable information\u201d to police.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/crime/2014/09/20/opelousas-makes-first-significant-heroin-trafficking-arrest/15964263/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Drug distribution network ran beetween New Orleans and Opelousas", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "Drug distribution network ran beetween New Orleans and Opelousas", "title": "Opelousas makes first significant heroin trafficking arrest", "url": "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/crime/2014/09/20/opelousas-makes-first-significant-heroin-trafficking-arrest/15964263/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/theadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drug distribution network ran beetween New Orleans and Opelousas", "title": "Opelousas makes first significant heroin trafficking arrest", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b127ef6bdeca0a7997ada31f1919c35b81de662/c=354-0-1769-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/LafayetteLA/2014/09/20/heroinilllustration.jpg", "creator": "@theadvertiser", "site": "@theadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743844896", "fb": {"app_id": 150147415035780}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaef6\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 Clarence Hamilton, 21, 1619 Brown St., Opelousas, possession of schedule I drugs and contempt of court.\n\u2022 Kevin Davis, 25, 1000 Emma St., Opelousas, possession of schedule I drugs and contempt of court.\n\u201cThis was the culmination of several months of a highly intensive investigation on a major narcotics trafficking organization in the City of Opelousas, which involved the trafficking of heroin, crack cocaine, and marijuana,\u201d Gallow said.\nDrug syringe and cooked heroin on spoon (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto )Three Opelousas men have been arrested in connection with the first significant heroin seizure in the city\u2019s recent history.\nAlso seized were 15 rocks of crack cocaine, 8 ounces of marijuana and seven ecstasy pills."}
