If you want to sell all that stuff you’ve accumulated over the years, you probably think about having a yard or garage sale. But when celebrities pile up on random odds and ends, where do they turn?

On the heels of selling their 32-acre estate in Armonk, N.Y., for the asking price of $27.5 million, director Ron Howard and his wife, Cheryl, decided to sell lots of their furniture and furnishings through One King’s Lane, a high-end home shopping website, at prices ranging from $75 to $10,499.

One King’s Lane has also sold items for other celebrities, including Drew Barrymore, Patrick Dempsey and Diane Keaton. Carol Feldman, a co-founder of the five-year-old website, told Yahoo Homes that the sale of celebrity products was “part of the site’s evolution.”

You can check out the Howards’ newfangled garage sale through August 10.
