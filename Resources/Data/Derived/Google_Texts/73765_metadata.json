Even the business mogul said that he\u2019s not sure if Cruz likes him, but had to hand it to the senator that he was one hell of a fighter.\n\nOne op-ed for the Dallas Morning News has suggested that Cruz could return to the Senate and reach across the aisle to build bipartisanship for the next two years, before he runs again.\n\nThe overwhelming response to this from readers agree that that is never going to happen.\n\nBut given the senator\u2019s history with the Senate and his relationship with others, which he has refuses to fix; up until he suspended his campaign, Ted Cruz is likely going to go back to Washington and do whatever it takes to take out his loss on America for not supporting him.\n\n[Image by Darron Cummings/AP Photo]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The beat-down that Ted Cruz suffered earlier in the week, was not only a blow to his campaign, but to those who thought the Dominionist senator, would certainly", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The beat-down that Ted Cruz suffered earlier in the week, was not only a blow to his campaign, but to those who thought the Dominionist senator, would certainly", "title": "When Ted Cruz Returns To The Senate, Will He Take Out His Loss On America?", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/3072645/when-ted-cruz-returns-to-the-senate-will-he-take-out-his-loss-on-america/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ted-Cruz-steps-down-from-stage-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-07T20:16:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T22:46:56+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ted-Cruz-steps-down-from-stage-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-05-07T20:16:01+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "#ted2016,2016 republican presidential race,ted cruz,washington,opinion", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ted-Cruz-steps-down-from-stage-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The beat-down that Ted Cruz suffered earlier in the week, was not only a blow to his campaign, but to those who thought the Dominionist senator, would certainly"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Just wrapped up interview with Senator Ted Cruz\u2026 Opening rally with a prayer.\n@WISH_TV pic.twitter.com/U61ozJgV3b \u2014 Vi Nguyen (@ViNguyen) April 25, 2016There is no doubt that the dislike of Ted Cruz is quite profound throughout Washington.\nAs Inquisitr wrote before he made his announcement Tuesday evening, the dislike for Ted Cruz is not just made up by elites.\nBut now that he\u2019s dropped out of the race, what happens to Ted Cruz?\nTed Cruz not supporting Donald Trump would not be a shock."}
