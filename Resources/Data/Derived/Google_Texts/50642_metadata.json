Among the many contenders is Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who came in a close third place to Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucus on Feb. 1.\n\nLike every other presidential candidate, Rubio has all sorts of ideas about how he\u2019d change the country. While it\u2019s difficult to say exactly how these proposals could affect Americans \u2014 particularly because it\u2019s hard to predict if and how they\u2019ll materialize, not to mention how they\u2019ll be paid for \u2014 they\u2019re important to consider as voters decide in the coming months who will run the country for the next four years.\n\nWe\u2019ve already rounded up a handful of ways other candidates could affect your money if elected president (read here about Trump, Cruz and Sen. Bernie Sanders), so here\u2019s an overview of Rubio\u2019s positions on issues that could impact your finances.\n\n1. Healthcare Reform\n\nLike other Republican presidential candidates, Rubio proposes repealing Obamacare. The law has significantly impacted the way in which many Americans pay for healthcare, as well as how much they pay, so getting rid of it would spur more changes in that area. Rubio\u2019s idea for giving people access to affordable healthcare is to give Americans \u201can advanceable, refundable tax credit that can be used to purchase insurance,\u201d according to his website. Where that tax credit would come from, however, is unclear.\n\nRead More: What\u2019s a Good Credit Score?\n\n2. Income-Based Student Loan Repayment\n\nAt the moment, people have a variety of student loan repayment options (for federal loans, at least). One of them is income-based repayment, which borrowers can apply for through their student loan servicers. Rubio proposes making income-based repayment the \u201cuniversal repayment method for federal student loans.\u201d\n\nHe hasn\u2019t detailed how this simplified IBR would work \u2014 under the current IBR program for new borrowers, people pay 10% of their discretionary monthly income toward the loans, and any balance remaining after 20 years is forgiven. The rules are a little different if you have older loans. Right now, you have to qualify for IBR, but Rubio proposes it be automatic.\n\n3. Social Security\n\nRubio wants to reform Social Security and Medicare, because the way he sees it, the programs can\u2019t last the way they are now. He proposes keeping things the same for people who are near retirement, but he suggests gradually increasing the Social Security retirement age and exempting from payroll tax seniors older than 65 who wish to continue working. He also proposes reducing the growth in benefits for wealthier retirees to strengthen the benefits for low-income retirees.\n\nRead More: The Truth About Credit Repair\n\n4. Fewer Tax Brackets\n\nThere are seven tax brackets right now, which Rubio proposes replacing with three. The current tax brackets aren\u2019t easy to explain concisely (here\u2019s a more in-depth guide to current tax brackets), but Rubio proposes brackets of 15%, 25% and 35% of taxpayers\u2019 incomes, depending on filing status and how much they earn. (The low end of the current tax brackets is 10%, and the high end is higher than 35%). If Rubio gets his way, it\u2019s likely you\u2019d see a difference in what you\u2019re paying in taxes, though it\u2019s difficult to say if you\u2019ll pay more or less.\n\nRead More: Is Chase Freedom\u2019s 5% Cash Back Right for You?\n\n5. No Minimum Wage Increase\n\nRubio thinks Americans need higher-paying jobs, but he doesn\u2019t think raising the minimum wage is the way to do it. Instead, he wants to focus on bolstering vocational education and cutting the corporate tax rate so business can offer more jobs to un- and under-employed people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's where the Republican presidential hopeful stands on the issues that affect your wallet the most.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Here's where the Republican presidential hopeful stands on the issues that affect your wallet the most.", "title": "The Marco Rubio Effect on Your Wallet", "url": "http://time.com/money/4213920/marco-rubio-obamacare-student-loans-minimum-wage/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/gettyimages-509151146.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/gettyimages-509151146.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Here's where the Republican presidential hopeful stands on the issues that affect your wallet the most.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Marco Rubio Effect on Your Wallet"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", election 2016", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "marco rubio, taxes, social security, minimum wage, student loans, obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Fewer Tax BracketsThere are seven tax brackets right now, which Rubio proposes replacing with three.\n(The low end of the current tax brackets is 10%, and the high end is higher than 35%).\nHealthcare ReformLike other Republican presidential candidates, Rubio proposes repealing Obamacare.\nThe current tax brackets aren\u2019t easy to explain concisely (here\u2019s a more in-depth guide to current tax brackets), but Rubio proposes brackets of 15%, 25% and 35% of taxpayers\u2019 incomes, depending on filing status and how much they earn.\nNo Minimum Wage IncreaseRubio thinks Americans need higher-paying jobs, but he doesn\u2019t think raising the minimum wage is the way to do it."}
