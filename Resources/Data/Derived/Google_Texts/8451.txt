KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Jack Del Rio tried to succeed as an NFL head coach while his team played against Peyton Manning twice a year.

Del Rio found the goal easier to attain when Manning was on his side playing quarterback. Filling in for John Fox during the most difficult stretch of the Broncos’ schedule, Del Rio posted an impressive 3-1 record as interim head coach.

When the team plane landed back in Denver on Sunday night, Del Rio’s job as boss was done. Fox will be back Monday morning as head coach while Del Rio returns to his full-time role as defensive coordinator.

“He has great command in team meetings, addressing the team and you can tell he has been an experienced head coach,” Manning said of Del Rio.

After the Broncos defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 35-28, Sunday, team front office boss John Elway presented Del Rio with the game ball.

“It was special to have John Elway recognize the things I did, but I basically want to say that is just a representation of what we all did,” Del Rio said. “It wasn’t about me. It was a collective effort.”

Like most teams, the Broncos have encountered their share of devastating injuries, suspensions and controversies. But losing a head coach in midseason was an extraordinary predicament. Fox had been on four-week medical leave after undergoing heart-valve replacement surgery.

“Our team has faced a lot of adversity in just a short time,” Manning said. “You never expect your head coach not to be with you the entire time. But coach Del Rio has done a great job keeping us together. It was a pretty tough four-game stretch he had to endure and the team responded. But we are certainly glad to have coach Fox back.”
