Mikhail Zygar\u2019s questions were sharper than those of the others, who headed back to spacious television studios while Zygar broadcast his piece from a Moscow living room.\n\nThe Dozhd news channel, whose editor-in-chief Zygar was given a Committee to Protect Journalists award last month, rose to prominence in 2011 with its coverage of the mass protests against President Vladimir Putin \u2014 which state-owned television largely ignored.\n\nAs other Russian television channels have grown increasingly subservient this year, providing propaganda backing for the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and Russia\u2019s aggressive policy toward Ukraine, Dozhd didn\u2019t follow the lead \u2014 and is now paying for it.\n\nPutin\u2019s government has been careful not to order the channel to shut down, but a Kremlin-instigated smear campaign has driven this rare independent broadcaster to the brink of demise.\n\nPast strollers and bicycles in the hall, a Soviet-era apartment in central Moscow now houses the studio of Dozhd, whose combined online and TV audience is about 12 million. Anchorman Pavel Lobkov sits on a chair in what was once a spacious living room.\n\nThe 47-year-old Lobkov shrugs off the challenges, recalling his early days in television during the Soviet Union\u2019s perestroika era.\n\n\u201cThings were probably even tougher then: We had no Internet, no Skype, no cellphones. I went live from war zones, so these comfortable surroundings of an apartment can hardly unsettle me,\u201d he said.\n\nLobkov spent most of his television career on NTV, a legendary channel taken over by state-controlled gas company Gazprom in 2001, a move that forced independent journalists to flee.\n\nNTV, owned by oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, was a leading TV channel that offered a view different from the Kremlin. The government effectively wrested the channel from Gusinsky\u2019s control and entrusted it to Gazprom to run in Putin\u2019s first major crackdown on independent media.\n\nNow at Dozhd, Lobkov says he\u2019s reliving the same pressure and harassment campaign he experienced at NTV when \u201call tools of the government were used.\u201d\n\nPressure on independent media intensified this year as the Kremlin sought to unify the country behind the annexation of Crimea and Russia\u2019s involvement in eastern Ukraine.\n\nSince its inception in 2010, Dozhd had its studio in a former chocolate factory on the Moskva River, but its landlord broke the lease in November, forcing the channel to look for new space. Sympathizers offered Dozhd a place elsewhere, but last week they were told they can\u2019t broadcast out of there anymore.\n\nDozhd doesn\u2019t want to make public its new temporary location.\n\nDuring Putin\u2019s 15 years in office, the Russian television landscape has been sanitized to the point where news coverage on all channels is almost identical. State channels toe the Kremlin line and private channels, most of which are owned by Kremlin-friendly oligarchs or state-controlled conglomerates like Gazprom, are just as obedient.\n\nAs recently as January 2014, Dozhd broadcast both online and on cable networks, expanding its reach to Russian regions that still largely get their information from state-owned television. Its troubles began when Dozhd was aggressively covering the daily anti-government protests in Ukraine, which state-owned television dismissed as a neo-Nazi coup.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russia sees harsh crackdown on independent media", "title": "Russia sees harsh crackdown on independent media", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Russia sees harsh crackdown on independent media", "title": "Russia sees harsh crackdown on independent media", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/21/russia_sees_harsh_crackdown_on_independent_media/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/russia-independent.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Russia sees harsh crackdown on independent media", "title": "Russia sees harsh crackdown on independent media", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/russia-independent.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nataliya Vasilyeva", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Its troubles began when Dozhd was aggressively covering the daily anti-government protests in Ukraine, which state-owned television dismissed as a neo-Nazi coup.\nThe government effectively wrested the channel from Gusinsky\u2019s control and entrusted it to Gazprom to run in Putin\u2019s first major crackdown on independent media.\nNTV, owned by oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, was a leading TV channel that offered a view different from the Kremlin.\nDuring Putin\u2019s 15 years in office, the Russian television landscape has been sanitized to the point where news coverage on all channels is almost identical.\nAs recently as January 2014, Dozhd broadcast both online and on cable networks, expanding its reach to Russian regions that still largely get their information from state-owned television."}
