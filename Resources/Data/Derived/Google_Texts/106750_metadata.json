That makes \"Deadpool\" Fox's biggest box office opening for one of its Marvel properties.\n\nAnd the \"Merc with the Mouth\" isn't going anywhere with a sequel to the film already in development.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Deadpool' had the biggest opening ever for an R-rated film this weekend, hauling in an estimated $135 million at the domestic box office.", "language": "english", "author": "CNN Money", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/entertainment/headlines/Deadpool-Marvels-profane-superhero-has-record-box-office-opening-368773741.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/deadpool1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "'Deadpool' had the biggest opening ever for an R-rated film this weekend, hauling in an estimated $135 million at the domestic box office.", "title": "'Deadpool,' Marvel's profane superhero, has record box office opening"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "title": "'Deadpool,' Marvel's profane superhero, has record box office opening", "url": "http://www.kake.com/entertainment/headlines/Deadpool-Marvels-profane-superhero-has-record-box-office-opening-368773741.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/deadpool1.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "'Deadpool,' Marvel's profane superhero, has record box office opening", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Deadpool, Marvels profane superhero, has record box office opening"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c6d\"", "article_summary": "That makes \"Deadpool\" Fox's biggest box office opening for one of its Marvel properties.\n\"Deadpool\" had the biggest opening ever for an R-rated film this weekend, hauling in an estimated $135 million at the domestic box office.\n20th Century FoxHe may be an unlikely hero, but Deadpool saved the day at the box office this weekend.\n\"Deadpool\" surprised Hollywood, more than doubling its initial forecasts of a $60 million box office opening and brought in a summer-like debut in the dead of winter -- and on a very cold weekend in the Northeast.\nnlike Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers, Deadpool is owned by Fox instead of Disney (DIS)'s Marvel Studios."}
