Would colleges and universities stop capping adjuncts\u2019 workloads to prevent them from qualifying as eligible for benefits under the law? Would institutions that already had done so rethink their caps? And would administrators even follow the guidance, which offers a \u201csafe harbor\u201d formula of 2.25 hours worked for each classroom contact hour, but still allows them to count total hours worked based on a decidedly ambiguous \u201creasonable\u201d standard?\n\nA few weeks out from the IRS guidance, it appears that it has made some difference, with at least one community college system moving to rethink its course load cap. But many others have made no such move, or confirmed that they won\u2019t rethink their policies. It's important to note that many colleges adopted the caps, which resulted in many adjuncts losing sections -- and income -- before guidance had been issued, much to the frustration of many non-tenure-track faculty members.\n\nSome adjuncts tracking the issue noted that the guidance isn\u2019t final, but sets the stage for future discussions about the Affordable Care Act's impact on adjunct labor, and for discussions about the status of adjunct instructors in general.\n\nAdrianna Kezar, professor of higher education at the University of Southern California and director of the Delphi Project to examine the changing academic work force, described the landscape like this, via email: \u201cI know that there is some discussion on campuses about what to do and the short-term and long-term issues at stake. It is also happening at meetings and conferences. But those that decided to cut back hours will likely stay with that decision. Those that have not made decisions may follow the guidance.\u201d\n\nStill, she added, \u201cI think that having it issued in terms of policy will shape some colleges and certainly is better than having no guidelines out there.\u201d\n\nGary Rhoades, professor and director of the University of Arizona\u2019s Center for the Study of Higher Education, was slightly more hopeful. \u201cI think that colleges will have an incentive to follow the guidelines, and that if they have already set other, lesser calculations, there will be good reason for them to revisit and revise those policies to conform with the government guidelines,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Baime, vice president for government relations and policy analysis for the American Association of Community Colleges, said he thought the guidance \"likely\" would cause widespread review of previously adopted caps.\n\nStarting about 18 months ago, colleges moved in droves to cap their adjuncts\u2019 course loads ahead of the health care law\u2019s so-called \u201cemployer mandate\u201d taking effect. Large employers under the law must offer full-time employees \u2013 those who work 30 hours or more per week \u2013 health care benefits or face fines, so institutions all over the country moved to lower their course load caps for adjuncts or create them where they hadn\u2019t existed before.\n\nCollege associations warned institutions that they may be acting too soon, without explicit guidance from the federal government about how to count adjuncts\u2019 total hours worked per week to determine if they were benefits-eligible under the law. Since adjuncts work outside of class to prepare for contact time with students, they said, it was unclear how to count adjuncts\u2019 hours. Different adjuncts groups, college associations and unions proposed various formulas, but there was nothing concrete.\n\nMany of the institutions were working off a kind of \u201cworst case scenario\u201d scenario formula, from the perspective of wanting to provide as few adjuncts health care as possible. Under that formula, which was supported by the American Federation of Teachers and some adjunct groups, one hour of contact time equaled two hours of outside preparation time, for a total of three hours. So Community College of Allegheny County, followed by many other institutions, announced a 10-credit-per-semester cap. It replaced a previous 12-credit cap, essentially meaning that most adjuncts could now teach three courses (nine credits) instead of four per semester in the fall and summer, for 27 hours per week total.\n\nAllegheny did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would rethink its policy in light of the IRS guidance. Various institutions also are staying mum. A spokesman for the College of DuPage, which last year created some full-time positions for adjuncts while capping other adjuncts\u2019 workload at 27 credits per, said the guidance wouldn\u2019t change anything, and showed that the college\u2019s policy is \u201cappropriate within the clarified guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe Virginia Community College system, however, is reviewing a course load cap it instituted last year for all adjuncts: 10 credits each in the fall and spring and 7 in the summer, a spokesman said. That cap resulted in sections being taken away from or limited for about 25 percent of the system\u2019s some 7,000 adjuncts at 23 campuses, and could change based on a pending review of the IRS guidance and the Virginia \u201cManpower Control Program.\u201d The state policy limits adjunct faculty at public institutions to 29 hours per week. Still, at least one college within the system has announced that new course loads of 12 credits and contact hours each for the fall and spring, and 8 in the summer, soon will be adopted, based on the relatively \u201crelaxed\u201d IRS guidance, The Washington Post reported. The college system spokesman said that announcement was premature.\n\nJosh Ulman, chief government relations officer for the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, said he expected more and more colleges to follow the IRS model, to be in compliance should the guidelines change going forward.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in email that whether or not colleges would follow the guidelines was \"simple.\" Employers that \"embrace the sprit of the [law] -- which is rooted in the idea that everyone deserves access to high-quality and affordable healthcare -- will work with us to make it happen. Those who oppose the law or put cutting costs above high-quality education probably won't.\"\n\nIndiana's Ivy Tech Community College, a large community college system, won\u2019t change the ACA-related course load caps it instituted regardless of the guidance, President Tom Snyder said. Under the new caps, adjuncts can work 12 credit hours per semester, or about 27 hours total based on the IRS formula. Snyder, who recently offered Congressional testimony on what he saw as the disproportionate impact of the new health care law on community colleges, given their high rates of employment of adjunct faculty, said he would continue to lobby for the possible exemption of colleges from the law. Snyder said the law \"penalizes\" adjunct faculty who want to teach more hours but must adhere to new course load caps, and the \"school misses out on a skilled adjunct.\" And providing health care to all adjuncts teaching beyond the new caps would be prohibitively expensive, at the cost of $10 million annually, he said. To do that, Ivy Tech would have to downgrade health care plans for everyone else.\n\nNo college has yet announced it will offer more adjuncts health insurance as a result of the guidance. That didn\u2019t come as a surprise to adjunct advocates, who often cite health insurance and other benefits as a kind of \u201clast nut\u201d to be cracked in organizing and other advocacy efforts that in many places already have led to better pay and job security, for example.\n\nBecause many institutions still recognize adjuncts as working only during contact classroom hours, Kezar said the guidelines \u201ccertainly should make more adjuncts qualify.\u201d But, she said, \u201cInstitutions that are dead-set against providing them [with health insurance] will find ways around it.\"\n\nBaime noted that the guidelines offer flexibility to colleges to offer \"robust employment\" of adjuncts without necessarily providing health insurance. Weingarten said that adjuncts who don't get insurance through their institutions are counting on expanded opportunities for coverage elsewhere in the law.\n\nUlman said that at the very least, the IRS guidance will make it clearer who might qualify for benefits so that institutions and employees can have more \u201chonest discussions\u201d about coverage.\n\nMaria Maisto, president of the New Faculty Majority, said there was more work to be done to make sure that those kinds of honest discussions were happening on campuses. And given the lack of obvious enforcement mechanism in the guidance, she said, it\u2019s up to adjuncts to demand it.\n\nDespite the tumult of the past 18 months for adjuncts, advocates have said there\u2019s a silver lining, to which the new IRS guidance adds: It\u2019s brought the contingent academic labor issue out of the sector and into the broader policy debate.\n\nRhoades said the guidance is \u201cofficial recognition that adjunct faculty work outside the class, as part of contributing to a quality education for the students, and that will create additional pressure on institutions to not just acknowledge that, but to actually remunerate these faculty for that work.\u201d\n\nKezar agreed, saying, \u201cthe legislation and guidance have been really instrumental in bringing adjuncts\u2019 plight to light.\" She noted Democratic Rep. George Miller\u2019s recent report on adjunct labor issues, which was sparked by Maisto\u2019s November testimony to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. \u201cHe learned all that through the [Affordable Care Act] discussions.\u201d\n\nUltimately, she said, the debate\u2019s greatest impact \u201cmay not be on health care but on drawing attention to the slew of problems related to this work force model that has been grown beyond capacity to serve higher education well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/25/some-colleges-consider-changes-adjunct-caps-wake-irs-guidance", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "While some colleges are studying the possibility of restoring adjuncts' sections in the wake of guidance from the IRS, they aren't moving yet.", "title": "Some colleges consider changes in adjunct caps in wake of IRS guidance"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "While some colleges are studying the possibility of restoring adjuncts' sections in the wake of guidance from the IRS, they aren't moving yet.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8112\"", "article_summary": "Since adjuncts work outside of class to prepare for contact time with students, they said, it was unclear how to count adjuncts\u2019 hours.\nTo do that, Ivy Tech would have to downgrade health care plans for everyone else.\nUnder the new caps, adjuncts can work 12 credit hours per semester, or about 27 hours total based on the IRS formula.\nNo college has yet announced it will offer more adjuncts health insurance as a result of the guidance.\nAnd providing health care to all adjuncts teaching beyond the new caps would be prohibitively expensive, at the cost of $10 million annually, he said."}
