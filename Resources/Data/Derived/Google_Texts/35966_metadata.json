And the outcome could have a bigger effect on your finances than any other presidential contest to date this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in 12 states and one territory will flock to polling stations to pick their party\u2019s nominee for the general presidential election. More delegates will be committed to candidates on Super Tuesday than on any other day. And with a diverse cross-section of places represented\u2014from Alabama to Alaska to American Samoa\u2014the day is set to serve as one of the first indicators of the candidates\u2019 electability on a national scale.\n\nSo how will the results affect your pocketbook? For those headed to the polls on Tuesday, MONEY has broken down what you need to know about the frontrunners\u2019 stances on big personal finance issues before you cast your ballot.\n\nTaxes\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s plan cracks down on the rich. She would require people who make more than $1 million each year to pay at least 30% in taxes\u2014on average they now pay 28%\u2014and would also add a 4% surcharge on the taxes of those who make more than $5 million.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 proposal would establish four new federal tax brackets for high earners: 37%, 43%, 48%, and 52%. The top rate would apply to taxable income over $10 million. Additionally, the liberal Vermont senator would raise the rate on people in all other tax brackets by 2.2%.\n\nDonald Trump, the current Republican frontrunner, suggests creating four income tax brackets: 0%, 10%, 20%, and 25%. The top rate would apply to income above $150,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint filers. People at those income levels currently pay between 28% to 33% of their earnings in taxes.\n\nTed Cruz proposes a flat tax of 10% on all ordinary income. The junior Republican senator from Texas would also up the standard deduction to $10,000 per filer, up from $6,300.\n\nMarco Rubio wants to establish three tax brackets of 15%, 25%, and 35%. The top rate would apply to taxable income above $150,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint filers. He would also eliminate taxes on capital gains and dividends.\n\nSocial Security\n\nClinton has promised to uphold Social Security. She also wants to expand benefits for widows and widowers, as well as for those who take time off work to care for aging parents and grandparents.\n\nSanders opposes any reductions to Social Security benefits and any increase in the retirement age. He also wants to raise the system\u2019s taxable wage limit to $250,000, from the current level of $118,500.\n\nTrump rejects the idea of cutting Social Security benefits. And unlike his Republican opponents, he opposes raising the retirement age.\n\nCruz wants to raise the retirement age and cap increases in the cost-of-living adjustment. He also wants to allow workers to save up to $25,000 in personal savings accounts.\n\nRubio supports a gradual increase in the retirement age to match rising life expectancies. He also would make cuts to benefits for higher-income seniors.\n\nCollege\n\nClinton proposes that no family or student should have to borrow money to fund their college education\u2014and that community college be totally free. She also says that those with existing student debt will be able to refinance it at lower rates. Clinton says her plan\u2019s $350-billion price tag (over 10 years) would be paid for by tax adjustments for the wealthy.\n\nLike Hillary, Sanders believes in free higher education, but he wants low-income students to use state, federal, and institutional aid to cover the cost of tuition, living, and other expenses. He also wants to more than triple the federal work-study program. Bernie estimates the plan will run about $75 billion a year\u2014and he\u2019ll fund it by taxing the \u201cWall Street speculators who nearly destroyed the economy seven years ago,\u201d according to his campaign website.\n\nTrump has never released an official plan that addresses college costs. However, he told The Hill in July, \u201cThat\u2019s probably one of the only things the government shouldn\u2019t make money off\u2014I think it\u2019s terrible that one of the only profit centers we have is student loans.\u201d\n\nThough Cruz has said he took out student loans to finance his own education, he hasn\u2019t said much publicly about addressing student debt. His position on student loans is a bit murky: He\u2019s voted in favor of capping federal student loan interest rates as a senator, but he also voted against Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s student loan refinancing bill in 2015.\n\nRubio has often referenced his past as a student loan borrower with more than $100,000 in debt. He supports a universal automatic income-based repayment plan. He also proposes a plan in which students could apply for \u201cstudent investment plans,\u201d in which approved investors would pay a student\u2019s tuition in exchange for a percentage of the student\u2019s income for a set period of time after graduating.\n\nHealth Care\n\nClinton promises to uphold and expand the Affordable Care Act. She would require insurance providers to limit out-of-pocket prescription drug spending to $250 a month, as well as lower the price tag of deductibles and copays.\n\nSanders proposes a single-payer \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d system that would provide all Americans with comprehensive health coverage. Under his plan, private insurance would exist only to provide supplemental coverage. His website says the plan would cost $1.38 trillion per year but will save $6 trillion compared to the current health care system over the next ten years.\n\nTrump does not have a formal health care plan (something his opponents attacked him for in the most recent debate). The billionaire businessman says he\u2019d repeal Obamacare if elected, but he\u2019s been sparse on the details of what he would replace it with. He\u2019s said he would allow people to buy their plans from insurers in any state, regardless of where they live. He also supports using health savings accounts to pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance.\n\nCruz also has not released a formal health care plan. But in debates and interviews, he\u2019s said he would also repeal Obamacare and expand health savings accounts. Like Trump, he\u2019d also let individuals buy health insurance in any state, no matter where they live.\n\nRubio, like his Republican opponents, wants to repeal the ACA. But he suggests replacing it with a refundable tax credit to purchase health insurance, which would increase each year. He\u2019d also let people buy insurance in any state.\n\nFinancial Reform\n\nIn October 2015, Clinton wrote an op-ed in Bloomberg defending the Dodd-Frank Act. If elected, she\u2019s said she would protect the 2010 bill that overhauled the country\u2019s system of financial regulation. She\u2019s also promised she would get rid of the carried interest tax loophole\u2014which lets allows hedge funds, private equity firms, and venture capitalists to avoid billions of dollars in taxes each year\u2014and impose a \u201crisk fee\u201d on banks with more than $50 billion in assets.\n\nSanders wants to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, which would separate commercial banking from investment banking. He\u2019s also proposed legislation to break up big banks and supports taxing Wall Street speculation.\n\nTrump has slammed Dodd-Frank, calling it a \u201cdisaster.\u201d He promised in an October 2015 interview with The Hill that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d repeal it if elected.\n\nCruz has also called for the repeal of Dodd-Frank, claiming it did not help prevent bailouts and instead merely created pricy regulations.\n\nAs senator, Rubio voted against Dodd-Frank four times. He\u2019s also said he\u2019s not \u201canti-Wall Street,\u201d and has proved that point by accepting more money from Wall Street donors than any other candidate of either party, Reuters reported in February.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's what you need to know before Super Tuesday on the presidential candidates' positions on issues that will affect your pocketbook.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Here's what you need to know before you cast your ballot Tuesday.", "title": "Where the Presidential Candidates Stand on Money Issues", "url": "http://time.com/money/4238864/presidential-candidates-stances-money-financial-issues/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/160226_em_supertuesday.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/160226_em_supertuesday.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Here's what you need to know before you cast your ballot Tuesday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Where the Presidential Candidates Stand on Money Issues"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", 2016 election, 2016 presidential campaign, bernie sanders, donald trump, hillary clinton, politics, sen. marco rubio, super tuesday, ted cruz", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "candidates, presidential race, election, super tuesday, financial, taxes, social security, college, health care"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump, the current Republican frontrunner, suggests creating four income tax brackets: 0%, 10%, 20%, and 25%.\nLike Trump, he\u2019d also let individuals buy health insurance in any state, no matter where they live.\nBut he suggests replacing it with a refundable tax credit to purchase health insurance, which would increase each year.\nFor those headed to the polls on Tuesday, MONEY has broken down what you need to know about the frontrunners\u2019 stances on big personal finance issues before you cast your ballot.\nAnd the outcome could have a bigger effect on your finances than any other presidential contest to date this year."}
