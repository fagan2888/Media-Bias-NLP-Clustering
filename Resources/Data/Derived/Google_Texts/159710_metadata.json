An agency review of the data included a comparison to screening levels for exposure during recreational river use to see if the metal concentrations in the water are consistent with levels prior to the disastrous 3 million-gallon spill that inundated the river in early August.\n\n\u201cBased on the results of the surface water samples in the Animas River, surface water concentrations are trending toward pre-event conditions,\u201d the EPA said Sunday.\n\nResidents affected by the incident remain wary of the EPA in the wake of the spill. Silverton and the Navajo Nation have expressed concern with the agency.\n\nExperts point out that metals lining the riverbed could continue to cause long-term effects for agriculture, aquatic life and other life-forms along the Animas River.\n\nDocuments released by the EPA late Friday showed that the agency knew the Gold King mine was at risk for blowout more than a year before wastewater spilled from the mine above Silverton on Aug. 5.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "EPA: Animas River surface water returning to pre-spill conditions", "title": "EPA: Animas River surface water returning to pre-spill conditions", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/23/epa-animas-river-surface-water-returning-to-pre-spill-conditions/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150818__animasriverp1-5.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150818__animasriverp1-5.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-23T19:00:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:31:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBased on the results of the surface water samples in the Animas River, surface water concentrations are trending toward pre-event conditions,\u201d the EPA said Sunday.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency officials released new data Sunday that they said indicates surface water concentrations from the Animas River are returning to their normal conditions.\nExperts point out that metals lining the riverbed could continue to cause long-term effects for agriculture, aquatic life and other life-forms along the Animas River.\nWater samples collected by the EPA on Aug. 16 and 17 have been validated, the agency said.\nResidents affected by the incident remain wary of the EPA in the wake of the spill."}
