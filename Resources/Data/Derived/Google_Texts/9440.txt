Former Prince George's County State's Attorney Glenn Ivey will begin airing the first television advertisement in the race for Maryland's 4th Congressional District on Tuesday, doubling down on a general election message heavy with references to President Barack Obama.

With echoes of a limited-run radio advertisement Ivey aired earlier this year, the Democrat criticizes the GOP for the 2013 shutdown of the federal government and for refusing to consider Obama's expected Supreme Court nominee. He makes no mention of the April 26 primary election immediately before him.

"In Congress, I'll protect President Obama's legacy, defend Obamacare and stand up for Social Security and Medicare," Ivey says in the ad. "I'll take on Republicans for all of us."

The 4th District is overwhelmingly Democratic, virtually assuring that the winner of the primary will take the seat. While his primary opponents have discussed their ability to broker compromise, Ivey seems to be striking a more defiant tone in his ads and on the campaign trail.

The ad's reach is not clear, and none of the candidates in the 4th District had enough money at the end of last year to mount a significant television advertising campaign. Ivey's campaign described their investment as "five-figures," and said the ad would run on cable and broadcast stations.

On Monday afternoon, only a single broadcast television contract had been posted with the Federal Communications Commission: Just under $7,000 on WRC-TV in Washington. The campaign said it will continue to run radio and television ads through the primary.

Other Democrats running for the seat, currently held by Rep. Donna F. Edwards, include former Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, Del. Joseline Pe√±a-Melnyk as well as Warren Christopher, Matthew Fogg and Terence Strait.
