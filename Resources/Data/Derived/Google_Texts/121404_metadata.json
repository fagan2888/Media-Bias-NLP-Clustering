A long-dreaded transformation from hope to doom is taking place as the United States of America ushers the world onto the no-turning-back road of nuclear perdition. Once, we could believe there was another way to go. Indeed, we were invited to take that path by the man who is, even today, overseeing the blocking of it, probably forever.\n\nIt was one of the most stirring speeches an American president had ever given. The place was Prague; the year was 2009; the president was the recently sworn in Barack Obama. The promise made that day is worth recalling at length, especially since, by now, it is largely forgotten:\n\n\u201cAs the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act\u2026 So today, I state clearly and with conviction America\u2019s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. I\u2019m not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly \u2014 perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now, we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, \u2018Yes, we can\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Obama had been in office only three months when, boldly claiming his place on the world stage, he unequivocally committed himself and his country to a nuclear abolition movement that, until then, had at best existed somewhere on the distant fringes of power politics. \u201cI know,\u201d he added, \u201cthat there are some who will question whether we can act on such a broad agenda. There are those who doubt whether true international cooperation is possible\u2026 and there are those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapons and doubt whether it\u2019s worth setting a goal that seems impossible to achieve. But make no mistake. We know where that road leads.\u201d\n\nThe simple existence of nuclear weapons, an American president declared, paved the road to perdition for humanity.\n\nObama as The Captain Ahab of Nuclear Weapons\n\nAt that moment, the foundations for an imagined abolitionist world were modest indeed, but not nonexistent. The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) had, for instance, struck a bargain between nuclear haves and have-nots, under which a path to abolition was treated as real. The dealseemed clear enough: the have-nots would promise to forego obtaining nukes and, in return, the world\u2019s reigning nuclear powers would pledge to take, in the words of the treaty, \u201ceffective measures in the direction of nuclear disarmament.\u201d\n\nFor decades before the Obama moment, however, the superpower arsenals of nuclear warheads continued to grow like so many mushrooms, while new nuclear states \u2014 Israel, Pakistan, India, North Korea \u2014 built their own impressive arsenals. In those years, with the singular exception of South Africa, nuclear-weapons states simply ignored their half of the NPT bargain and the crucial clause mandating progress toward eventual disarmament was all but forgotten.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended in 1991 with the disappearance of the Soviet Union, and the next year Americans elected as president Bill Clinton, who was famously against the Vietnam War, it was at least possible to imagine that nukes might go the way of internationally banned chemical weapons. But Washington chose otherwise. Despite a paucity of enemies anywhere on Earth, the Pentagon\u2019s 1994 Nuclear Posture Review insisted on maintaining the American nuclear arsenal at Cold War levels as a \u201chedge,\u201d an insurance policy, against an imagined return of Communism, fascism, or something terrible in Russia anyway \u2014 and Clinton accepted the Pentagon\u2019s position.\n\nSoon enough, however, even prominent hawks of the Cold War era began to worry that such a nuclear insurance policy could itself ignite a global fire. In 1999, a chief architect of the nuclear mindset, Paul Nitze, stepped away from a lifetime obsession with building up nuclear power to denounce nukes as \u201ca threat mostly to ourselves\u201d and to explicitly call for unilateral disarmament. Other former apostles of nuclear realpolitik also came to embrace the goal of abolition. In 2008, four high priests of the cult of nuclear normalcy \u2014 former Senator Sam Nunn, former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, and former Secretaries of State George Schultz and Henry Kissinger \u2014 jointly issued asacrilegious renunciation of their nuclear faith on the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page. \u201cWe endorse setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand working energetically on the actions required to achieve that goal.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, such figures had come to Jesus only after leaving office, when they were exempt from the responsibility of matching their high-flown rhetoric with the gritty work of making it real.\n\nObama in Prague was another matter. He was at the start of what would become an eight-year presidency and his rejection of nuclear fatalism rang across the world. Only months later, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in large part because of this stunning commitment. A core hope of the post-World-War-II peace movement, always marginal, had at last been embraced in the seat of power. A year later, at Obama\u2019s direction, the Pentagon, in its2010 Nuclear Posture Review, actually advanced the president\u2019s purpose, committing itself to \u201ca multilateral effort to limit, reduce, and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons worldwide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States,\u201d that document promised, \u201cwill not develop new nuclear warheads.\u201d When it came to the future of the nuclear arsenal, a program of responsible maintenance was foreseen, but no new ground was to be broken. \u201cLife Extension Programs,\u201d the Pentagon promised, \u201cwill use only nuclear components based on previously tested designs, and will not support new military missions or provide new military capabilities.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s timing in 2009 was critical. The weapons and delivery systems of the nuclear arsenal were aging fast. Many of the country\u2019s missiles, warheads, strategic bombers, and nuclear-powered submarines dated back to the early Cold War era and were effectively approaching their radioactive sell-by dates. In other words, massive reductions in the arsenal had to begin before pressures to launch a program for the wholesale replacement of those weapons systems grew too strong to resist. Such a program, in turn, would necessarily mean combining the latest technological innovations with ever greater lethality in a way guaranteed to reinvigorate the entire enterprise across the world \u2014 the polar opposite of \u201ceffective measures in the direction of nuclear disarmament.\u201d\n\nObama, in other words, was presiding over a golden moment, but an apocalyptic deadline was bearing down. And sure enough, that deadline came crashing through when three things happened: Vladimir Putin resurfaced as an incipient fascist intent on returning Russia to great power status; extremist Republicans took Congress hostage; and Barack Obama found himself lashed, like Herman Melville\u2019s Captain Ahab, to \u201cthe monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on half a heart and half a lung.\u201d Insiders often compare the Pentagon to Moby Dick, the Great White Whale, and Obama learned why. The peaceful intentions with which he began his presidency were slapped away by the flukes of the monster, like so many novice oarsmen in a whaling skiff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2009, the president promised nuclear disarmament.
