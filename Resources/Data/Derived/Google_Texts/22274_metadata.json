Last week Google sources told the WSJ that Google was planning to spend $1-3 billion on \u201c180 small, high capacity satellites at lower altitudes than traditional satellites\u201d to enable two-way Internet access. In April, Google bought Titan Aerospace \u2013 which makes solar-powered, high-flying drones that Titan calls \u201catmospheric satellites\u201d \u2014 for Internet access to remote areas and for disaster relief. And in March Google CEO Larry Page shared his ambitions that Project Loon \u201ccould build a world-wide mesh of these balloons that can cover the whole planet.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s Cover Story\n\nGoogle\u2019s public rationale for all these recent endeavors has been altruism, to supply Internet access to the two-thirds of the world that is not online. About Skybox, Google said: \u201cSkybox\u2019s satellites will help keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery. Over time, we also hope that Skybox\u2019s team and technology will be able to help improve Internet access and disaster relief \u2014 areas Google has long been interested in.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Google Inc. was caught secretly wiretapping hundreds of millions of Gmails before they were delivered for three years without anyone\u2019s knowledge via an NSA-PRISM-like device called Content One Box.\n\nAnd never mind that Google was also caught secretly wiretapping the personal WiFi signals of tens of millions of households in 33 countries over three years.\n\nGoogle now wants us to believe that Google will not be doing any secret surveillance, spying or illegal data collection when it builds a new worldwide, high-capacity, satellite grid with two-way, tracking, monitoring, and high-resolution video capabilities?\n\nAnd the company that has long maintained publicly that any broadband access with less than Gigabit speeds are inferior, is now claiming it wants to offer inferior, slow-speed, satellite Internet access to the whole world?\n\nEven if one believes Google\u2019s incredible cover story for a moment, that they will use their world-wide satellite network primarily to supply internet access where there is none, what does one surmise that Google Inc. will do with the unused surveillance capability in all the many geographies where there is already superior Internet access and where all Google\u2019s monetize-able customers routinely operate? And wouldn\u2019t it be more profitable and make more business sense to densely pack more satellites over-top of where most of Google\u2019s users and devices are?\n\nAcquiring Military-Grade Capability\n\nImportantly, SkyBox\u2019 produces dual-use technology that can be used for both military and civilian purposes. More importantly, SkyBox\u2019 technology offers military-grade capability. \u201cNo one outside the military has ever been able to access data like this: Theoretically, one could follow individual people from space, per Business Insider.\n\nSkyBox\u2019 cutting edge SkySat satellite circuitry is phone book size and uses the power equivalent of a ~100 watt light bulb. The satellites also provide real-time high resolution video images. SkyBox current commercial value proposition is selling satellite surveillance of foreign company logistics to help estimate when certain business activities will occur. Interestingly, the Economist reports the prices for chipsets for nanosats like SkyBox\u2019 SkySat satellites are approaching just $25 a piece.\n\nIn a post-Snowden world, expect the rest of world to have big concerns about the growingmilitarization of Google as a leading DOD contractor for mapping analytics, soldier-robotics, artificial intelligence and now satellite production, operation and application.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Superstate Ambitions\n\nAs the Internet\u2019s lone superpower, will Google\u2019s latest big move into military-grade satellite services make foreign governments and foreigners think that Google will become more valuable to, and a closer partner and technology supplier to NSA and the U.S. intelligence community than before?\n\nWill Google\u2019s eye-in-the-sky ambitions make those who fear that Google has become an unaccountable \u201cdigital superstate\u201d even more fearful that Google is becoming all-powerful and effectively digitally colonializing the world\u2019s data and private/secret information on Google\u2019s terms?\n\nCould Google Big Brother Inc. covet the surveillance potential of a Google-owned-and-operated satellite network that could fill in the gaps where Google currently cannot yet surveil, watch and track people in real-time, because Google does not yet have a fully omnipresent satellite capability that is potentially real-time, continuous, high-resolution, and targetable to tracking individuals or groups of individuals\u2019 movements at any time?\n\nThat outcome is not what Google Chairman Eric Schmidt would have people believe. On CNBC April 30th Mr. Schmidt reassured the world that Google does not spy or surveil: \u201cWe actually don\u2019t track people. We are very very careful to respect people\u2019s privacy. We disclose exactly what we do.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s Eye-in-the-Sky, Sky-Eye, or Sky-Spy YouTube Channels?\n\nAs almost always, Google is way ahead of everyone here. Long term Google sees the potential for Google Earth and Google Maps to meld with its satellite capability to immediately film in real-time for YouTube any event of interest in the world, whether it be a natural disaster, terrorist attack, plane/train/car crash, boat sinking, political demonstration, battle/war-in progress, crime-in-progress, shooting, hostage taking, car chase, concert, sporting event, celebrity island wedding, etc.\n\nWhat Google realizes that others do not is the commercial and business dominance value of being the only entity that can constantly surveil, spot, and then immediately respond with a live video feed in real-time to any breaking development or news of interest to some or many of its users.\n\nOne can imagine that many foreign governments will not be thrilled with Google having the new capability to broadcast live via YouTube a foreign government\u2019s dirty laundry via its soon-to-be constant aerial surveillance videos of their country, or to choose to give what it finds secretly to the NSA or another foreign government. The editorial, political, and military power of this dominant commercial surveillance capability could be staggering.\n\nLike Google dominates mapping with Google Earth, StreetView, and Maps, a Google owned-and-operated satellite network integrated with all of Google\u2019s other dominant surveillance services: search, data, advertising, mobile, video, browser, etc. provides Google with the opportunity to globally dominate aerial surveillance as well.\n\nSkyNet?\n\nIn closing, it is telling that Google\u2019s latest satellite investment binge discussed above coincides with a another Google buying binge of eight military robotics companies several months ago, and also a targeted hiring and acquisition effort to bolster Google\u2019s leadership in artificial intelligence just a few months ago; (Google bought ethics-concerned, DeepMind, an acquired company that scarily-required Google to establish an Ethics Board as a condition for Deepmind being bought by Google.)\n\nOn top of this creepy predicate, Google\u2019s Head Futurist, Ray Kurzweil, told the Guardian in February that he had long thought the \u2018singularity\u2019 \u2014 the time when computers\u2019 artificial intelligence will overtake human thinking \u2014 will be 2029, and that \u201cby 2045 computers will be a billion times more powerful than all of the human brains on Earth.\u201d\n\nFans of science fiction, and the Terminator movies in particular, will surely see the creepy parallels between Google\u2019s concentrated efforts over the last several months and the dystopian \u201cTerminator movie future\u201d where a satellite-enabled, artificial-intelligence named \u201cSkyNet\u201d becomes \u201csentient,\u201d i.e. smarter than humans, and then proceeds to see humans as a threat, and then proceeds to try and wipe out the human race.\n\nGoogle\u2019s purposeful determination and actions over the last several months indicates that Google may be anticipating Kurzweil\u2019s \u201csingularity\u201d and wants to be sure that any future SkyNet artificial intelligence and robot army is Google owned, programmed\u2026 and controlled.\n\nForewarned is forearmed.\n\n[Originally published at Precursor Blog]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/06/google-skybox-spy-satellites-big-brother-inc-always-watching/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/000.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Google Skybox Spy-Satellites: Big Brother Inc.
