Featuring representatives from state regulators, academics and policy executives from both startups and entrenched, dominant companies, it is meant to explore the consumer protection and competition questions posed by the on-demand economy.\n\nLast week, Sen. Mark Warner Mark WarnerLawmaker bemoans tax 'buzzsaw' for on-demand economy workers Reid throws wrench into Clinton vice presidential picks Reid: 'Hell no' to VP pick from state with a Republican governor MORE (D-Va.) proposed policies he said could help build a safety net for workers who are enmeshed in the on-demand economy. Companies like Uber and Lyft treat their workers as independent contractors, rather than full employees who get benefits like unemployment and protections like the minimum wage.\n\nThe increased attention in Washington marks a change from how the companies have been regulated in the past. Most of the companies have fought almost all of their regulatory battles at the state and local level, where businesses like hotels and taxi services are governed.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "FTC: No plans for 'big enforcement push' against Uber, on-demand economy firms", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "FTC: No plans for 'big enforcement push' against Uber, on-demand economy firms", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/244393-regulator-to-on-demand-economy-companies-were-not-adversaries", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/uber_112014getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "David McCabe", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/244393-regulator-to-on-demand-economy-companies-were-not-adversaries", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-09T10:39-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "on-demand economy, sharing economy,Mark Warner,Federal Trade Commission, FTC", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-09T10:39:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/244393-regulator-to-on-demand-economy-companies-were-not-adversaries", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "FTC: No plans for 'big enforcement push' against Uber, on-demand economy firms"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5f45\"", "article_summary": "A top official with the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday morning that the agency was not planning a \u201cbig enforcement push\u201d against sharing economy companies like Uber and Airbnb.\nThe comments from FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen kicked off a workshop the regulator is holding on the sharing, or on-demand, economy.\n\u201cThe sharing economy, pitting a number of long-established business models against aggressive new entrants, appears a particularly fertile ground for such mischief,\u201d she said.\nFeaturing representatives from state regulators, academics and policy executives from both startups and entrenched, dominant companies, it is meant to explore the consumer protection and competition questions posed by the on-demand economy.\nAt times, she struck notes that were sympathetic to the growing industry \u2014 including when saying that the on-demand economy, which has pitted long-dominant industries against new companies, could suffer from regulation meant to favor incumbent players."}
