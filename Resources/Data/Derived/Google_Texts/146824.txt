NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HealthFleet, Inc., the first platform-as-a-service provider for healthcare, today announced the appointment of James R. Boyle as Chairman. Mr. Boyle was most recently President and CEO of Genworth Financial, Inc.’s (NYSE: GNW) U.S. Life Insurance division and was formerly President and CEO of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc.

“Jim is a proven business leader whose guidance and insights will enable HealthFleet to accelerate traction in the market and execute on the significant opportunity for innovative technology solutions within the healthcare sector,” said Bill Van Wyck, President and CEO of HealthFleet. “We are very excited to have Jim on board.”

The enormity of healthcare reform and the Affordable Care Act has forced providers, insurers, employers and consumers to align, creating significant technology gaps across the care continuum. For traditional healthcare services companies that struggle with the associated complexities and expense of these changes, HealthFleet provides a fast, cost-effective way to meet the growing demands of their customers and patients.

HealthFleet’s technology platform helps providers achieve long-term, sustained engagement for better results – most importantly, improved health and quality of care. The platform gives healthcare providers the unique ability to offer their programs and services online, filling technology gaps in order to triage patients into the right care, at the right time and place.

“I look forward to dedicating more time to HealthFleet. This company has quickly become a category leader, having developed a superior technology platform that allows customers and partners to deliver more cost-effective and specialized care-management programs. The need to provide more efficient, affordable healthcare is immense, and HealthFleet is poised to capitalize on this significant market opportunity,” said Boyle.
