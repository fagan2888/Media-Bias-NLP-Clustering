Scraping by on unemployment benefits, he\u2019s earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in hopes of securing a decent job.

At 14 percent for the past two years, the state\u2019s poverty rate is lower than the nationwide figure, which is 15.5 percent.\n\nAlthough the cost of living varies throughout the country, the poverty line is set on a national level. An annual income of about $12,000 or less would place a single person below the poverty line. The poverty level is about $24,000 for a family of four, with some variations depending on the number of children in the household and whether the householder is over 65 years old.\n\nLiving in Lincoln, Jamey House manages to get by on his $338 weekly unemployment check, the equivalent of $17,576 a year. The 40-year-old single father of two was among the 200 people laid off from Lincoln Paper & Tissue in December 2013 \u2013 two months after he bought a house.\n\nAfter about a year as a peer support worker, helping other laid-off mill employees get into school or apply for jobs, he took the opportunity to pursue the college degree he started after high school but never earned.\n\nWith a full course-load next semester, he\u2019ll only need two more classes for a bachelor\u2019s in business management. He thinks he\u2019ll be close enough to finishing to start looking for work in the spring, probably in banking.\n\nEven though House was among the people who made up Penobscot County\u2019s 18 percent poverty rate in 2014 \u2013 and will count toward the same statistic in 2015 \u2013 he feels like he has come a long way from having to buy fuel in 5-gallon containers to keep his house warm in the winter.\n\n\u201cWe survived,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a light at the end of the tunnel now.\u201d\n\nStill, he has to think twice about buying a snack at the store. And he draws out of his 401(k) retirement fund to make house payments.\n\n\u2018WORKING POOR\u2019 ALSO STRUGGLING\n\nPeople who were laid off aren\u2019t the only ones struggling to stay out of poverty. In addition to the unemployed are the underemployed, the so-called \u201cworking poor,\u201d whose low wages or lack of work hours \u2013 even sometimes with multiple jobs \u2013 keep them hovering around the poverty line.\n\nKara Hay, chief executive officer at Penquis, the Bangor-based community action agency, said the job growth there has been in the service sector, so people who have found employment after getting laid off from manufacturing jobs are often making a lot less than they had.\n\nRecent college graduates are also struggling to find jobs that match their education level \u2013 and that can help pay off their student loans, Hay said. But even those who can cobble together a living by working a couple of part-time jobs are not putting anything away in savings.\n\n\u201c(They\u2019re) one disaster, one event away from falling below the poverty line,\u201d she said.\n\nGail Webb, 64, of Fort Fairfield knows exactly what it\u2019s like to have tragedy strike while trying to stay afloat.\n\nWebb had worked for 20 years as the business manager for a car dealership when the automotive industry collapsed at the start of the recession. Because most of her salary came from commissions, she couldn\u2019t afford to keep working there.\n\n\u201cMy income was slashed in half,\u201d she said.\n\nShe got a job as an office manager for a construction company, but then hard times hit that industry, too, and she was laid off.\n\nLike House, she decided to go back to school, pursued a degree from Northern Maine Community College in residential construction and had plans to become a housing inspector. Then, the month before she graduated, her grandchildren\u2019s father died in a car accident, and her daughter asked her to become the legal guardian of the three girls.\n\nYears earlier than she had planned, Webb started collecting Social Security benefits and lives off $1,100 a month, though the children get their own checks, too.\n\nStill, she\u2019s had to remodel her house to make room for the kids, ages 7 to 16, and a good chunk of her money has to go toward gas for taking them to school and appointments.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two years and things are starting to feel more normal for the kids. Once the oldest gets her driver\u2019s license, Webb says she hopes she can start looking for a job.\n\n\u201cI am still hopeful that I can use my degree and work part time,\u201d she said.\n\nEFFECTS OF AN AGING WORKFORCE\n\nAlthough the 2014 Census data show that Aroostook County, where Webb lives, had its highest poverty rate in years at 20.1 percent, the county\u2019s community action program is seeing signs of a turnaround.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, fewer people applied or were eligible for heating assistance and home weatherization projects, said Jason Parent, the program\u2019s executive director.\n\nHe said a bigger problem he\u2019s seen is employers struggling to fill open positions because of the aging population and consequent shrinking workforce.\n\nIn Washington County, however, the aging population is seen as a possible reason for the improved poverty rate, because there are fewer families with young children, who tend to struggle, said Charles Rudelitch, executive director of the Sunrise County Economic Council.\n\nThe state\u2019s easternmost county has also avoided layoffs at major employers, including the Woodland Pulp mill, which has been expanding its workforce, Rudelitch said.\n\nSomerset County has similarly enjoyed stability among its bigger businesses, including paper mills in Skowhegan and Madison, New Balance and Backyard Farms.\n\nHaving that base has enabled the county to start to move in a positive direction from what growth there has been in utilities, crude manufacturing and farming, said Heather Johnson, executive director of the Somerset Economic Development Corp.\n\nBut even though the poverty rate is improving, it\u2019s still a concern considering it\u2019s over 17 percent, the fifth highest in the state, Johnson said.\n\nThe state\u2019s inland counties tend to have the highest poverty rates, while they\u2019re lower along the coast, with the exceptions of Washington, the most remote coastal county, which peaked at 21.7 percent poverty in 2011, and Kennebec, the home of the state capital in central Maine where the poverty rate has hovered around the state average for several years.\n\nThe southern coastal counties of York and Cumberland, the state\u2019s hubs for business, would be the first to see job growth in the improving economy, said Ann Acheson, a research associate at the Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center in Orono.\n\nSTORIES OF PERSONAL \u2018RECOVERIES\u2019\n\nFarther up the coast in Lincoln, Knox, Waldo and Hancock counties, there\u2019s been an influx of well-off retirees, she said, which both draws down the poverty rate and helps the economy through their purchases and house projects.\n\nAnd even though it\u2019s only a seasonal impact, more people with expendable income coming from out of state has probably also helped these tourist destinations, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sense of growth and development in Belfast these days,\u201d Keith Small, executive director of Waldo Community Action Partners, said about the county seat.\n\nStorefronts have filled up, there\u2019s a shipyard that\u2019s poised to expand and a Massachusetts-based technology company has moved into town with the potential for 350 new jobs.\n\nResidents Bill and Heidi Littlefield went through their own personal recession and recovery.\n\nAfter nearly 18 years working for the same lumber company, Bill Littlefield, 59, was fired two years ago after a customer made a complaint about how he delivered an order.\n\nHe didn\u2019t qualify for unemployment, so he and his wife lived off his retirement savings and her Social Security benefits for half a year, until he got a job driving a tractor- trailer.\n\nHe was laid off five months later.\n\nThat left the Littlefields having to cut back on Christmas presents and only buying milk a half-gallon at a time.\n\nThen, in July, he got a gig through a temp agency coating snowplows for Fisher Engineering in Rockland. A month ago, he got hired on by the company and is making $3 an hour more than when he was delivering lumber.\n\nThere is about a 30-mile commute for the 50-hour-a-week job, but that\u2019s a small price to pay to be able to fill their grandchildren\u2019s Christmas wish lists this year without falling behind on their bills.\n\n\u201cWe have just less worry,\u201d Heidi Littlefield said, \u201cmore peace of mind.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While statewide, the poverty rate has leveled off, north and inland, many are struggling to shake off the effects of the recession.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "While statewide, the poverty rate has leveled off, north and inland, many are struggling to shake off the effects of the recession.", "title": "Some Mainers are still wondering ... what economic recovery? - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/773719_233387-poverty-1228-5-KB.jpg", "height": 723}, "updated_time": "2015-12-28T08:34:43-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/12/27/mainers-still-wondering-recovery/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While statewide, the poverty rate has leveled off, north and inland, many are struggling to shake off the effects of the recession.", "title": "Some Mainers are still wondering ... what economic recovery? - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/773719_233387-poverty-1228-5-KB.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-12-27T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-28T08:34:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "At 14 percent for the past two years, the state\u2019s poverty rate is lower than the nationwide figure, which is 15.5 percent.\nThe statewide poverty rate has leveled off after reaching a recent high of 14.4 percent in 2012.\nMeanwhile, the coast is seeing an uptick in tourism and some rural areas have had growth in the agricultural industry that\u2019s helping draw down the poverty rate.\nMost parts of the state have started to recover from the recession, according to newly released information about poverty in each Maine county.\nBut even though the poverty rate is improving, it\u2019s still a concern considering it\u2019s over 17 percent, the fifth highest in the state, Johnson said."}
