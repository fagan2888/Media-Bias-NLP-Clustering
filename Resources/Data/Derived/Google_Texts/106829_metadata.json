At the time, Nore asked Obama whether he'd continue stem cell research during his presidency, to which the president responded he would.\n\nIn February 2013, Nore was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. He was 14 years old. Nore said he was \"cancer free\" by that summer, but was later re-diagnosed.\n\n\"I had to have a stem cell transplant. I beat the battle once again,\" Nore wrote to the president.\n\n\"I would like to thank you very much for continuing the research.
