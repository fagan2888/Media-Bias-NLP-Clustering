It said between 4 million and 9 million fewer people will have employment-based health insurance each year from 2017 through 2026 than would have had such coverage if the ACA had never been enacted.\n\nTo be sure, factors other than the ACA will contribute to the decline in employer-based coverage, including insurance premiums that are rising faster than wages. Put simply, it will be cheaper for some employers to raise pay than to continue paying for health benefits.\n\nThe decline of employer-based health insurance benefits will have an effect on the federal budget, the CBO reported\u2014for the better.\n\nEmployer-provided health insurance represents one of Uncle Sam\u2019s largest tax breaks. The federal tax system provides preferential treatment for health care coverage that people receive from their employers\u2014a subsidy that costs the federal government billions in tax revenue every year.\n\nThe CBO projected the shift away from employer-provided health insurance will reduce the federal budget deficit by a total of $248 billion over the 2017\u20132026 period, primarily by boosting federal tax receipts.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "4994136bc793ed9927db8cecc3707c22"}, "twitter": {"description": "For all the talk of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effect on the health  insurance marketplace, employer-provided benefits remain the backbone of  the American health insurance system, according to a new report by the  Congressional Budget Office.", "title": "CBO: Fewer employers to offer health benefits", "site": "@bizdaily", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bizdaily"}, "description": "For all the talk of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effect on the health insurance marketplace, employer-provided benefits remain the backbone of the American health insurance system, according to a new report by the Congressional Budget Office.
