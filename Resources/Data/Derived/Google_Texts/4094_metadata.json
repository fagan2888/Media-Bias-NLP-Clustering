There were more than 12.6 million victims of identity theft in the U.S. last year, and the federal government\u2019s collection of Americans\u2019 personal health and financial data offers a treasure trove of possibilities for criminals.\n\nThis week, the Los Angeles Times reported an Alahambra, Calif., medical clinic admitted that two laptops that contained more than 700,000 patient medical records were stolen during an office break-in.\n\nThe thieves have not been caught.\n\n\u201cWe regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause our patients,\u201d AHMC Healthcare Inc. said in a statement.\n\nThe medical clinic told patients to place fraud alerts on their credit files.\n\nThe highly sensitive nature of the doctor-patient relationship is one reason why there was resistance by lawmakers to force doctors to go to all-electronic records. Under the new requirements, the government will inquire into virtually every recess of what has been considered private.\n\nDoctors will ask patients and their children questions such as \u201cIs there a gun in your home?\u201d and \u201cAre you depressed?\u201d The answers will be added to a patient\u2019s medical data and subsequently to each American\u2019s government file.\n\nAgencies like the IRS will also be handed the personal data from those supervising health care.\n\nThis week, it was revealed that the Obamacare website informs users that their Social Security number, birthday and income will all be shared with the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Administration.\n\nPrivate\n\nThe controversy already has generated a back-and-forth in Congress, where a Colorado Democrat, Diana DeGette, criticized a Republican for having concerns about privacy.\n\nU.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, had charged that the source code for the Obamacare website includes the statement that Americans will have \u201cno reasonable expectation of privacy about communication or data stored on the system.\u201d\n\nThe code cannot be viewed by a user on Healthcare.gov, he reported, but it is in the code and violates the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s not HIPAA-compliant; admit it,\u201d Barton charged Cheryl Campbell of CGI Federal, which was contracted to work on the site. \u201cYou\u2019re under oath. Your company is the company that put this together. We\u2019re telling every American \u2026 that you sign up for this or even attempt to, you have no expectation of privacy. That is a direct contradiction of HIPAA and you know it.\u201d\n\nUntil now, doctor-patient privacy has been maintained with paper patient files and flip charts. The sales pitch to get lawmakers to coerce doctors and hospitals to go with electronic records initially met stiff resistance.\n\nBut the argument was that the paper record system had flaws. Patients were filling prescriptions from one doctor that were contra-indicated by a prescription from another doctor, which could have tragic outcomes.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich endorsed the idea of electronic records. He described how Hurricane Katrina displaced Louisiana residents, many of whom had to spend months away from home.\n\nWhile they could go to a Jiffy Lube and find their car records there, medical records, limited to one location, had been destroyed by the hurricane, he explained.\n\nAnticipating\n\nWhat Gingrich and lawmakers didn\u2019t anticipate was Obamacare.\n\nBruce Schneier, security technologist and fellow at the Berkman Institute for Internet and Society, told WND medical privacy is \u201cone of the most difficult issues in the information age.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe information is incredibly valuable to society \u2013 not just to deliver health care, but for research purposes \u2013 yet highly personal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to figure out how to navigate between these two poles and how to secure the data however it is stored. It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\n\nCalifornia state assemblyman Tim Donnelly, candidate for governor of California, reported to WND that people \u201care being hit from two directions, and it is hard to say which is more dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are being forced by Obamacare to hand over every bit of their most private data to the government,\u201d he said. \u201cLiterally every major branch of government will have access to use that data as they please. Now we learn that the same data can be taken by thieves from any local healthcare facility, simply by stealing a laptop. With these rules, privacy, as Americans have known it, is gone.\u201d\n\nDonnelly warned of \u201ccorrupt bureaucrats and politicians using the collected data against political opponents.\u201d\n\nMitt Romney\u2019s private contribution to the National Organization for Marriage was leaked by an IRS agent. The breach was turned into a campaign issue, but no one has ever been prosecuted.\n\nThe recent NSA data-mining scandal brought to light how many contractors have access to government data and how that data can be leaked for the entire world to see.\n\nOne of the biggest fears for Americans has always been the IRS audit. People have joked and many have charged that if you criticize the government, you might be audited. Politicians claim the thinking to be the fodder of paranoid conspiracy theorists.\n\nDr. Dathan Paterno of Park Ridge Psychological Services, told WND that he is concerned with how these data may be used in the hands of the government.\n\n\u201cNow, if you run for office, for example, someone could leak your private medical information or what was disclosed 10 years ago to a psychologist, and you could be ruined,\u201d he said.\n\nPaterno asked: Who would run for public office or even step forward to criticize the government knowing this?\u201d\n\nPrivacy experts point out that Democrats who control the administration have all of the data now, but in a matter of time, Republicans could control it and use it to go after Democrats.\n\nThe payoff\n\nA top executive with a leading EMR company, who asked not to be identified, said the electronic files are here to stay. He insists that as with most advances in technology, it\u2019s primarily a good thing.\n\nHe said electronic data provides better care, reduces redundancy and if pooled correctly with proper procedures to protect individuals\u2019 rights, advances research.\n\nBut he said there can be problems \u201cwhen Uncle Sam makes it mandatory, as it is in Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has paid out over $16 billion in stimulus money to doctors and institutions to buy these systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is only the beginning. It will easily be five to eight times that by the time they are done.\u201d\n\nHe noted that to qualify for the payments over a four to five year period, certain objectives must be met.\n\n\u201cFirst year it is pretty simple \u2013 collect certain demographics, age, race, etc. Each year it gets a little more complicated and more information needs to be collected.\u201d\n\nHe said institutions \u201care basically being forced onto systems that are required to collect data and now Obamacare is forcing the individuals to supply all that info as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the government offers $44,000 to $64,000 per doctor to buy these systems, it\u2019s pretty enticing,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when most don\u2019t really want to have anything to do with it.\u201d\n\nDoctors are enticed by Obamacare\u2019s government payouts to convert to an electronic system. A medical practice can receive up to $44,000 in Medicare incentives and up to $63,750 in Medicaid incentives for every physician in that practice.\n\nThe risk\n\nA payoff like that is hard to pass up, and those who still choose to put off converting to an electronic system will see penalties under the Affordable Care Act. A one-percent penalty on Medicare reimbursements begins in 2015 but increases each year. After time, up to 95 percent of Medicare reimbursements to practices will be withheld as a penalty for not converting to an electronic system.\n\nAndy Lemons, an OB/GYN in Birmingham, Ala., told WND that most professionals don\u2019t like being forced to do anything, especially when an untrustworthy government is acting in a \u201cBig Brother role.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe safety of sensitive and private info should carry greater weight than the convenience,\u201d he said. \u201cI often could benefit from access to reliable past medical records, but surely a safer format exists.\u201d\n\nA major concern of Lemons is the way that insurance companies could use data against future applicants.\n\n\u201cWhat about future life insurance from a genetic issue that was previously assured to be confidential \u2026 what about your offspring who haven\u2019t even applied for coverage, or policies? The abuse by agencies is a real threat, and the slope to its worsening is far too slippery.\u201d\n\nLemons said he has heard stories of sexual orientation, gun ownership and other private issues being part of the questionnaires.\n\n\u201cThe potential for misuse, and profiling is extreme \u2026 and accountability for violations has already proven lacking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe remainder of the proverbial iceberg will likely prove worse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Americans are increasing their calls for lawmakers to fight Obamacare because of worries over an abundance of personal information that soon will be in the government\u2019s hands.
