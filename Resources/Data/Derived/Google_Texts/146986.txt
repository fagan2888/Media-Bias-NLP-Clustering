At the United Nations General Assembly Thursday in New York City, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu renewed his warning about Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb. Considering the recent passage of the nuclear agreement with Iran, the prime minister’s comments were especially powerful.

“Iran is setting up dozens of terror cells,” Netanyahu said. “Imagine what they will do after the sanctions are lifted.”

“Unmuzzled,” Iran will “go on the prowl, devouring more and more prey,” he said.

In the wake of the nuclear deal, Netanyahu remarked, Iran is spending billions on weapons and satellites.

“Do you think Iran is doing that to advance peace?”

That question was perhaps a direct response to President Obama’s claim on Monday that the Iran Deal will ensure their nuclear program is “peaceful.”

Netanyahu rejected such assurances, saying the agreement does nothing to block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon.

“When bad behavior is awarded, it only gets worse,” he said. “I’m gravely concerned the nuclear deal with Iran will prove to be the marriage certificate of that unholy union.”

Netanyahu acknowledged some "well-intentioned people" believe the deal is the only way to block Iran’s path to the bomb. Yet, “the best intentions don’t prevent the worst outcomes.”

In the most powerful part of his speech, Netanyahu stopped to directly address the nations in attendance.

“If Iran’s rulers were working to destroy your countries, perhaps you’d be somewhat less enthusiastic about the deal,” he said. “If Iran’s terror proxies were firing thousands of rockets at your cities, perhaps you’d be more measured in your praise.”

“And yet the response from every one of you here, utter silence," he said. "Deafening silence.”

After those remarks, he stood at the podium and glared at the delegates around the room for about one minute.
