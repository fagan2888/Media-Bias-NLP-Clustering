But he was deemed 100 percent recovered in late April last year and helped lead Canada to the World Championship gold medal.\n\nHe might again play for Canada this spring \u2014 along with fellow center Matt Duchene and defenseman Tyson Barrie \u2014 if his knee injury isn\u2019t more than a sprain and won\u2019t require offseason surgery.\n\nThe other banged-up Avs are defensemen Eric Gelinas (elbow) and Nikita Zadorov (head), plus others who have been out for most of the season.\n\nRepeat performance. Early in last Tuesday\u2019s game in St. Louis, Avs center Carl Soderberg flipped the puck into the stands from the defensive zone. The delay-of-game penalty led to David Backes\u2019 power-play goal and a 1-0 lead for the Blues.\n\nEarly in Sunday\u2019s game, it was Avs winger Gabe Landeskog who flipped the puck out of play from the D-zone. And it led to Backes\u2019 power-play goal and a 1-0 Blues lead.\n\nIn both cases, Soderberg and Landeskog tried making indirect passes with little pressure.\n\nFootnotes. The Avs made two lineup changes from Friday\u2019s 4-2 loss to visiting Washington: Defenseman Zach Redmond replaced Zadorov, and Jack Skille played on the fourth line in place of Andreas Martinsen. \u2026 Among the playoff-bound Blues\u2019 scratches were goalie Brian Elliott, defenseman Jay Bouwmeester (upper-body injury) and forwards Robby Fabbri (lower-body injury) and Ryan Reaves. \u2026 The Avs depart for Nashville, Tenn., on Monday and begin a two-game trip Tuesday against the Predators, who lost to Colorado 4-3 at home last week. Colorado visits Dallas on Thursday before Saturday\u2019s regular-season finale against the visiting Anaheim Ducks.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nathan MacKinnon misses 7th game in a row", "title": "Nathan MacKinnon misses 7th game in a row", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/03/nathan-mackinnon-misses-7th-game-in-a-row/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__Nathan-Mackinnonp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__Nathan-Mackinnonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-03T20:44:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:14:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02f6\"", "article_summary": "Early in last Tuesday\u2019s game in St. Louis, Avs center Carl Soderberg flipped the puck into the stands from the defensive zone.\nEarly in Sunday\u2019s game, it was Avs winger Gabe Landeskog who flipped the puck out of play from the D-zone.\nMacKinnon missed the last 18 games of the 2014-15 season with a broken foot.\nBut he was deemed 100 percent recovered in late April last year and helped lead Canada to the World Championship gold medal.\n\u2026 Among the playoff-bound Blues\u2019 scratches were goalie Brian Elliott, defenseman Jay Bouwmeester (upper-body injury) and forwards Robby Fabbri (lower-body injury) and Ryan Reaves."}
