I think Donald Trump\u2019s a disaster. I think he\u2019ll hurt the country and we\u2019ll lose in a landslide. But I will still pledge to support the nominee because I think Hillary Clinton is the worst person on the planet to run the country. And I think emails have cemented the notion that she just has bad judgment.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he would still be onstage firing up crowds to support Trump even though he thinks he\u2019s a disaster and would campaign with him, Rand answered, \u201cWell, the thing is is that there are relative degrees of enthusiasm when you support the nominee. And I won\u2019t be enthusiastic, but I will support the nominee and I will pledge to support the nominee. But I think in the meantime, the next six months, I\u2019m going to try to convince people that Donald Trump is a fake conservative. He\u2019s not really conservative at all. He\u2019s been for a single-payer healthcare system, he\u2019s been for higher taxes. And really what bugs me the most is his business model has been using eminent domain to take private property from small property owners, gobble that up in order for him to make money. And I think that is something antithetical t0 the notion of freedom.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul stated that he would support fellow candidate Donald Trump if he won the nomination, but \"I won't be enthusiastic\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul stated that he would support fellow candidate Donald Trump if he won the nomination, but \"I won't be enthusiastic\"", "title": "Rand: I'd Support 'Disaster' Trump If He's The Nominee, But 'I Won't Be Enthusiastic' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Rand-Hannity-93-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/03/rand-id-support-disaster-trump-if-hes-the-nominee-but-i-wont-be-enthusiastic/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul stated that he would support fellow candidate Donald Trump if he won the nomination, but \"I won't be enthusiastic\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Rand-Hannity-93-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Rand: I'd Support 'Disaster' Trump If He's The Nominee, But 'I Won't Be Enthusiastic' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Rand", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rand Paul", "published_time": "2015-09-03T21:01:54-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e9d\"", "article_summary": "And I won\u2019t be enthusiastic, but I will support the nominee and I will pledge to support the nominee.\nI think Donald Trump\u2019s a disaster.\nBut I think in the meantime, the next six months, I\u2019m going to try to convince people that Donald Trump is a fake conservative.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERKentucky Senator and GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul stated that he would support fellow candidate Donald Trump if he won the nomination, but \u201cI won\u2019t be enthusiastic\u201d on Thursday\u2019s \u201cHannity\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nBut I will still pledge to support the nominee because I think Hillary Clinton is the worst person on the planet to run the country."}
