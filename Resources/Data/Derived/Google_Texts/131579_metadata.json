Its reasoning is very dubious. Although it was addressed to schools and colleges, if its reasoning is accepted, it could lead to lawsuits against private employers under Title VII. Past bathroom disputes have led to costly lawsuits and substantial settlements against businesses.\n\nThe decree was issued pursuant to Title IX, a federal statute that only bans sex discrimination in education. The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, where I used to work, now interprets the federal ban on sex discrimination as also covering discrimination based on gender identity: \u201cGender identity refers to an individual\u2019s internal sense of gender. A person\u2019s gender identity may be different from or the same as the person\u2019s sex assigned at birth.\u201d\n\nThis interpretation is very strange, because one\u2019s internal gender identity is not always the same thing as one\u2019s sex. That\u2019s why transgender people go to the trouble of getting a sex change: they are not the sex they want to be.\n\nIt\u2019s also why legislation has been proposed in Congress to expand federal antidiscrimination laws to cover gender identity, rather than just sex. Congress has declined to pass such legislation, but now, the Obama administration has effectively legislated on its own, by decree, in violation of the Constitutional separation of powers, which vests legislative power in the legislative branch, not the executive branch.\n\nPrivate employers will also face pressure to follow the Obama administration\u2019s demands, since the Obama administration\u2019s reasoning is not education-specific, and could thus easily be extended from Title IX (governing schools) to Title VII (governing workplaces). Title IX and Title VII are often (but not always) interpreted the same. And the Obama Justice Department has already ordered North Carolina to apply these requirements to workplaces (based on reasoning that a former Justice Department lawyer describes as collapsing into \"incoherence\").\n\nThis decree is bureaucratic overreaching, because Title IX forbids sex discrimination, not discrimination based on gender identity. And it forbids discrimination, not failure to accommodate. Courts have rejected efforts to convert federal antidiscrimination statutes into duties to affirmatively accommodate, as they made clear in upholding California\u2019s ban on race and gender-based affirmative action against Title IX and Title VII preemption challenges. (See, e.g., Coalition for Economic Equality v. Wilson (1997)). While the Constitution may provide transgender people with certain additional rights, the Obama administration lacks jurisdiction over such matters under the Title IX statute.\n\nI am sympathetic to many requests made by transgender students as a policy matter. It makes more sense for a male-looking transgender student to use the boy\u2019s restroom, or a female-looking transgender student to use the girl\u2019s restroom, regardless of their biological sex. Requiring otherwise would likely increase, rather than reduce, student discomfort. The last thing we need is bathroom police. But federal bureaucrats only have jurisdiction to enforce Title IX, not to set new policies. Title IX does not mandate national central planning for bathrooms.\n\nMoreover, it appears that the Obama administration will require schools to allow even male-looking biologically-male students to use women\u2019s locker rooms, not just female-looking transgender students, since it warns schools that its guidance covers even a student who \u201cdoes not conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity,\u201d and its demands expressly cover \u201clocker rooms,\u201d not just \u201crestrooms.\u201d It also warns that schools \u201cmay not require transgender students \u2026 to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so.\u201d It also covers dorm rooms, perhaps impeding the opportunity of students to select a roommate of their own biological sex: it states that a \u201cschool must allow transgender students to access housing consistent with their gender identity and may not require transgender students \u2026 to disclose personal information when not required of other students.\u201d\n\nThis demand may spark privacy lawsuits against school districts by the parents of female students. An Illinois school district that complied with similar demands by the Office for Civil Rights is currently being sued (along with the Obama administration) by a group of parents of teenage girls.\n\nAs law professor Eugene Volokh notes in the Washington Post, even liberal Justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg once emphasized that constitutional privacy rights require that separate bathrooms and locker rooms be provided for students of different sexes. Similarly, the Title IX statute itself allows sex-specific facilities, providing that \u201cnothing contained [in Title IX] shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution \u2026 from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1686. The Education Department\u2019s regulations implementing Title IX accordingly have for more than 40 years permitted the provision of \u201cseparate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.33.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s position today goes beyond what even liberal judges mandated in the past, out of misguided deference to Obama administration bureaucrats, since it applies not simply to restrooms, but locker rooms, where the privacy ramifications are much greater. As Professor Volokh observes, on April 19, an appeals court ruled in G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board that \u201cschools must let biologically female students who identify as male use men\u2019s restrooms.\u201d The court in that case said that \u201conly restroom use is at issue in this case,\u201d not locker rooms.\n\nThat 2-to-1 ruling by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (with Obama appointees in the majority)\n\ndidn\u2019t hold that this is required by the Constitution, but rather deferred to the Education Department\u2019s interpretation of the department\u2019s regulation on the subject. (The regulation, which interprets the federal Title IX provisions, and which generally forbids sex discrimination but allows sex-segregated restrooms, applies to any schools that get federal funds.) The court also held that the high school\u2019s proposed accommodation of G.G., which would have allowed G.G. (as well as other students) to use three single-stall unisex restrooms that it created, was inadequate, because it still barred G.G. from using the ordinary multi-stall boys\u2019 restrooms.\n\nG.G. is biologically female, and has not had gender reassignment surgery, but identifies as male; G.G. would thus be able to use the boys\u2019 high school restroom.\n\nThus, the court upheld the Education Department\u2019s 2015 opinion letter redefining \u201csex\u201d to include not just one\u2019s biological sex, or sex after gender reassignment surgery, but also your self-identification as being a member of the sex opposite your physical characteristics. In dissent, Judge Paul Niemeyer noted that this new definition of \u201csex\u201d is internally inconsistent, \u201cillogical and unworkable,\u201d and will lead to constitutional privacy violations in future scenarios involving locker rooms.\n\nA former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel points out some of the internal inconsistencies in Title IX created by the Education Department\u2019s interpretation in commentaries you can find here, at Parts 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6.\n\nAs Professor Volokh notes, the judges in the majority \u201cdidn\u2019t squarely consider the argument that this would undermine the constitutional privacy rights of other students; some courts have said that there is a constitutional right not to be seen when undressed by members of the opposite sex.\u201d Failing to consider the issue may well have been a mistake: Under the canon of constitutional doubts, a court is not supposed to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the law if it would raise even potential constitutional problems. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 923 (1995) (rejecting interpretation by Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division based on potential constitutional violation that would have resulted); NAMUDNO v. Holder, 129 S. Ct. 2504, 2513 (2009)(same).\n\nThis ruling was wrong to allow bureaucrats to summarily redefine what sex means, since that is the most foundational term in the statute, and thus is not a mere detail whose meaning Congress would have delegated to bureaucrats, especially to change without notice and comment. By redefining \u201csex\u201d for purposes of the bathroom regulation, they effectively redefined it throughout the statute. As the court itself put it, \u201c\u2018sex\u2019 should be construed uniformly throughout Title IX and its implementing regulations.\u201d\n\nThe court deferred to an Education Department 2015 opinion letter reinterpreting what \u201csex\u201d meant in its bathroom regulation, to instead mean one\u2019s internal \u201cgender identity.\u201d That letter, like today\u2019s decree from the Obama administration, never went through notice and comment. As a result, the Education Department never had to think through and address some of the practical problems identified by school districts and state officials in their briefs with the court (such as the potential pitfalls of relying on students\u2019 asserted self-definition, rather than objectively-verifiable gender characteristics, such as biology, or sex-change surgery), which it would have had to address if it had allowed school districts to comment on the requirements contained in the letter.\n\nThe court purported to rely on Auer deference, which sometimes allows an agency to avoid notice and comment when it is providing guidance about the meaning of its own regulation, rather than a statute passed by Congress. But the word \u201csex\u201d appears not just in the bathroom regulation, but the statute itself. Thus, by redefining the word \u201csex,\u201d the Education Department was not simply reinterpreting its own regulation, but redefining the statute. But that could legally be done, if at all, only after notice and comment \u2014 which never occurred. The court was wrong to allow that. It was like letting the tail wag the dog.\n\nEffectively, the court applied not Auer deference, but Auer deference squared, going well beyond the degree of deference allowed by the Supreme Court\u2019s Auer and Seminole Rock decisions.\n\nAnd redefining what sex means is likely beyond the authority of the Education Department to begin with, even with notice and comment. It\u2019s analogous to the Supreme Court refusing to defer to the Obama administration about whether health care tax credits were available in most states under the Affordable Care Act, which it refused to do for an issue that basic to the statute, instead deciding the issue on its own. See King v. Burwell, 135 S.Ct. 2480, 2489 (2015). Just as Congress does not \u201chide elephants in mouseholes,\u201d Whitman v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001), it does not delegate to agencies the ability to rewrite basic statutory terms simply by using one of those terms in an obscure bathroom regulation that imposed no obligations on regulated entities (and thus could not be challenged by them), and then later reconstruing it to have a very different meaning (especially when the regulation did not implement agency policy preferences that it is allowed to rethink, but rather was adopted to accommodate constitutional privacy rights outside the agency\u2019s control).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yesterday, the Obama administration issued a \u201cdecree\u201d not simply banning discrimination against transgender people, but also effectively mandating affirmative a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-transgender-decree-usurps-legislative-powers-rewrites-title-ix-statute", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/1b/00/1b00bd55ef35934e71e5f2d5cb8a8341.jpg?itok=XFBQ9esx", "type": "article", "title": "Obama transgender decree usurps legislative powers, rewrites Title IX statute"}, "twitter": {"site": "@examinercom", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/1b/00/1b00bd55ef35934e71e5f2d5cb8a8341.jpg?itok=XFBQ9esx", "description": "Yesterday, the Obama administration issued a \u201cdecree\u201d not simply banning discrimination against transgender people, but also effectively mandating affirmative accommodation of them in terms of things", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama transgender decree usurps legislative powers, rewrites Title IX statute"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2016-05-14T09:33:03-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Government, dear colleague letter, Transgender Issues, HB 2, bathroom access, Civil Rights Division", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Similarly, the Title IX statute itself allows sex-specific facilities, providing that \u201cnothing contained [in Title IX] shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution \u2026 from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.\u201d 20 U.S.C.\nTitle IX and Title VII are often (but not always) interpreted the same.\nThe decree was issued pursuant to Title IX, a federal statute that only bans sex discrimination in education.\nWhile the Constitution may provide transgender people with certain additional rights, the Obama administration lacks jurisdiction over such matters under the Title IX statute.\nBut federal bureaucrats only have jurisdiction to enforce Title IX, not to set new policies."}
