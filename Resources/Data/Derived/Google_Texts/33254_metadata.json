A fresh crop of outside banks has been setting up shop in the Charleston region, enticed by the growing population base and an economy that\u2019s outperforming most of its peers. Another big draw is the consolidation within the industry, which provides an opening in terms of clients and bankers for opportunistic lenders.\n\nSome of the newer names dotting the Charleston landscape include NewBridge Bank of Greensboro, N.C., and Memphis, Tenn.-based First Tennessee Bank, which hung out their shingles last year.\n\nLeading the Palmetto State charge for ServisFirst is Tom Trouche, who left the recently acquired First Citizens Bank & Trust in December, shortly after being named its top Southern coastal region executive.\n\nHis new employer\u2019s goal is to get to $300 million in assets, namely loans, in Charleston within five years.\n\nTrouche said he got to know ServisFirst and its CEO Broughton through a mutual acquaintance.\n\n\u201cWhat attracted me to them is the business model,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cIt really is a quite simple business model. It\u2019s traditional commercial banking services \u2014 loan-making and deposit-taking. ... Based on the calls we\u2019ve made to clients and prospects so far, it definitely resonates with them as well.\u201d\n\nThe bank was formed 10 years ago and went public in May. It has grown to $4 billion in assets spread over just 13 branches. It earned $52 million last year.\n\nUntil last week, ServisFirst had no operations in South Carolina. Its full-service retail locations are concentrated in its home state and just across the southern border, in Pensacola, Fla. It also has a loan production outpost to the north in Nashville. It\u2019s expanding east into Georgia this month, when it expects to close its $41 million purchase of Atlanta-based Metro Bank.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for good markets, growing markets in the Southeast where there is a pool of talented bankers who are ready to be able to deliver products without a lot of bureaucracy,\u201d Trouche said.\n\nWhat ServisFirst won\u2019t have is a dense brick-and-mortar network, though Trouche can see an office perhaps in the North Charleston-Summerville corridor and other high-growth areas.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s the future of banking,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the approach as \u201cbranch-light, technology-heavy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking right now on an iPhone,\u201d he said. \u201cMany would say that\u2019s your new branch.\u201d\n\nThe bank from Birmingham also is sniffing around other markets in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cCharleston is just the start,\u201d he said.\n\nTrouche\u2019s boss is shying away from outright acquisitions. Broughton, the chief executive officer, said ServisFirst intends \u201cto stick to our organic growth opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would certainly not buy a bank that can\u2019t grow faster than we can, so that rules out most of the banks that are for sale,\u201d Broughton told analysts during last week\u2019s earnings call.\n\nIn the end, surviving and thriving in a crowded market all comes down to pleasing the customer, Trouche added.\n\n\u201cWe all have the same products more or less,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s service where you outperform your competition.\u201d\n\nContact John McDermott at 937-5572", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charleston\u2019s banking business attracts new competitor in ServisFirst, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, Banking,Birmingham, Alabama,Charleston,First Citizens Bank,ServisFirst Bank,Tom Broughton,Tom Trouche", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The lineup of banks duking it out in the Charleston market continues to expand.", "title": "Charleston\u2019s banking business attracts new competitor in ServisFirst", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150125/150129719/charleston-x2019-s-banking-business-attracts-new-competitor-in-servisfirst", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150125/PC05/150129719/AR/0/AR-150129719.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150125/PC05/150129719/AR/0/AR-150129719.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The lineup of banks duking it out in the Charleston market continues to expand.", "title": "Charleston\u2019s banking business attracts new competitor in ServisFirst", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150125/PC05/150129719/AR/0/AR-150129719.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150129719}}, "keywords": "Charleston\u2019s banking business attracts new competitor in ServisFirst , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, Banking,Birmingham, Alabama,Charleston,First Citizens Bank,ServisFirst Bank,Tom Broughton,Tom Trouche", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-25T08:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T12:06:00Z", "author": "John McDermott"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The lineup of banks duking it out in the Charleston market continues to expand."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda59c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt is a great growth market,\u201d ServisFirst Bancshares CEO Tom Broughton said during a conference call with industry analysts Wednesday.\nThe lineup of banks duking it out in the Charleston market continues to expand.\nTrouche said he got to know ServisFirst and its CEO Broughton through a mutual acquaintance.\n\u201cWe found that office space is very expensive in Charleston, which is a sign that it\u2019s a really good market,\u2019 he said.\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s good potential growth in South Carolina.\u201dBroughton\u2019s bullish outlook is based in part on an unusual yardstick."}
