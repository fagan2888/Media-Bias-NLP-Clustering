Donald Trump\u2019s fondness for them is changing habits and causing consternation in newsrooms, while challenging political traditions.\n\nTwo organizations are circulating petitions to encourage Sunday morning political shows to hang up on Trump. Some prominent holdouts, like Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace, refuse to do on-air phoners. Others argue that a phone interview is better than no interview at all.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nExcept in news emergencies, producers usually avoid phoners because television is a visual medium \u2013 a face-to-face discussion between a newsmaker and questioner is preferable to a picture of an anchor listening to a disembodied voice.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Trump likes them. There\u2019s no travel or TV makeup involved; if he wishes to, Trump can talk to Matt Lauer without changing out of his pajamas. They often put an interviewer at a disadvantage, since it\u2019s harder to interrupt or ask follow-up questions, and impossible to tell if a subject is being coached.\n\nFace-to-face interviews let viewers see a candidate physically react to a tough question and think on his feet, said Chris Licht, executive producer of \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d Sometimes that\u2019s as important as what is being said.\n\nTrump tends to take over phone interviews and can get his message out with little challenge, Wallace said.\n\n\u201cThe Sunday show, in the broadcast landscape, I feel is a gold standard for probing interviews,\u201d said Wallace, host of \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201dThe idea that you would do a phone interview, not face-to-face or not by satellite, with a presidential candidate \u2013 I\u2019d never seen it before, and I was quite frankly shocked that my competitors were doing it.\u201d\n\nSince Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015, Wallace has conducted three in-person interviews with him on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d and four via satellite.\n\nChuck Todd, host of NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d has done phoners with Trump but now said he\u2019s decided to stick to in-person interviews on his Sunday show. He\u2019s no absolutist, though.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much better viewer experience when it\u2019s in person,\u201d Todd said. \u201cSatellite and phoners are a little harder, there\u2019s no doubt about it. But at the end of the day, you\u2019ll take something over nothing.\u201d\n\nMorning news shows do phoners most frequently. At the outset of the campaign, Trump was ratings catnip. The ratings impact of a Trump interview has since settled down, but it\u2019s still hard to turn him down. He\u2019s the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination. He\u2019s news.\n\nThere appear to be no network policies; different shows on the same network have different philosophies. Licht has turned Trump down for phoners on CBS but concedes there may be exceptions for breaking news. \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d in fact, aired Trump commenting by phone following Tuesday\u2019s attack in Belgium.\n\nSince the campaign began, Trump has appeared for 29 phone interviews on the five Sunday political panel shows, according to the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America. Through last Sunday, ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d has done it 10 times, CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d seven and six times each on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Trump phoned in an 11th time to \u201cThis Week,\u201d calling from Florida. The program repeatedly flashed a stock Trump photo while the candidate demanded an overhaul of NATO, blamed rival Ted Cruz for the bitter feud targeting each other\u2019s wife and complained about the Republican Party\u2019s delegate selection process.\n\nNone of the news shows have done phoners with Cruz, John Kasich, Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, said Media Matters, which is urging that the practice be discontinued. Cruz and Clinton declined ABC\u2019s invitation to speak by phone or in person for the network\u2019s most recent Sunday program.\n\nThe activist group MomsRising said the disparity \u201csends the message that some candidates can play by different rules, without consequences, and that\u2019s just un-American.\u201d A study by mediaQuant and The New York Times estimated that Trump has received the equivalent of $1.9 billion in free advertising given the media attention paid to his campaign.\n\nA Trump spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nWhat\u2019s unclear is whether other candidates were denied opportunities given to Trump.\n\nCNN chief executive Jeff Zucker said Trump opponents frequently turn down interview requests. During an appearance on CNN last week, former GOP candidate Carly Fiorina complained about media attention paid to Trump, leading Anderson Cooper to shoot back: \u201cDonald Trump returned phone calls and was willing to do interviews, which was something your campaign, frankly, was unwilling to do.\u201d\n\nCruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier tweeted last week that she saw Trump being interviewed via phone on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d a day after Cruz was told that he couldn\u2019t do a phone interview with the show.\n\nFox said that since then, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d has offered to conduct a phone interview with Cruz five times and has been turned down each time. Cruz did appear in the studio Wednesday. Frazier did not return requests for comment.\n\nNBC\u2019s Todd believes that complaints about phoners are a surrogate for people who want to blame the media for Trump\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re shooting the messenger while you\u2019re ignoring what he is tapping into,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes a little silly when you look at the bigger picture here. The media is getting criticized for interviewing Donald Trump. If we weren\u2019t questioning him, we\u2019d be criticized for not questioning him.\u201d\n\nFor years, cautious candidates have tended to be stingy with press access. Trump is the complete opposite. In a fast-moving information age, he may be changing the expectations for how often a candidate submits to interviews.\n\nTodd doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a coincidence that he\u2019s had more access to Clinton during the past six weeks than he had during the six years she was in the Obama administration. Both Clinton and Cruz appeared in phone interviews following the Belgium attacks.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s opponents fall into two camps: Those who complain and continue to get crushed by the media wave, or those who grab a surfboard and try to ride it,\u201d said Mark McKinnon, veteran Republican political operative and co-host of Showtime\u2019s political road show, \u201cThe Circus.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In TV news, a telephone interview is typically frowned upon.
