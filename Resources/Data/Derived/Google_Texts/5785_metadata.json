Does he really believe there are GOP voters out there, even in mavericky New Hampshire, who will hear this and say, \u201cI hate the idea of electing a Republican who\u2019ll follow Obama\u2019s foreign policy, but damn do I respect him for his honesty\u201d?\n\nSpecial bonus mystery: Christie\u2019s positioning himself as one of the most muscular hawks in the field. If you\u2019re in the market for a strong hawk above all else, why would you prefer Christie to, say, Rubio after he said this?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one of those guys who\u2019s going to say to you, \u2018on Day One I will abrogate the agreement,\u2019\u201d Christie said, noting that the American president could not just act alone when China, Russia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom are also parties to the deal, should one emerge. \u201cOn Day One, I will look into it and try to decide, depending upon where we are at that moment.\u201d\u2026 \u201cIf I\u2019m saddled with the deal as president, then on the first day I\u2019ll be saying to my national security advisor, to my Secretary of State and to my head of national intelligence: give me all the information I need to let me know all the options I have to try to put this genie back in the bottle, and then we\u2019ll make a decision,\u201d he added\u2026 \u201cI have grave, grave doubts that this is an agreement I will be willing to stand behind, but I also don\u2019t want to be the kind of president who tells all of you something in a campaign and that either doesn\u2019t do it, hoping you forget that I told you I would actually do it on the first day,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, who does it only because I promised it, even if at that moment it\u2019s not what\u2019s in the best interests of America.\u201d\n\nHe would have quit the nuclear talks already in protest of Iran\u2019s bad faith if he were president now, he stressed, but a lot of good that\u2019ll do him. As I say, though, he\u2019s telling the truth here. He won\u2019t tear up a nuke agreement with Iran on day one, and neither will Rubio or Scott Walker or anyone else, no matter what they tell you to gain your vote. A new president isn\u2019t going to take the oath of office and then immediately turn around and extend a middle finger to America\u2019s European allies, none of whom will want to revisit the issue of Iran\u2019s nuclear program anytime soon. At a minimum, without strong evidence of an Iranian breach to justify the U.S. walking away, the rest of the so-called P5 will keep their sanctions relief for Iran in place, splitting the western alliance against Tehran and giving Iran a propaganda win. It\u2019s true that President Christie or President Rubio would move much more quickly than President Clinton to tear up the agreement if and when there is credible evidence of an Iranian violation, but this \u201cday one\u201d nonsense has to stop. Too bad only longshot candidates like this guy are sufficiently free to say so.\n\nSpeaking of Christie trying to impress hawks, here he is on MSNBC this morning arguing that the next terrorist attack on America should trigger congressional hearings into \u2026 Rand Paul. Er, why? He\u2019s held filibusters for something like 24 combined hours on drones and the NSA; anything he has to say about his counterterror policies in front of Congress has already been said in front of Congress. Besides, if any policy supported by Paul creates a security flaw that\u2019s exploited by terrorists, it\u2019ll have attained the force of law only because congressional majorities agreed with Paul to enact it. Does Christie want Congress to hold hearings into itself?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Telling it like it is.", "title": "Chris Christie: No, I won\u2019t promise to undo Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/06/chris-christie-no-i-wont-promise-to-undo-obamas-nuclear-deal-with-iran/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-06T23:21:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T20:28:21+00:00"}, "keywords": "Chris Christie, deal, Iran, Marco Rubio, nuclear, Obama, Scott Walker,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "If you\u2019re in the market for a strong hawk above all else, why would you prefer Christie to, say, Rubio after he said this?\nHe won\u2019t tear up a nuke agreement with Iran on day one, and neither will Rubio or Scott Walker or anyone else, no matter what they tell you to gain your vote.\nSpecial bonus mystery: Christie\u2019s positioning himself as one of the most muscular hawks in the field.\nAs I say, though, he\u2019s telling the truth here.\nToo bad only longshot candidates like this guy are sufficiently free to say so."}
