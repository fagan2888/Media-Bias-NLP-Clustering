The price tag spiked again in the third quarter, continuing a trend that began two years ago after years of declining D&O rates for health-care providers.\n\nFor midsized and large health systems, the average cost increase for D&O insurance renewals in the sector was 9.6 percent higher than in the second quarter. That\u2019s according to an analysis by insurance broker Marsh of renewal rates for its thousands of health-care D&O clients. For smaller health-care organizations ($150 million or less in assets or annual revenue and fewer than 1,000 employees), the rate climb reached 12.7 percent.\n\nA major cause of the costly trend is the rapid consolidation the health-care industry has undergone since passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, Marsh says. Many health-care provider organizations have come together in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), joint ventures and loose alliances and networks aimed at better coordinating services, reducing costs and improving the quality of care.\n\nThe health-care reform law promoted such cooperative behavior among health-care providers by, among other things, providing financial incentives to ACOs for reducing duplicative care to individual patients and otherwise holding down costs. To accomplish that, the affiliated entities share patient data and pricing information, says Mark Karlson, a Marsh managing director and leader of the firm\u2019s FINPRO health-care practice.\n\nBut in a case of government initiatives with conflicting agendas, those activities expose health-care providers to potential violations of antitrust regulations and laws. Indeed, the Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of the Justice Department have made clear that they intend to step up pursuit of antitrust cases in the health-care field. In Nov. 15 testimony before a House of Representatives subcommittee, FTC chair Edith Ramirez identified health care as a major area of focus and outlined the commission\u2019s efforts to promote competitiveness in the industry, including several lawsuits it has filed to block proposed hospital mergers.\n\n\u201cThe antitrust regulators are saying that they don\u2019t care what the Affordable Care Act says, their job is to enforce antitrust regulations and they\u2019re going to continue to do that unless ACA regulations are changed [to stop incentivizing antitrust behavior],\u201d says Karlson.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provides safe harbors for federally recognized ACOs with respect to antitrust matters, and the FTC has said it will generally recognize similar protections for such arrangements that are not federally recognized. That statement of intentions has yet to be tested, though. \u201cThere\u2019s a real question about whether [those protections] apply only to the formal, federally sponsored ACO models, or to the many private entities as well,\u201d Karlson says. \u201cAnd there are any number of things they can do with antitrust implications \u2014 business practices and arrangements with insurers and doctors that allow them to dominate a marketplace and keep competitors out.\u201d\n\nNot only are D&O insurance rates shooting up for health-care outfits, the coverage is being watered down. Insurers are providing lower policy limits for antitrust-related claims, establishing higher deductibles or covering only a portion of any claim, says Karlson.\n\nBeyond the potential for antitrust litigation, the new health-care cooperatives are creating new risk profiles for providers. For example, the most basic decisions related to forming or joining such an entity, including which organizations to partner with, the structure of the entity and how to share payments and expenses can carry substantial risk, Marsh says. And given the increasing number of contracts among hospitals, doctors, clinics and insurance companies arising from such arrangements, the potential for breach-of-contract suits where those relationships aren\u2019t going well is multiplied.\n\nAnother risk for the health-care cooperatives comes from their assumption of patient case-management reviews formerly done by insurers. Whereas before an insurer would intervene to say that a patient, for example, did not require a procedure or diagnostic test because it was duplicative, now the cooperatives are doing that in many cases, creating a new type of liability.\n\nThe changing environment means that D&O insurance rates for health-care companies will keep inflating for the foreseeable future, Karlson says: \u201cOn the heels of a marketplace where D&O rates had been getting cheaper for five to eight years, it\u2019s going to take several years of significant increases before underwriters get their book priced where they\u2019d like to see it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "aca, accountable care organization, acos, affordable care act, d&o, directors and officers insurance, mark karlson, marsh", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Competition among federal statutes may be a key factor in the skyrocketing cost of liability insurance for directors and officers of health-care companies.", "title": "Obamacare, antitrust laws make health-care D&O coverage cost soar.", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2013-12-19T16:27:01+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/risk-management/2013/12/competing-laws-boost-costs-health-firms/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Competition among federal statutes may be a key factor in the skyrocketing cost of liability insurance for directors and officers of health-care companies.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Obamacare, antitrust laws make health-care D&O coverage cost soar.", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "topicRoot": "Risk & Compliance", "topic": "Risk Management", "headline": "Competing Laws Boost D&O Costs for Health Firms", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Competing Laws Boost D&O Costs for Health Firms\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/risk-management\\/2013\\/12\\/competing-laws-boost-costs-health-firms\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-19 16:26:00\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-12-19 16:27:01\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24504,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"ACA\",\"Accountable Care Organization\",\"ACOs\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"D&amp;O\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"Regulation\",\"Risk &amp; Compliance\",\"Risk Management\"],\"image\":null}", "date": 20131219, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Risk Management", "tag": "Marsh", "published_time": "2013-12-19T16:26:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-19T16:27:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Competition among federal statutes may be a key factor in the skyrocketing cost of liability insurance for directors and officers of health-care companies."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca01\"", "article_summary": "But in a case of government initiatives with conflicting agendas, those activities expose health-care providers to potential violations of antitrust regulations and laws.\nFor smaller health-care organizations ($150 million or less in assets or annual revenue and fewer than 1,000 employees), the rate climb reached 12.7 percent.\nThe price tag spiked again in the third quarter, continuing a trend that began two years ago after years of declining D&O rates for health-care providers.\nThat\u2019s according to an analysis by insurance broker Marsh of renewal rates for its thousands of health-care D&O clients.\nBeyond the potential for antitrust litigation, the new health-care cooperatives are creating new risk profiles for providers."}
