Among those who have felt affected, more people say the law has hurt them than helped them, according to polling by National Public Radio and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nTwenty-six percent of U.S. adults say they have been personally harmed by the healthcare law since its passage \u2014 a fraction that likely reflects those in the poll who said they have noticed rising healthcare costs in the last several years.\n\nThis is not all the way NPR reported on its own poll. On Monday\u2019s Morning Edition, they waited until late in a seven-minute segment to mention the Obamacare part of their results on health care, and they completely avoided numbers, especially the notion that more feel harmed than helped:\n\n* STEVE INSKEEP, anchor: We\u2019re in the midst of implementing Obamacare, which is about insuring people but also about cutting down costs in the system. Has Obamacare made people\u2019s experiences any better or worse the last couple of years?\n\n* ALISON KODJAK, health reporter: Well, our poll shows that people think their care hasn\u2019t much changed in the last few years. The majority of them say that the law hasn\u2019t really affected them directly. They believe that it helps a lot of people. They hear that more people have insurance, but they say that it doesn\u2019t really help them specifically.\n\n* INSKEEP: Isn\u2019t that the political challenge that Obamacare has faced all along? It\u2019s designed to insure millions more people, which is very important. But there are many, many millions of others who don\u2019t necessarily experience a direct change?\n\n* KODJAK: Yeah, it is. And it \u2014 one of the problems is that there actually are a lot of additional benefits from Obamacare in people\u2019s insurance, but they don\u2019t see that directly. You get free mammograms. You get free colonoscopies. You get free birth control. If you had an illness, you can still buy insurance because they can\u2019t exclude you for a pre-existing condition. Those aren\u2019t apparent to most of the people that we surveyed.\n\nSo if Obamacare doesn\u2019t seem very popular, NPR wants its listeners to know that Americans still haven\u2019t figured out all the \u201cfree mammograms, free mammograms and free birth control\u201d that Obamacare provides. It\u2019s never Obama\u2019s fault. The people just don\u2019t know how great Obamacare is yet.\n\nNPR also didn\u2019t explain that its polling partners are liberal advocates for nationalized health care. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation helped Hillary Clinton organize forums to promote ClintonCare proposals. Robert Blendon of Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health was a Hillary health care adviser.\n\nEditor\u2019s note.
