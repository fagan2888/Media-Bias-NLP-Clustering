When it\u2019s warm enough, he usually sleeps in the park.\n\nAs he stood at Clark Street and Belden Avenue talking with a reporter for about an hour in the cold on a recent weekday, only two out of maybe 40 people who passed him stopped to help.\n\nEven then, the couple who stopped to give him a few quarters offer some unsolicited advice that sounded condescending, whether they intended it or not.\n\n\u201cThese are valuable, you know \u2014I have to do laundry.\u201d\n\nMost people don\u2019t acknowledge him at all. He is confident though, that there are plenty of compassionate people in the neighborhood, and he always gets by somehow.\n\nRobinson became homeless after the housing program that had been providing him a place to live lost funding and closed. In the meantime, he fought for three years to get disability support for physical problems and depression.\n\nRobinson is emblematic of a complicated persistent problem plaguing Chicago\u2019s streets even in affluent neighborhoods such as Lincoln Park: The mixture of homelessness, mental illness, and correctional and mental health systems ill-equipped and under-budgeted to deal with the resulting problems.\n\nIn last week\u2019s midterm election, 86 percent of Cook County voters supported an advisory ballot initiative for additional state funding for mental health services for Illinois residents. Yet public policy has not reflected that support with actual funding to help address the issue.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Illinois cut 31.7 percent of its overall general fund budget for mental health services, according to a report by the National Alliance on Mental Illness. And in 2012, Chicago closed six of its 12 community mental health centers, while Illinois closed two large state institutions.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait for the government,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIndividuals who can do it should try to help one person every month.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s and Illinois\u2019 actions are indicative of how mental health care has changed dramatically over the last half-century and led to a broader population of homeless who suffer from mental illness.\n\nDe-institutionalization began in the 1950s in response to deplorable conditions at large psychiatric institutions, and in part because of lack of funding. At the time, it was thought that smaller clinics and community organizations could better serve patients, and would be an improvement over the old asylum model.\n\nAs the World Health Organization has reported, research shows that the closure of mental health facilities not accompanied by the development of community services leaves a service vacuum.\n\nAnd unfortunately, that\u2019s exactly what has happened in Chicago.\n\nThe Mental Health Systems Act, passed in 1980 and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, was designed to provide federal support for community mental health programs in response to growing need generated by de-institutionalization. The Reagan administration repealed the act in 1981 in an effort to reduce spending, ending federal funding and leaving states responsible for mental health care with individual grants.\n\nAs a result, astounding numbers of people suffering from mental illness became homeless during the 1980s, as other social and economic factors pushed those living on the edge of poverty out into the streets.\n\nMental illness often brings about other challenges that hinder people\u2019s abilities to find and maintain employment and housing.\n\nAccording to the National Resource and Training Center on Homelessness and Mental Illness, about 20 percent to 25 percent of the single-adult homeless population suffers from some form of severe and persistent mental illness.\n\nPeople suffering from mental illness have a greater likelihood of becoming homeless and also a far greater chance of ending up in jail or prison, often as repeat offenders.\n\nCook County Sheriff Tom Dart is outspoken about the problem of mental illness at the Cook County Jail, which he referred to as the largest mental institution in the United States.\n\nWith more than 9,000 inmates on any given day, Dart estimateed between 25 percent to 35 percent have some form of mental illness.\n\nEvery few days posted at the top of the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s website is the percentage of arrestees who self-identified as mentally ill at intake that day. For Nov. 7, it was 36 percent.\n\nIn an interview with National Public Radio, Dart said many of the mentally ill inmates have nowhere else to go. They are usually charged with minor crimes, which are often committed in an effort to have a place to stay and be ensured access to medication.\n\nThe scene as described inside\u2014rows of severely ill people behind bars, leather restraints and a room with only a drain and bloody, scratched padded walls\u2014sounds much like the asylums of old.\n\nDart insisted that in addition to the humane concerns involved, it costs far more money to maintain incarceration of the mentally ill in this fashion than it does to fund community mental health centers.\n\nRobinson, a Chicago native, followed that same general path to homelessness.\n\nHe was kicked out of his house at age 13. In order to survive, he joined a gang and began selling drugs. He was in and out of jail, serving prison sentences for several charges, including homicide.\n\nHe said that a lot of people in similar situations are in jail because they can\u2019t get help.\n\n\u201cIn jail, they get food, showers, medications and a bed,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, years later, Robinson earned his high school diploma, and despite difficulties keeping steady work, he said he would rather spend a night in the cold than go back to jail.\n\nRobinson takes life one day at a time, and never stops smiling. He said he\u2019s been clean for the last 19 years.\n\n\u201cPlenty of millionaires are miserable,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing down won\u2019t get you anywhere. The Lord can\u2019t bless you if you\u2019re full of anger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite being in a world-class city, many people in Chicago struggle with poverty and homelessness, issues where mental illness contributes in many cases.", "generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 1.14.3", "og": {"site_name": "The DePaulia", "description": "Despite being in a world-class city, many people in Chicago struggle with poverty and homelessness, issues where mental illness contributes in many cases.", "title": "Many in Chicago struggle with poverty and homelessness", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://depauliaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cabrini\u2013Green_Tear_Down.jpg", "height": 365}, "updated_time": "2014-11-16T18:54:33-05:00", "url": "http://depauliaonline.com/2014/11/16/city-light-city-blight-many-chicago-struggle-poverty-homelessness/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite being in a world-class city, many people in Chicago struggle with poverty and homelessness, issues where mental illness contributes in many cases.", "title": "Many in Chicago struggle with poverty and homelessness", "image": "http://depauliaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cabrini\u2013Green_Tear_Down.jpg", "creator": "@thedepaulia", "site": "@thedepaulia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 108424530298}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDePaulia/", "section": "City News", "tag": "poverty", "published_time": "2014-11-16T22:16:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T18:54:33-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf626\"", "article_summary": "And in 2012, Chicago closed six of its 12 community mental health centers, while Illinois closed two large state institutions.\nThe Mental Health Systems Act, passed in 1980 and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, was designed to provide federal support for community mental health programs in response to growing need generated by de-institutionalization.\nMental illness often brings about other challenges that hinder people\u2019s abilities to find and maintain employment and housing.\nAccording to the National Resource and Training Center on Homelessness and Mental Illness, about 20 percent to 25 percent of the single-adult homeless population suffers from some form of severe and persistent mental illness.\nWith more than 9,000 inmates on any given day, Dart estimateed between 25 percent to 35 percent have some form of mental illness."}
