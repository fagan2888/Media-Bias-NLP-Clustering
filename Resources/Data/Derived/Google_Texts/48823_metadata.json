(Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\nSTERLING \u2014 The 72nd annual commencement ceremony Friday at Northeastern Junior College was both somber and a time for celebration, as 357 students celebrated a new chapter in their life.\n\nGraduates mourned the loss of Morgan Burns, an NJC student who passed away earlier this week and was remembered with a moment of silence at the ceremony. But they also celebrated the huge accomplishment of another student.\n\nJeremy Richhart-Kind, of Fleming, was in a car accident in 2013 which left him paraplegic. Following a discussion with his automotive technology classmates last fall about how great it would be for him to walk across the stage to get his degree, he decided to make that his mission. Thanks to the help of fellow NJC student Jamie Bunk and the support of the community, he was able to achieve his goal.\n\nPictured are the 2015 graduates of Northeastern Junior College at the school's annual commencement ceremony Friday. NJC graduated 357 students this year. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\nA smile on his face, the words \"I WILL WALK\" printed on his cap, with the help of two other graduates, Richhart took one step and then another, walking across the stage to receive his diploma, as cheers filled the Bank of Colorado Event Center.\n\nFriday's ceremony started with students proceeding into the Bank of Colorado Events Center to the traditional graduation song, \"Pomp and Circumstance,\" performed by Mary Smith, adjunct music instructor.\n\nAlumni Mace Bearers Wendell and Jewel Sonnenberg, from the classes of 1948 and 1951, led the students in, along with Faculty/Staff Marshall Mike Vair.\n\nAfter all the graduates made their way to their seats the NJC Contemporary Choir performed the National Anthem and an invocation was given by Troy Clevenger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNJC President Jay Lee welcomed the students and guests and congratulated the graduates, before introducing Richard E. Martinez Jr., chair of the Colorado Community College System board of directors.\n\n\"Education is the first step in a long process of personal growth,\" Martinez told the graduates. \"Compassion, courage and critical thinking will serve you well as you face the tough issues of our world today.\"\n\nAlumni Mace Bearers Wendell and Jewel Sonnenberg, along with Faculty/Staff Marshal Mike Vair, begin the procession into the Bank of Colorado Event Center at NJC's commencement ceremony. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\nHe encouraged the students to treasure their education, \"keep your eyes open to the world around you; always see in others what they are capable of being and becoming; inspire those around you, show them the good that can come from great education, show them above all else that they can do it to.\"\n\nMartinez challenged the students to never stop learning and to \"know that you have it within you to do what it takes to make the world a better place.\"\n\nDenzel Stewart, 2014-15 ASG President, then spoke, thanking those who helped support him.\n\n\"Being your president has been a great honor. You all would never let me forget my role in this campus,\" he told his fellow graduates, recalling some of his interactions with other students on campus.\n\nAssociated Student Government President Denzek Stewart shares a few words of advice with his fellow graduates. (Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\nHe encouraged the students to hang on to the memories they've made so far and to continue to make more memories.\n\n\"Today is the youngest you will ever be, you can only make moments to remember today,\" Stewart said. \"Thank you for all the memories NJC.\"\n\nFollowing his speech, Dr. Ray Kilmer, president of the NJC Alumni Association board of directors, said a few words.\n\n\"Soon to be graduates, this is your day,\" he told the students. \"We're very proud of you.\"\n\nHe told the graduates to reflect and look to tomorrow, ask the question \"having reached this point in my life, where am I headed?\"\n\nKilmer also encouraged them to \"believe in yourselves, set out to prove a few things for yourself and others and told them to acknowledge, appreciate and benefit from the support of others, \"but don't take advantage of those who believe in you.\"\n\nHe then presented the Pride in Association Award, which recognizes a family for their support, dedication and loyalty to NJC over the years, to the Tom and Traudi Torres family.\n\nSeveral student award recipients were also acknowledged.\n\nThe Charles F. Poole Award, given to scholastic class leaders who attended NJC continuously and contributed to campus life, went to Andrea Northup (Sterling), Jim Padilla (Sterling), Jacob Piper (Hugo), Kelsey Smith (Montrose) and Tyler Vandenbark (Fleming).\n\nThe NJC Contemporary Choir perform the National Anthem, under the direction of Celeste Delgado-Pelton, during NJC's commencement ceremony.
