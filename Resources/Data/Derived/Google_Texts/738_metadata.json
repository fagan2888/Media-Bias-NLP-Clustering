Scott Walker\u2019s campaign-in-waiting is now leaking reporter inquiries to other media outlets as Breitbart News pursued questions on the dual citizenship of new communications staffer Liz Mair.\n\nMair, a supporter of open borders immigration, amnesty for illegal aliens and the Senate \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill from last Congress, has dual citizenship in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It doesn\u2019t appear she was born with dual citizenship, meaning she seems to have sought out dual citizenship as an adult in another country after living most of her life as a U.S. citizen.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI am a dual US-UK citizen, and the NHS [National Health Service in the UK] was my primary source of health care for many, many years,\u201d Mair wrote in a blog post where she, in part, criticized ObamaCare and other government-run healthcare programs. \u201cOne of the reasons I returned to the US was to get into a better health care system than the NHS. The NHS provides universal, fairly crappy care for free for many people, and at a higher cost than (IMO) is warranted for a number of people who don\u2019t use it much, but pay for it through their taxes. Sorry to disappoint.\u201d\n\nOn another part of her website, she notes she was \u201cborn and raised\u201d in the U.S. and got a graduate degree in the U.K.\n\n\u201cLiz was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, and lived in the United Kingdom for ten years,\u201d her bio on the website reads. \u201cThere, she earned an MA in International Relations from the University of St. Andrews and attended law school, ultimately practicing corporate law in the City of London for three years. Liz also holds a certificate in Political and Social Sciences from the Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News had asked Mair a pair of questions about her decision to attain dual citizenship. \u201c1.) When did you get UK citizenship? What were the circumstances under which you obtained dual citizenship? You weren\u2019t born with dual citizenship right?\u201d And: \u201c2.) Why wasn\u2019t US citizenship good enough? Why did you seek out dual citizenship in the first place?\u201d\n\nSince Mair hasn\u2019t answered the questions\u2014and has since refused to\u2014it\u2019s unclear whether she was born with dual citizenship or whether she sought it out as an adult after she moved to the U.K. later in life. This could complicate her situation with the Walker campaign, especially after scrutiny of her disdain for Iowans\u2014which was exposed by the Des Moines Register on Monday\u2014or her support of abortion, amnesty for illegal aliens and gay marriage already has.\n\nTo make matters worse for the Walker campaign, Mair actually leaked the inquiry this reporter sent to her to another media outlet\u2014an action that\u2019s viewed as widely inappropriate and unacceptable for any campaign or communications professional.\n\nThat email seeking comment was sent to Mair at 10:34 a.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nAt 10:49 a.m., Bloomberg Politics reporter Dave Weigel reached out to this reporter with an email headlined: \u201cAre you writing about Mair\u2019s dual citizenship?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what I am hearing,\u201d Weigel wrote in the body of the email. \u201cShe\u2019s been a very public person, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever concealed that.\u201d\n\nWeigel\u2019s right that she has been public and forthcoming about being a dual citizen\u2014it\u2019s on her website. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a story in connection with her hiring by Walker, and since Walker is very seriously considering running for president every action he takes and every person he hires is going to come under scrutiny\u2014especially since Walker is neck-and-neck in the polls with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nGeorge Rasley of Richard Viguerie\u2019s ConservativeHQ wrote on Tuesday that Walker \u201chas just put conservative support for his rising presidential campaign in jeopardy\u201d by hiring Mair.\n\n\u201cGovernor Walker is new to national politics, but conservatives got the message loud and clear that Scott Walker may not be one of us, or at least that the inside-the-Beltway political class has already infiltrated his allegedly populist campaign, when he hired Liz Mair, who has made a point of attacking conservative Republicans at every opportunity, for a senior position in his campaign,\u201d Rasley wrote.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mair has even tweeted in recent weeks and months\u2014before she was hired for the Walker Our American Revival PAC, his campaign in waiting\u2014about how politically toxic this topic really is for her.\n\n\u201cI am Scottish-American. But that\u2019s also one of many reasons why I\u2019d get my ass kicked if I ever ran for anything,\u201d Mair wrote on Twitter on Feb. 26.\n\nSince this reporter hadn\u2019t sent a separate and distinct inquiry to Walker\u2019s communications director and press secretary, Kirsten Kukowski and AshLee Strong respectively, until 10:54 a.m., the only person who could have leaked the inquiry to Weigel was Mair herself.\n\nWhen confronted about the fact that she\u2019s leaking reporter emails, Mair threatened to never read or respond to any emails from this reporter again.\n\n\u201cThis will be the last email from you I will read or reply to,\u201d Mair wrote back when asked why she leaked the inquiry about her dual citizenship to Weigel\u2014and potentially others.\n\nKukowski and Strong haven\u2019t responded when asked if they view leaking reporter inquiry emails as acceptable behavior and something they\u2014as Walker campaign communications staffers who have both had a long history in political communications for major Republican figures\u2014would personally approve of or engage in as a tactic.\n\nKukowski worked for Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus for years, and Strong similarly worked for Sen. John Thune (R-SD) for years. Both have been responsible Republican communications staffers for quite some time, and it\u2019s extraordinarily curious that at this time they are standing by someone on their team that engages in the widely-considered-to-be-unacceptable tactic of leaking.\n\nThe real story behind Mair here, however, is where Walker really stands on immigration.\n\nFor the second straight day, Walker\u2019s staff is refusing to answer basic questions about where the governor stands when it comes to several detailed areas of immigration policy. He said a few weeks ago that he \u201cchanged\u201d on immigration, but he thus far hasn\u2019t laid out his policy viewpoints. As nationally syndicated Iowa-based radio host Steve Deave noted in an interview with Breitbart News on Tuesday, the first move he made on immigration after saying he \u201cchanged\u201d from his previous amnesty support is hiring the open borders advocate Mair.\n\nWalker\u2019s staffers Kukowski and Strong haven\u2019t answered whether Walker thinks there should be any increase in H1B visas to bring in cheap foreign high tech labor\u2014or any other legal immigration increase\u2014while American workers are struggling. They also haven\u2019t answered whether Walker thinks Republicans should trust the Chamber of Commerce, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s lobbying outfit FWD.us, Sheldon Adelson, Bill Gates, or other open borders advocates when it comes to immigration policy, and they haven\u2019t laid out, when asked, what type of immigration policy other than a secured border\u2014which even the Democrats say they support\u2014that Walker would support.\n\nIf Walker\u2019s going to make a bid for the White House\u2014all the liberal media bashing of him aside\u2014he\u2019s going to have to have well thought positions on these issues rather than just rhetoric. Team Walker is refusing to answer those questions and more, and won\u2019t let the governor do interviews about immigration policy. Moreover, if Walker wants to beat Bush\u2013and then eventually Hillary Clinton or whatever Democrat wins their nomination if he wins the GOP nod\u2013he needs to have a distinct policy on immigration that\u2019s different from them. At this time, he has no such policy\u2013or at least he clearly can\u2019t articulate it since his staff is refusing any interviews on the matter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scott Walker Campaign-in-Waiting Leaks Reporter Inquiries on New Pro-Amnesty Staffer\u2019s Dual Citizenship", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Scott Walker Campaign-in-Waiting Leaks Reporter Inquiries on New Pro-Amnesty Staffer\u2019s Dual Citizenship", "title": "Scott Walker Campaign-in-Waiting Leaks Reporter Inquiries on New Pro-Amnesty Staffer\u2019s Dual Citizenship - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Walker-31-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/17/scott-walker-campaign-in-waiting-leaks-reporter-inquiries-on-new-pro-amnesty-staffers-dual-citizenship/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scott Walker Campaign-in-Waiting Leaks Reporter Inquiries on New Pro-Amnesty Staffer\u2019s Dual Citizenship", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Walker-31-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Scott Walker Campaign-in-Waiting Leaks Reporter Inquiries on New Pro-Amnesty Staffer\u2019s Dual Citizenship - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jeb Bush, Liz Mair, Scott Walker,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Scott Walker", "published_time": "2015-03-17T11:06:11-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93d7\"", "article_summary": "It doesn\u2019t appear she was born with dual citizenship, meaning she seems to have sought out dual citizenship as an adult in another country after living most of her life as a U.S. citizen.\nScott Walker\u2019s campaign-in-waiting is now leaking reporter inquiries to other media outlets as Breitbart News pursued questions on the dual citizenship of new communications staffer Liz Mair.\nWhat were the circumstances under which you obtained dual citizenship?\nTeam Walker is refusing to answer those questions and more, and won\u2019t let the governor do interviews about immigration policy.\nYou weren\u2019t born with dual citizenship right?\u201d And: \u201c2.)"}
