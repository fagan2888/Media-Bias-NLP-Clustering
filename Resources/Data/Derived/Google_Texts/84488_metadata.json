I cannot understand why an international organization, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (IPCC) operating under the umbrella of the United Nations, was permitted to issue reports of an imminent threat to the Earth, to mankind, that a freshman student of meteorology would know were false. At long last the Big Lie of Global Warming has been totally exposed and we can thank The Heartland Institute, a free market think tank that has organized and hosted eight international Conferences on Climate Change since 2008 to expose the lies behind global warming\u2014now called \u201cclimate change\u201d\u2014as it became clear that seventeen years of continuous cooling has put a Big Chill on this Big Lie.\n\nI suspect that the Heartland team, led by Joe Bast and including some remarkable, dedicated people, will only get a line or two in some future historian\u2019s account of the deception that began in 1988 before a congressional committee. Thereafter the global warming hoax was given momentum by former Vice President Al Gore who, along with the IPCC, would receive a Nobel Peace Prize!\n\nIt helps to have a sense of humor when you are doing battle with hucksters who have the entire world\u2019s media to defend them.\n\nThe climate \u201cskeptics\u201d\u2014some of the world\u2019s most renowned meteorologists\u2014dubbed their effort the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) and, working with the Heartland Institute, have just released a new edition of \u201cClimate Change Reconsidered II.\u201dIt arrives just as the IPCC will release its 5th Assessment Report. The IPCC\u2019s lies will get lots of news coverage.\n\nHeartland\u2019s NIPCC report was fortunate to have notice taken by Fox News, but beyond that most of the intransigent U.S. news media ignored it.As often as not one has to look to foreign newspapers to get the truth.\n\nIn Great Britain\u2019s The Mail, the headline on September 14 was \u201cGlobal warming just HALF what we said: World\u2019s top climate scientists admit computers got the effects of greenhouse gases wrong.\u201d A leaked copy of the IPCC report revealed \u201cscientific forecasts of imminent doom were drastically wrong.\u201dWell, of course, they were wrong. The so-called \u201cscience\u201d on which they were based was idiotic.\n\nIt focused primarily on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other so-called \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d, claiming they were trapping heat while being produced by all manner of human activity related to generating energy with coal, oil, and natural gas.Dr. Martin Hertzberg, Ph,D, co-author of \u201cSlaying the Sky Dragon\u2014Death of the Greenhouse Gas Theory\u201d, summed it up neatly, pointing out that water vapor in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is a primary factor affecting climate long term and weather short term.\n\n\u201cThe determinant of weather is mainly water in all its forms,\u201d said Dr. Herzberg, \u201cas vapor in the atmosphere, in its heat transport by evaporation and condensation, as the enormous circulating mass of liquid ocean whose heat capacity and mass/energy transport dominate the motions of our atmosphere and the precipitation from it, and finally as cloud, snow, and ice cover which influence the radiative balance between the Sun, the Earth, and free Space.\u201d\n\nAs you try to wrap your mind around that explanation, just think about the way the Earth goes through regular seasons as well as predictable cycles of warming and cooling. It has done this now for some 4.5 billion years.To read \u201cClimate Change Reconsidered II\u201d, visit its website.\n\nAmong its findings, the report notes that \u201cno close correlation exists between temperature variation over the past 150 years and human related CO2 emissions.\u201d Blaming the climate or even the weather on humans is insane. You might as well blame the floods in Colorado on humans instead of the downpours of rain, comparable to 1894 and 1969.Indeed, the U.S. gives ample evidence of greatly reduced events associated with the weather.\n\nThere have been fewer tornadoes over recent decades. It\u2019s been eight years since a Category 3 hurricane hit the U.S. Droughts have been shorter and less extreme than the 1930s and 1950s. And sea levels are predicted to increase barely four to eight inches per century and that may be on the high side. There will be dramatic weather events, but there have always been dramatic weather events!The Heartland\u2019s new report is welcome, but both they and I know that the same deceitful charlatans are still at work in the United Nations, in the United States, and around the world to keep this greatest of hoaxes alive.\n\nThe harm the global warming hoax has done and continues to do is best seen in the efforts of the Environmental Protection Agency to wipe out the coal industry based entirely on the lie that CO2 is a \u201cpollutant.\u201d When the House Energy & Commerce Committee held a hearing on the Obama administration\u2019s climate policies thirteen agencies were invited to testify, but the administration provided only EPA administrator Gina McCarthy and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. The latter read a prepared statement that was one long lie about global warming. Presumably he was under oath!\n\nMs. McCarthy, the latest in a long line of environmental fanatics to run the agency, was forced under questioning to admit that current and proposed greenhouse gas regulations are not there to protect the public but to influence \u201cthe international community\u201d to reduce their CO2 and other alleged emissions.\n\nNot only do the regulations have no basis in science, but they exist to keep the environmental war on energy use going and to pressure developing nations such as China and India. Within the past month, the citizens of Australia rose up and threw out the politicians who imposed a \u201ccarbon\u201d tax on them. The new prime minister has shut down the \u201cclimate ministry\u201d that existed to enforce it.\n\nAnd while most of the world wasn\u2019t watching, the United Nations was seeking to impose, once again, an international agreement similar to the failed and defunct Kyoto Protocol to limit CO2 and other greenhouse emissions, based on the BIG LIE! The 44th Pacific Islands Forum, held in the Marshall Islands, was intent on \u201can ambitious future climate regime to be finalized in 2015.\u201d\n\nThat is what must be understood. These people will not give up until they have no other option. They will continue to exploit the ignorance of people regarding the actual science, penalizing them by driving up the cost of energy use, by closing down energy industries, prospective projects, and the jobs they provide,\n\nThey sustain the malignant ethanol scam that is ruining engines as this is being written. They are behind the useless solar panel and wind turbine industries that produce so little actual electricity they are a negative drag on the national grid. You, however, are picking up the tab for their mandated use. They practice a form of child abuse to tell children the Earth is doomed if their mother uses a plastic bag to bring groceries home from the supermarket.\n\nThe world\u2019s BIGGEST LIE has been exposed and it will have to be exposed again and again until a stake is driven into the evil heart of the \u201cglobal warming\u201d hoax.\n\n[First published at Warning Signs.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/09/global-warming-the-biggest-lie-exposed/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/climate-wars.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Global Warming: The BIGGEST LIE Exposed"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0176\"", "article_summary": "The world\u2019s BIGGEST LIE has been exposed and it will have to be exposed again and again until a stake is driven into the evil heart of the \u201cglobal warming\u201d hoax.\nThe latter read a prepared statement that was one long lie about global warming.\nThereafter the global warming hoax was given momentum by former Vice President Al Gore who, along with the IPCC, would receive a Nobel Peace Prize!\nI will never understand the kind of thinking behind a lie so big that it became an international fraud and swindle.\nAt long last the Big Lie of Global Warming has been totally exposed and we can thank The Heartland Institute, a free market think tank that has organized and hosted eight international Conferences on Climate Change since 2008 to expose the lies behind global warming\u2014now called \u201cclimate change\u201d\u2014as it became clear that seventeen years of continuous cooling has put a Big Chill on this Big Lie."}
