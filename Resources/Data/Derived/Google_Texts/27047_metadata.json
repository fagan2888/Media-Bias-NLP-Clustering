Other top destinations were Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta and Houston.\n\nFlorida is a big target of identity theft in part because of the large number of older residents living there. Older and younger people can be targets for identity theft because many don\u2019t meet the income requirements to file a federal tax return.\n\nNearly 38,000 potentially fraudulent refunds, totaling $147 million, were sent to addresses in Miami last year, the report said.\n\nAmong individual homes, one address in Orlando received 580 tax refunds totaling $870,000 last year, the report said. Another Orlando address received 291 refunds totaling $466,000.\n\nThe IRS has stepped up efforts to fight identity theft, but thieves are getting more aggressive, said the report by J. Russell George, Treasury\u2019s inspector general for tax administration. Last year, the IRS stopped more than $12 billion in fraudulent refunds from going to identity thieves, compared with $8 billion the year before.\n\n\u201cIdentity theft continues to be a serious problem with devastating consequences for taxpayers and an enormous impact on tax administration,\u201d George said in a statement. The fraud \u201cerodes taxpayer confidence in the federal tax system.\u201d\n\nThieves often steal Social Security numbers from people who don\u2019t have to file tax returns, including the young, the old and people who have died, the report said. In other cases, thieves use stolen Social Security numbers to file fraudulent tax returns before the legitimate taxpayer files.\n\nThe IRS, which takes pride in issuing quick refunds, often sends them out before employers are required to file forms documenting wages, the report said.\n\n\u201cThe constantly evolving tactics used by scammers to commit identity theft continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the IRS, and we take this issue very seriously,\u201d the IRS said in a statement. \u201cThe IRS has a comprehensive and aggressive identity theft strategy that focuses on preventing refund fraud, investigating these crimes and assisting taxpayers victimized by it.\u201d\n\nDespite budget cuts, the agency said, agents have resolved more than 565,000 cases of identity theft this year, three times the number of cases resolved at the same time last year.\n\nA separate report by George said the number of identity theft victims is on the rise as thieves get more aggressive.\n\nThrough June, the IRS identified 1.6 million victims who had their identities stolen during this year\u2019s tax filing season, the report said. That compares with 1.2 million victims in 2012.\n\nMany of these people didn\u2019t realize they were victims until they submitted their returns only to learn from the IRS that someone else had already used their Social Security number to file and claim a refund.\n\nThe IRS usually identifies the proper owner of Social Security numbers, but the process can be lengthy, the report said. For cases closed between August 2011 and July 2012, it took an average of 312 days to resolve the case and issue a proper refund, the report said.\n\nThe IRS said it has resolved most of this year\u2019s identity theft cases within 120 days.\n\nFor this year, the IRS says it has developed a computer program that helps agents spot when multiple refunds are going to the same address or bank account. As of May 30, the program identified 154,302 tax returns and stopped $470 million in tax refunds from being issued, the report said.\n\nHere\u2019s a copy of the report:\n\nFINAL THOUGHT: Remember, this is the same organization that will be in charge of enforcing Obamacare.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service issued $4 billion\u00a0in fraudulent tax refunds last year to people using stolen identities, with some of the money going to addresses in Bulgaria, Lithuania and Ireland, according to an inspector general's report released Thursday.
