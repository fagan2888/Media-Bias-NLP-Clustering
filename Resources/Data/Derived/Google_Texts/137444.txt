Kudlow said of Trump, “for all his harsh language, Donald Trump, a lot of times, to me at least, sounds like a moderate Republican, a liberal Republican.” He continued, citing a New York Times article, and Trump’s interview with Sean Hannity on the Fox News Channel, where Trump advocated against a flat tax, said he favored progressive income taxation, and said he isn’t a supply-sider. Kudlow also said, “Trump also said he would be willing to consider legalization for the immigrants, yes he wants the wall, and so forth.”

Kudlow also stated, regarding Trump saying he’s flexible and loves women, “I don’t know what the hell that means, in political terms.”

Kudlow concluded, “I’m not saying he’s a conservative. I’m saying, actually, when I listen to him — now, if he’s going immigration with [Sen.] Jeff Sessions (R-AL), that’s different. That’s the restrictionist wing. But, on taxes, another one is healthcare. He has not ruled out a large government presence in healthcare. Another one is on Planned Parenthood. He’s sorta circled that thing so many times, I don’t know what he stands for.” And “Donald Trump keeps saying how you have to be flexible, he’s a deal-maker, what’s he going to do when he finds out that if he can’t have his way as president, he doesn’t have the power to fire [Speaker] John Boehner (R-OH), what’s he going to do?”
