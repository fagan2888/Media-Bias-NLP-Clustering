His extraordinary tenor voice and \u201cacoustic soul\u201d style bring spiritual integrity and musical sophistication to his pop song chart.\n\nThe growing collection of original work Colon has developed over the last several years often showcases personal stories about relationships and his family life.\n\nWhile Colon's career is over a decade long, it was in 2011 that he captured the hearts of over 13 million NBC viewers who selected him as \"The Voice.\"\n\n\"I try to write about stuff that pertains to me,\" Colon said. \"I write a lot about my family, and a lot about things that affect all of us. And by writing these songs, it affects me too. It can be a very emotional experience, a very draining experience, because I write stuff that\u2019s very close to home.\"\n\nToday, Colon\u2019s career takes him on concert tours from coast to coast and occasionally overseas. His musical collaborations and recording sessions include regular visits to Los Angeles, New York, and Nashville. Yet despite all the travel, and more so because of it, Connecticut remains his home. It\u2019s his constant; the place that provides a healthy support system for his family, including wife Maureen and their three young children. Colon said, \"Connecticut\u2019s always been home. It just feels like where I\u2019m supposed to be.\"\n\nIn a recent interview in the CPTV studios, Colon shared an update on life since \"The Voice,\" including some insight into his early music training at the University of Hartford\u2019s Hartt School, a glimpse at his involvement in the community with Achieve Hartford!, and his passion for developing young voices. Our television crew had a chance to capture Javier leading a master class with some amazing teen vocalists at ACES: the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven.\n\nColon's efforts with young people reflect some of his own musical experiences that were motivated by his middle school teachers. \"I didn\u2019t really think I was anything special when I was in seventh and eighth grade,\" he said, \"but my teachers pushed me. They saw some talent there. They saw more talent than I saw.\"\n\nIn this Spotlight on the Arts video, meet the Connecticut side of Javier Colon\u2014America\u2019s \"voice\" and our next door neighbor.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts/Culture", "description": "Winner of NBC\u2019s \"The Voice,\" Javier Colon, is a rare combination of talent, star-power, and humility.
