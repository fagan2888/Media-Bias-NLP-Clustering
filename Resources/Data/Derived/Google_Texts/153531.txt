Two vehicles in a tow company impound yard were destroyed by fire early Friday while another vehicle was damaged.

Firefighters are investigating the cause of the fire in the closed, and locked facility.

Deputy Police Chief Lawrence Cattano said his department also is investigating the fires.

According to Fire Chief Abraham Pitre, around 1:17 a.m. Friday firefighters were called the 353 Market St., an impound lot for one or more Perth Amboy towing companies, for a report of a fire.

Firefighters found three vehicles on fire. Pitre did not know the make of the vehicles.

Pitre said it took about a 30 minutes to extinguish the fire. He said firefighters remained on the scene to document and take photos in the area.

Pitre said two vehicles were destroyed in the fire and another vehicle sustained moderate damage.

A police monitoring service indicated firefighters have been to the site several times in the past month for similar car fires.
