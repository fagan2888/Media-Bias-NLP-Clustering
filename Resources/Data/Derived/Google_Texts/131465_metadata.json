After complaining about labor pains, she was rushed to a hospital in Ambikapur where she assumed she would be giving birth to only one child \u2014 she had never undergone an ultrasound to know for sure. However, soon after giving birth to her first daughter, she successfully delivered four more, all naturally.\n\nThe quintuplet birth makes Singh the mother of the country\u2019s most prematurely born quints, having delivered them at only 26-weeks gestation, the Huffington Post reported \u2014 the average pregnancy lasts around 40 weeks. The girls are also extremely underweight, weighing only 3 pounds each, and will remain under close observation in the hospital\u2019s neonatal intensive care unit.\n\nEverything about Singh\u2019s daughters is unique. Not only are the young babies defying odds by surviving birth at such a young gestational age, but even their mere existence is a medical marvel. Quintuplets are rare; a couple\u2019s chance of conceiving this many children at once is about one in 60 million. Quintuplets, all with the the same gender, are even rarer.\n\nFor example, the first set of all-girl quintuplets to have ever been recorded in the United States was only born last year. (It\u2019s worth noting these children were conceived via artificial reproductive technology (ART), which ups the odds of fertilizing more than one egg.) The couple used intrauterine insemination, a type of ART that involves placing sperm inside the uterus in order to boost the amount of sperm that reach the fallopian tubes. All five girls were born healthy, which is a rarity among quintuplets, too.\n\nThe Singhs said the births of their five daughters have made the loss of their son, who died shortly after his birth, just a bit easier. \u201cI am extremely grateful to God for blessing us with not one but five children,\u201d said the girls\u2019 father, Manesh Singh, according to the Daily Mail. \u201cWe were heartbroken when we lost our first child, a son, immediately after birth two years ago. I believe God has compensated the loss. I only hope that they all survive and I can give them a wonderful life.\u201d\n\nWhile multiple births of all types remain rarer than single births, in the United States, these types of pregnancies are on the rise. According to Medline Plus, this is largely due to increasing numbers of women taking fertility drugs. Add to that the fact that there have been vast advances in prenatal and neonatal care, and it\u2019s no wonder more of these children are surviving past childbirth than ever before.\n\nThe first set of quintuplets ever recorded to survive infancy were the five identical Dionne sisters, who were born near Corbeil, Ontario, Canada in 1934, Mental Floss reported. Unfortunately, these sisters were taken away from their parents and made wards of the state not long after their birth. The Canadian government then exploited the sisters, turning them into a tourist attraction until their parents were able to win back their custody in 1943.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mother, pleasantly, surprised, after, unexpectedly, giving, birth, quintuplet, daughters", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A woman in India unexpectedly gave birth to quintuplet baby girls after believing she was carrying only one child.", "title": "Indian Mom Expected To Birth 1 Child, Popped Out 5 Instead", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/quintuplets-pleasantly-surprised-multiple-births-380620", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/04/singh.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A woman in India unexpectedly gave birth to quintuplet baby girls after believing she was carrying only one child.", "title": "Indian Mom Expected To Birth 1 Child, Popped Out 5 Instead", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/quintuplets-pleasantly-surprised-multiple-births-380620", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/04/singh.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/04/singh.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-04-04T17:06:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T17:06:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A woman in India unexpectedly gave birth to quintuplet baby girls after believing she was carrying only one child."}, "article_summary": "Manita Singh, 25, of Chhattisgarh is believed to be the first woman to have ever delivered quintuplets naturally in her part of India.\nHowever, soon after giving birth to her first daughter, she successfully delivered four more, all naturally.\nUnfortunately, these sisters were taken away from their parents and made wards of the state not long after their birth.\nThe quintuplet birth makes Singh the mother of the country\u2019s most prematurely born quints, having delivered them at only 26-weeks gestation, the Huffington Post reported \u2014 the average pregnancy lasts around 40 weeks.\nThe Singhs said the births of their five daughters have made the loss of their son, who died shortly after his birth, just a bit easier."}
