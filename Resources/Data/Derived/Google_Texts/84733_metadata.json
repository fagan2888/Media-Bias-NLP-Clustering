So when Semyon Varlamov returns from a groin injury \u2014 he practiced fully again Friday and says he\u2019s fine \u2014 Reto Berra could be reassigned (waived) or traded. More about that here and in Saturday\u2019s paper and online. And keep in mind: Roy could change his mind, or have his mind changed based on finances. Berra will make his $1.4 million ($1.45 million cap hit) wherever he plays, whereas Pickard makes substantially less in Lake Erie and is waiver-exempt.\n\nAbout that headline: Erik Johnson didn\u2019t have a concussion-type head injury. It was his neck that messed him up in Wednesday\u2019s 4-3 overtime win at Arizona. EJ, who appeared to be knocked out, dangerously absorbed a hit by the Coyotes\u2019 Martin Hanzal in OT while trying to shoot, and his follow-through resulted in Hanzal\u2019s shoulder colliding with his head.\n\nMinutes later, Hanzal inadvertently redirected the puck in Arizona\u2019s net to complete Colorado\u2019s comeback from a 3-0 hole.\n\n\u201cI went from pretty (upset) to pretty elated,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cKarma comes around \u2014 if you believe in that stuff.\u201d\n\nEJ said he was motionless on the ice because he was afraid to move. \u201cI was feeling some neck pain and wasn\u2019t sure if I should move or not. I was waiting for (trainer) Matt (Sokolowski) to get out there and tell him what I was dealing with. I had motion in my limbs and stuff but just had neck pain.\u201d\n\nEJ missed Thursday\u2019s game at home against Chicago. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t a back-to-back I would have been able to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t able to get my range of motion, a lot of neck stiffness \u2026 How fast the game is, you have to have your head on a swivel and complete range of motion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Arizona Coyotes,Avalanche,Calvin Pickard,Erik Johnson,Patrick Roy,Reto Berra,Semyon Varlamov", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson suffered neck injury at Arizona, cleared to play Saturday against Dallas.", "title": "Erik Johnson sees silver lining in Martin Hanzal hit", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/11/28/avs-erik-johnson-sees-silver-lining-martin-hanzal-hit/20187/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson suffered neck injury at Arizona, cleared to play Saturday against Dallas.", "creator": "@mikechambers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2014/11/28/avs-erik-johnson-sees-silver-lining-martin-hanzal-hit/20187/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "title": "Avs\u2019 Erik Johnson sees silver lining in Martin Hanzal hit", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson suffered neck injury at Arizona, cleared to play Saturday against Dallas."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01c6\"", "article_summary": "And keep in mind: Roy could change his mind, or have his mind changed based on finances.\nBerra will make his $1.4 million ($1.45 million cap hit) wherever he plays, whereas Pickard makes substantially less in Lake Erie and is waiver-exempt.\n\u201cI went from pretty (upset) to pretty elated,\u201d Johnson said.\nI had motion in my limbs and stuff but just had neck pain.\u201dEJ missed Thursday\u2019s game at home against Chicago.\nMinutes later, Hanzal inadvertently redirected the puck in Arizona\u2019s net to complete Colorado\u2019s comeback from a 3-0 hole."}
