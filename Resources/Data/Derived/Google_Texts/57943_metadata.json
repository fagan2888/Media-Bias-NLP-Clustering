At race tracks. At tattoo parlors. Even at Disney World-area resorts in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.\n\nOne example after another of apparent spending by Maine\u2019s welfare recipients was contained in data released by the state last week.\n\nLawmakers immediately called it misuse. Abuse. Fraud.\n\nBut it can also be called something else: completely legal.\n\nAt the center of the controversy are Maine\u2019s EBT cards \u2014 electronic benefit cards issued to the poor and loaded with money they qualify for, including TANF benefits (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, often informally called welfare).\n\nMaine recently instituted rules prohibiting TANF recipients from withdrawing money or using the cards at certain places \u2014 specifically, no casinos, liquor stores or strip clubs.\n\nHowever, under the rules, recipients are still allowed to buy whatever they want elsewhere, even if what they buy elsewhere is the same thing they would have bought in one of the prohibited places, including alcohol, cigarettes and lottery tickets.\n\nIn fact, a brochure for TANF recipients and the website that recipients use to access their accounts both make one thing clear: \u201cAny item may be purchased using your cash benefit account.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an allowance that has been around as long as the TANF program itself.\n\nSome say it\u2019s time for that to end.\n\n\u201cObviously, the public is outraged to think these abuses are going on and there has been no action here in this state Legislature to try and curb this growing problem,\u201d said Senate Republican Leader Michael Thibodeau of Winterport.\n\nOthers agree that TANF recipients should not be buying beer and tobacco with taxpayer funds, but worry that the questionable transactions released by Gov. Paul LePage last week \u2014 which represent about three-tenths of 1 percent of all TANF purchases and withdrawals in 2012 and 2013 \u2014 have been politicized to gain points.\n\nMaine, they say, should focus its attention on the bigger issue of helping people out of poverty.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to see this money go to buy alcohol and cigarettes. Absolutely nobody. I think that\u2019s a distraction, a smokescreen the governor is putting up,\u201d said House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick. \u201cLook at the governor\u2019s track record on these programs [to get people out of poverty]. They\u2019re a failure.\u201d\n\nFrom checks to EBT cards\n\nTANF, a federal program, was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996 as part of welfare reform and as a successor to Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC. Under TANF, the federal government gives each state a block of money and, in return, states are responsible for designing and implementing programs to help poor families become self-sufficient.\n\nMaine gets $78 million a year.\n\nTANF\u2019s trademark is a cash benefit. When people talk about traditional \u201cwelfare,\u201d TANF and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP (once called food stamps), are often what they mean.\n\nFor years, TANF benefits were sent by check or deposited directly into the recipient\u2019s bank account. SNAP benefits were given out as food coupons. In the late 1990s, the federal government started requiring states to switch from food stamps to EBT cards. When the food benefit was loaded on the card, the recipient could use it at grocery stores and other allowable places, much like a debit card.\n\nSome states, including Maine, also started loading most people\u2019s TANF benefits onto the card. While SNAP benefits could only be used at certain places and for certain items, TANF benefits could be used anywhere for anything. And if a store or service provider didn\u2019t take EBT cards \u2014 the recipient\u2019s landlord, for example \u2014 the recipient could use the card to withdraw the benefit in cash from an ATM.\n\nAbout 7,700 Maine families, including about 13,000 children, get TANF. The average benefit for a family of three is $415 a month.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama administration made a new requirement. It told states they had to enact policies that would prevent TANF-loaded EBT cards from being used in liquor stores, casinos and strip clubs. That year, Maine created a law that did just that. Starting August 2012, it became illegal in Maine for the card to be used in gambling facilities, adult entertainment establishments or any store where liquor sales account for 50 percent or more of gross revenue. The law prohibited the use of EBT cards at ATMs at those locations as well, according to DHHS.\n\nHowever, the card can legally be used anywhere else that accepts it. Cash withdrawals at ATMs elsewhere are OK, too. Furthermore, Maine\u2019s current law contains no language that outlaws withdrawing EBT cash from an ATM elsewhere and then using the cash at a liquor store, casino or strip club.\n\nExperts say the cash option is important because some places don\u2019t take EBT cards. If a parent needs to pay the rent, get a child\u2019s hair cut or hire a babysitter while at a job interview, for example, they may have to have cash.\n\nThe brochure given to TANF recipients and the website they use to access their balance both make a point of that allowance. \u201cAny item may be purchased using your cash benefit account,\u201d they say.\n\nOr said.\n\nTwo days after DHHS was contacted for this story by the Sun Journal last week, the website was changed.\n\n\u201cI appreciate you calling this to our attention as this is not a website that DHHS maintains, and it is critical that we update this information,\u201d DHHS spokesman John Martins wrote in an email.\n\nThe site, which is run by a DHHS contractor, now details the 2012 state law and notes: \u201cTANF cash benefits are to be used for the purchase of items to help parents and their children with the basic needs of everyday living and using the benefits for any other purpose is against the program\u2019s intent. Benefits used to meet the program\u2019s intent include food, clothing, shelter, utilities, household goods, personal care items and general incidental expenses. Purchases such as lottery tickets and tobacco products do not meet the intent of the program.\u201d\n\nAlthough the new language notes that lottery tickets and tobacco products don\u2019t meet the intent of the law, it is still legal to buy them with TANF money.\n\nAlthough the law that banned liquor stores, strip clubs and casinos went into effect in August 2012, DHHS officials said the department still had to promulgate rules to implement the law and those rules didn\u2019t come until June 2013. They are still working on changing documents to reflect the new law.\n\nOfficials said they plan to replace the old brochure with a form that TANF recipients will have to sign to acknowledge they\u2019ve been told what TANF money should be used for and what the penalties are for illegal use. That form has not yet been fully drafted.\n\nDHHS officials pointed out that new TANF recipients receive handbooks that include information about what their TANF dollars should and shouldn\u2019t be used for. New TANF recipients also must go through an orientation that includes a PowerPoint presentation that, among other things, outlines the new law.\n\nOfficials acknowledge that some people who get TANF went through the orientation before the law was signed. But, they said, orientation has for years included information on TANF\u2019s intent \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to be used for food, shelter and basic living expenses \u2014 even if that orientation didn\u2019t focus on a specific law.\n\nAnd besides that, they said, TANF recipients are all poor families with children. Parents should already know it\u2019s bad to spend their money frivolously when their children need food and diapers.\n\n\u201cThe reality is these are people who qualify based on being poor and, really, if you\u2019re looking to do what\u2019s right by your children and families, I don\u2019t know that a website saying \u2018You can use it for anything\u2019 would put you in a position where you would have the cash to use it for alcohol,\u201d Martins said. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is something we will discuss\u2019\n\nLast week, Gov. LePage released a list of more than 3,650 questionable EBT card transactions, from a total of more than 1.1 million transactions, that occurred between Jan. 1, 2012, and Nov. 15, 2013. The bulk of the questionable transactions took place at smoke shops. Others took place at retailers that primarily sell liquor, at out-of-state stores and one \u2014 for $10 \u2014 at the medical marijuana dispensary in Auburn.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office also released an extra year\u2019s worth of data going back to 2011. That year includes, among other questionable transactions, $820 in the Disney World area.\n\nIt is unclear how many of the questionable transactions represented actual fraud, misuse or illegal activity. Although the locations where the cash was withdrawn were tracked, the items purchased with the cash weren\u2019t. A number of the businesses on the list, including retailers that sell liquor, said they don\u2019t accept EBT cards, but they do have an ATM on site.\n\nSome neighborhood stores maintain low ATM fees, and it\u2019s possible that residents prefer to withdraw cash at a local, low-fee site rather than at a bank.\n\nAnd because the law didn\u2019t go into effect until August 2012 and the DHHS rules didn\u2019t take effect until halfway through 2103, many of the transactions legally occurred before that.\n\nBut regardless of whether or not transactions at liquor stores, strip clubs and casinos took place before Maine prohibited them, such transactions are not in line with the intent of the law and hold the possibility for fraud, misuse or illegal activity.\n\nOther states have encountered similar problems, and in recent years \u2014 particularly after the federal push \u2014 many have tried to make changes.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 20 states have placed some kind of restriction on EBT cards. That includes Maine, with its 2012 law on casinos, strip clubs and liquor stores.\n\nAmong the 19 other states with laws, seven have fewer restrictions than Maine \u2014 including New York, which prohibits the card\u2019s use only at gaming establishments. Six have more restrictions \u2014 including Massachusetts, which prohibits purchases from tattoo parlors, manicure shops, rent-to-own stores, jewelry shops and cruise ships, among other places.\n\nIn 2013, at least 30 states put forth proposals on the issue and nine passed laws. So far in 2014, three states are dealing with legislation.\n\nColorado is expanding its list of restrictions to include marijuana shops and adult entertainment venues.\n\nKentucky has proposed limiting the use of benefits for alcohol, tobacco, casinos, tattoos, lottery tickets and other gambling, adult entertainment and psychic services. It is also considering a photo ID requirement.\n\nMissouri has proposed, among other things, making recipients ineligible for benefits if they withdraw funds at a casino or other gaming establishment.\n\nThe national Children and Families Program director said she expects more proposals to come as the year progresses.\n\nLast session, the Maine Legislature considered an amended bill that would have uniformly prohibited the use of TANF money to buy alcohol and tobacco, no matter where it was sold. It also would have required TANF recipients to hold on to their cash-transaction receipts for 12 months in case DHHS audited them.\n\nThe bill failed, largely along party lines.\n\nLePage has said he plans to propose changes to the program this year in an effort to prevent fraud, including a redesign of the EBT cards so they bear the card owner\u2019s photo.\n\nHowever, Maine Assistant Attorney General Leanne Robbin, who has worked on EBT card-trafficking legislation in the past, said such a measure could prove tricky since TANF recipients \u2014 sometimes sick or disabled, or caring for a sick or disabled family member \u2014 are allowed to give their card to someone else to make purchases or withdraw cash on their behalf.\n\nAnd, she said, the measure\u2019s ability to prevent fraud would only be as good as the enforcement. Card holders must enter their PINs to make purchases or withdraw cash, she said, and that\u2019s considered the card\u2019s safety measure. As long as the card-holder enters the correct PIN, stores are not required to seek a photo ID.\n\n\u201cAs the cards are used now, I don\u2019t see that photos will necessarily be relevant,\u201d Robbin said.\n\nLePage has also said he plans to submit a bill that would put greater limits on where recipients can spend TANF money in an effort to curb the purchase of alcohol, cigarettes and lottery tickets. He said he would also like to limit where recipients can use their cards outside Maine. He made that announcement in mid-December, weeks before the DHHS data release.\n\nLePage\u2019s spokeswoman recently declined to talk about the proposal or to say whether it is still being considered.\n\n\u201cThat is something we will discuss in the upcoming days as the bills are finalized,\u201d Adrienne Bennett said in an email.\n\nDifferent changes\n\nSome EBT card-users say they\u2019re concerned about fraud and misuse, and they\u2019d like to see change, too. But their changes differ from the governor\u2019s.\n\nOne Farmington EBT card holder, who used to get TANF until she reached the program\u2019s five-year limit, said she would like welfare recipients to be required to show receipts for their purchases.\n\nA Dixfield single mother, who has received TANF in the past and now elects to receive only SNAP, said she would like to see a ban on cash withdrawals.\n\nA Rumford woman, who receives SNAP benefits for her foster child, said she would like to see better vocational rehab.\n\nDemocrats, too, say they would like to see changes. Their changes also differ from the governor\u2019s.\n\nTwo days after the governor released his list of questionable EBT card transactions, Senate President Justin Alfond, D-Portland, and Eves, speaker of the House, wrote a letter to Maine Attorney General Janet Mills urging her to prosecute if any of the transactions are found to violate the law.\n\nIn an interview this week, Eves echoed the sentiment.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely no abuse should be tolerated and if there is abuse, it should be prosecuted,\u201d he said.\n\nEves\u2019 own welfare-reform bill became law without the governor\u2019s signature last summer. It requires DHHS to assess recipients\u2019 needs and to coordinate the training and tools they need to find work.\n\nBut he believes the focus on 3,000-plus possibly problematic TANF transactions is a political ploy.\n\n\u201cI think this is just a continuation of the governor\u2019s failed policies,\u201d Eves said. \u201cMore people are living in homelessness. More people are accessing our food pantries, our soup kitchens. More people are living in poverty and homelessness than are finding jobs, and that is a problem.\u201d\n\nEves noted, \u201cWe need to be focused on solutions. And that is making sure people have good-paying jobs, access to education. That\u2019s how people are going to climb out of poverty.\u201d\n\nHis solution: Expand Medicaid so very poor adults can get healthy enough to work, and raise the minimum wage so workers can live without state help.\n\n\u201cI know that we\u2019re going to be focused on this throughout the session and throughout the campaign, is my assumption,\u201d Eves said.\n\n\u201cBut, really, my interest is really focusing in on, \u2018What are the solutions [to poverty]?'\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve identified abuse or fraud, go after it. Prosecute it. Because there should be no abuse or fraud. But let\u2019s talk about the solutions.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s office took issue with Eves\u2019 assertions that he\u2019s not doing enough to help people out of poverty.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats think that expanding welfare is economic development,\u201d spokesman Peter Steele said in an email. \u201cIf that were true, Maine during the [Gov. John] Baldacci years would have had the country\u2019s best economy. Liberals over the past decade purposely made access to welfare programs easier and less accountable, encouraging Mainers to stay in poverty. Their policies created the problems that Gov. LePage is now trying to fix.\u201d\n\nSteele added, \u201cNo one in the Legislature \u2014 no one \u2014 knows the devastating effects of poverty more than the governor. That\u2019s why he is focusing on welfare-to-work programs to lift Mainers out of poverty. Since he took office, more than 8,000 jobs have been created. Maine\u2019s unemployment rate is the lowest since 2008.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the AG\u2019s Office said Mills had received the letter from lawmakers urging prosecution of anyone violating Maine\u2019s new EBT law, and said the office is \u201cworking to address all angles.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 They were at smoke shop ATMs when they used their welfare cards to withdraw cash.
