If you\u2019re not comfortable seeing the words \u201cwhite folks,\u201d \u201cblack folks\u201d and references to the N-bomb, this interview with the man whose autobiography title is the N-word is not for you. It\u2019s also not for blacks who expect Gregory to go easy on them, especially on the subject of how American Indians have been treated.\n\nGregory has an insouciance that suggests that he\u2019s not impressed by much. However, one accolade has resonated with him. \u201cI\u2019m stunned there is a book out by National Geographic that lists 1,001 people who made America and I\u2019m listed. I said, \u2018Wow.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe could have said much more about National Geographic\u2019s writing that Gregory \u201crose from the ghetto to become a nationally successful comic in the 1960s, who delivered biting satire targeted against racial prejudice. His comedy added a new dimension to the civil rights movement, raising the consciousness of black as well as white Americans. By the 1980s Gregory had left the comic stage and become an entrepreneur in the field of nutrition.\u201d\n\nOur interview took place in the lobby of St. Paul\u2019s Crowne Plaza with protesters and public milling around. Clyde Bellecourt, leader and co-founder of the American Indian Movement; David Glass, president of the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media, both White Earth members, and others created a human perimeter to keep Gregory\u2019s fans from interrupting my interview.\n\n\u201cThere were many [fans]. Wow,\u201d noted Glass, with a little heads-up for the Washington, D.C., area. \u201cFans and admirers of Dick Gregory, get ready. We are visiting Maryland\u2019s Fed Ex [Field] Dec. 28 for the last game of their losing season. It might not be as big as the rally in Minnesota, but we expect thousands and I think we\u2019ll have more celebrities. We are hoping to get congressman John Lewis, 1968 Olympian John Carlos and [former Viking] Joey Browner.\u201d\n\nDick Gregory\n\nIn my startribune.com/video I used a musical element plus the lobby noise to camouflage one word I bandied around with Gregory.\n\nQ: Why\u2019s it taking so long to get the name of the D.C. area NFL team changed?\n\nA: I just think the arrogance. You see, this has nothing to do with prejudice. It\u2019s white supremacy and most folks don\u2019t understand that, including white folks. And it works for them. This planet is 3 percent white people and 97 percent nonwhite, but the 3 percent control the whole planet. That\u2019s through white supremacy. I\u2019ve always said if I ever took over the first thing I would do is make Negros apologize to white folks, \u2019cause [we\u2019re] mad at the wrong white folks. The white folks [we\u2019re] mad at couldn\u2019t help us if they liked us. Who wants to live next to a Ku Klux Klansman? And the real [white people] who are the problem, we don\u2019t see \u2014 the Rockefellers, the Du Ponts. Ku Klux Klan [doesn\u2019t] determine public policy. My shame, I\u2019m 82 years old, is when I was growing [up] nobody told me that the cowboy movies were insults. So I\u2019d go to the cowboy movies and pull for the cowboys. I\u2019d go to the African movies and pull for Tarzan. What I like now is there are no cowboy movies so [new] generations [are not] seeing that and there\u2019s a friendly feeling toward Native Americans. \u2026 Momentum, momentum.\n\nQ: Are you as surprised as I am that there are blacks who don\u2019t understand the name of the D.C. team is offensive?\n\nA: I\u2019m a little outraged and not surprised. My mother worked hard, two jobs, to see to it the six of us had Christmas \u2014 and she told me a white man named Santa Claus brought it. So I couldn\u2019t be surprised with that mentality.\n\nQ: A lot of blacks don\u2019t realize how far back our relationship with, as I call them, the Original Americans, goes. Reservations were safe havens for runaway slaves.\n\nA: You know why they don\u2019t know it? Because NBC and CBS haven\u2019t told them. Here\u2019s my take: I\u2019m just as guilty as the white folks because if my sons and daughters broke in your house, killed everybody and took it over, I\u2019m not responsible for that. But once I start living in there \u2026 So we aren\u2019t responsible for what happened to the Native Americans but now that we\u2019re part of this, you know. And I always say on Thanksgiving: When you black folks be praying and thanking and praising God, do you think about the [people] who invented Thanksgiving? I don\u2019t know if we can ever change the old black folks but [they\u2019re] fixing to die anyway. [Laugh]\n\nQ: What name would you give the D.C. area NFL team?\n\nA: [His name was a hybrid of two racially offensive terms for blacks and white.] Then you\u2019d see black folks complaining. [Extended laughter] Then it would be a different ballgame.\n\nQ: That\u2019s what you say humorously, but if you were serious?\n\nA: I wouldn\u2019t even know how to start. I\u2019d bring a committee in \u2026 You see [the owner of the D.C.-area NFL team Dan] Snyder is just a young, ignorant punk. What\u2019s going to happen is they are fixing to move that team back into Washington, D.C. [If Snyder wants to be in D.C. he may have to change the team\u2019s name because the mayor of D.C. finds it divisive.]\n\nQ: You\u2019ve been married to Lil since 1959?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: What do you know about creating a lasting marriage that 50 percent of the population doesn\u2019t know?\n\nA: I\u2019m gone most of the time. Mine was easy. I had a mother who used to preach to us, \u201cNo son of mine will ever get a woman pregnant and won\u2019t marry her.\u201d So I got her pregnant. Mom didn\u2019t say you had to stay with her. I told her the other day, \u2018If you ever leave me, I will never get married again.\u2019 She said Why? I said, \u2018It didn\u2019t cost nothing.\u2019 You get pregnant, go to the justice of the peace, get married. I didn\u2019t [spend] no $65,000 for a wedding and then go to South America [for a honeymoon]. I said to her, if you want this to work, it\u2019s not about love. It\u2019s can you be lovable as [a person]. You have children [with whom] you\u2019re lovable. The type of love you marry for is a sex thing and anger and all of that and all the crazy stuff that happens in a society that\u2019s sexist; you bring that to the marriage. That\u2019s not the attitude you have with your children. The house is on fire, you make sure you get them out. I\u2019ve never raised my voice, at all. I\u2019ve made millions of dollars. I never wrote a check in my life. All of that goes to her. She\u2019s able to tolerate [me]. That\u2019s what it is.\n\nQ: One of your children is named Gregory Gregory?\n\nA: No, no. Gregory. One name. Here\u2019s what happened. The real white folks showed up at my house two weeks after his birth and said, You cannot name your son Gregory. One name doesn\u2019t work on the computer. I said, \u2018Look, as a Christian did y\u2019all throw the Bible away?\u2019 Because everybody in the Bible had one name. The real flak comes from one of my daughters I named Miss Gregory. There is one black woman on this planet that all white folks have to call Miss.\n\nQ: Do you have any comedians you admire currently doing stand-up acts?\n\nA: I don\u2019t look at them.\n\nQ: Bill Maher, Lizz Winstead?\n\nA: First time I\u2019ve heard that name. I like this new crop of comedians but I don\u2019t get to see them.\n\nQ: What\u2019s the greatest misconception about you, not that I think you care?\n\nA: [Back when] I was in the military, wasn\u2019t any war going on but had there been a war, I\u2019d have [gone] anyway. It\u2019s funny. [Despite] a white racist, insane nation, I\u2019m willing to go and die.\n\nQ: The name of your autobiography is [the N-word]. How often do you use that word in a week?\n\nA: All the time. You know why? When I was a little boy I didn\u2019t hear too good. So when white folks called me [N-word] I thought they were saying bigger. \u2026 Y\u2019all don\u2019t know enough about the word. I\u2019m 82 years old and 98 percent of all the black women I\u2019ve been around, I\u2019ve never heard them say [N-word]. White people don\u2019t know that. They just think it\u2019s something we all say. Women don\u2019t say it. Basically men do, so it must be a sex thing.\n\nInterviews are edited.
