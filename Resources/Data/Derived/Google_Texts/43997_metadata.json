Obamacare is a disaster, and taxes are too high. Constitutional rights are being violated left and right. Sanctuary cities are endangering citizens. The terrorists are beating us. Russia and China are laughing at us. Pulling America back from the abyss requires daily prayer and a political awakening.\n\nWhen the Democratic candidates gathered at a forum Monday night in Des Moines, they identified an entirely different set of problems: Wages are stagnant, and workers have been left behind by the economic recovery; guns are rampant; the big banks are greedy and reckless; the police can no longer be trusted; and climate change threatens environmental catastrophe.\n\nPresidential elections have long featured major differences between Democrats and Republicans, but the fault lines have generally been over how to fix the problems facing the country. What makes the 2016 campaign unique is that the two parties don\u2019t even agree on the problems.\n\nThe conversations underway on the two parties\u2019 debate stages and at their candidates\u2019 rallies and town hall meetings are strikingly different. This fall\u2019s general election is likely to turn on which set of issues voters consider more urgent.\n\nBernie Sanders regularly calls for a \"political revolution\" in America, but what does that mean? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s going to be which of these visions \u2014 regardless of what the solutions are, but what the priorities are, what the issue set is \u2014 will appeal to independent voters,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont. \u201cWhich vision are independents going to accept as the legitimate vision, even if they don\u2019t agree with all of the solutions?\u201d\n\nThe dynamic also could have significant consequences for whoever is sworn in as president.\n\nA Democratic president such as Sanders or Hillary Clinton, for instance, would be heavily engaged in reining in Wall Street, toughening gun laws and combating climate change.\n\nBut a Republican president probably would not see those as areas of concern, much less emphasis. That president would probably focus on undoing President Obama\u2019s biggest achievements and recalibrating U.S. foreign policy to be more assertive toward the Islamic State.\n\nOne of the few areas of agreement between the two parties is drug abuse \u2014 specifically the heroin epidemic tearing through the country. \u201cThe drug thing is killing Republicans and Democrats together,\u201d former president Bill Clinton said at a campaign rally in Concord, N.H.\n\nJoel Benenson, the pollster on Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and now Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief strategist, attributed the divide on issues to the constituencies that each party is trying to reach. Whereas Republicans aggressively court evangelical Christians and other grass-roots conservatives, Democrats cater to the interests of minorities, women and \u00adworking-class people.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party generally has been focused on the lives of working Americans and the fundamental issues that they\u2019re still dealing with: How do I get a good-paying job? How do I get my kids into college? How do I get my pay up? How do I get some of my costs down?\u201d Benenson said. \u201cThe Republican Party seems to be locked in some kind of echo chamber.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton takes a question from a voter at a campaign event in Toledo, Iowa, on Monday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nBut Republicans say their top issues are the priorities of most Americans \u2014 and they point to the groundswell of enthusiasm for their campaigns as proof.\n\n\u201cThere is an awakening that\u2019s sweeping this country,\u201d Cruz said repeatedly as he visited nearly two dozen New Hampshire towns last week on a bus tour.\n\nThe last two candidates\u2019 debates \u2014 both in Charleston, S.C., and clocking in at about two hours each \u2014 offered a vivid illustration of the gulf. At the Jan. 14 GOP debate, there were 15 mentions of the word \u201cimmigration,\u201d but three days later at the Democratic debate, it came up three times.\n\nChina was invoked 43 times in the GOP debate but only three times at the Democratic one. No Republican said the word \u201cclimate,\u201d yet it was uttered seven times on the Democratic stage. And \u201cISIS\u201d \u2014 an acronym for the Islamic State \u2014 was said 46 times by the Republicans, compared with 20 times by the Democrats.\n\nAfter seeing the Democrats spar, Matt Moore, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, walked away stunned.\n\n\u201cNo candidate mentioned national security over the first hour of the debate,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe believe national security is the most important issue facing the American people. That was quite perplexing.\u201d\n\nFor a split-screen contrast, just attend one of Chris Christie\u2019s town hall meetings. The Republican governor of New Jersey often goes on for more than an hour talking almost exclusively about the danger of \u201cradical jihadist terrorism\u201d and warning that the next target could be anywhere.\n\n\u201cI lose three times as many calories when I listen to the Republicans talk than when I listen to Democrats, because it gets you all revved up,\u201d Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) said. \u201cYou almost feel like: \u2018Oh, my God, the world\u2019s going to end next week. I better do something.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBaltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (D) lamented that issues she and many of her urban constituents consider critical \u2014 including criminal-justice reform and voting rights \u2014 are largely ignored by the leading Republican candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery to me that at a time that is so critical to our country\u2019s future, virtually half the country would be satisfied with that type of superficial and too-often childish debate, when we have some real serious things going on in our country,\u201d \u00adRawlings-Blake said.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the issues that the candidates prioritize, but also the kind of language they use during their campaigns.\n\nAt the Democratic debate, no candidate said the words \u201cGod,\u201d \u201cChristian,\u201d \u201cBible\u201d or \u201cscripture,\u201d and the three \u2014 Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley \u2014 do not commonly use such words in their speeches.\n\nBy contrast, the Republican candidates tend to wear their faith on their sleeves, in part to win over conservative Christian voters in Iowa and other states.\n\nDonald Trump brings his childhood Bible with him to some campaign rallies and holds it as a prop, although the billionaire mogul drew mockery when he botched a reference to Second Corinthians during a recent speech to students at Liberty University, the Christian college in Virginia founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell.\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush often talks about his Catholic faith and carries a rosary on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd Cruz, whose father is a born-again Christian and travels the country preaching, has taken to quoting scripture in his stump speeches. He cites Second Chronicles 7:14 and urges his supporters to find time every day to pray for the country\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cJust one minute when you wake up in the morning,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re shaving. When you\u2019re having lunch. When you\u2019re tucking your kids into bed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic and Republican candidates have wildly different ideas about America\u2019s top problems.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Democratic and Republican candidates have wildly different ideas about America\u2019s top problems.", "title": "The two parties can\u2019t agree on the problems, let alone the solutions", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-two-parties-cant-agree-on-the-problems-let-alone-the-solutions/2016/01/26/1b3a4bf4-bfeb-11e5-9443-7074c3645405_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/21/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Cruz_Fact_Check-0b51e-3479.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PhilipRucker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-two-parties-cant-agree-on-the-problems-let-alone-the-solutions/2016/01/26/1b3a4bf4-bfeb-11e5-9443-7074c3645405_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "election 2016, republican party", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1b3a4bf4-bfeb-11e5-9443-7074c3645405", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "election 2016, republican party"}, "article_summary": "What makes the 2016 campaign unique is that the two parties don\u2019t even agree on the problems.\nBut a Republican president probably would not see those as areas of concern, much less emphasis.\nA Democratic president such as Sanders or Hillary Clinton, for instance, would be heavily engaged in reining in Wall Street, toughening gun laws and combating climate change.\nThe conversations underway on the two parties\u2019 debate stages and at their candidates\u2019 rallies and town hall meetings are strikingly different.\nAt the Jan. 14 GOP debate, there were 15 mentions of the word \u201cimmigration,\u201d but three days later at the Democratic debate, it came up three times."}
