Sometimes I think we\u2019re like that frog, and we get comfortable with where we\u2019re at in life and sit still, while other times we hop right out.\n\nLast year was one of those times we chose not to be \u201ccooked alive\u201d and we voted out Mary Landrieu, who had tirelessly campaigned for the re-election of President Obama, even as he gutted our oil and gas industry (which employs nearly 320,000 in our state) and lobbied Congress to increase energy taxes, not to mention the White House\u2019s de facto moratorium on drilling and exploration, wreaking havoc on our economy.\n\nLike John Bel Edwards, though, Mary Landrieu supports the expansion of the Affordable Care Act, even though over 60 percent of us in Louisiana do not. If you remember, she also supports raising the minimum wage, just like John Bel Edwards does \u2013 even though 85 percent of studies since 1990 show that increasing the minimum wage causes companies to cut low-skilled workers, making them more likely to stay unemployed.\n\nAnd just like Mary Landrieu, John Bel Edwards supports Planned Parenthood 100 percent.\n\nThe problem for John Bel Edwards, just like it was for Mary Landrieu, is that Louisiana politics has moved on. The \u201cevery man a king\u201d Democrat, or politicians that say one thing among the voters, and another when they are in office, is a tired, worn out template which is indicative of politicians more interested in the next election, than the next generation.\n\nYet this year, these same folks who voted out Mary Landrieu are now considering voting for John Bel Edwards and going back to the Louisiana of yesterday, and endorsing the old-style, hypocritical, Louisiana populist politics that asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s in for me?\u201d\n\nRemember Governor Edwin Edwards? He was a populist, and was elected four times as governor because of it. In the meantime, he was lining his own pockets with payments from state contractors and then raised taxes on the people of Louisiana by almost $1 billion to pay for it.\n\nOr how about populist U.S. Representative Bill Jefferson from New Orleans, who accepted $500,000 in bribes while in office, in exchange for his influence in Congress?\n\nOr New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin who was convicted on 20 counts of bribery, and is now serving 10 years in prison for selling the mayor\u2019s office for his personal gain?\n\nAll of these examples share a common denominator: These politicians all claimed to be champions of the people, and defender of the \u201clittle guy\u201d or even \u201cconservative\u201d Democrats, in some instances. Instead, though, the people lived under one set of rules, while their elected leaders lived by another. They said one thing, and then did another.\n\nGood intentions are not enough, though. You only need to look around to see what decades of politicians\u2019 good intentions have done to our nation, and our communities. Of course, good intentions can provide a spark to ignite a purpose, launch a plan, and to direct the mind, but they can tell you nothing about the actual outcome \u2013 so we must make sure our vote is an informed one.\n\nHuey P. Long made famous the slogan, \u201cEvery man a king, but no one wears a crown.\u201d That sounds good, but history has shown that it\u2019s often the populist, well-intentioned politicians, like Mary Landrieu and John Bel Edwards, who end up wearing the crowns \u2013 while we get cooked alive, in the meantime.\n\n\u2014 Louis R.
