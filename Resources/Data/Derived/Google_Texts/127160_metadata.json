The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for further consideration in light of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,\" read the order.\n\nThe Washington, DC-based Becket Fund for Religious Liberty has followed the case and submitted an amicus brief on behalf of the Catholic Conference.\n\nMark Rienzi, senior counsel with the Becket Fund, told The Christian Post he was \"delighted that the Court once again rejected the government's stingy view of religious liberty.\"\n\nFree Sign Up Newsletter!\n\n\"That's what is so bizarre about the government's position,\" said Rienzi regarding the federal government's effort to prevent a religious organization from getting a religious exemption.\n\n\"The government says they are not a 'religious employer' and therefore they have to sign forms to authorize and require other people to give out contraceptives for them. That makes no sense at all.\"\n\nIn 2012, the Obama Administration announced the creation of an HHS mandate that would compel insurance to cover FDA approved birth control methods.\n\nThe announcement garnered controversy as many argued that the then-proposed HHS mandate did not adequately exempt all of those with religious objections to some or all forms of contraception covered by the mandate.\n\nSince then, the federal government has made various compromises and has lost the occasional court case compelling them to amend the mandate.\n\n\"Under current law, [the Catholic Conference and others] can receive an exemption by writing a letter to the Health and Human Services Department or filling out a two-page form to document their objections,\" reported the Hill.\n\n\"But the groups said those extra steps created an 'unjustified substantial burden' and called for the same kind of across-the-board exemption that houses of worship received under the law. \"\n\nRegarding the overall lawsuits being leveled nationwide against the mandate, Rienzi of Becket Fund told CP that he believed the Supreme Court will eventually have to take up the issue.\n\n\"I think that the Court will continue the path it has set in the long string of mandate cases to date \u2026 and it will protect religious ministries from this mandate,\" said Rienzi.\n\n\"This whole fight is unnecessary and silly. Obviously the government can distribute contraceptives without the forced involvement of the Catholic Church and its ministries. The government can put a man on the moon \u2014 they can distribute pills without religious ministries.\"\n\nReportedly Michigan Catholic Conference's success at the high court is the sixth group since December 2013 that the Justices have sided with on HHS mandate legal action.\n\nThe other five are Little Sisters of the Poor, Hobby Lobby Stores, Wheaton College, the University of Notre Dame, and Archbishop David A. Zubik with the Diocese of Pittsburgh.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The U.S. Supreme Court has thrown out a ruling against a Catholic organization that was being compelled to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives at the threat of being fined by the Internal Revenue Service.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Supreme Court Stops IRS Fines From Hitting Catholic Group Over Federal Contraception Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court has thrown out a ruling against a Catholic organization that was being compelled to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives at the threat of being fined by the Internal Revenue Service.", "title": "Supreme Court Stops IRS Fines From Hitting Catholic Group Over Federal Contraception Mandate", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/supreme-court-stops-irs-fines-from-hitting-catholic-group-over-federal-contraception-mandate-138399/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/81426/supreme-court.jpg", "author": "Michael Gryboski", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ChristianPost", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/81426/supreme-court.jpg", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court has thrown out a ruling against a Catholic organization that was being compelled to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives at the threat of being fined by the Internal Revenue Service.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Supreme Court Stops IRS Fines From Hitting Catholic Group Over Federal Contraception Mandate"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/supreme-court-stops-irs-fines-from-hitting-catholic-group-over-federal-contraception-mandate-138399/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "IRS,SCOTUS,Supreme&20Court,Sixth&20Circuit,mandate,appeal,Becket&20Fund,Michigan&20Catholic&20Conference,lawsuit,church&20and&20state,religious&20liberty,contraception,birth&20control,Barack&20Obama,HHS,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2015-04-29T12:18:00-04:00", "modDate": "2015-04-29T12:18:00-04:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "IRS, SCOTUS, Supreme Court, Sixth Circuit, mandate, appeal, Becket Fund, Michigan Catholic Conference, lawsuit, church and state, religious liberty, contraception, birth control, Barack Obama, HHS,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 2012, the Obama Administration announced the creation of an HHS mandate that would compel insurance to cover FDA approved birth control methods.\nReportedly Michigan Catholic Conference's success at the high court is the sixth group since December 2013 that the Justices have sided with on HHS mandate legal action.\n, Christian Post Reporter By Michael Gryboski Christian Post Reporter(Photo: Reuters/Joshua Roberts) A police officer walks up the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington March 2, 2015.\nRegarding the overall lawsuits being leveled nationwide against the mandate, Rienzi of Becket Fund told CP that he believed the Supreme Court will eventually have to take up the issue.\nThe other five are Little Sisters of the Poor, Hobby Lobby Stores, Wheaton College, the University of Notre Dame, and Archbishop David A.
