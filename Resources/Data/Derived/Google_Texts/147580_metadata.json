For example, Methodist Richardson (Texas) Medical Center relocated to a $120 million, 125-bed facility a few miles from its old location in May after a three-year design and construction process, according to the article. In the new building, all outpatient services are on the ground floor with the emergency room, laboratory and radiology department all located next to the medical office building.\n\nMethodist Richardson has also established three \"care zones\" for all patient rooms, according to President Kenneth Hutchenrider: the area immediately off the hallway for caregivers such as nurses, the patient zone at and around the bed, and the family/visitor zone around the window.\n\nIntermountain Healthcare in Utah adopted similar design strategies to maximize patient satisfaction, according to Director of Program Development Heath Jones. \"We're starting to develop a blueprint of co-locating services,\" Jones told U.S. News. Intermountain, he said, decided design is a vital part of the broader business strategy, as part of a model of more connected care the organization wants to pioneer on a national or global scale.\n\nIntermountain's other design innovations include increasing surgery and imaging's proximity to one another whenever possible due to their intertwined nature, according to the article.\n\nMeanwhile, in New York City, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has an innovation team featuring four in-house designers, one of whom has a background in anthropology. In 2008, Memorial Sloan-Kettering collaborated with Parsons The New School for Design on its new chemotherapy infusion center in Brooklyn, taking into account design suggestions such as meditation areas and customizable lighting in each room, according to the article.\n\nHospitals take design cues from other industries as well, such as CHI St. Luke's Health-The Woodlands (Texas) Hospital, which used the hospitality industry as a model, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTo improve satisfaction scores, hospitals seek patient input on design\n\nHospitals use design to improve population health\n\nFlorida Hospital to build apartments for employees\n\nAirports, shopping malls inspire revamped hospital designs\n\nNew hospital design keeps patient in mind, improves safety\n\nGood design may revolutionize healthcare industry, improve outcomes\n\nDo hotel-like hospitals deliver patient-centered care?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals increasingly pay attention to\u00a0design\u00a0and physical space as a factor in\u00a0patient experience,\u00a0according to\u00a0U.S. News & World Report.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals increasingly pay attention to\u00a0design\u00a0and physical space as a factor in\u00a0patient experience,\u00a0according to\u00a0U.S. News & World Report.", "title": "Hospitals innovate design strategies to improve patient experience", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-innovate-design-strategies-improve-patient-experience/2014-09-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,design,hospital architecture,Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Experience,Patient Satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:To improve satisfaction scores, hospitals seek patient input on designHospitals use design to improve population healthFlorida Hospital to build apartments for employeesAirports, shopping malls inspire revamped hospital designsNew hospital design keeps patient in mind, improves safetyGood design may revolutionize healthcare industry, improve outcomesDo hotel-like hospitals deliver patient-centered care?\nHospitals increasingly pay attention to design and physical space as a factor in patient experience, according to an article in U.S. News & World Report.\nIntermountain Healthcare in Utah adopted similar design strategies to maximize patient satisfaction, according to Director of Program Development Heath Jones.\nHospitals look to design as a way to improve both population and community health.\nHospitals take design cues from other industries as well, such as CHI St. Luke's Health-The Woodlands (Texas) Hospital, which used the hospitality industry as a model, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
