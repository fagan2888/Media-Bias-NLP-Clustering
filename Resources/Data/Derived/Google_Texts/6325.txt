The Strain

Apparently a worm crawling out of someone's body through their eye socket isn't what people want to see on their way to work in the morning — or at all, for that matter.

FX used such an image to advertise its upcoming horror series The Strain, and is now replacing several billboards after residents complained, Entertainment Weekly reports.

The network is "in the process of replacing the key art for The Strain on outdoor media in several locations," according to EW, though it did not specify which locations.

Last week, Buzzfeed posted a roundup of Twitter complaints from Los Angeles residents about the billboard.

Directed by Guillermo del Toro and adapted from the book trilogy by Del Toro and Chuck Hogan, The Strain stars Corey Stoll as an epidemiologist who's working to stop a contagion that's turning New Yorkers into vampires. Carlton Cuse (Lost) will serve as showrunner.
