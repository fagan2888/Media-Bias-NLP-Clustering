Rand Paul appears to have one persistent stalwart on his side in his quest for the White House: His father.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what I really think about my son, Rand, then don\u2019t listen to our national media,\u201d says Ron Paul, both a former congressman and presidential hopeful himself.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to the big government Washington insiders who\u2019d love nothing more than another Bush/Clinton showdown in November of 2016,\u201d Mr. Paul says of his son in a lengthy and strongly worded public campaign message.\n\n\u201cThere is not one candidate who has run for president in my lifetime who can say they fully share my commitment to liberty, Austrian economics, small government, and following the Constitution, than my son, Rand Paul. That\u2019s why I have wholeheartedly endorsed him.\u201d\n\nMr. Paul, the senior, has also organized a public pledge of support for the candidate and has launched a fundraising effort. He says any rumors that father and son are at odds are manufactured \u201cstory lines\u201d from the press.\n\n\u201cTruth is treason in the empire of lies. And nowhere is that more true than when it comes to Washington, D.C. and their media mouthpieces. Even where Rand and I do have minor differences of opinion, I would take Rand\u2019s position over any of his opponents\u2019 in both parties every time,\u201d Mr. Paul says in his message, suggesting that news organizations have their GOP favorites.\n\n\u201cThey fear Rand more than any other candidate. They know he is our best hope to restore liberty, limited government and the Bill of Rights and finally end the big spending status quo in Washington, D.C.,\u201d the father says, citing his son\u2019s opposition to the NSA\u2019s bulk metadata collection program, Obamacare, \u201cwar fever,\u201d the dangers of drones and the Federal Reserve - among other things\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s proven he\u2019s unafraid to stand up to anyone in Washington when the times call for it - even the leadership of his own party,\u201d Mr Paul says, later adding, \u201cI\u2019m proud to say I \u2018Stand with Rand\u2018.\u201d\n\nThe Republican senator is not on the campaign trail at the moment. The GOP candidate, an ophthalmologist, is in in Haiti performing charity eye surgery in a program organized by the Moran Eye Center from the University of Utah.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
