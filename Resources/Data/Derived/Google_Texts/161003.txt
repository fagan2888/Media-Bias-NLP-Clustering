Parts of northern Colorado are under a red flag warning for fire danger Saturday as temperatures climb into the mid-70s.

“Unseasonably warm temperatures, very low humidity and gusty west winds will combine to produce high to very high rangeland fire danger this afternoon,” the National Weather Service said in a statement.

The red flag warning is in effect near the Wyoming border in Larimer and Weld counties and along the base of the Front Range foothills in Boulder and Jefferson counties, according to the weather service.

“Elsewhere, light winds and unseasonably warm temperatures with abundant sunshine are to be expected today,” the weather service said. “Tonight, a week cold front is expected to race south across northeast Colorado after midnight, bringing cooler temperatures and slightly higher humidity to the area.”

Sunday, the weather in Denver is expected to be sunny with a high of 65 degrees. The weather service said there is a slight chance of rain in the northeastern part of the state Sunday afternoon and evening.

In Denver, high temperatures are expected to return to the 70s by Monday and remain there at least through Wednesday.
