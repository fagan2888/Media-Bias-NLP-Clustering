Cannon Falls, MN

A Minnesota State Patrol says a trooper responding to a traffic accident slammed into another car in Cannon Falls, killing two people in the other vehicle.



The collision happened Friday about 2:35 p.m. Cannon Falls is about 35 miles southeast of St. Paul.



State Patrol Lt. Eric Roeske says 48-year-old state trooper Scott Reps was airlifted to a hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.



Roeske says Reps' squad had its lights flashing and sirens activated. He says the other vehicle pulled out of a parking lot, and the Reps slammed into it.



The collision killed Norman Scott, the 78-year-old man driving the other vehicle, and his passenger, 79-year-old Geneva Scott. Both were from Cannon Falls.



State Patrol Lt. Col. Matt Langer says authorities haven't determined how fast Reps was going.
