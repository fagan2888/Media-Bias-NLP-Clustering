Precisely 7,745 of those had been pending for more than 45 days, which is the most allowed under CMS rules unless the applicant needs a disability determination.\n\nThe call center is being run by a state contractor, Maximus, which reported average hold times of about 20 minutes for the month of February. However, some callers were kept on hold for almost an hour and a half.\n\nMosier\u2019s letter says the backlog resulted from a rush of 13,000 Medicaid applications during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment, which ran from November through January.\n\nThe letter does not mention a computer system switch last summer that state officials have previously said contributed to the backlog.\n\nGov. Sam Brownback, in his budgets for the current fiscal year and the next, has banked a total of $10 million in Medicaid savings because of lagging enrollment since the implementation of the Kansas Eligibility Enforcement System, or KEES.\n\nScott\u2019s letter asks state officials to set a date for eliminating the backlog but Mosier didn\u2019t specify one in her response\n\nNursing home groups unsatisfied\n\nIn Kansas, Medicaid serves about 450,000 low-income children, pregnant women, people with disabilities and the elderly.\n\nScott\u2019s letter requests that the state submit information on the backlog on a bi-weekly basis. He also asks state officials to describe how they plan to address unreimbursed care provided to people whose Medicaid applications are pending.\n\nThat request is of particular interest to nursing homes, which rely heavily on Medicaid and are carrying, in some cases, more than $1 million in unpaid bills.\n\nThe state\u2019s response, which was to tell Scott that providers would be reimbursed retroactively once Medicaid applications have been processed, did not satisfy representatives of nursing home associations.\n\nRachel Monger, director of government affairs for LeadingAge Kansas, said the state is already required to retroactively reimburse nursing facilities and it doesn\u2019t solve their current cash flow issues.\n\n\u201cThe entire issue we are having is that providers are being forced to provide uncompensated care, and elders are being turned away from care, until their application is processed,\u201d Monger said. \u201cOur providers need payment now.\u201d\n\nRetroactive payments might help providers of services that allow seniors to stay in their homes.\n\nMonger\u2019s group, which represents non-profit nursing homes, and the Kansas Health Care Association, which represents for-profit homes, have asked the administration to give presumptive Medicaid eligibility to their residents.\n\nCindy Luxem, executive director of the KHCA, said her organization has heard little about the state\u2019s response to CMS, but some of the state\u2019s previous efforts to help have not lived up to expectations.\n\nShe said KHCA and LeadingAge met with KDHE officials recently and were told that while the backlog persists, no one waiting on a Medicaid review will be dropped.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we send that (message) out (to members) we get an email from a member who had three folks drop off the Medicaid rolls since the first of March,\u201d Luxem said.\n\nLuxem said she welcomes the involvement of the federal government, which funds about 60 percent of Medicaid in Kansas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Luxem said. \u201cSomething\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nMitzi McFatrich, who runs an advocacy group for nursing home residents called Kansas Advocates for Better Care, said something needs to happen soon.\n\nHer group has documented instances of frail and elderly Kansans unable to find nursing facilities that will take them while their Medicaid applications are pending for months.\n\n\u201cIt is inexcusable that the state hasn't followed its own rules and federal law, and a sad commentary that someone from the federal government has to point that out,\u201d McFatrich said. \u201cWe remain hopeful but skeptical until we see the State take action and clear the backlog.\u201d\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.
