Artful water features

To truly become a pleasurable place, a garden needs two final touches: art, and the sound and sight of water. Denver artist and graphic designer Daniel Bahn found a way to combine the two in his bright mosaic-tile fountains, sold under the name Artistic Water Features. They’re a fitting match for modern architecture and vibrant plant life, and their vertical profile was created with smaller urban spaces in mind. Each individual tile is set by hand. Fountains measuring 18 by 48 inches start at $2,400; the largest, 5 by 3 feet, start at $4,800. Product manager Shara Todd, Bahn’s wife, says the couple has found that most people want him to create a one-of-a-kind design. Bahn has also partnered with Mobilane, a British company that manufactures green walls, to create a tile surround for their LivePicture planters. (If you want to see Bahn’s work in person, there’s a piece slated to be installed on the Kaos Pizzeria patio at 1439 S. Pearl.) Susan Clotfelter
