Under the act, beginning in 2018, individual health care plans over $10,200 per year are eligible for a 40 percent \u201cCadillac tax.\u201d Albemarle\u2019s current individual plan averages $8,349 per year.\n\nSchool Board member Steve Koleszar said he\u2019d like to see the School Board hold a separate work session on the issue.\n\nIn addition to health insurance premiums, the joint boards held their annual talk on compensation.\n\nWhile the two bodies decided not to vote until they see County Executive Tom Foley\u2019s five-year financial plan, they reached consensus on a possible salary increase of 1 percent to 3 percent for teachers and classified staff.\n\nA 1 percent raise would come with an approximately $1.5 million price tag, while a 3 percent raise would cost $4.5 million, assistant county executive Bill Letteri said.\n\nLast year, the county and the school division planned for a 2 percent salary increase, but ultimately lowered that figure to 1 percent in the face of a challenging budget year.\n\nTo make up for the lost increases, staff\u2019s recommendation Wednesday called for a 3 percent increase for classified staff and a 2 percent bump for teachers.\n\nBut Supervisor Jane Dittmar said she was hesitant to agree on a number so early in the budgeting process.\n\nSchool Board member Jason Buyaki agreed.\n\n\u201cIt sets false expectations,\u201d Buyaki said. \u201cWe have seven more months of budget work ahead of us before we can finalize the numbers.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Albemarle adopted a compensation strategy in which the county surveys surrounding localities to establish competitive market wages.\n\nFor classified, or non-teaching, staff, Albemarle\u2019s strategy is to pay at the 50 percent level of the competitive market, or midway between the highest and lowest salaries.\n\nFor teachers, the strategy is to pay at the bottom of the top quartile, or the 75th percentile.\n\nSupervisor Ken Boyd said that compensation strategies have changed a lot in the last 14 years.\n\n\u201cMaybe a small group should take a look at our strategy and see if it still makes sense,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nKoleszar agreed, but said he thought the current system worked well.\n\n\u201cWe changed from the 50th percentile to the 75th because we saw our applicant pool drying up and we were hiring teachers we shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d he said.\n\nSchools Superintendent Pam Moran said that any perception that teachers have been receiving raises is false.\n\n\u201cWhile on the surface it appears that our employees have gotten raises, in reality almost every one of those have been counterbalanced by actions that have removed them from their paychecks,\u201d Moran said, noting that recent increases were due to issues such as rising Virginia Retirement System contribution mandates.\n\nGerome said the two boards also will be considering a new leave system that would offer one short- and long-term leave program to all employees.\n\nThe School Board is set to meet at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct 9 in Lane Auditorium of the County Office Building on McIntire Road.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com:80/cville/cache%2F41%2F41%2F4141e5d09766dd5200cfe0b5dd1e2f6f.png", "site_name": "Charlottesville Tomorrow"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb97\"", "article_summary": "School Board member Steve Koleszar said he\u2019d like to see the School Board hold a separate work session on the issue.\nAlbemarle mulls cutting health benefits for spouses; raises for county employees preliminarily discussedLorna Gerome (right) discusses health insurance and employee compensation with the Albemarle School Board and Board of SupervisorsRising health insurance costs were at the forefront of discussion Wednesday between the Albemarle Board of Supervisors and the county School Board.\nIn addition to health insurance premiums, the joint boards held their annual talk on compensation.\nTo deal with this, the two boards are now considering a shift in health insurance offerings that would stop providing coverage to spouses who can receive those benefits elsewhere.\nThe School Board is set to meet at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct 9 in Lane Auditorium of the County Office Building on McIntire Road."}
