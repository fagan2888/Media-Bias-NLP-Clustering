Pilots hate to land in LaGuardia because the runways are short. Some have said it\u2019s like trying to land a 747 as if it were a helicopter.\n\nThe most egregious of LaGuardia\u2019s runways is number 13 \u2014 a mere mile and half long \u2014 the one that Delta flight 1086 was forced to use during today\u2019s snowstorm. Thankfully no one was hurt, but the plane could have careened into Flushing Bay had it not been for new technology that prevented it.\n\nIn June 1997, another Delta Airlines jet from Atlanta carrying 63 people \u201cstruck the concrete pier supporting the runway, ripping off its landing gear. The 75-ton plane skidded 2,700 feet on its nose wheel and belly. The Fuselage cleared the pier by only 16 inches,\u201d according to a report in The New York Times.\n\nThat begs the question \u2014 why haven\u2019t we built a new, modern accessible airport in New York City, the nation\u2019s business capital? Reason: We don\u2019t have an infrastructure plan because our federal government is paralyzed.\n\nHow many more \u201cincidents\u201d like this will it take before federal and state governments become serious about fixing essential problems in the United States? In 2010, LaGuardia was named the 8th Scariest airport to land, according to Smartertravel.com.\n\nAs one passenger told The New York Daily News about landing at LaGuardia, \"It's like you're about to crash into the river! And if we did, it wouldn't be any 'Miracle on the Hudson' experience.\"\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you ever needed yet another reason to invest in America\u2019s infrastructure, the plane", "title": "LaGuardia\u2019s Runway 13: A Known Danger for Over 18 Years", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/05/LaGuardia-s-Runway-13-Known-Danger-Over-18-Years", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/delta_nose_fence.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/05/LaGuardia-s-Runway-13-Known-Danger-Over-18-Years", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/delta_nose_fence.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jackieleo"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If you ever needed yet another reason to invest in America\u2019s infrastructure, the plane", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0843\"", "article_summary": "If you ever needed yet another reason to invest in America\u2019s infrastructure, the plane that slid off the runway on LaGuardia Airport today may be it.\nIn June 1997, another Delta Airlines jet from Atlanta carrying 63 people \u201cstruck the concrete pier supporting the runway, ripping off its landing gear.\nThe most egregious of LaGuardia\u2019s runways is number 13 \u2014 a mere mile and half long \u2014 the one that Delta flight 1086 was forced to use during today\u2019s snowstorm.\nPilots hate to land in LaGuardia because the runways are short.\nAs one passenger told The New York Daily News about landing at LaGuardia, \"It's like you're about to crash into the river!"}
