But as designers and researchers who have spent the better part of two years creating a system of healthy living for a huge national populace, we think he didn\u2019t take his defense far enough. Not only are wellness programs valuable for the organizations and their employees, as his data states, they are our biggest hope for fixing a national health crisis.\n\nThanks to their reach and influence on employees, workplaces have a unique power to reframe the mindset around health itself \u2014 from one of sickness to wellness. \u201cCompanies are a microcosm of society and an important and unleveraged setting for health improvement and risk reduction,\u201d says Dr. Ron Goetzel, a leading expert in the field of health and productivity management. With 150 million Americans going to work every day, corporate America is not only in the best position to change our nation\u2019s health, but has a responsibility to do so.\n\nAs part of a project with the Department of Defense, we recently researched over 20 award-winning and recognized workplace wellness systems, at companies such as Johnson & Johnson, L.L. Bean, and Safeway. We saw these leading organizations owning the responsibility to change how people interact with healthcare, in a way that government or healthcare organizations have been unable to do.\n\nThe organizations with the greatest success are managing to shift people\u2019s relationship with health from one where health is something thought about and \u201cpracticed\u201d annually at the doctor\u2019s office, to one where health is practiced daily through small lifestyle habits. The more proactive stance toward health they have established feeds off of itself and enhances employee lives, even while reducing future costs. For the organizations in our study, this translates into average annual health care cost increases of 1 to 2 percent compared to the 7 percent national average.\n\nHow have they done this? Here are three approaches we discovered that appear to be key.\n\nPut it in Surround Sound\n\nThe best wellness programs bring the built environment, company policies, and leadership messaging under a single mission of wellness. When USAA\u2019s Enterprise Medical Director Dr. Peter Wald joined the organization 12 years ago, he found many discrete resources for wellness \u2014 mini gyms, cafes, and health experts \u2013 already in place. Once he tied them under the mission of prevention, putting health in \u201csurround sound,\u201d as he likes to say, the program took hold within the organization. Safeway redefined its core business from \u201ca grocery company with a wellness program,\u201d to \u201ca wellness company that happens to sell groceries,\u201d and the program took off. The CEO, along with the leadership team, ensures that health and wellness are kept top of mind, and leaders work hard to tie all wellness activities back to a broader company strategy. Safeway made large capital investments in a state-of-the-art fitness center, a preventative-care health center, and health-focused cafeterias to support the organizational mission. Creating a seamless wellness experience has resulted in participation rates of over 80 percent.\n\nKeep it Personal\n\nWhen health is made personal and put in real-life terms, people discover the value that health can hold in their lives \u2014 and that provides the strong call to action. Johnson & Johnson, which has one of the longest-standing wellness programs in the country, understands that people don\u2019t strive to get healthy because it\u2019s the right thing to do in some abstract sense. \u201cHealth is usually a means to an end,\u201d says Adam Glauberg, Director of Global Health Services at Johnson & Johnson. The individual wants to be there for family, to get off diabetes medication, to perform better at work. If the company can tap into those personal motivations, it can better communicate the value of health. J&J uses a platform called \u201cEnergy for Performance in Life,\u201d a training program designed by the Human Performance Institute division of Wellness & Prevention, a Johnson & Johnson company, to teach employees how to maximize their energy to improve their performance both at work and at home. The program is designed to be less clinical and more lifestyle-oriented than many health-oriented interventions. Making the program more relevant to everyday life dramatically increased the number of people engaging in it; it has now reached 90 percent employee participation.\n\nMake it a Collective Effort\n\nWellness needs to be done with employees, not to them, or the effects won\u2019t last. When employees feel a system is their own, engagement increases. The best programs actively design for \u201cgrassroots\u201d partnership and harness the power of shared accountability to sustain engagement. L.L. Bean empowers its employees in different locations to design their own wellness initiatives relevant to their department\u2019s needs. If a worksite is able to get at least 15 people interested in a new program, it receives funding and support from corporate to run that program locally. This kind of empowerment encourages many employees to become health and wellness representatives in their location \u2014 initiating activities such as Zumba and yoga and recruiting other employees to join in their collective wellness efforts. Building such community health champions helps spread the message and ensures the program\u2019s reach. It also keeps people accountable and gives them the support they need at those inevitable derailing moments.\n\nSo let\u2019s stop challenging the validity of comprehensive wellness programs, and instead celebrate our most wellness-oriented organizations for stepping up to a national health care crisis. Our society depends on their reach and influence to help move practice forward, and to reframe the conversation from a focus on sick care to a focus on well care. Already, these programs have made deeper inroads into large, intractable health care problems than anyone else \u2013 and with the Affordable Care Act making new provisions for wellness programs, there is hope for greater support and incentives. Let\u2019s give workplace wellness programs the support that will keep them, and the people in them, healthy.", "article_metadata": {"page-category-name": "Health", "msapplication-config": "none", "viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width", "description": "Getting it right matters, because it\u2019s our best chance to fix America\u2019s national health epidemic.", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Business Review", "description": "Getting it right matters, because it\u2019s our best chance to fix America\u2019s national health epidemic.", "title": "What Great Corporate Wellness Programs Do", "url": "https://hbr.org/2014/03/what-great-corporate-wellness-programs-do", "image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/hbr_opengraph_940x490.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harvardbiz", "creator": "@harvardbiz"}, "ox-group": 537063787, "item-name": "What Great Corporate Wellness Programs Do", "page-id": 300, "article-content-type": "Digital Article", "rr-placements": "item_page.articles,item_page.top_right,item_page.bottom,item_page.red_strip,item_page.subscribe_now,item_page.topbar_subscribe,item_page.mag_cover,item_page.subscribe,item_page.article_slider,item_page.exit_popup_slider", "page-category-id": 3982, "shopper-attributes": "state:guest", "sid": "A8EC0EBDB1C7DFCE34A5D3D2FE11B03A", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HBR", "published_time": "2014-03-21T15:00:45Z", "author": "Karuna Harishanker", "section": "Health", "modified_time": "2014-11-02T01:18:29Z", "tag": "Work-life balance"}, "page-type": "ITEM", "item-id": "tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.34016", "uid": "1dbe63509b1bae093e310506b083191b"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c4f\"", "article_summary": "In a recent HBR post, \u201cIn Defense of Corporate Wellness Programs,\u201d doctor and entrepreneur Rajiv Kumar took on the doubters about the value of workplace wellness programs.\nSafeway redefined its core business from \u201ca grocery company with a wellness program,\u201d to \u201ca wellness company that happens to sell groceries,\u201d and the program took off.\nPut it in Surround SoundThe best wellness programs bring the built environment, company policies, and leadership messaging under a single mission of wellness.\nLet\u2019s give workplace wellness programs the support that will keep them, and the people in them, healthy.\nJohnson & Johnson, which has one of the longest-standing wellness programs in the country, understands that people don\u2019t strive to get healthy because it\u2019s the right thing to do in some abstract sense."}
