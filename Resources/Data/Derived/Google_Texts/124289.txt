Stacy Blake breathed a sigh of relief Saturday morning after her grandmother's 1985 World Series sweatshirt was back in her hands.



"I'm just so excited to have it back and it's just like a little piece of my grandma is back with me," Blake said.



Blake lost the 30 year-old sweatshirt at the Royals parade Tuesday.



She wore it around her waist at the celebration in memory of her grandmother who died 14 years ago.



After shifting amongst 800,000 fans, she later realized it was gone.



"I guess in the hustle and bustle in between people it just fell off," Blake said.



Blake turned to social media to find the keepsake and one Kansas City, Kansas family responded.



"My sister shared with me her post that she had lost it and we were just so glad that we were the ones to find it and help her get it back," said the woman who found the sweatshirt, Nalonna Bauer.



Nalonna Bauer and her sisters were stuck in traffic after the festivities.



While searching for a restroom and food they came across the World Series sweatshirt.



"When we were walking back that's when we found it on the ground and we were like 'no way' we couldn't believe it," Bauer said.



Bauer's sisters live in St. Joseph and saw this facbook post circulating.

They recognized the shirt immediately and notified Bauer right away.



"I think they would just be thankful that we got it back to her and it's back home, so that's what matters," Bauer said.



Blake says she is grateful that there are still good people in this world.



"I just can't thank them enough and that there's warm-hearted, kind, people that would bring it back and I can't believe Facebook kept sharing it until I got it back," Blake said.
