It is also highly unlikely that Congress will be able to override the president\u2019s veto with a two-thirds majority in both chambers.\n\nHowever, pro-life leaders and other observers say they hope that the Senate passes the defunding measure. They believe that the issue of defunding Planned Parenthood, which receives $528 million in government money, is not going away anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe think any attempt to defund Planned Parenthood at this point is a good idea, and it shows the resolution of the Congress to stop federal money for this horrendous organization,\u201d said Jim Sedlak, vice president of American Life League, a national Catholic pro-life organization.\n\nSedlak told the Register that he is realistic about the bill\u2019s chances of becoming law, adding that there is \u201cno question\u201d the president will veto it.\n\n\u201cI still think it\u2019s good to pass the bill, send it to his desk and force him to veto it,\u201d Sedlak said.\n\nThe Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015 passed the House on a party-line vote of 240-189, with only one Democrat \u2014 Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota \u2014 voting for it. Seven Republicans voted against it.\n\nThe bill blocks any federal funding, including Medicaid funds, to Planned Parenthood while two House committees investigate the abortion provider for alleged violations of federal law. The investigations were prompted by a series of undercover videos that allege Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue for profit, which is illegal.\n\nThe Obamacare Linkage\n\nThe reconciliation bill also repeals the individual and employer insurance mandates in the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Congressional Republicans have long targeted the president\u2019s signature health-care law, voting dozens of times on bills to repeal the legislation.\n\nThree Republican senators \u2014 Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 have already come out against the reconciliation bill because it only repeals parts of the Affordable Care Act. In a joint statement, the senators said they would not support the bill unless it is amended to fully repeal Obamacare.\n\nPro-life Democrats, a small minority in their party, disagree with the Republicans\u2019 insistence on linking the repeal of Obamacare with defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nKristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America, told the Register that she does not approve the reconciliation bill as currently written.\n\n\u201cIf they take away defunding Obamacare, then I absolutely would,\u201d Day said. \u201cIf there is going to be any change to the health-care law, there has to be a plan in place. You can\u2019t gut the system when thousands of people are depending on it. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. That\u2019s not very pro-life.\u201d\n\nSaid Day, \u201cIf you bring up a clean Planned Parenthood defunding bill, then you could get somewhere. That\u2019s something we can do. Planned Parenthood [and affiliates] are bad players.\u201d\n\nSedlak, of American Life League, acknowledged the inclusion of the Affordable Care Act provisions \u201ccomplicates\u201d the bill\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cWe always hope that we can get a straight up-and-down vote on defunding Planned Parenthood by itself. We can win that on its own merits, but this is the way the bill was passed,\u201d Sedlak said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping the Senate will look at this bill and look at the defunding provisions of Planned Parenthood and pass it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping to see.\u201d\n\nChanging the Dialogue\n\nTo date, the Center for Medical Progress has released 11 undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing, in a blunt manner, the harvesting and selling of fetal organs. The Center for Medical Progress says the videos are proof that Planned Parenthood traffics fetal tissue for a profit and that it even performs partial-birth abortions to procure body parts.\n\nThe latest video, released Oct. 27, appears to show an abortionist for Planned Parenthood in Austin, Texas, describing a partial-birth abortion procedure to terminate living, late-term fetuses that she hoped would yield intact fetal heads for brain harvesting.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says the videos are \u201chighly edited\u201d and claims that its affiliates only charge reimbursement costs for procuring fetal tissue, which is legal. Still, earlier this month, Planned Parenthood announced that it would stop taking money from researchers for aborted fetal organs.\n\nSedlak said that the undercover videos have been instrumental in turning public opinion and more members of Congress against Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThese videos over the summer were absolutely terrific in terms of showing people the truth of Planned Parenthood and the callousness of the people there,\u201d Sedlak said.\n\nDay of Democrats for Life agrees the videos have had a \u201cmajor impact.\u201d She noted a recent Reuters poll that found that public support for federal funding of Planned Parenthood dropped 20 points \u2014 54% to 34% \u2014 after respondents saw the videos and learned more about the abortion provider\u2019s policies and procedures. She noted that Planned Parenthood, which has a $1.2-billion budget, performs more than 330,000 abortions a year.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be funding the largest abortion provider in the nation,\u201d Day said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t want their taxpayer dollars going there.\u201d\n\nAbortion Conference Videos\n\nPotentially even more compelling, in terms of shifting the public debate, might be the contents of Center for Medical Progress videos of comments apparently recorded at the April 2014 national conference of the National Abortion Federation. The footage, which was previously under a restraining order, was leaked and published by a conservative online news site on Oct. 23.\n\nConference participants freely discussed grisly events that occur during and after abortions, sometimes to laughter and applause. During one panel discussion, a female doctor commented that it\u2019s undeniable to abortionists that the fetuses they abort are living persons, and she suggested this should be openly acknowledged when pro-lifers point out this reality.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just give \u2019em all the violence: It\u2019s a person; it\u2019s killing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s just give them all that.\u201d\n\nStudents for Life of America subsequently created a mash-up of quotes from the conference video and posted it on the pro-life group\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder NAF sought a restraining order \u2014 these tapes expose the gruesome reality that abortionists face every day and the kinds of illogical justifications they use to end the lives of tiny human beings,\u201d Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said in an Oct. 28 blog post. \u201cThis is the reality of abortion \u2014 eyeballs dropping in the laps of abortionists, heads getting stuck, women in pain \u2014 and to hear advocates laughing about the dismembering of babies is stomach-churning. Would the general public be laughing along with them?\u201d\n\nRegister correspondent Brian Fraga writes\n\nfrom Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\nRegister staff contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In November, the U.S. Senate will take up the House reconciliation bill that would strip Planned\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "In November, the U.S. Senate will take up the House reconciliation bill that would strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding while it i...", "title": "Will Planned Parenthood Videos Have a Permanent Impact?", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/will-planned-parenthood-videos-have-a-permanent-impact/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/PPAbortionAmnaDermish.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/will-planned-parenthood-videos-have-a-permanent-impact/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/PPAbortionAmnaDermish.jpg", "description": "In November, the U.S. Senate will take up the House reconciliation bill that would strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding while it i...", "card": "summary", "title": "Will Planned Parenthood Videos Have a Permanent Impact?"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, abortion, brian fraga, center for medical progress, planned parenthood defunding, planned parentood, u.s.congress, undercover videos", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "article_summary": "They believe that the issue of defunding Planned Parenthood, which receives $528 million in government money, is not going away anytime soon.\nThat\u2019s not very pro-life.\u201dSaid Day, \u201cIf you bring up a clean Planned Parenthood defunding bill, then you could get somewhere.\n\u201cWe always hope that we can get a straight up-and-down vote on defunding Planned Parenthood by itself.\nPro-life Democrats, a small minority in their party, disagree with the Republicans\u2019 insistence on linking the repeal of Obamacare with defunding Planned Parenthood.\nThe investigations were prompted by a series of undercover videos that allege Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue for profit, which is illegal."}
