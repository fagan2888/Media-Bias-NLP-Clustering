Those crazy teabaggers actually want to live their own lives in accordance with the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. They think a bunch of old dead white guys actually knew anything about the world we live in today.\n\nWhat a bunch of loons. Everybody knows that today, fundamental human nature is completely different than it was back then. After all, now we have iPhones. Duh!\n\nSo naturally, Obama for America (the fine folks who run Obama\u2019s official Twitter account) are striking back in the very best way:\n\nYou know you want to display this free sticker everywhere: http://t.co/P3jiADJHDx pic.twitter.com/XcR8HAysgV \u2014 OFA TruthTeam (@OFATruthTeam) March 21, 2014\n\nLOL!\n\nThe bumper sticker is free in the same sense Obamacare itself is free: You might not be paying for it, but somebody is. Whether they like it or not. As long as it\u2019s not you, what do you care?\n\nOnce again, the President of the United States speaks power to truth. If you oppose his attempts to control every aspect of your life, including your very body itself, he\u2019ll only redouble his rhetorical efforts to sell you something you don\u2019t want and can\u2019t afford. And he\u2019ll mock you for daring to dissent.\n\nWhat are you going to do about it? Vote this November? Nice try, wingnut. Just give up, or your moral, ethical, and intellectual betters will mock you with another bumper sticker. Another Twitter hashtag. Another TV ad.\n\nNothing you do matters.\n\nRight?\n\n(Hat tip: Twitchy)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jim Treacher", "description": "In case you don't know American history and/or how it's currently repeating itself, this is the Gadsden flag: It was designed in 1775 by an American", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "In case you don't know American history and/or how it's currently repeating itself, this is the Gadsden flag:        It was designed in 1775 by an American general named Christopher Gadsden, and in th", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s latest sales pitch: mocking the Gadsden flag", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/24/obamacares-latest-sales-pitch-mocking-the-gadsden-flag/", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamacreeps-e1395681757657.png", "height": 198}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In case you don't know American history and/or how it's currently repeating itself, this is the Gadsden flag:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was designed in 1775 by an...", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s latest sales pitch: mocking the Gadsden flag Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/24/obamacares-latest-sales-pitch-mocking-the-gadsden-flag/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamacreeps-e1395681757657.png"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-24 13:30:59", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare's latest sales pitch: mocking the Gadsden flag", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "treacher,jim-treacher", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "treacher", "sailthru.description": "In case you don't know American history and/or how it's currently repeating itself, this is the Gadsden flag:        It was designed in 1775 by an American general named Christopher Gadsden, and in th", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamacreeps-e1395681757657.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4d1\"", "article_summary": "Now we have King Barry, and many of his opponents have given him the same warning by displaying the Gadsden flag.\n4136383In case you don\u2019t know American history and/or how it\u2019s currently repeating itself, this is the Gadsden flag:It was designed in 1775 by an American general named Christopher Gadsden, and in the context of the American Revolution, its meaning is self-evident.\nThe bumper sticker is free in the same sense Obamacare itself is free: You might not be paying for it, but somebody is.\nThose crazy teabaggers actually want to live their own lives in accordance with the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.\nThey think a bunch of old dead white guys actually knew anything about the world we live in today."}
