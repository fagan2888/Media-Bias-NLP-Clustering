Well, sort of that is, and the legalization doesn\u2019t apply to everyday citizens. However, sexual relationships between a consenting politician and lobbyist are now officially A-Okay, reports The Daily Beast. Don\u2019t look so surprised \u2014 the rules have never applied to the political elite.\n\nIf this rule sounds unethical to you, you\u2019d be wrong. In fact, North Carolina\u2019s own Ethics Commission is the body that gave its collective thumbs up to lobbyist/politician fornication. In December, the state\u2019s lobbying compliance director formally asked the commission \u2014 hypothetically, supposedly \u2014 whether such relationships were permitted by state ethical standards. Now, two months later, the group decided that these sexual relationships are on the up-and-up, leading some to wonder whether the Ethics Commission had been \u201clobbied\u201d in the interim.\n\nThe relationship between lobbyists and elected officials has always been both complicated and troubling. Private interest groups pay lobbyists to convince politicians to draft and approve legislation in their favor. While politicians are purported to represent their constituents, their pro-big business biases suggest that lobbyists have the real power.\n\nIn North Carolina, politicians and staffers must disclose all gifts from lobbyists that cost over $10. However, politicians have no obligation to acknowledge having sex with lobbyists since sex is free. \u201cConsensual sexual relationships do not have monetary value and therefore are not reportable as gifts or \u2018reportable expenditures made for lobbying\u2019 for purposes of the lobbying law\u2019s expenditure reporting provisions,\u201d wrote the North Carolina Ethics Commission.\n\nThe Ethics Commission may insist that its decision is different from prostitution, yet by allowing corporations to hire people who can sway politicians with sexual acts, it\u2019s certainly opening the door to that sort of behavior. It would certainly be easier for industries to conceal their influence by enticing government officials with off-the-books sex than having to disclose \u201cmoneyed\u201d presents instead.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time something of the sort happened in North Carolina anyway. The question to the Ethics Committee may have officially been posed as a \u201chypothetical,\u201d but there are multiple publicized examples of sexual affairs between politicians and lobbyists in the state. Just three years ago, two staffers for politician Thom Tillis resigned after getting caught in a sex scandal with lobbyists. For the record, U.S. Senator Tillis says he would continue to forbid these types of relationships for his staffers regardless of whether it is technically illegal.\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad, average American citizens. We may not hear much about these newly condoned, backdoor sexcapades, but when lobbyists can legally sleep with a congressman while simultaneously trying to convince him to lower corporate tax rates, you better believe that all of America is getting screwed in the processed.\n\nPhoto Credit: Giovanni Dall'Orto", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina has deemed it \"ethical\" for lobbyists to have sex with the politicians they're hired to sway.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3133/3132206.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "politics,politicians,lobbyists,lobbying,corruption,money,bribes,north carolina,ethics,sex,affairs", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "However, politicians have no obligation to acknowledge having sex with lobbyists since sex is free.\nIn North Carolina, politicians and staffers must disclose all gifts from lobbyists that cost over $10.\nHowever, sexual relationships between a consenting politician and lobbyist are now officially A-Okay, reports The Daily Beast.\nIn fact, North Carolina\u2019s own Ethics Commission is the body that gave its collective thumbs up to lobbyist/politician fornication.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time something of the sort happened in North Carolina anyway."}
