That is no accommodation. The government has many other ways to make sure women may access these drugs, but it has chosen the unjust, unlawful, and unnecessary path of forcing people of faith to participate in acts that violate their deepest convictions. There is an easy solution: The government can offer these services to women who want them without forcing Christian schools, nuns, and priests to abandon their belief that life is sacred. We will confer with our clients to determine a response to the Supreme Court\u2019s request.\u201d\n\nThe nuns, whose order is 175 years old, serve the elderly poor through their worldwide retirement centers. The Obama administration is forcing them to subscribe to the abortion mandate, even though it previously has exempted major corporations such as Exxon, Pepsi and Chevron.\n\nThe Little Sisters already have argued publicly that the solution isn\u2019t complicated.\n\n\u201cThere is a simple solution that addresses the Little Sisters\u2019 moral concern and the government\u2019s stated goal: offer these services as an add-on through ACA\u2019s healthcare exchange like dental insurance and other add-ons. That is what the exchanges were created to do, and this would provide access to all women in America (i.e., those in religious plans and secular ones HHS has already exempted). This is a much better solution than continuing to try to force only religious groups with an objection to these services to offer them,\u201d they explain on a website dedicated to their defense.\n\nRienzi said at the time of the oral arguments that the government can use procedures \u201cas easy to use as shopping on Amazon or Kayak,\u201d to deliver abortion drugs if it chooses.\n\nThe sisters are the lead plaintiffs in a Supreme Court case that incorporated several related cases challenging Obamacare\u2019s abortion-pill mandate.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the court appeared headed for a 4-4 tie, a scenario on which WND reported earlier.\n\nThe arguments consolidated cases from the Third, Fifth, 10th, and D.C. circuits, and if the vote ends up 4-4, due to the absence of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the lower-court rulings, most of which favored the administration, will stand. In case of a tie, three of the decisions would favor the government, and the fourth would not, leaving a conflict among the circuits.\n\nFrom the past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is available some critically important advice, \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nNBC noted the White House has exempted churches but has refused to exempt other nonprofit groups like the nuns.\n\nA recent filing by the nuns charged the White House believes it can make anyone, including churches, pay for abortion.\n\nRegarding the exemption for churches, the brief explained: \u201cThe government insists that it does so as a matter of administrative grace and \u2018special solicitude\u2019 for churches, and that nothing in RFRA requires the exemption. Thus, in the government\u2019s view, it could eliminate the exemption for churches tomorrow. That is astonishing enough, but it fails to grapple with the reality that by granting the exemption the government has already conceded that it does not have a compelling interest in demanding compliance from religious employers who are more likely to hire people who share their religious objections.\n\n\u201cBut the government has no more compelling interest in demanding compliance from petitioners, who share the same statutory entitlement to hire people who share their own faith as the exempted employers,\u201d the brief said. \u201cNor can the government escape the reality that the mandate\u2019s secular exemptions and the government\u2019s own concessions regarding them doom its least-restrictive means defense. The government claims that asking whatever subset of petitioners\u2019 employees who actually want contraceptive coverage to obtain it through an exchange would \u2018inflict tangible injury\u2019 that cannot be tolerated. But the government itself champions the exchanges not a dozen pages earlier in its brief as one of several acceptable paths through which the tens of millions of employees whose employers are already exempt can obtain contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\nAt issue is whether the Obama White House can demand the nuns pay for abortions even though the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act appears to forbid it.\n\nPlaintiffs lawyers argued the need for the demand on the nuns is not compelling \u2013 a requirement of the RFRA for the government to impose a rights violations \u2013 because about one-third of the country already is exempted.\n\nSolicitor General Donald Verrelli argued on behalf of Obamacare that the nuns want to stop the government from providing the abortion pills, but the nuns said nothing\u2019s further from the truth: They just cannot, because of their faith, be involved, and that includes the government\u2019s solution of signing over authority to do it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand why the government is doing this when there is an easy solution that doesn\u2019t involve us \u2013 it can provide these services on the exchanges,\u201d said Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, mother provincial for the Little Sisters of the Poor, in a statement made outside the court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also hard to understand why the government is doing this when one-third of all Americans aren\u2019t even covered by this mandate, and \u2026 yet the government threatens us with fines of $70 million per year if we don\u2019t comply. \u2026 All we ask, is that we can continue to do this work.\u201d\n\nA decision is expected in June.\n\nOther cases to be affected by the decision include Christian Brothers Services, Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust, Houston Baptist and East Texas Baptist Universities, Reaching Souls International, Truett-McConnell College, GuideStone Financial Services of the Southern Baptist Convention, Geneva College, Southern Nazarene University, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington and the Most Reverend David A. Zubik.\n\nA friend-of-the-court brief from the Thomas More Law Center said if the appeal is lost, the government \u201cbecomes the head of every religious denomination in the country by its assumed authority to determine what is in fact a sin.\u201d\n\nFrom the past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is available some critically important advice, \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday took the unusual step of asking both sides of a case in which it already has heard oral arguments to provide additional information \u2013 specifically regarding how the government can \u201cavoid forcing religious women to provide services against their faith.\u201d \u201cThis is an excellent development,\u201d said Mark Rienzi of [\u2026]", "title": "Supremes give Little Sisters another chance to blast abortion mandate", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2016/03/supreme-court-lets-talk-about-abortion-mandate/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2012/09/us_supreme_court_596x283.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Little Sisters already have argued publicly that the solution isn\u2019t complicated.\nThe sisters are the lead plaintiffs in a Supreme Court case that incorporated several related cases challenging Obamacare\u2019s abortion-pill mandate.\nThey are to \u201cdiscuss alternative ways to avoid forcing religious women to provide services against their faith.\u201dLawyers with the Alliance Defending Freedom also have been involved in the case.\n\u201cClearly the Supreme Court understood the Sisters\u2019 concern that the government\u2019s current scheme forces them to violate their religion,\u201d he continued.\nA recent filing by the nuns charged the White House believes it can make anyone, including churches, pay for abortion."}
