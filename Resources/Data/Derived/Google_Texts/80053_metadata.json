They include facilities in Whittier, El Monte, Alhambra, Lakewood and Glendora.\n\nIn fact, she said, the preparation has already improved service to patients.\n\n\u201cWe have reduced patient wait time to about 15 minutes from about an hour or more,\u201d Vazquez said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, local call centers have had people seeking information about ACA, she said.\n\nServing 145,000 patients annually, Vazquez said, Planned Parenthood provides life-saving cancer screening, breast exams, STD treatments and family planning.\n\n\u201cRoughly 98 percent of patients are seeking preventative treatment,\u201d she added.\n\nHealth center staffs have undergone training to help explain ACA to patients.\n\nAnd while no additional staff have been hired, each of their workers have reconfigured their work flow to accommodate an increase in patient population,\u201d Vazquez added.\n\nFor Dr. A. Shawn Adhami, who has clinics in Montebello and El Monte, Obamacare has meant hiring more staff, including clerical, physician assistants and nurses.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is no way to accurately tell how many new patients our offices will add, we are projecting an increase from 10 to 15 percent,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently the Montebello office, 1000 W. Whittier Blvd., sees 30 to 40 patients daily, and the El Monte office, 3030 Tyler Ave., sees about 40 to 55 patients daily.\n\nThe Montebello clinic, Vistasol Medical Group\u2019s patients range from low-income to city officials, attorneys and fellow physicians.\n\nUnlike a lot of his colleagues, Adhami, who is chief of staff at Monterey Park Hospital, welcomes the implementation of Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect plan, he acknowledged, \u201cbut overall, I\u2019m happy about it because millions of people will be receiving basic healthcare and preventative medicine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state-based Health Insurance Marketplace will provide millions, many who currently have no healthcare insurance, with affordable coverage choices.\n\nIn the past few years, Medicare and Medi-Cal recipients have had to choose a provider.\n\n\u201cOverall, it will reduce payments per patient to doctors,\u201d said Dr. Adhami. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a revenue-generator.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have anticipated change,\u201d said PIH Health Spokeswoman Monique Rodriguez. \u201cWe are expecting to see an increase in Medi-Cal patients to our hospital.\u201d\n\nRegarding preventative services, she added, PIH Health\u2019s physician group has the capacity to care for any influx of patients.\n\n\u201cThe community can rest assured knowing that (we are) committed to their well-being, and will continue to provide the high-quality care (they) have come to expect from us and deserve,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nIn the past few years, the federal government has spent $11 billion to fund thousands of capital expansion projects across the nation. Of that, $200 million has come to California. The funding has allowed 45 new federally qualified health centers to open in California, said Carmela Castellano-Garcia, president and chief executive officer for the California Primary Care Association. The association represents 900 not-for-profit community clinics and health centers statewide.\n\nEven small clinics in California will play a big role in the success or failure of the Affordable Care Act nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe believe community clinics and health centers will be play seminal role in the success of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect community health centers to be one stop shop for both enrollment and health care services under health care reform.\u201d\n\nOf the nearly 5.3 million patients who visited health centers in California last year, about 43 percent are uninsured, state officials have said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, 51 community clinics serve more than 1 million patients each year, the majority of whom are currently uninsured,state officials have said.\n\nThe challenge of enrolling patients has been the vast amount of information and ongoing changes that have come with meeting the guidelines of ACA.\n\nThe federal health law requires most Americans to have health insurance starting January 2014, and many residents will qualify for free or subsidized coverage based on their income.\n\nThose who qualify or those who want to change health plans can go to CoveredCA.com or call 888-975-1142 and compare plans under tiered policies that include Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum \u2014 each providing different levels of out-of-pocket costs, based on income.\n\nStaff Writer Susan Abram contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some area medical clinics say they have taken steps to ensure they will be able to care for current patients, as well as an anticipated slew of new ones, as the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, is implemented in the new year.Sign", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Whittier area medical providers ready for Obamacare", "og": {"url": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/government-and-politics/20130921/affordable-care-act-whittier-area-medical-providers-ready-for-obamacare", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LE/20130921/NEWS/130929911/AR/0/AR-130929911.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Whittier area medical providers ready for Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"domain": "whittierdailynews.com", "description": "Some area medical clinics say they have taken steps to ensure they will be able to care for current patients, as well as an anticipated slew of new ones, as the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, is implemented in the new year.Sign", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Whittier area medical providers ready for Obamacare", "url": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/government-and-politics/20130921/affordable-care-act-whittier-area-medical-providers-ready-for-obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LE/20130921/NEWS/130929911/AR/0/AR-130929911.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@WhittierNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563971431", "iphone": "id503668140", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.whittierdailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd871c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe believe community clinics and health centers will be play seminal role in the success of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said.\nThe association represents 900 not-for-profit community clinics and health centers statewide.\nEven small clinics in California will play a big role in the success or failure of the Affordable Care Act nationwide.\nIn Los Angeles, 51 community clinics serve more than 1 million patients each year, the majority of whom are currently uninsured,state officials have said.\nServing 145,000 patients annually, Vazquez said, Planned Parenthood provides life-saving cancer screening, breast exams, STD treatments and family planning."}
