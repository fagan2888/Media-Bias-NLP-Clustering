(CBS11) – Donald Trump has released a seven-point plan to reform the U.S. Healthcare System.

Trump lays it all out on his website.

The plan repeals Obamacare, modifies existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines, allows individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns and allow individuals to use Health Savings Accounts with tax-free contributions.

His plan also would require price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and hospitals.

It also includes block-grant Medicaid to states giving states “incentives to seek out and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse.”

Finally, Trump says his plan removes barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers “that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products.”
