The Bryan Smith for Congress campaign today released its first radio ad of the primary election. The 60-second spot, entitled "Odd Man Out," highlights Smith's call for Congressman Mike Simpson to join the Idaho congressional delegation in voting to defund Obamacare. The ad is being played across Idaho in Boise, Twin Falls, and Idaho Falls.



Over the past few weeks, conservative Republican candidate Bryan Smith has repeatedly joined Senators Jim Risch and Mike Crapo and Congressman Raul Labrador of the Idaho congressional delegation in their efforts to defund Obamacare. Simpson has repeatedly come out saying that he will not support these efforts and will be voting "no" on the upcoming spending bill to defund Obamacare.



Bryan Smith is a conservative Republican running for Idaho's second congressional district. He is running against 16-year incumbent and big spending, career politician Mike Simpson. Bryan and his wife live in Idaho Falls.
