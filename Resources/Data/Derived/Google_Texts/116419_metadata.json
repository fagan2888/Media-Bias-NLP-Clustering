Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., today filed a motion to remove Boehner as speaker.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be silent any longer,\u201d says @RepMarkMeadows\n\nMeadows\u2019 \u201cmotion to vacate the chair\u201d accuses Boehner of trying to \u201cconsolidate power and centralize decision-making, bypassing the majority of the 435 members of Congress and the people they represent.\u201d Meadows would need a majority of the House to strip Boehner of the speakership.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of Americans who know there is something drastically wrong with the way things happen in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Meadows told talk radio host Mark Levin. \u201cHopefully, my colleagues will see that there\u2019s something inherently wrong with the leadership that we have and it\u2019s time for a change.\u201d\n\nLast month, Meadows was temporarily removed from his subcommittee chairmanship by a Boehner ally, Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. Chaffetz punished Meadows for voting against a procedural motion to advance President Obama\u2019s trade bill. Days later, Chaffetz was forced to reverse his decision when a majority of Republicans on the committee voiced their support for Meadows to retain the subcommittee role.\n\nMeadows cites Boehner\u2019s recent actions in the resolution. \u201c[T]he Speaker uses the power of the office to punish Members who vote according to their conscience instead of the will of the Speaker.\u201d (Read the full resolution at the end of this story.)\n\nAfter filing the resolution Tuesday, Meadows spoke to reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s really more about trying to have a conversation on making this place work, where everybody\u2019s voice matters, where there\u2019s not a punitive culture,\u201d he said.\n\nLater in the evening, he spoke to Levin, who enthusiastically embraced the idea and urged conservatives to support it.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be silent any longer,\u201d Meadows told Levin. \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s something that had to be done\u2014regardless of the consequences. And there will be consequences to pay. This particular decision may send me home. It may make sure that I don\u2019t get reelected, but it\u2019s one that had to be made.\u201d\n\nSupport and Opposition\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many conservatives will back Meadows. Several lawmakers contacted by The Daily Signal declined to comment or did not respond to questions. One of the few who did speak to the press Tuesday was Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., who told The Washington Post he supports the effort.\n\n\u201cThe people in my district are incensed,\u201d Jones told the Post. \u201cThe leadership\u2019s not listening to the American people. \u2026 The frustration is a lot deeper than the leadership knows because they\u2019re not in touch with the average citizen, the average Republican.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers publicly denounced the effort.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, said he doubts that Meadows\u2019 effort will succeed.\n\n\u201cThis is not a serious effort,\u201d Dent said. \u201cIt was not well thought out. It\u2019s half-baked at best. We ought to bring the resolution up and vote it down\u2014like, immediately.\u201d\n\nDent suggested that leadership should put the motion up for a vote before the House adjourns for recess later this week.\n\n\u201cI would pick it up tonight if I could,\u201d Dent said. \u201cThis is a total distraction. I don\u2019t want to spend all of August talking about this instead of more important issues like the Iran deal. We ought to nip it in the bud now and get on message.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with Levin, Meadows said the measure could get a vote as early as Wednesday if Republican leaders think they can defeat it. He warned that wouldn\u2019t dissuade him from pressing his case as long as he represents North Carolina\u2019s 11th District.\n\n\u201cThat really doesn\u2019t stop the effort,\u201d he told Levin. \u201cIt really needs to be the people\u2019s decision, not just a few in and around the Beltway in Washington.\u201d\n\nHow It Happened\n\nMeadows\u2019 decision to file the resolution Tuesday apparently caught members of Congress by surprise. Yet it\u2019s only the latest episode in a clash between the GOP\u2019s conservative members and leadership.\n\nThe most recent dustup took place after a June 11 vote to bring Obama\u2019s trade bill to the floor for a vote. Meadows joined 33 other Republicans in opposition to the rule, angering Boehner and the GOP leadership team, which expects party unity on rule votes. (The measure narrowly passed, 217-212, after several Democrats voted in favor of it.)\n\nIn the days that followed, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., removed three of those Republicans from his whip team: Reps. Trent Franks, R-Ariz.; Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.; and Steve Pearce, R-N.M.\n\nChaffetz, meanwhile, gave Meadows the option to resign or be demoted as chairman of the Government Operations subcommittee. Meadows refused to resign, prompting Chaffetz to \u201cmake a change on the field.\u201d Meadows maintained he did nothing wrong by voting his conscience on the trade bill.\n\nSince 2013, Republican leaders have punished at least a dozen members.\n\nThose who haven\u2019t lost their spot on the whip team or fundraising opportunities with the National Republican Congressional Committee have been denied travel opportunities as part of congressional delegations overseas.\n\nMeadows told Levin he expected to face retribution as a result of his recent actions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t relish being punished, but the punishment is surely going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing compared the sacrifices our Founding Fathers had to make.\u201d\n\nRepublican Infighting\n\nNews of Meadows\u2019 resolution comes just days before the 435 members of the U.S. House plan to depart for their August recess. Some of Meadows\u2019 critics said the anti-Boehner resolution would distract from their efforts to build opposition to Obama\u2019s Iran deal during the break.\n\nDemocrats appeared to embrace Meadows\u2019 move. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a former House speaker who has maintained her leadership role despite Democrat electoral losses, attacked the GOP-led Congress in statement Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAs the American people look to Congress for solutions to the challenges they face, they increasingly see a Republican Congress dominated by obstruction, distraction and dysfunction,\u201d Pelois said. \u201cFor more than 200 days, this Republican Congress has failed to advance any measure to create jobs and growth in our country, and leaves for August early with the prospect of only more shutdowns and manufactured crises in store this fall. The American people deserve better.\u201d\n\nIt comes just a day after Senate Republicans appeared to resolve some of their differences over a highway bill and a vote to revive the Export-Import Bank, which expired on June 30. Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, voiced strong opposition to the Ex-Im vote, with Cruz accusing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., of lying to his fellow Republicans.\n\nCruz\u2019s fiery speech Friday angered Senate Republicans like Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Orrin Hatch of Utah. They delivered floor speeches Sunday critical of Cruz\u2019s blunt language about McConnell. Cruz, however, refused to back down\u2014even after McConnell summoned all Republicans for a meeting Monday.\n\nNow, with a summer recess only days away, both McConnell and Boehner face the challenge of a fractured party with competing priorities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Days before the U.S. House is planning to adjourn for its month-long recess, Speaker John Boehner is facing yet another challenge from conservatives.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Days before the U.S. House is planning to adjourn for its month-long recess, Speaker John Boehner is facing yet another challenge from conservatives.", "title": "Congressman Seeks to Oust John Boehner as House Speaker", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix085975.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-25T12:07:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IqOTr5"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Days before the U.S. House is planning to adjourn for its month-long recess, Speaker John Boehner is facing yet another challenge from conservatives.", "title": "Congressman Seeks to Oust John Boehner as House Speaker", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rollcallpix085975.jpg"}, "creator": "@RobertBluey", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-07-28T18:51:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-25T12:07:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "john boehner, mark meadows, house of representatives,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d10\"", "article_summary": "Meadows told Levin he expected to face retribution as a result of his recent actions.\nDays before the U.S. House is planning to adjourn for its month-long recess, Speaker John Boehner is facing yet another challenge from the right.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be silent any longer,\u201d Meadows told Levin.\n\u201cThat really doesn\u2019t stop the effort,\u201d he told Levin.\n\u201cThere are millions of Americans who know there is something drastically wrong with the way things happen in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Meadows told talk radio host Mark Levin."}
