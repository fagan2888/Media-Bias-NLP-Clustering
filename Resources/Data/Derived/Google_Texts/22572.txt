REPORTER: What happened in Virginia the other day – does that concern you for your chances here in this runoff?

COCHRAN: I don’t know what you’re talking about. What happened in Virginia?

REPORTER: … with Eric Cantor losing his seat

COCHRAN: I haven’t really followed that campaign very closely at all.

REPORTER: Really?

COCHRAN: Really.

REPORTER: So you have no comment you want to make?

COCHRAN: I can make a comment. You asked me what happened. I haven’t followed that campaign very closely.

REPORTER: Well, Eric Cantor lost his seat as majority leader

COCHRAN: Well, it happens. You know, members of Congress – some win, some lose. It’s not an automatic proposition that you get reelected just because you’ve done a good job. Voters make their own decisions and I respect their judgment.
