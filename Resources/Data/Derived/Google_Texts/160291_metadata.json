During a 2010 summit about the Affordable Care Act, 2008 GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) laid out several objections to provisions of the law, before Obama couldn\u2019t help himself.\n\n\u201cLet me just make this point, John, because we\u2019re not campaigning anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe election\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nMcCain chuckled at the rude remark, saying, \u201cI\u2019m reminded of that every day.\u201d\n\nThen, at his 2015 State of the Union, congressional Republicans lightly cheered when Obama announced yet again that he would never run another campaign.\n\n\u201cI know, because I won both of them,\u201d he said, drawing howls of approval from Democrats in the chamber. The media, not surprisingly, loved it, despite Obama\u2019s party having just taken a brutal drubbing in the midterms two months earlier.\n\nIn addition, Obama\u2019s referred to \u201cbitter\u201d people in the heartland who \u201ccling\u201d to guns and religion, compared GOP opponents of his unpopular nuclear deal to hardliners in Iran and suggested the GOP House of Representatives had a \u201cgun held to the head of the American people.\u201d\n\nAnd who could forget his 2008 dismissal of then-rival Hillary Clinton as \u201clikable enough\u201d during a Democratic debate? The quip did not endear him to voters, who dealt Clinton a victory in the New Hampshire primary that revived her campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A history of petty attacks by Barack Obama belie Michelle Obama's claim that her husband takes the high road in politics.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "First\u00a0lady Michelle Obama praised her husband Barack on Saturday as the kind of person who always maintains the high ground in the dirty world of politics.    \u201cDo what Barack Obama has always done,", "title": "Obama Goes Low", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/obama-goes-low/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First\u00a0lady Michelle Obama praised her husband Barack on Saturday as the kind of person who always m", "creator": "@DavidRutz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "Obama Goes Low", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDo what Barack Obama has always done,\u201d she said at a commencement address for Jackson State University.\nBY: Follow @DavidRutzFirst lady Michelle Obama praised her husband Barack on Saturday as the kind of person who always maintains the high ground in the dirty world of politics.\nObama has been unable to resist spiking the football about his two elections to the presidency, for instance.\nDuring a 2010 summit about the Affordable Care Act, 2008 GOP presidential candidate Sen.
