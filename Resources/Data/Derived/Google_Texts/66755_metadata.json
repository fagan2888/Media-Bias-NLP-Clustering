That is the sobering news from a new survey of wait times conducted by Merritt Hawkins, a physician staffing firm, which polled some 1,400 medical offices in 15 large metropolitan areas across the country.\n\nThe survey, conducted over a five-month period last year, assessed how long it would take a new patient to get an appointment for nonemergency care in five different medical specialties: cardiology, dermatology, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedic surgery and family practice. Boston had the longest average wait times \u2014 45 days across all specialties, well above the national average of 19 days. The findings in this survey showed little change across all specialties from two previous surveys in 2009 and 2004. Long waits have apparently become the norm in many metropolitan areas.\n\nThe findings are consistent with an international survey of 11 industrialized countries last year by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that analyzes health care issues. The findings punctured the illusion that our high-priced health care system, relying on private doctors, provides faster service than the national health systems in other advanced countries. When Americans got sick, 26 percent had to wait six days or longer for an appointment, better only than Canada and Norway but much worse than other countries with national health systems like Britain and the Netherlands. Patients in Britain and Switzerland also reported shorter waits to see a specialist than patients in the United States.\n\nExperts suggest several ways to reduce wait times, like increasing primary care doctors, allowing nurses and physicians\u2019 assistants to provide more care and opening more primary care clinics. The critical ingredient is to make reduction of wait times a political issue, as happened in Britain and is now happening in American veterans\u2019 hospitals in the wake of a scandal involving falsified records to hide long wait times.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140707211021, "twitter": {"description": "A survey punctured the illusion that our high-priced health care system provides faster service than the national systems in other advanced countries.", "title": "The Long Wait to See a Doctor", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/opinion/the-long-wait-to-see-a-doctor.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002986711"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/opinion/the-long-wait-to-see-a-doctor.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002986711", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/opinion/the-long-wait-to-see-a-doctor.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "The Long Wait to See a Doctor", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 7, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Doctors,Health Insurance and Managed Care,United States,Editorials", "news_keywords": "Doctor,Editorial", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A survey punctured the illusion that our high-priced health care system provides faster service than the national systems in other advanced countries.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A survey punctured the illusion that our high-priced health care system provides faster service than the national systems in other advanced countries.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 7, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-07-08", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Editorials", "published": "2014-07-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "United States", "slug": "08tue3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140708143727, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/opinion/the-long-wait-to-see-a-doctor.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A survey punctured the illusion that our high-priced health care system provides faster service than the national systems in other advanced countries.", "title": "The Long Wait to See a Doctor"}, "pdate": 20140707, "des": "Editorials", "articleid": 100000002986711, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Long Wait to See a Doctor", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "The critical ingredient is to make reduction of wait times a political issue, as happened in Britain and is now happening in American veterans\u2019 hospitals in the wake of a scandal involving falsified records to hide long wait times.\nBoston had the longest average wait times \u2014 45 days across all specialties, well above the national average of 19 days.\nLong waits have apparently become the norm in many metropolitan areas.\nExperts suggest several ways to reduce wait times, like increasing primary care doctors, allowing nurses and physicians\u2019 assistants to provide more care and opening more primary care clinics.\nThat is the sobering news from a new survey of wait times conducted by Merritt Hawkins, a physician staffing firm, which polled some 1,400 medical offices in 15 large metropolitan areas across the country."}
