She said she was told by state health care officials this week that she no longer qualified for subsidies promised under the federal law. Without them, she does not know if she will be able to afford insurance after her Health Republic policy ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an advocate for the health care law,\u201d said Ms. Jackson, who lives in Harlem. \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t navigate this, who can?\u201d\n\nHealth Republic and the 11 other co-ops set to close this year make up more than half of the total plans established under the Affordable Care Act. The 23 organizations \u2014 nonprofit start-ups with consumer-led boards \u2014 were set up as alternatives to government-run plans and were intended to create competition with companies like Aetna and Anthem.\n\nThe plans took off but soon encountered financial and political difficulties.\n\nHealth care has long been considered one of the most challenging markets for new players, dogged by rising treatment costs and dominated by a few big companies. The cooperatives faced pressure to keep premiums low. Congress also made deep cuts to the funds meant to boost struggling co-ops, reducing that budget by 60 percent.\n\nHealth Republic has now become a cautionary tale and a warning to other struggling insurers. The company has also become a source of anxiety, from Albany to Long Island, as some New Yorkers try to determine what insurance plan to sign up for next.\n\nProblems arose in September when state regulators said they were closing the co-op and instructed policy holders to seek new insurance plans on the federal exchange. Initially, Health Republic plans were to stay in effect until the end of the year. But last week, the State Department of Financial Services said it had moved the date to Nov. 30.\n\nThe state said in a statement last week that a \u201creview of Health Republic\u2019s finances has found that the company\u2019s financial condition is substantially worse than the company previously reported in its filings.\u201d Consumers have until Nov. 15 to select a new plan under the federal health care law to avoid losing coverage in December.\n\nHealth Republic said it had operated transparently with regulators and had had an independent financial review in August. The company said in a statement last Wednesday that it was forced to shut down because it received less than 13 percent of the roughly $149 million that the federal government promised it under the health care law.\n\nSharon Schanzer, a self-employed graphic designer on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, said the experience with Health Republic had her feeling d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Schanzer said she enrolled after having a similar policy with the Freelancers Union, a group that had been offering low-cost plans to independent workers. But in 2014, the Freelancers Union said it would cancel its plans for roughly 25,000 members, because the federal health care law had made it impossible to continue.\n\nMs. Schanzer said she opted for a $680-per-month plan from Health Republic. She found the plan affordable with her income, but it was more restrictive than the plan with Freelancers Union, which allowed her to see doctors outside the plan\u2019s network. However, she said her opinion of Health Republic changed when she received a letter from the insurer saying it was seeking approval to raise her premium to about $850 per month.\n\nThe rate increase never came. Not long later, she received a notice that the company would shut down entirely.\n\n\u201cI had no idea it was a speculative thing at the time,\u201d Ms. Schanzer said, \u201cthat this was a chance I was taking and it wasn\u2019t going to last.\u201d\n\nSome officials in the health care industry said that there were early signs that Health Republic was not on good footing. Kathleen Shure, of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group, said she and others were surprised at Health Republic\u2019s low-cost plans because of what it had agreed to pay hospitals and doctors.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw their premiums announced, we all started scratching our heads,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had low premiums and a huge network. We thought it was marketing.\u201d\n\nMs. Shure said Health Republic had been known for being slow to make payments. Now that it will close, her organization is preparing hospitals for what could be an even longer collection process. On Monday, the group\u2019s president, Kenneth Raske, sent a letter to hospitals asking them to tally what Health Republic owes.\n\nMs. Shure added: \u201cWe know not everybody is going to be paid 100 percent, we just don\u2019t know how bad it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHealth Republic\u2019s collapse has left Bonnie Rothman Morris, who runs a public relations company in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., uncertain about how she will receive treatment for acoustic neuroma, a benign tumor that causes hearing loss, and unsteadiness when she moves.\n\nEvery year, she goes for an expensive daylong procedure that involves an M.R.I. and visits to two specialists to review the tumor. This year, she said, when she made her appointment, the doctor\u2019s assistant told her there was a chance she would have to pay the bills herself if Health Republic failed to pay.\n\nMs. Morris canceled her visit, which was scheduled for Monday.\n\n\u201cI am going to wait until I have health insurance that I can trust will pay the bills,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"tone":
