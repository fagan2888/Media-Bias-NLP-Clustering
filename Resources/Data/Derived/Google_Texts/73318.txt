The rate of people lacking health insurance in Fairfield County dropped to 10.5 percent in 2014, according to new data from the U.S. Census Bureau, while a sizable drop from 13.2 percent the year before still the highest mark in southern New England.

Connecticut’s uninsured rate fell to 8 percent in 2014 from 10.9 percent the prior year.

The Fairfield County uninsured rate was 23.1 percent in 2014 for those making less than twice the income to qualify at the federal poverty level, or $23,800 for an individual or $48,600 for a family of four, down from 29.4 percent the previous year.

The Census Bureau calculated a 12 percent uninsured rate in Fairfield County in 2010 when the federal Affordable Care Act became law, with Connecticut’s rate at 10.4 percent that year. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled improper the Obama administration’s funneling of $175 billion in subsidies to insurance carriers under the law, ruling that the payments required Congressional authorization.
