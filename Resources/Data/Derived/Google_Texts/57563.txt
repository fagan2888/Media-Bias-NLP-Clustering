With rising health care costs, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and increasing concern about the effects of unnecessary medical care, there has been more interest in the role of physicians in stewardship of health care resources.

However, a major barrier to engaging physicians as stewards of resources is the lack of education and training that they receive on this topic. As a result, the ABIM Foundation and the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation recently partnered to address how to incorporate stewardship into medical education and training.

The ABIM Foundation is committed to advancing medical professionalism as defined in the Physician Charter, a document released in 2002 by our organization, the American College of Physicians Foundation, and the European Federation of Internal Medicine. The ABIM Foundation’s recent efforts, such as its Choosing Wisely® campaign, have focused on the physician’s responsibility for managing medical resources.

The Macy Foundation’s mission is to improve health by advancing the education and training of health professionals—specifically, by supporting interprofessional education and teamwork, new curriculum content, new educational models, education on how to care for the underserved, and career development for underrepresented minorities.

In November 2013, the two organizations convened medical educators, students, residents, and other stakeholders for a meeting on “Advancing the Competency of Stewarding Healthcare Resources in Medical Education and Training.”

Highlights of the convening included identification of five “critical paths” to making stewardship a bedrock required competency in medical education and training:

* Experiential learning and curricula to reinforce stewardship and address the “hidden curriculum”—meaning the “unwritten rules” in medical education and training that may undermine wise use of resources.

* Health care organizational supports for stewardship in patient care and clinical meetings;

* Clinical supports such as decision-support systems and price and cost information;

* Professional self-regulation that supports and includes stewardship in assessments of physicians and other accountability efforts; and

* Sustainability of stewardship efforts across the continuum of medical education, training, and practice.

Participants also discussed the need for a stewardship competency framework that would enable students and medical residents to:

* Know why to choose wisely by understanding the clinical harms that occur from overuse and the clinical case for stewarding resources;

* Know when to choose wisely by addressing the influence of organizational culture, the incentives for overuse in training and practice, and the needed metrics for systems accountability in delivering high-value care; and

* Know how to choose wisely by demonstrating clinical reasoning and the ability to (1) deal with uncertainty; (2) use evidence, information technology, and decision-support tools; and (3) communicate with patients regarding high-value care.

Although there is a need for greater support of stewardship in medical education and training, numerous promising practices already exist. Meeting attendees heard presentations by several winners of the Teaching Value and Choosing Wisely Competition, sponsored by the nonprofit organization Costs of Care and the ABIM Foundation, to identify and recognize champions of high-value care in medical education and training. The competition resulted in more than seventy entries, which were either already-implemented innovations or “bright ideas” for promoting stewardship in medical education and residency. Presenters were:

* Michelle Lin (NYU [New York University] Langone Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital)—She and her fellow resident Larissa Laskowski were emergency medicine residents at NYU when Hurricane Sandy shut down the Bellevue emergency department (ED). Bellevue reopened with a temporary, freestanding ED while the hospital underwent repairs, and Lin and Laskowski were inspired by the resource constraints in this care setting to develop a ten-week curriculum for evidence-based testing and guidelines for avoiding unnecessary care. The curriculum presented common tests administered to patients in an ED and low-, medium-, and high-probability outcomes of administering each test.

* Robert Fogerty (Yale University School of Medicine)—Fogerty, a Yale faculty member, designed and implemented “I-CARE” (Interactive Cost-Awareness Resident Exercise) to integrate cost awareness without disrupting clinical training for Yale’s internal medicine residency program. I-CARE exercises take place during morning rounds; during an exercise, a resident presents a case, and resident teams compete against intern teams to develop a high-value diagnosis plan. The attending physician then reveals the most high-value plan, and each team is given a “bill” based on the chargemaster (a hospital’s comprehensive list of prices for supplies and procedures) for how much they spent during the exercise.

* Amit Pahwa (Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center)—Pahwa was a “bright idea” winner for his proposal to create cost report cards for residents by using billing data that would make lab and imaging use for each trainee available for feedback and allow residents to compare themselves with their peers. Program directors could also use the report cards to assess residents’ performance on providing high-value care.

Attendees concluded the meeting by brainstorming about future shared efforts to advance stewardship of resources in medical education and training. For example, the ABIM Foundation is strongly considering establishing a stewardship learning network for medical students and residents, collaborating with leading medical education and training organizations on a stewardship faculty development effort, and partnering with other organizations to offer curriculum and technical support to accompany their stewardship efforts.

Participants left the meeting galvanized by the shared understanding of the paths for advancing stewardship in medical education and training, their collective desired future state, and the energy and creativity of young leaders in advancing the wise use of resources. While challenges remain, the ongoing commitments by the ABIM Foundation, the Macy Foundation, and other participants will assure the advancement of stewardship as a competency in medical education and training.
