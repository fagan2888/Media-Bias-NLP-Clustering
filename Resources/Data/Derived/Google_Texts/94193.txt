Cuomo reminds insurers to provide maternal screening and treatment Affordable Care Act requires companies to follow task force recommendations

Albany

The Cuomo administration is reaching out to health insurance carriers, reminding them that they are required to offer maternal and postpartum depression screening as well as treatment.

"Health insurers have an obligation to cover charges for essential preventative services,'' Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a prepared statement Monday. The statement outlined the "circular,'' similar to a regulatory notice, sent to health insurance firms.

The requirement was part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which calls for such screening and treatment as part of the preventive services that insurers provide without additional co-pays or deductibles.

Leslie Moran, spokeswoman for the state Health Plan Association, which represents health insurers, said it was unclear why the bulletin was issued Monday. There haven't been reports of problems or screening not being provided.

Ron Klug, spokesman for the state Department of Financial Services, which oversees insurance carriers, said the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to follow recommendations of the Preventive Services Task Force, a national volunteer group that offers advice on preventive measures in health.

The Task Force issued its recommendations on maternal and postpartum depression screening and treatment in January.
