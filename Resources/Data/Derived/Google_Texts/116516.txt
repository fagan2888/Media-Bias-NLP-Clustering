What is Obamacare?

We already know what politicians think it could be. Republicans believe the health law will soon bring about the apocalypse. Democrats, on the other hand, think the law will bring peace to the earth and begin a utopian state of peace and tranquility for all.

For right now, though, the law — represented by the online marketplaces set up by governments across the land — is pretty terrible. Well, at least that’s what a whole bunch of pundits and news outlets are saying.

Sure, the exchanges, powered by a central operated by the federal government, might make purchasing health insurance easier someday, but first they have to, you know, work. But they don’t. One buyer in Delaware, for example, tried purchasing coverage for 11 days straight before finally succeeding.

The project cost a mere $400 million, or just another drop in the bucket for the federal government.
