Vidant Medical Center President Brian Floyd was talking about the future of health care in our region at a luncheon held by the Greenville-Pitt County Chamber of Commerce Tuesday.

Floyd talked about the need for more health care providers to form affiliations and share costs in order to meet the bottom line in today's business environment.

He says primary care services are changing as well with many nurse practitioners offering services in places like pharmacies and retail stores.

Floyd says the biggest challenges for Vidant Medical Center are covering the gaps in payments created by uninsured patients, and keeping up with the changes required by both state policies and the Affordable Care Act.

Floyd says, "There are new regulations, new payment changes, new rules associated with the center for Medicaid services, and so our health system is in a continuous state of change, and responding to those changes."

Floyd says despite facing challenging times, the outlook for Vidant Medical Center is still very good.
