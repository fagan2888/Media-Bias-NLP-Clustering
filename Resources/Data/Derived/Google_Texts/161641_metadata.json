The latest outbreak follows the death of two patients, near-death of five, and exposure to 179 patients in a similar outbreak from October through early January at UCLA\u2019s Ronald Reagan Medical Center. In both occurrences the culprit seems to have been contaminated body scopes.\n\nThe term \u201csuperbug\u201d refers to bacteria that have mutated to become drug-resistant. Although the public is unaware of the growing risks from super-bugs, drug resistant staph infections already kill about 19,000 people per year in America, The CRE superbug is medically known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThere are two common links between the UCLA and Cedars-Sinai superbugs. The two world renowned hospitals are only 5.7 miles apart and they appear to have both transmitted superbug bacteria during a procedure known as ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). Both hospitals used EVIS EXERA II (TJF-Q180V) Duodenoscopes manufactured by Japanese electronic imaging giant Olympus Corporation of America and serviced by the same technical source.\n\nAbout a half a million Americans undergo ERCP each year, in which a fiber-optic scope is threaded down the person\u2019s throat to diagnose and therapeutically treat problems in the digestive tract such as pancreatitis, gallstones, cancers and blockages in the bile duct.\n\nOver the last seven months, CRE transmissions have been confirmed from patients from undergoing ERCP procedures using Olympus duodenoscopes at UCLA, Cedars-Sinai, and Seattle\u2019s Virginia Mason Medical Center.\n\nCedars-Sinai proactively launched an investigation regarding its own ERCP scopes and patient records after the media broke the superbug deaths at UCLA. Cedars-Sinai\u2019s infection-control experts used genetic and molecular analysis to identify the unique CRE \u201cfingerprint.\u201d\n\nCRE is an especially dangerous superbug, since it is so resistant to antibiotics; up to 50% of infected patients die.\n\nTo prevent further infections, Cedars-Sinai quarantined its tainted scope and adopted a protocol hospital-wide enhanced anti-bacteria safety monitoring for contamination. The hospital also offered patients possibly exposed to CRE a free home testing kit.\n\nConsumer advocate Lisa McGiffert, Director of the Safe Patient Project at Consumers Union, told the Los Angeles Times that the intense scrutiny comes too late for some patients: \u201cIt\u2019s really horrific to know so many people underwent these procedures when they could have known the danger beforehand,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went in trusting the system, and the system broke down.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the announcement by Cedars-Sinai follows the filling of a wrongful death lawsuit by the surviving family of 48-year-old Antonia Torres Cerda against Olympus as the maker of the CRE contaminated device. Although Cerda was treated in October, the suspected CRE contaminated duodenoscope appears to have reused on another 178 patients through January.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Superior Court complaint states that Ms. Cerda was exposed to CRE and as a result \u201csuffered significant injury and died.\u201d In addition to wrongful death, the family\u2019s complaint accuses the company of negligence and fraud in selling and promoting a \u201cdefective\u201d scope. The family\u2019s attorney said Ms. Cerda died Nov. 8.\n\nUCLA patient Aaron Young also sued Olympus last week for negligence in connection with his CRE infection from the same tainted scope. The 18-year-old high-school student has suffered enormous pain and is still hospitalized in quarantine at UCLA, according to attorney Pete Kaufman, who represents the Cerda and Young families.\n\nThe suit on behalf of Ms. Cerda lists her as having a spouse, four children in Kings County and a parent in Mexico. Kaufman said UCLA and University of California Regents may be added as defendants, if details of liability emerge.\n\nLawmakers, consumer advocates and patient families have criticized healthcare regulators regarding the ineffectiveness of anti-bacterial drugs to fight superbugs. But much of the problem has been that antibacterial drug resistance has become a growing problem from people over-using antibiotics. There has also been little incentive for the pharmaceutical companies to invest money knowing that superbugs tend to mutate to beat the new drug.\n\nStratfor says that because antibiotic-resistant staph infections and tuberculosis cases are becoming so numerous, \u201cour entire species could be at risk.\u201d That has incentivized researchers, governments and drug companies to launch crash programs to develop new compounds called \u201cteixobactins\u201d that target an entirely different part of bacteria cells than antibiotics. The new treatments deny superbugs the same potential to develop resistance.\n\nThe new class of drugs to kill superbugs is being funded and the testing expedited by huge government grants. Pharmaceutical companies expect it will take about five years for the drugs to reach the market. But in ten years, \u201csuperbugs\u201d may be a forgotten term.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Killer Superbug Breaks Out at Cedars-Sinai; Could Hit 67 Patients", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Killer Superbug Breaks Out at Cedars-Sinai; Could Hit 67 Patients", "title": "Killer Superbug Breaks Out at Cedars-Sinai; Could Hit 67 Patients - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Cedars-Sinai-Reuters.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-14T21:33:54-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/06/killer-superbug-breaks-out-at-cedars-sinai-could-hit-67-patients/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Killer Superbug Breaks Out at Cedars-Sinai; Could Hit 67 Patients", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Cedars-Sinai-Reuters.png", "title": "Killer Superbug Breaks Out at Cedars-Sinai; Could Hit 67 Patients - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Antibiotics, Cedars-Sinai, medical research, Superbug, UCLA,Big Government, Breitbart California,superbug", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-06T06:12:56-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T21:33:54-07:00", "tag": "UCLA", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFour patients at Cedars-Sinai have contracted the \u201cCRE super-bug.\u201d One has died and 67 are at risk of exposure, according to a hospital spokesman.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThere are two common links between the UCLA and Cedars-Sinai superbugs.\nCedars-Sinai proactively launched an investigation regarding its own ERCP scopes and patient records after the media broke the superbug deaths at UCLA.\nOver the last seven months, CRE transmissions have been confirmed from patients from undergoing ERCP procedures using Olympus duodenoscopes at UCLA, Cedars-Sinai, and Seattle\u2019s Virginia Mason Medical Center.\nUCLA patient Aaron Young also sued Olympus last week for negligence in connection with his CRE infection from the same tainted scope."}
