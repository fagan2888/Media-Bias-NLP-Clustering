That\u2019s become the underlying issue in the nomination of the White House\u2019s pick for surgeon general, Vivek Murthy. In 2012, Murthy sent out a tweet: \u201cTired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting lives at risk b/c they're scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue.\u201d The NRA got Senators to hurl the words back at him during a confirmation hearing, and seems to have convinced not just Republicans but some Democrats to vote against him. Now nobody is talking about bringing his nomination to the floor.\n\nLet\u2019s leave aside the issue of whether a Tweet should be the grounds for an opposition campaign, and of whether Murthy, best known for running an advocacy organization to support Obamacare\u2019s launch, is the most qualified person for the job. If the question at hand is whether it\u2019s partisan to believe that gun violence should be under the purview of the nation\u2019s top doctor, it seems the answer is no. As Lucia Graves at National Journal chronicled last week, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush\u2019s surgeon generals, C. Everett Koop and Louis W. Sullivan, have professed the same view as Murthy without ruffling feathers. \u201cPromoting reasonable gun policies does not make [public health professionals] \u2018antigun\u2019 any more than the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is \u2018anticar,\u2019\u201d wrote David Hemenway of the Harvard School of Public Health in his 2004 book Private Guns, Public Health.\n\nGun violence impacts health in all kinds of ways. There are the more obvious ones, like death and injury. As Olga Khazan pointed out at The Atlantic, suicide rates are higher in states where gun ownership is more common. In 2010, 19,392 people took their own lives with guns, while \u201cjustifiable homicides\u201d\u2014self-defense shootings that may have saved a life\u2014numbered only 230. Over two-thirds of homicides and over half of successful suicides involve the use of a gun, and accidental gun deaths average about two a day. The U.S. spends $2 billion a year on medical care for victims of gun injuries; one out of three people hospitalized after shootings is uninsured, according to The Huffington Post.\n\nThen there are the less obvious health effects of gun violence: Lead in the ground from ammunition. Loss of hearing from gunshots. Widespread PTSD that effects everyone from shooters, to victims, to bystanders. \u201cGun violence traumatizes whole communities,\u201d Hemenway told me. This creates a cycle: \u201cPeople with PTSD in inner cities often don\u2019t have good access to mental health care, and it makes them more likely to be aggressive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Is calling guns a public health issue a political statement?
