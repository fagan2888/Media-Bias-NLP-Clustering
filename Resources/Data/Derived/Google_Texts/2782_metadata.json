Those provisions were not included in the bill that was released yesterday.\n\nIn a telephone briefing today, organized by a group called 340B Health, representatives from four health systems explained how savings from the program allow their organizations to support access and treatment for low-income Americans both in the outpatient and inpatient settings, and to actively partner with federally qualified health clinics in their communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that some in the pharmaceutical industry want to gut the 340B program,\u201d said David L. Ramsey, president and CEO of CAMC Health System in Charleston, W.Va., noting that the program accounts for just 2 percent of U.S. drug revenues.\n\nOther speakers offered various examples of how 340B savings allow them to provide prescriptions to uninsured patients upon discharge who otherwise would have to go home without needed medications; support graduate medical education and other educational programs for physicians, nurses pharmacists and others, particularly in areas where those positions are difficult to fill; provide neonatal intensive care to needy families; and offer a host of other health promotion and health care services to vulnerable residents.\n\nFor more information, visit www.340Bhealth.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a lifesaver for low-income patients and critical to maintaining the nations health care safety net, hospital leaders stressed today, and, in a letter to Congress, called any legislation that might change the program premature.
