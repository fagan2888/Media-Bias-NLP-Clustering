PUEBLO — A 6-year-old girl died Friday night after a pickup truck smashed into a home.

The Pueblo Chieftain reported that the girl’s uncle, 34-year-old Daniel Chase, is in jail facing charges of vehicular homicide and driving under the influence of alcohol.

According to the newspaper, the girl and her father, 27-year-old Charles Chase, had parked in the driveway in front of the house at about 7:15 p.m.

Then, the Chieftain said, a Ford Ranger sped past a nearby stop sign, drove up past the right side of the parked truck and crashed into the front door of the home, hitting the girl.

The two men had been arguing earlier at a different address, police said.
