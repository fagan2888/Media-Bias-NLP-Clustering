The vice president added the Pope \u201chas become a moral rudder for the world on some of the most important issues of our time, from inequality to climate change.\u201d\n\nPope Francis will have a brief visit at the White House during his stay in the United States. He will also visit Cuba on this trip.\n\n\u201cFor Obama, the visit offers a chance to imbue his remaining goals with a sense of moral authority as he approaches the end of his presidency,\u201d AP says.\n\nIronically, when Obama visited Pope Francis last year at the Vatican, his description about the meeting contradicted the official Vatican account. While Obama said he and the Pope had not discussed any social issues in detail, Vatican officials said the two leaders discussed religious freedom, life, and conscientious objection \u2013 terms often used to mean abortion and the birth control mandate in Obamacare.\n\nA similar situation occurred in 2009, when then-House Speaker and pro-abortion, pro-same-sex marriage Catholic Nancy Pelosi posed for a photo-op at the Vatican with Pope Benedict.\n\nAs Catholic News Agency reported at the time, the 15-minute meeting \u201cturned sour\u201d when Pope Benedict used the opportunity to reaffirm the Church\u2019s teachings on the right to life and the duty to protect the unborn.\n\nFollowing the meeting, the Holy See released a statement saying:\n\nHis Holiness took the opportunity to speak of the requirements of the natural moral law and the Church\u2019s consistent teaching on the dignity of human life from conception to natural death which enjoin all Catholics, and especially legislators, jurists and those responsible for the common good of society, to work in co-operation with all men and women of good will in creating a just system of laws capable of protecting human life at all stages of its development.\n\nPelosi\u2019s statement about the meeting with Pope Benedict was as follows:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. ambassador to the Vatican said that during Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the United States next month, he expects the Pope will urge the U.S. to embrace its history of welcoming immigrants.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the Vatican said that during Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the United States next month, he expects the Pope will urge the U.S. to embrace its history of welcoming immigrants.", "title": "Ambassador Says Pope Francis Will Urge U.S. to \u2018Open Doors\u2019 for Immigrants - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/ap_ap-photo1388-e1434974744614.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/29/ambassador-says-pope-francis-will-urge-u-s-to-open-doors-for-immigrants/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. ambassador to the Vatican said that during Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the United States next month, he expects the Pope will urge the U.S. to embrace its history of welcoming immigrants.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/ap_ap-photo1388-e1434974744614.jpg", "title": "Ambassador Says Pope Francis Will Urge U.S. to \u2018Open Doors\u2019 for Immigrants - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Abortions, Ambassador Kenneth Hackett, Catholic social teaching, Climate Change, Donald Trump 2016, Environment, Global Warming, illegal immigration, Income Inequality, Nancy Pelosi, Pope Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, President Obama, Religious freedom, Vice President Joe Biden,Big Government, Faith, Immigration,pope francis", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Vice President Joe Biden", "published_time": "2015-08-29T07:30:14-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe U.S. ambassador to the Vatican said that during Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the United States next month, he expects the Pope will urge the U.S. to embrace its history of welcoming immigrants.\nIronically, when Obama visited Pope Francis last year at the Vatican, his description about the meeting contradicted the official Vatican account.\n\u201cPope Francis has breathed new life into what I believe is the central mission of our faith: Catholic social doctrine,\u201d Biden said in a statement.\nAmbassador Kenneth Hackett said the Pope\u2019s immigration message will be important as lead GOP presidential contender Donald Trump has called for a border fence between Mexico and the United States and the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants, the Associated Press reports.\nPelosi\u2019s statement about the meeting with Pope Benedict was as follows:"}
