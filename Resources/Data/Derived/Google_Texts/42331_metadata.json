West St. The hope was to bring the issue of child abuse to the forefront while also raising money for the family of baby Emma, who passed away earlier this week from apparent severe child abuse.\n\n\"We're trying to get everyone to appreciate what you have because you never know when it can go,\" Baker said.\n\nThat's something Baker says she knows firsthand.\n\nHer cousin passed away last year from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and is now memorialized in a tattoo on her arm.\n\n\"It kind of really hits close to home,\" Baker said.\n\nBaker is a friend of baby Emma's family and she says she knew she had to help by planning the fundraiser.\n\n\"I feel that was the least I could do in paying it forward because I know the pain of losing someone so young,\" Baker said.\n\nAlongside Baker, and other family and friends, were members of the organization Bikers Against Child Abuse.\n\nThey too were moved by Emma's story and inspired to help.\n\n\"She is such a beautiful little girl and it's just so senseless that this has to happen,\" said one of the members who goes by the name \"Turtle.\" \"Hopefully, we can all come together as a community and do anything we can to stop this from happening to another child.\"\n\nThe bikers held signs and encouraged drivers to head into the Autozone parking lot, while family and friends washed down the cars.\n\nThe bikers say many people put wads of cash into a plastic bucket as they drove out.\n\n\"People are very generous and they want to help in the ways that they can,\" Turtle said.\n\nWhether that was with a cash donation or with just a quick honk, their contributions meant the world to those volunteering at the car wash.\n\nAfter all, so many of them are like Baker and know firsthand, every little bit helps at a difficult time like this.\n\n\"It's not about anything else but raising support and awareness,\" Baker said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Volunteers hosted a car wash fundraiser Sunday on West Street in hopes of raising money for Emma's family and bringing the issue of child abuse to the forefront.", "language": "english", "author": "Jason Tarr", "og": {"description": "Volunteers hosted a car wash fundraiser Sunday on West Street in hopes of raising money for Emma's family and bringing the issue of child abuse to the forefront.", "title": "Community rallies together to raise money, awareness in wake of baby Emma's death", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Community-rallies-together-to-raise-money-awareness-in-wake-of-baby-Emmas-death-262321241.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E3F/329/E3F3291678684E3997DE8198AF80BA13", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/AFD/D93/AFDD93A9CB0743D397B60A370A205A4A.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Volunteers hosted a car wash fundraiser Sunday on West Street in hopes of raising money for Emma's family and bringing the issue of child abuse to the forefront.", "title": "Community rallies together to raise money, awareness in wake of baby Emma's death", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Community-rallies-together-to-raise-money-awareness-in-wake-of-baby-Emmas-death-262321241.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/HonkForEmma.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Community rallies together to raise money, awareness in wake of baby Emma's death", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Community rallies together to raise, money"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9fe\"", "article_summary": "Baker is a friend of baby Emma's family and she says she knew she had to help by planning the fundraiser.\nWith each honk and with every donation, dozens of volunteers worked to empower a family and a community Sunday.\nAlongside Baker, and other family and friends, were members of the organization Bikers Against Child Abuse.\n\"We're trying to get everyone to appreciate what you have because you never know when it can go,\" Baker said.\nBaker helped organize a car wash fundraiser in the parking lot of the Autozone on N.
