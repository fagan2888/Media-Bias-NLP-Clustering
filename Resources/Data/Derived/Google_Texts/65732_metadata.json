Conservatives of this disposition can be dull, but they know how to nurture and run institutions.\n\nOK, I guess, although Corey Robin would say that conservatism was never about that \u2014 that it was always about preserving power relations. But in any case, that kind of conservatism left the Republican Party a very long time ago. Remember, Ronald Reagan embraced supply-side economics, which was not only a radical doctrine but one rejected by virtually the entire economics profession; was that \u201cintellectual humility\u201d? And remember that Newt Gingrich tried to undermine the constitutional separation of powers with a government shutdown more than 20 years ago.\n\nAnd on the other hand, by David\u2019s definition Barack Obama is pretty conservative: the Affordable Care Act is a classic example of incremental change, building on the existing system rather than trying a complete overhaul.\n\nMy point is that if what you want is traditional conservatism, the only people with real influence with anything like that mindset are Democrats. Actually existing conservatism is a radical doctrine.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151013110046, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 13, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Everett Dirksen Doesn't Live Here Anymore ( 20151013 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "There are no traditional conservatives in American politics.", "title": "Everett Dirksen Doesn't Live Here Anymore", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/everett-dirksen-doesnt-live-here-anymore/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "There are no traditional conservatives in American politics.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 13, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1444748446, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T15:00:46-04:00"}, "utime": 20151013150046, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20151013, "pdate": 20151013, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "There are no traditional conservatives in American politics.", "title": "Everett Dirksen Doesn't Live Here Anymore", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/everett-dirksen-doesnt-live-here-anymore/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/everett-dirksen-doesnt-live-here-anymore/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Everett Dirksen Doesn't Live Here Anymore", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec2b\"", "article_summary": "Actually existing conservatism is a radical doctrine.\nMy point is that if what you want is traditional conservatism, the only people with real influence with anything like that mindset are Democrats.\nRemember, Ronald Reagan embraced supply-side economics, which was not only a radical doctrine but one rejected by virtually the entire economics profession; was that \u201cintellectual humility\u201d?\nOK, I guess, although Corey Robin would say that conservatism was never about that \u2014 that it was always about preserving power relations.\nAnd remember that Newt Gingrich tried to undermine the constitutional separation of powers with a government shutdown more than 20 years ago."}
