(Photo: Gannett File Photo)\n\nThe Mount Kisco Medical Group is trying to collect millions in unpaid medical claims after the collapse of Health Republic Insurance.\n\nPhysicians and the billing department of the region's largest medical group were left in the lurch after one of the state's largest health insurance co-ops shutdown. Health Republic absorbed millions in debt as a result of offering health insurance too low in cost under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOf the 200,000 patients across the state served by Health Republic, 13,000, or 6 percent, sought services at Mount Kisco Medical Group. Those patients will be or have been transferred to other carriers, said Dr. Scott Hayworth, president and chief executive officer of Mount Kisco Medical Group.\n\n\u201cWe feel taking care of patients is our primary responsibility, and we will continue to provide care for all those patients,\u201d Hayworth said.\n\nHowever, there is little recourse available to the Medical Group to recover those lost funds.\n\n\u201cThe physicians directly impacted are obviously very upset,\u201d Hayworth said. \u201cNo matter what field you are in, no matter what you do, you live up to your terms of the contract \u2026 They expect to get paid for their work.\u201d\n\nThe exact amount lost is unknown \u2014 bills are still coming in \u2014 but Hayworth estimates the total amount is \u201cin the millions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a large amount of money. Health care is a very narrow-margin business,\u201d Hayworth said. \u201cAs a result, it is a very meaningful amount for the medical group. In the world of managed care, a lot of organizations already discount a lot of money off usual fees, and, as a result, there isn\u2019t a lot of excess profit in the system.\u201d\n\nThe group has plans to reach out to federal and state lawmakers to ask them to do \u201cthe right thing,\u201d Hayworth said.\n\nThe state Association of Health Underwriters on Monday called on Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state lawmakers to use some of the state's estimated $1 billion surplus in extra funds in next year's budget to cover Health Republic\u2019s unpaid bills to providers and brokers.\n\n\u201cAlmost every other state covers the providers if the insurance company folds or goes out of business,\u201d Hayworth said. \u201cMost states have a fund in place and other ancillary providers on call. New York state doesn\u2019t, and needs a fund.\u201d\n\nHayworth said it is \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d what impact the loss would have on the health provider\u2019s services. Mount Kisco Medical Group has 2,800 employees, who serve 500,000 patients from throughout the Hudson Valley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just money for physicians, but also chemotherapy, vaccines and ambulatory surgery, and a lot of other things which we are not getting paid for,\u201d he said.\n\nAmanda J.
