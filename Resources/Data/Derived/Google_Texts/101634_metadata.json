The three-day event sketches the struggles of the Seminoles to remain in their homeland through a reenactment of the second Seminole War from 1835 to 1842.\n\nRELATED Alan Jackson to HeadlineSeminole Tribe's Big Cypress Reservation's 118th Anniversary\n\n\u201cThis was an important part of Florida and U.S. history,\u201d said Pedro Zepeda, part Seminole and Mexican, who has played major and minor roles in the reenactment for some 17 years. \u201cThe Seminole people are still here. We are still breathing our culture.\u201d\n\nThe tribe takes pride in being the \u201cUnconquered Seminoles,\u201d and historical accounts capture the pain that the Seminoles experienced in the battles that their people fought.\n\nThe second of the Seminole wars (there were three) was an uneven battle between the mighty force of the U.S. Army, Navy and Marines, numbering around 50,000 against some 5,000 Seminoles.\n\nThe end of the costly war \u2014 the U.S. military was said to have spent $40 million \u2014 caused the forced removal of thousands of Seminoles who were relocated to Oklahoma.\n\nWillard Steele, who wrote a brief history on the Seminoles, said that by the end of the war there were about 300 Seminoles left in the Florida territory.\n\n\u201cHistory tends to repeat itself. Fighting people in their own territory has always been difficult for the U.S. military,\u201d said Zepeda. Zepeda said that there may have been few Seminole fighters, but they were trained and skilled in military campaigns. \u201cMilitary know-how is built into our culture.\u201d\n\nPicture this for a moment: mounted soldiers in uniform and Indian warriors in colorful attire fiercely battling it out in the grassy field. You hear the exchange of musketry shots and cannon booms. This glimpse of reenactment is not all that bloody. In fact, the weapons are loaded with black powder, not real bullets, so it is safe.\n\nIn between the war scenes, enjoy watching alligator wrestling, a snake show, Stomp dancing, tomahawk throws, primitive archery competition and music. Visitors will see how early settlers hew wood, iron and silver crafts.\n\nYou can camp and join some 800 scouts who will be there for the weekend event.\n\n\u201cCamps are set up back in their time period,\u201d said Noella O\u2019Donnell, tourism coordinator of Florida Seminole Tourism.\n\nWhat You Should Know When You Visit:\n\n\u00b7 Check the weather in Florida before your trip, it is generally nice, but it can be chilly or rainy\n\n\u00b7 Dress comfortably.\n\n\u00b7 Come a few minutes early for the battle reenactments\n\n\u00b7 Be aware that the firings can be loud for some children\n\nFor more on the history and culture of the Seminoles, check out the Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki Museum (ahtahthiki.com), 3 miles down the road from the Billie Swamp Safari where the reenactment takes place.\n\nIf you are staying in the area, there are accommodations offered at Billie Swamp Safari or at the nearby Big Cypress RV Resort and Campground.\n\nBillie Swamp Safari, 2,200 acres of untamed everglades, offers a fun family adventure with swamp buggy rides and airboat rides.
