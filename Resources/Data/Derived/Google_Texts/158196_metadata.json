Resident Nathan Cox was one of those people.\n\n\"We have not bought any gifts yet so we're starting fresh, on Sunday, four days before Christmas,\" Cox said.\n\nCox had his son, daughter and wife with him at the mall. He said they walked through and did some window shopping, then split up to make the purchases.\n\n\"I think I got what we need to get, I'm going to send them to the car and dash through these stores and get everything they said they wanted,\" Cox said.\n\nBetty Cook and her husband Bob, of Siloam Springs, were also shopping at the Northwest Arkansas Mall. Betty said they usually don't wait this long to be done with their Christmas shopping.\n\n\"This is the first year because our two daughters and my daughter-in-law did our Christmas shopping for their children because they know their sizes,\" Betty said. \"So we are just buying extra little things that make Christmas fun.\u201d\n\nSome shoppers said there may be an advantage to last minute Christmas shopping. Several stores were seen having 40-50% sales on their entire stores.\n\nCollege junior Melanie Ward said she took advantage of the sales Sunday. She said she still had a few family members left to buy for.\n\n\"I was mostly looking for my siblings and some stocking stuffers for my parents,\" Ward said.\n\nListed below are extended hours for several local malls.\n\nNorthwest Arkansas Mall Holiday Hours\n\nSunday Dec. 21: 11 a.m. -9 p.m.\n\nMonday Dec. 22: 9 a.m. -10 p.m.\n\nTuesday Dec. 23: 9 a.m. -10 p.m.\n\nWednesday Dec. 24: 8 a.m. -6 p.m\n\nPromenade Mall in Rogers Holiday Hours\n\nSunday Dec. 21: 11 a.m. -9 p.m.\n\nMonday Dec. 22: 8 a.m. -10 p.m.\n\nTuesday Dec. 23: 8 a.m. -10 p.m.\n\nWednesday Dec. 24: 8 a.m. -6 p.m\n\nCentral Mall in Fort Smith Holiday Hours\n\nSunday Dec. 21: 11 a.m. -9 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FAYETTEVILLE (KFSM)- Many stores are opening their doors earlier and staying open later to allow shoppers more time to scratch people off their Christmas lists.
