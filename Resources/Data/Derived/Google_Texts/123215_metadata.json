Now the Greeks have 72 hours to pass these measures in parliament--not an easy task, given the July 4 \"no\" vote.\n\nBy Wednesday evening it will be clear whether Greece will remain among the 19 nations now in the currency union or whether it will be the first in the euro\u2019s 16-year history to go its own way.\n\nRelated: Why Greece Can\u2019t Grow Its Way Out of This Mess\n\nThe talks that led to this moment concluded an astonishing weekend of bobbing, weaving, backpedaling, and nose-to-nose negotiation. Eurozone finance ministers met for more than 10 hours Sunday, at the end of which they handed a four-page document to a hastily convened summit of euro zone leaders.\n\nIt contained what amounts to an ultimatum, and it\u2019s what eurozone leaders gave Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras: Make this list of rigorous new reforms law and get your parliament to pass it before Wednesday night. Only then will the third bailout program, now expected to be worth $95.6 billion, be implemented. Otherwise, it\u2019s over.\n\nA couple of new realities are suddenly evident.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s up to Tsipras now to get this deal done or lead Greece out of the euro. How hard will he fight for a package of reforms that, in some of its conditions, is certain to offend his electorate and many in the governing Syriza party? How much resistance will he meet among influential Syriza factions sporting deeper shades of red?\n\nThese questions won\u2019t be answerable until Tuesday or so. Let\u2019s assume for the moment Tsipras is still in the prime minister\u2019s office by then.\n\nRelated: Greece\u2014The Self-Inflicted Wounds of a Careless Country\n\n\u2022 Eurozone leaders spoke with one voice at midnight Sunday Brussels time. But no one should be misled: The European Union is a house deeply divided at this moment. Greece is the wedge that splits it apart, but there\u2019s nothing sudden about this breach: The exposed fault line was baked into the EU cake from the start.\n\nDon\u2019t be misled on this point, either: Dickering over new details of a prospective bailout isn\u2019t nearly as important as where political power\u2014in the EU or in the sovereignty of a member\u2014is seen to lie at the end of the process now reaching its denouement.\n\nEven a few weeks ago, the standard line was that the Greeks simply didn\u2019t measure up to the fiscal and economic conditions the EU demanded in return for further bailout assistance. This no longer holds\u2014if it ever did.\n\nAs of this past weekend the politics of the piece are plain. While Greece\u2019s left social democratic government has been a thorn in the EU\u2019s side since it came to power in January, that\u2019s not the only issue now. At least as consequential now are German politics and EU politics as the Germans see them.\n\nRelated: Greece\u2019s New Marxist Finance Minister\u2014More Polished? More Radical?\n\nThis is big. By no one\u2019s design, the Greek crisis amounts to Germany\u2019s (and Chancellor Merkel\u2019s) first turn as postwar Europe\u2019s de facto leader. And you have to mark this term paper in red ink: The key to European unity doesn\u2019t lie in forcing everyone else to be German, which appears to be Berlin\u2019s much-unenlightened thesis.\n\nThis leads to another, deeper source of tension. As argued previously in this space, Europe\u2019s fissure has cultural and historical dimensions that have long been brushed aside but are now ignored to everyone\u2019s cost. Never mind the Continent\u2019s East-West divide: The distinction between Northern Europeans and Southern, Nordics and Latins, is kicking in big time.\n\nThe split in front of us now was instantly evident after Tsipras went back to Brussels, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Paris after Greece\u2019s \u201cno to austerity\u201d vote last week with a proposal that gave EU institutions and leaders virtually all they had demanded. Senior French and Italian officials quickly advanced favorable appraisals of the new Greek program.\n\nSimultaneously, the hawks swooped in. The generalissimo among them, of course, is German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sh\u00e4uble, whose view that Greece should be pushed out of the eurozone altogether has been all but stated for months. Behind him stand the Finns, the Slovaks, and other less-powerful members of the currency union.\n\nRelated: Why Germany\u2019s Hard Line with Greece Carries Enormous Risks\n\nBy this weekend, these positions had hardened. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande insisted that Greece deserved a new deal, and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi joined him.\n\nLate Saturday, Sh\u00e4uble\u2019s ministry leaked a counter-proposal: Athens must accept another, more sweeping reform package. It would have to include (1) a depositary vehicle into which Greece would transfer $55 billion in state-held assets\u2014airports, ports, oil refineries, and the like\u2014for privatization and (2) direct European Commission supervision of the Tsipras administration.\n\nAnyone familiar with the Greek crisis knows what Wolfgang Sh\u00e4uble knows damn well: Privatizations are an exceptionally sensitive sticking point for the Greeks, and assigning the EC to oversee Athens is an insult few Greeks\u2014or anyone else in a similar circumstance\u2014would be likely to accept.\n\nA diplomat in Brussels, quoted by Reuters Sunday evening, said these demands were \u201ctantamount to turning Greece into a German protectorate.\u201d\n\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, the German newsweekly that obtained the leaked document, said it included a finance ministry plan for Greece to exit \u201cfor at least five years.\u201d\n\nRelated: One in Two French Want Greece Out of the Euro\n\nSince Tsipras went home with many or most of the German finance ministry\u2019s demands in his briefcase, the weekend in Brussels looks like a victory for the EU\u2019s hawks. The intent seems plain: What the Greek leader must sell back in Greece\u2014assuming he chooses to\u2014amounts to intentionally antagonistic conditions that could prove the quickest way to force Greece out of the eurozone.\n\nThe question now\u2014and a lot of people are starting to ask it\u2014is whether Sh\u00e4uble and his allies intend to use Greece as a warning to other members, notably France and Italy\u2014major economies that have resisted austerity\u2019s rigors on one or another issue. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s just-departed finance minister, argued in an opinion piece last week that France is Sh\u00e4uble\u2019s true target, Greece the object lesson.\n\nFrom far beneath this split in Europe, a cultural fault line breaks through the surface. Look at the nations now lined up on either side of the Greek crisis: French and Italians stand in opposition to Germans and Finns.\n\nWhichever way the Greek crisis goes this week, we\u2019ve already learned fundamental things from it. One, Europe needs a leader who can accommodate diversity within the union\u2014if not embrace it as high among the Continent\u2019s strengths.\n\nTwo, Europe isn\u2019t there yet.\n\nThis column was updated Monday morning, July 13th, at 7:50 am.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Leaders of the eurozone nations put Greeks and other Europeans on urgent notice at a h", "title": "Europe\u2019s Deal with Greece Nearly Splits the Eurozone", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/13/Greece-Gets-Ultimatum-And-Europe-Splits-Over-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/eurozone-greece_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/13/Greece-Gets-Ultimatum-And-Europe-Splits-Over-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/eurozone-greece_1.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Leaders of the eurozone nations put Greeks and other Europeans on urgent notice at a h", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28c7\"", "article_summary": "Eurozone finance ministers met for more than 10 hours Sunday, at the end of which they handed a four-page document to a hastily convened summit of euro zone leaders.\nYanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s just-departed finance minister, argued in an opinion piece last week that France is Sh\u00e4uble\u2019s true target, Greece the object lesson.\n\u2022 It\u2019s up to Tsipras now to get this deal done or lead Greece out of the euro.\nThe generalissimo among them, of course, is German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sh\u00e4uble, whose view that Greece should be pushed out of the eurozone altogether has been all but stated for months.\nFrench President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande insisted that Greece deserved a new deal, and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi joined him."}
