Buildings are fringed by a wide lawn, but on the perimeter is a tall metal fence, topped by barbed wire. This is Napa State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital managed by California\u2019s Department of State Hospitals.\n\nHere, anyone who enters the secure area, workers and visitors alike, passes through multiple doors, metal detectors and locked gates.\n\nWhile most people with mental illness are not violent, more than 80 percent of Napa\u2019s patients are referred here by the criminal justice system. Some of them committed horrific crimes but were found not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial but ordered to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nMany of these patients can still be dangerous. Last year alone, the hospital says they committed more than 1,800 physical assaults.\n\nFor staff here, this week marks a somber anniversary. It was here, on October 23, 2010, that psychiatric technician Donna Gross was murdered by a patient \u2014 grabbed, dragged and strangled to death.\n\n\u201cEveryone who was here the day that Donna died on these grounds has PTSD, and we will never be able to address it. We just carry it. It\u2019s there,\u201d says Michael Jarschke. He has worked as a psychiatric technician at Napa State Hospital for 32 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of Donna Gross\u2019s murder, staff members all carried alarms to call for help. But Jarschke says that back then the alarm worked only inside the buildings \u2014 not outside, where Gross was murdered.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it today, that\u2019s almost ludicrous that we would do this,\u201d Jarschke said. \u201cWe always look back five years [later] and say, \u2018Wow, we were really dumb back then.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs president of the union representing psychiatric technicians, Jarschke helped form the \u201cSafety Now Coalition,\u201d employees who organized \u2014 and demanded \u2014 change.\n\nHospital Executive Director Dolly Matteucci says there have been changes, like limiting the ability of potentially dangerous patients to walk around freely.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, we have a much more stringent and informed and comprehensive grounds access policy,\u201d Matteucci said.\n\nMatteucci describes the most important change at Napa \u2014 a new personal alarm system with GPS to help hospital police respond more quickly to emergencies anywhere on the grounds. She has one hanging around her neck and explains that by pulling it, it sends an \u201cimmediate notification to dispatch and to all hospital police.\u201d\n\n\u2018Violence is part of the daily life at Napa.\u2019 Psychiatrist Steve Seager\n\nWhen I asked how frequently staff members are pulling the alarm, I was astonished by her response.\n\n\u201cThe tag gets pulled from 11 to 17 times in a day,\u201d she told me. \u201cStaff might see a patient escalating and say, \u2018That\u2019s looking a little precarious. I want a little help before I engage that patient.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe says that the heavy use of the alarm system illustrates how difficult it can be to serve such a challenging population \u201cin a very complex, active environment that was not built for a forensic patient population.\u201d\n\nNapa State Hospital opened in 1875. Until 20 years ago, most of its patients were civil commitments. Today, the vast majority have criminal backgrounds, including gangs. In fact Napa patients include members of the Crips, Bloods, Aryan Brotherhood \u2014 they\u2019re all there.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address that, Matteucci says, Napa has added more hospital police. But the hospital remains a dangerous place for staff.\n\nAt a hearing of the state Senate Health Committee last year, psychiatric technician Stephanie Diaz gave tearful, halting testimony, recounting her recent experience with one patient. As she was escorting him up a stairwell, she said he tripped her, pinned her to the floor and attempted to rape her.\n\n\u201cI started screaming at the top of my lungs,\u201d she told the committee, \u201cpraying that someone would hear me. I wasn\u2019t sure if I (had) pulled my alarm completely, and after a slight delay I heard the alarm sound and help arrived. It felt like an eternity. And I feared for my life.\u201d\n\nDiaz was testifying on behalf of legislation that would allow California\u2019s five state mental hospitals to isolate the most dangerous patients and give them more intensive treatment. The bill, AB 1340, passed and was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown last year, but it will take time to implement.\n\nNapa psychiatrist Steve Seager is a vocal critic of hospital administration. He says much more needs to be done to protect both patients and staff.\n\n\u201cViolence is part of our life every day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a constant thing. It\u2019s not like violence happens now and again. Violence is part of the daily life at Napa.\u201d\n\nIt begs the question: Why would anyone want to work here?\n\n\u201cOne of my nurses said, \u2018This is a Jesus job.\u2019 The patients need treatment. They\u2019re criminals.They\u2019ve committed crimes. I never forget that. But they deserve to be treated with dignity, which we try and do,\u201d Seager said.\n\nDespite the violence, despite their criminal records, the clients at Napa are patients, not prisoners. Hospital director Matteucci reminds us that as patients, they have certain rights.\n\n\u201cThey have the right and ability to be out and about in their treatment environment, treatment in groups. Exercising as a group. So it\u2019s just a demonstration of the complexity of our system,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last year alone, the psychiatric hospital's patients committed more than 1,800 physical assaults.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"5 Years After Brutal Murder, Napa Hospital Seeks to Balance Treatment With Security\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/10\\/19\\/five-years-after-brutal-murder-napa-hospital-seeks-to-balance-treatment-with-security\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-19 00:01:08\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-26 21:41:28\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":92470,\"author_id\":\"255\",\"author_name\":\"Scott Shafer\",\"author_display_name\":\"Scott Shafer\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\",\"Napa State Hospital\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/10\\/NapaStateHospital.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Last year alone, the psychiatric hospital's patients committed more than 1,800 physical assaults.", "title": "5 Years After Brutal Murder, Napa Hospital Seeks to Balance Treatment With Security", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/10/19/five-years-after-brutal-murder-napa-hospital-seeks-to-balance-treatment-with-security/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/10/MichaelJarschke-800x979.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scottshafer"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health,napa state hospital,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c98\"", "article_summary": "This is Napa State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital managed by California\u2019s Department of State Hospitals.\nHe has worked as a psychiatric technician at Napa State Hospital for 32 years.\nSome of them committed horrific crimes but were found not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial but ordered to a psychiatric hospital.\nIn fact Napa patients include members of the Crips, Bloods, Aryan Brotherhood \u2014 they\u2019re all there.\n\u201cThey have the right and ability to be out and about in their treatment environment, treatment in groups."}
