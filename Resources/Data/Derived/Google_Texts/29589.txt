The Affordable Care Act offered states federal dollars to expand Medicaid to Americans making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. But after the mandate was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2012, states had to decide whether to take the money and expand the program or turn down the cash. So far, 28 states expanded the program, with most showing a real drop in charity care and bad debt after the adoption.

But whether driven by politics or concerns over costs, 22 states have chosen not to expand Medicaid. Some are exploring their own waiver systems while others are already in deep discussions over joining the expansion crowd.
