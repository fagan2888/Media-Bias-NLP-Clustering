If you didn\u2019t know this Hobby Lobby was here before, know it now and don\u2019t shop here. They don\u2019t deserve women\u2019s business because they are the ones that all across the country have made it harder for women to get access to birth control,\u201d she said.\n\nWasserman Schultz said the store shouldn\u2019t be patronized because it was the driving force that led to a Supreme Court decision in June that certain family-owned corporations couldn\u2019t be required to provide contraception coverage through their health insurance plans. The contraception mandate was part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe congresswoman and party chairwoman spoke at a news conference adjacent to the parking lot of a Hobby Lobby near the intersection of State Road 84 and University Drive in Davie. The store, which opened in April, is the chain\u2019s first South Florida location.\n\nWasserman Schultz was joined by a representative of Planned Parenthood of South Florida, a Florida International University medical student, and a woman who requires prescription birth control for medical issues not involving contraception. Supporters stood behind them and at the intersection holding anti-Hobby Lobby signs.\n\nJoseph Ottolenghi, the FIU student and co-president of Medical Students for Choice, said limiting employees\u2019 access to certain form of prescription birth control would have a perverse effect. The more expensive forms of birth control, which are harder for women to afford if they don\u2019t have it covered by insurance, are the most effective. If women don\u2019t get those types of birth control, he said it would lead to more unintended pregnancies and more abortions.\n\nWasserman Schultz said it is \u201cparticularly important to hold Hobby Lobby accountable, stand in front of their business, make things uncomfortable for them because that is what they have done to their employees. I want to make sure that people understand that there\u2019s a business here that doesn\u2019t support its employees, that wants to be able to get in the personal business of their employees and make health care decisions and replace their own values, replace their employees\u2019 health care decisions, with their values\u2026.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby case was not only disappointing, it was dangerous. No boss should have the right to dictate and employee\u2019s health decisions because don\u2019t belong in the bedrooms, doctor\u2019s offices or pharmacies of their employees. A woman and her doctor know what\u2019s best for their body. Not an insurance company. Not a politician. And certainly not a manager at a Hobby Lobby,\u201d she said.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time Wasserman Schultz has advocated using the power of the purse in a political context. In 2012, when people who support gay rights boycotted the fast food chicken chain Chick-fil-A because of contributions from its owners and foundation to anti-gay causes, she said she issued an edict to her three kids: No more Chick-fil-A.\n\n\u201cOur family votes with our wallets,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when we discover a company doesn\u2019t share our family\u2019s values and makes contributions or spends its profits on causes with which we don\u2019t agree, we don\u2019t patronize those businesses anymore. Hobby Lobby is one of the prime examples.\u201d\n\nPublic relations representatives for Hobby Lobby couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Wednesday evening. A page on its website describes the 5-4 Supreme Court decision as \u201ca victory for Americans who seek to live by faith.\u201d\n\nThe company owners argued that the birth control requirement imposed under the Obamacare health law violated their religious convictions by forcing them to provide \u201cpotentially life-terminating drugs and devices in the company\u2019s health insurance plan.\u201d\n\nMost customers at the store late Wednesday didn\u2019t want to talk or have their names published.\n\nAmanda Wilson of Fort Lauderdale, on her first trip to the store to make a return for a friend, said she agreed with Wasserman Schultz in principle. \u201cWe should have birth control covered,\u201d she said. But, she said, she wouldn\u2019t avoid patronizing the store because \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019d make a difference by not spending money there because I\u2019m just one person.\u201d\n\nKevin Dougherty of Cooper City is a constituent of Wasserman Schultz\u2019s \u2013 but not a fan. \u201cI doubt seriously I would give her recommendations any consideration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Wasserman Schultz visits Hobby Lobby store - to urge a boycott", "Description": "Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Weston, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, stopped at a Hobby Lobby store in her district on Wednesday \u2013 not to pick up some craft supplies for one of her kid\u2019s school projects, but to alert people to the store\u2019s existence and urge people...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "author": "South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Sentinel.com", "description": "Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Weston, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, stopped at a Hobby Lobby store in her district on Wednesday \u2013 not to pick up some craft supplies for one of her kid\u2019s school projects, but to alert people to the store\u2019s existence and urge people not to shop there.", "title": "Wasserman Schultz visits Hobby Lobby store - to urge a boycott", "url": "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/sfl-wasserman-schultz-hobby-lobby-boycott-20140820-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53f52a27/turbine/sfl-wasserman-schultz-hobby-lobby-boycott-20140820", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.17", "twitter": {"site": "@sunsentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402230662, app-argument=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/deeplinkid/81137528", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 64829476886, "app_id": 728754867160252}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-08-20", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd29d\"", "article_summary": "Hobby Lobby is one of the prime examples.\u201dPublic relations representatives for Hobby Lobby couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Wednesday evening.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby case was not only disappointing, it was dangerous.\nIf you didn\u2019t know this Hobby Lobby was here before, know it now and don\u2019t shop here.\nAnd certainly not a manager at a Hobby Lobby,\u201d she said.\nThe congresswoman and party chairwoman spoke at a news conference adjacent to the parking lot of a Hobby Lobby near the intersection of State Road 84 and University Drive in Davie."}
