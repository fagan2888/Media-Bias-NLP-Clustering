Neither Obamacare advocate Families USA nor the United Food and Commercial Workers, which backs anti-Walmart campaigns, responded to Examiner requests for comment.\n\nWalmart offers its employees two standard plans, a Health Reimbursement Account and an alternative it calls \"HRA High\" that costs more out of employees' pockets but has lower deductibles. Blue Cross Blue Shield manages both plans nationally.\n\nAlso offered is a Health Savings Account plan that includes high deductibles but allows tax-free dollars to be used for coverage.\n\nFor a monthly premium as low as roughly $40, an individual who is a Walmart HRA plan enrollee can obtain full-service coverage through a Blue Cross Blue Shield preferred provider organization. A family can get coverage for about $160 per month.\n\nUnlike Obamacare, there are no income eligibility requirements. Age and gender do not alter premium rates. The company plan is the same for all of Walmart's 1.1 million enrolled employees and their dependents, from its cashiers to its CEO.\n\nA Journal of the American Medical Association analysis from September showed that unsubsidized Obamacare enrollees will face monthly premiums that are five to nine times higher than Walmart premiums.\n\nJAMA found the unsubsidized premium for a nonsmoking gouple age 60 can cost $1,365 per month versus the Walmart cost of about $134 for the same couple.\n\nThe medical journal reported a 30-year-old smoker would pay up to $428 per month, in contrast to roughly $70 each month for a Walmart employee.\n\nA family of four could pay a $962 premium, but the same Walmart family member would pay about $160.\n\nLow premiums are not the only distinguishing feature of the Walmart plan. The retailer's employees can use eight of the country's most prestigious medical facilities, including the Mayo Clinic, Pennsylvania's Geisinger Medical Center and the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAt these institutions, which Walmart calls \"Centers of Excellence,\" Walmart employees and their dependents can get free heart or spinal surgery. They can also get free knee and hip replacements at four hospitals nationwide.\n\nMany top-rated Walmart hospitals \u2014 such as the Mayo and Cleveland clinics \u2014 are left out of most Obamacare exchange plans.\n\nBut the real difference between Obamacare and Walmart can be seen in the levels of day-to-day access to doctors and hospitals.\n\nRobert Slayton, a practicing Chicago independent insurance agent for 11 years and the former president of the Illinois State Association of Health Underwriters, described to the Examiner the differences between Walmart and Obamacare provider networks.\n\nSlayton said the BlueChoice exchange network for President Obama's hometown has very limited hospital participation. \u201cIn downtown Chicago, the key is the number of hospitals: 28,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re going to the national network \u2014 this is what the Walmart network would most likely be \u2014 and you have 54 hospitals. That\u2019s a big difference,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, a Republican who is now a health care advocate, said Obamacare's lack of first-class hospitals is a big problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the number, but who they are. You\u2019ll find under the Obamacare exchanges that the academic hospitals have declined to participate, along with the specialists who practice at those hospitals. The same is true of cancer hospitals,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople who are seriously ill need to stay away from these exchange plans,\u201d McCaughey said.\n\nSlayton said the gap between doctor availability in Chicago under the Obamacare and Walmart plans is dramatic.\n\n\u201cYou will notice there are 9,837 doctors [under Obamacare]. But the larger network is 24,904 doctors. Huge, huge difference,\u201d he said.\n\nWalmart also offers a free preventive health plan that mirrors the Obamacare plan. Its employees can take advantage of a wide range of free exams and counseling, including screenings for colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, chlamydia, diabetes, depression and special counseling for diet and obesity.\n\nTheir children can get more than 20 free preventive services, ranging including screenings for genetic disorders, autism and developmental problems to obesity, lead poisoning exposure and tuberculosis. There are also 12 free vaccinations, and free hearing and vision testing.\n\nWalmart employees pay as little as $4 for a 30-day supply of generic drugs and only $10 for eye exams through a separate vision plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better program than people, I think, might assume without looking, just because Walmart has gotten such a bad reputation by some of the labor groups and other groups for its general activities,\u201d said Gail Wilensky after reviewing the retailer's plan.\n\nWilensky was head under President George H.W. Bush of the federal Health Care Financing Administration, the predecessor to the the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. CMS is the agency in charge of implementing a large part of the Affordable Care Act, and it oversaw the rollout of the troubled healthcare.gov website.\n\nDavid Todd, an independent insurance agent based in Little Rock, Ark., also compared the health plans for the Examiner. Walmart\u2019s corporate headquarters is in Bentonville, Ark., and the company has 58,000 workers in the state.\n\nTodd pointed to stark differences between the government plan and Walmart: \u201cIf I buy a family plan on the exchange, it\u2019s still $1,000 a month. And I can buy this for ... [$160] on Walmart.\u201d\n\nWalmart also gives cash to its employees for any health care expense. The annual payments run from $250 to $1,000 and are given at the beginning of the enrollment year in an account that can only be used for health care expenses.\n\nWalmart individuals face a $2,750 deductible and families need to pay $5,500 under the HRA plan. Individuals pay $1,750 and families pay $3,500 deductibles under the HRA High plan.\n\nThe deductibles are high, but Obamacare deductibles are higher, going up to $6,300, according to Todd.\n\nTodd looked at a 30-year-old woman who could qualify for the government subsidy. \u201cThe nonsubsidized premium is $205 a month for this 30-year-old. If they get a subsidy, then the premium is zero. But that person has to come up with $6,300 if something catastrophic happened,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Walmart monthly premium for the same 30-year-old woman would be about $40. Her deductible would be $2,750, minus $250 in cash advance, for a total net deductible of $2,500.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Obamacare health insurance enrollees may feel a pang of envy when they eye the coverage plans offered by Walmart to its employees.\nFor many years, the giant discount retailer has been the target of unions and liberal activists who have harshly criticized the company's health care plans, calling them \u201cnotorious for failing to provide health benefits\u201d and substandard.\u201d\nBut a Washington Examiner comparison of the two health insurance programs found that Walmart's plan is more affordable and provides significantly better access to high-quality medical care than Obamacare.\n\nClick here to see an infographic comparing Obamacare's health insurance premiums to Walmart's", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Washington Examiner.
