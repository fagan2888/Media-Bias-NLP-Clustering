For teen drivers it could happen.\n\nA state senator is pushing for just that, hoping to hold students more accountable. He says it\u2019s a \u2018simplified version\u2019 of a bill that he\u2019s looked at before, adding there\u2019s less controversy around it now.\n\nPlaying hooky in the classroom could soon cost New Mexico teen drivers.\n\n\u201cTen or more unexcused absences makes you habitually truant,\u201d Senator Craig Brandt said.\n\nBrandt, a Republican out of Rio Rancho, is behind a bill looking to crack down on those skipping school.\n\n\u201cTeachers can\u2019t teach if the student isn\u2019t in the classroom,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder his bill, if a student becomes habitually truant, a letter goes home to the parents.\n\n\u201cIt gives them two weeks to contact the district to appeal the unexcused absences.\u201d\n\nIf 30 days go by, a letter then automatically gets sent to the MVD. If a student has their driver\u2019s license or is close to getting it, it could be revoked or not given to them at all.\n\nBrandt\u2019s tried this before. The last two years he introduced a longer version of the same bill, but couldn\u2019t get it out of committee. He\u2019s hoping this year\u2019s different.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of his idea, however. Teens aren\u2019t. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair,\u201d Jessica Dragon, a junior at West Mesa High School said.\n\nThat was a common response KRQE News 13 heard from many high school students.\n\n\u201cI think taking their license away isn\u2019t going to do anything,\u201d Dragon said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another way they can\u2019t get to school.\u201d\n\nParents, though, seem to be on board.\n\n\u201cI think it really is a good idea,\u201d Marlene Lizer said. \u201cThe kids do need to stay in school and if they are missing school they need to take their license away.\u201d\n\nWith this bill, the juvenile probation office would also be notified if those absences rack up. That way, they can look into whether or not a child may be being neglected.\n\nBrandt says truancy affects boys more than it does girls. He hopes this bill would put a dent in the dropout rate and increase graduation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "[anvplayer video=\"402116\" /] ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) - Skip school and lose your license?
