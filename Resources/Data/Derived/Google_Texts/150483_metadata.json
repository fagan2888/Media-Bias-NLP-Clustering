Government employees \u2014 along with kids \u2014 have the day off. But do you know why?\n\nIf you answered \u201cPresidents Day,\u201d you\u2019re not using its formal name.\n\nThe actual federal holiday is called \u201cWashington\u2019s Birthday,\u201d after the nation\u2019s first president, George Washington.\n\nAccording to the Gregorian calendar, adopted by England and its colonies after Washington was born, his birth date was February 22, 1732. (The Julian calendar has him born on February 11.)\n\n\u201cIn the earlier years, when it was celebrated, it was more than celebrating his birth, it was celebrating what we liked about Washington: He walked away from power, a very poignant lesson for people,\u201d presidential historian Doug Wead said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1885, though, that February 22 became designated a federal holiday to honor Washington.\n\nPresidential historian C.L. Arbelbide wrote in a 2004 article in the National Archives publication \u201cPrologue\u201d that succeeding generations found \u201csignificant ways to periodically resurrect his memory,\u201d as evidenced by the laying of the Washington Monument\u2019s cornerstone in 1848.\n\n\u201cThe numerous tributes continued to reaffirm George Washington\u2019s place as the original \u2018American Idol,'\u201d Arbelbide wrote in the article titled \u201cBy George, IT IS Washington\u2019s Birthday!\u201d\n\nWead, who was special assistant to President George H.W. Bush, said Americans later fell in love with another President with similar attributes.\n\nAbraham Lincoln, born on February 12, 1809, became a popular figure after freeing the slaves and ending the Civil War. But it wasn\u2019t until his assassination in April 1865 that Americans began to see Lincoln in a different light.\n\n\u201cLincoln, because he was assassinated, he overnight became a beloved figure and suddenly a genius,\u201d Wead said.\n\nAlthough he was considered \u201ca buffoon and dumb during his time,\u201d after his death, everything he said was re-read and studied, Wead said.\n\nIn 1968, Congress debated whether to combine the two presidents\u2019 birthdays into one holiday but decided against it. The legislative body passed the Monday Holidays Act that year, which said existing federal holidays would now be observed on Mondays to give government workers a long weekend.\n\nThe bill went into effect in 1971 and deemed that \u201cWashington\u2019s Birthday\u201d would be moved from February 22 to the third Monday in February.\n\nThough his birthday is a federal holiday, not all states celebrate it on the same day. While Congress has the authority to create federal holidays, states and the private sector do not have to observe them.\n\nWith the confusion over whose birthday it is and when it is celebrated, many Americans have simply lost interest in the day\u2019s true meaning, Wead said. The reason? Presidential nostalgia has been replaced by criticism and controversy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that [nostalgia] anymore. Part of that is cynicism about presidents today \u2014 Nixon, Johnson, Carter, Clinton, Bush \u2026 there\u2019s less respect,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of respect for Washington because he walked away from power. That was just unheard of.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Retailers open their doors Monday and roll out big sales to entice customers.
