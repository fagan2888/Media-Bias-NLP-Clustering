Jeb Bush.\n\nSpies is the lawyer behind both of Bush\u2019s leadership PAC and the pro-Bush SuperPAC called \u201cRight to Rise.\u201d Spies signed on with Bush long before Romney\u2019s surprise Friday announcement, but he makes clear that he\u2019s comfortable with his support for Bush while he also views Romney with affection.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s bumbling presidency has made it clear we need a president with executive leadership experience. The world would be much different and safer if Gov. Romney won and was president today,\u201d Spies said. \u201cBut politics is about timing. And Gov. Bush is now rising to the moment and I hope he decides to run.\u201d\n\nRomney certainly heard the ticking of the clock now that Bush on Wednesday began raising hedge-fund money in Greenwich, Conn. So Romney dropped his bomb Friday at a previously scheduled meeting with former donors in New York.\n\n\u201cEverybody in here can go tell your friends that I\u2019m considering a run,\u201d Romney told the donors, according to Politico. The Wall Street Journal first reported the story. Time, however, casts some doubts on Romney's level of interest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "@MarcACaputo Mitt Romney rocked the political establishment and Jeb Bush\u2019s quasi-campaign for president when the former Massachusetts governor announced he might run for the White House a third time.
