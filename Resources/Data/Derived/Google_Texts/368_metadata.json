However, it does contend that with co-ops failing and enrollment in non-co-op programs slowing, President Obama\u2019s signature program is in a \u201cdownward spiral.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look first at the co-ops. They were inserted into Obamacare as a kind of quasi-public option. The co-ops are non-profit organizations governed by boards controlled by policyholders. In other words, as Merrill Mathews of Forbes puts it:\n\n[T]he co-ops would get rid of those greedy, self-interested actuaries and insurers who were profiteering on the backs of the sick. Not full-blown socialized medicine, but a good start.\n\nActually, not so good as things are turning out. According to Chougule, as of this week nine of the law\u2019s 23 state co-ops have collapsed. Consequently, more than 600,000 people who enrolled in co-op health plans will lose their insurance at the end of this year.\n\nIronically, many of them were forced into the co-ops to begin with when Obamacare caused the cancellation of their private insurance policies in 2013. In other words, they will have lost their health insurance twice because of the law.\n\nTo make matters worse, nearly all of the remaining co-ops are in trouble. Chougule says that 22 of the 23 co-ops lost money in 2014 despite receiving $2.4 billion in taxpayer support. (The nine that have already failed received more than $1 billion combined). Many of those that haven\u2019t yet failed received letters from the feds demanding that they take urgent actions to avoid closing.\n\nWhy are co-ops failing? Chougule explains:\n\nIn an attempt to gain market share, the co-ops are offering policies at rates that don\u2019t come close to covering Obamacare\u2019s enormous costs. As a result, enrollment in their plans far exceeded projections, making their financial holes even worse.\n\nHe points to the case of the Nebraska-Iowa shared co-op:\n\nOffering artificially low rates, it enrolled ten times more people than expected. This resulted in premium income far below patients\u2019 medical claims, forcing the co-op into liquidation. Now 100,000 people will have to find other plans.\n\nAs for slowing enrollment, a matter I discussed here, the White House recently said it expects just 1.3 million new enrollees in 2016. Chougule notes that this number is far below the 8 million originally predicted for 2016.\n\nThe key question, though, is who is enrolling, and here\u2019s where the central conceptual problem with Obamacare lies. It offers a disproportionate enrollment incentive to people who have higher health costs and qualify for larger subsidies. The possibility of a downward spiral is therefore obvious:\n\nAs costs [imposed by highly incentivized enrollees] continue to rise, so do the premiums on healthier and wealthier enrollees in traditional, non-co-op plans. Understandably, the latter then enroll in smaller numbers. That in turn forces even higher premiums on the remaining enrollees, creating a downward spiral: Over time, the enrollee pool becomes poorer and sicker and incurs ever-increasing costs.\n\nThis phenomenon, one suspects, is a significant factor in the disappointing enrollment figures the White House is projecting.\n\nThe combination of failing co-ops and declining enrollment in non-co-op plan by healthy, non-subsidized individuals creates a huge challenge to Obamacare. The program may not be on \u201cdeath spiral\u201d alert, but it isn\u2019t looking sound.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "It has been a while since I read an \u201cObamacare death spiral\u201d article, and this article by Akash Chougule of Americans for Prosperity stops short of claiming that Obamacare is in one now\u2026", "title": "Is Obamacare spiraling downward?", "url": "http://on.powerlineblog.com/archives/2015/10/is-obamacare-spiraling-downward.php", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "powerlineblog:article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2015/10/obamacare.jpg?resize=602%2C603&w=240", "site": "@powerlineus", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": "505151,john.hinderaker,scottwynnjohnson,750972908", "app_id": 154257474630565}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-26T03:08:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-26T03:08:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The combination of failing co-ops and declining enrollment in non-co-op plan by healthy, non-subsidized individuals creates a huge challenge to Obamacare.\nIn other words, they will have lost their health insurance twice because of the law.\nIt has been a while since I read an \u201cObamacare death spiral\u201d article, and this article by Akash Chougule of Americans for Prosperity stops short of claiming that Obamacare is in one now.\nConsequently, more than 600,000 people who enrolled in co-op health plans will lose their insurance at the end of this year.\nHowever, it does contend that with co-ops failing and enrollment in non-co-op programs slowing, President Obama\u2019s signature program is in a \u201cdownward spiral.\u201dLet\u2019s look first at the co-ops."}
