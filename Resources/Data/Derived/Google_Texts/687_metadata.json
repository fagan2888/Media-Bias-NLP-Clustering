Both black boxes had been recovered, Egypt's civil aviation minister said.\n\nThe Russian flag could be seen flying at half-staff over the Russian embassy in Cairo on Sunday morning.\n\nThe passengers included 214 Russians and three Ukrainians.\n\nSinai is the scene of an insurgency by militants close to Islamic State, who have killed hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police and have also attacked Western targets in recent months. Much of the Sinai is a restricted military zone.\n\nMilitants in the area are not believed to have missiles capable of hitting a plane at 30,000 feet. Islamic State websites have in the past claimed responsibility for actions that have not been conclusively attributed to them.\n\nOfficials say there is no evidence to suggest that a bomb could have brought down the plane.\n\nTwo of Europe's largest airlines, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, said they would avoid flying over the Sinai peninsula while awaiting an explanation on the cause of the crash.\n\n(Reporting by Eric Knecht, Abdel Nasser Abou ElFadl, Omar Fahmy and Lin Noueihed; Editing by Michael Georgy and Adrian Croft)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Airbus A321, operated by Russian airline Kogalymavia under the brand name Metrojet", "title": "Russian delegation arrives in Egypt to begin crash investigation", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/01/Russian-delegation-arrives-Egypt-begin-crash-investigation", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-crash_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/01/Russian-delegation-arrives-Egypt-begin-crash-investigation", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-crash_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Airbus A321, operated by Russian airline Kogalymavia under the brand name Metrojet", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Islamic State websites have in the past claimed responsibility for actions that have not been conclusively attributed to them.\nThe Russian flag could be seen flying at half-staff over the Russian embassy in Cairo on Sunday morning.\nRussia, an ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, launched air raids against opposition groups in Syria including Islamic State on Sept. 30.\n(Reporting by Eric Knecht, Abdel Nasser Abou ElFadl, Omar Fahmy and Lin Noueihed; Editing by Michael Georgy and Adrian Croft)\nTwo of Europe's largest airlines, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, said they would avoid flying over the Sinai peninsula while awaiting an explanation on the cause of the crash."}
