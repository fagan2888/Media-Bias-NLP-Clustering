Associated Press Republican candidate for governor and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott greets a supporter at his primary victory party in March.\n\nBy Matthew Waller\n\nWe\u2019re pro-life, pro-family, pro-marriage, pro-faith. He has demonstrated ... that he supports those ...\u201d\n\nAnn Hettinger, state director of Concerned Women for America\n\nAUSTIN \u2014 Greg Abbott went door to door to talk to families in the Rio Grande Valley. The Republican candidate had just finished the first gubernatorial debate of the campaign in mid-September \u2014 a historic first gubernatorial debate held in South Texas.\n\nOn that rainy weekend, the Texas attorney general knocked on a handful of doors in a McAllen neighborhood and left campaign fliers. His wife, Cecilia, walking alongside him, and his security detachment kept a lookout on the street.\n\nNo one answered at many of the houses, but one door opened and Abbott was greeted by a solid supporter. At another home, a woman stepped out with her daughter and he made small talk.\n\n\u201cDo you live here?\u201d he asked the woman, Lily Benitez.\n\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Benitez said.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m Greg Abbott,\u201d he said.\n\nBenitez introduced him to her eighth-grade daughter, Aimee.\n\nHe explained he was running for governor and he handed them a flier.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would see him here,\u201d Benitez said afterward.\n\nAfter Abbott left the upper-middle-class, suburban neighborhood, with its tidy houses and landscaping, Benitez said she was a Democrat, but that she hadn\u2019t shut out the possibility of voting for the candidate she just met.\n\n\u201cYou have to look both ways,\u201d Benitez said.\n\nHe had come to her home, so she wanted to pay him the respect of looking into his campaign, she said.\n\nAbbott\u2019s campaign chances look good with voting less than a month away. He holds about a 3-to-1 advantage in fundraising and polls show him with a high single-digit lead against Democrat state Sen. Wendy Davis in a contest that will give Texans a new governor for the first time in 14 years.\n\nThe Texas attorney general since 2002 is a staunch conservative who grew his political career leading up the gubernatorial race by suing President Barack Obama more than 30 times. He\u2019s courted his conservative base by championing issues such as tort reform and defending Texas\u2019 state rights against the federal government.\n\nAbbott\u2019s campaign now focuses on increasing the state\u2019s economic momentum as the country\u2019s No. 1 job creator while improving education, even as his opponent criticizes his defense of billions of dollars in cuts to public schools.\n\nAbbott, 56, set himself early on as an Obama fighter, defending photo voter IDs, the president\u2019s signature health care reform laws or environmental regulations.\n\n\u201cAs your attorney general, I\u2019ve been fighting for your liberty against an overreaching federal government,\u201d Abbott said at the end of his first debate with Davis. \u201cNow Texas is already great, but I\u2019m running for governor to make it even better. Texas is No. 1 in the nation for creating jobs, and I want to keep it that way, by keeping government small and taxes low, to build the roads and the water projects we need, to keep Texas growing.\n\n\u201cI will also keep our communities safe, from the Rio Grande Valley, all the way to the Red River, but I will also work to build a brighter future for the next generation. The way I see it, Texas is No. 1 in the nation for jobs, we\u2019re also No. 1 in the nation for farms, for exports, for energy production, for so many different things. The time has come to set a new aspiration. Texas should be No. 1 in the nation for educating our children. As your governor, I will work to fulfill that aspiration.\u201d\n\nA paraplegic since a tree fell on him while out for a jog when in law school, he has used his disability as an inspirational story on the campaign trail and in campaign ads, such as how he trained himself after the incident by rolling up the floors of a parking garage, telling himself when discouraged to roll up \u201cjust one more.\u201d\n\nCritics have attacked Abbott for trying to crack down on lawsuits in his push for tort reform. He filed a lawsuit himself against the property owner and the tree company involved in his injury and recovered millions. Abbott has opened up about the settlement, which could bring him $9 million by age 65. He has spoken candidly about his disability. He has said the disability lets him connect with voters, and he sees his rise through the political stratosphere in Texas as a testimony to the overcoming spirit he promises to bring as governor.\n\nHe\u2019ll occasionally make light of his being in a wheelchair and being put there. He talks about being able to roll faster than most cars when they\u2019re backed up on a Texas metropolitan freeway, generally followed by a call for better roads. Or he\u2019ll joke about folks asking him how slow he must have been jogging for a tree to have fallen on him.\n\nInstead of being behind a group of block walkers every \u201cstep of the way,\u201d Abbott joked at a campaign event that he would be behind them \u201cevery wheel of the way.\u201d\n\nWichita Falls born and Duncanville raised, Abbott got a degree in finance from the University of Texas and his law degree came from Vanderbilt University. Abbott served as a Harris County state district judge. He got an appointment to the Texas Supreme Court from then-Gov. George W. Bush, and he won two subsequent elections to hold the position.\n\nHe won an election for Texas attorney general and entered that office in 2002. Since then, as he proudly says on campaign materials, he has filed dozens of lawsuits against the federal government. He also started a Cyber Crimes Unit to arrest people using the Internet to prey on children; a Fugitive Unit to arrest convicted sex offenders violating their parole; and he expanded the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit to stop elder abuse and tax waste.\n\nAbbott boasts collecting more than $31 billion in child support and receiving recognition in 2014 as having the best child support program in the nation, according to the National Child Support Enforcement Association. Abbott also went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 and defended the right of Texas to display a Ten Commandments monument at the Texas Capitol.\n\nAbbott has reached out to the Hispanic community with ads in Spanish and numerous mentions that his wife, Cecilia, would be the state\u2019s first Hispanic first lady. An early campaign ad featured his mother-in-law talking in Spanish about his integrity as a person.\n\nThe issues that Abbott has most tried to bring to the forefront include education \u2014 with conservative measures such as online resources, school choice and accountability steps featured prominently \u2014 fiscal job-creation policies, including budgeting reform in state government, and road funding.\n\nHe also has policy platforms for strengthening gun rights, protecting private information, emphasizing border security and continuing Texas\u2019 fight against the health care reform law.\n\nAnn Hettinger, the state director of Concerned Women for America, said her conservative activist organization embraces Abbott\u2019s priorities and the way those are reflected in his lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWith Concerned Women for America, we\u2019re pro-life, pro-family, pro-marriage, pro-faith,\u201d Hettinger said. \u201cHe has demonstrated visibly with his suits to the government that he supports those things.\u201d\n\nAbbott\u2019s issues resonate with two people who came from Corpus Christi to block walk in the Rio Grande Valley after Abbott\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cOne of my top priorities is protecting our poor babies from being killed,\u201d Margie Najvar said, referring to Abbott\u2019s anti-abortion stance.\n\nBernard Najvar, Margie Najvar\u2019s husband, said the couple\u2019s original health care plans were canceled because of the Affordable Care Act, so they had to get new insurance.\n\nDavis, Abbott\u2019s opponent, describes Abbott as an insider who isn\u2019t working for Texans.\n\n\u201cI think that he has shown, in his long tenure in office, whether as a judge or as attorney general, that time and again he will sell out the interest of the people who elected him to serve them in favor of his insider donors,\u201d Davis said in a 2014 Texas Tribune Festival interview.\n\nAs an example, she talked of Abbott getting a $100,000 contribution from Republican donors with fertilizer interests about the same time he gave a ruling that made information about dangerous chemicals less accessible in the wake of curiosity about fertilizers since a plant in West exploded in 2013. Abbott has said he was trying to prevent people such as terrorists from getting such information.\n\nAnd she has also noted that Abbott reportedly received more than $1 million in donations from people tied to the governor\u2019s economic development fund, and that a recent audit of that Texas Enterprise Fund showed a lack of formal applications on the part of some companies. Abbott had ruled that certain information was proprietary and shouldn\u2019t be released. According to the Dallas Morning News, Abbott said certain application letters didn\u2019t need to be released, but those letters either apparently didn\u2019t exist or weren\u2019t \u201cformal\u201d applications.\n\n\u201cI think it says everything you need to know about who he is, and it goes back to that saying, my friend\u2019s grandma\u2019s saying: When someone shows you who they are, believe them,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe has shown us over and over who he is.\u201d\n\nOn education, Davis has said derided Abbott for continuing to defend in court the state\u2019s decision to cut $5.4 billion from public education in 2011. Texas perennially faces a statewide school finance lawsuit, and lately a state district judge has said that Texas isn\u2019t doing enough for its students. Davis has said Abbott has the ultimate option on whether to continue the litigation, a claim Abbott disputes, arguing that he is obligated to represent the state.\n\nAbbott generally defends Texas\u2019 low regulation, low tax environment as a good place to do business and lead in job creation, a place that in the end lets Texans pursue dreams for their own future.\n\n\u201cWhat Texans really want to do, they want to be able to pursue their dreams,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so hard to be able to pursue a dream when you have government dictating what you can do, imposing more and heavy regulations on you, and those big government policies that Sen. Davis stands for crush dreams as opposed to allowing them to flourish.\u201d\n\nMatthew Waller covers state news as the Scripps Austin Bureau chief.
