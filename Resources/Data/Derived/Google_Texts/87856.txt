Adam Ottavino is clearly a big part of the Rockies’ future.

The right-handed reliever with the put-away slider has agreed to a three-year, $10.4 million contract extension, a major-league source confirmed Saturday. The deal covers Ottavino’s remaining arbitration years.

The Rockies have not officially announced the deal, but are expected to do so on Monday. Jon Heyman of CBS Sports was the first to announce the deal. The contract calls for Ottavino to make $1.3 million in 2016, $2.1 million in 2017 and $7 million in 2018.

Ottavino, 30, is coming back from the Tommy John surgery he underwent on May 7. He is expected to be out at least a year, meaning he likely won’t return to the majors until June or July in the 2016 season.

During the winter meetings earlier this month in Nashville, Tenn. Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich said Ottavino was progressing nicely from his surgery, but added that it’s too soon to but a timetable on Ottaviino’s return. Bridich said it’s possible Ottavino might not return until after the all-star break.

Until Ottavino returns, there is a good chance that recently signed right-hander Jason Motte will be Colorado’s closer.

Ottavino emerged as a dynamic closer early last season. In 10 games (10 ⅓ innings) he allowed no runs, three hits, walked two and struck out 13. Opponents were hitting just .094 against him when he went on the disabled list on April 27 with right triceps inflammation. A week later it was determined that he need elbow surgery and his season came to an end.

Ottavino has a 3.88 career ERA in 194 career appearances, 189 of them with the Rockies.
