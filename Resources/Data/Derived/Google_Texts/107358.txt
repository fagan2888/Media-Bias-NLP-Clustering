Denver police have arrested a man accused of robbing a bank on the 16th Street Mall and trying to escape via light rail.

The charges allege that Michael Whitington entered TCF Bank at 640 16th St. about 5 p.m. Tuesday and told the two employees that “this is a robbery,” according to a probable cause statement. Officials said Whitington was handed the money and he took off on foot.

Cameras picked up a possible suspect leaving the bank and boarding an RTD light rail going north, the court document said.

RTD dispatch informed police of the train’s whereabouts, and police stopped the train in the 2100 block of Welton Street.

After confronting the suspect on the train, police discovered he was wanted on a felony warrant. Two bank employees identified Whitington as the suspect.

Whitington, 45, was taken to be processed for the warrant and robbery. He remains in custody with $5,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday.
