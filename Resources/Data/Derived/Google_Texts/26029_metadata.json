Researchers use far more measured terms; sometimes the things they report make you wonder how they manage that.\n\nConsider this nationwide sample of 5,406 people with a diagnosis of advanced dementia who spent at least 90 days in a nursing home between 2009 and 2010. Most were over age 85 and had other diseases as well. The great majority, almost 70 percent, had a do-not-resuscitate order.\n\nIt\u2019s always a heartbreaking situation. Dementia is a terminal disease, although family members don\u2019t always recognize that and health care professionals don\u2019t always explain it. By definition, these patients can no longer recognize family members; most are bedridden, with a vocabulary that has shrunk to five words or fewer.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t walk or feed themselves or communicate meaningfully,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Tjia, a geriatrician and palliative care specialist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cA lot also have severe swallowing difficulties.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Dr. Tjia added: \u201cThese folks have a very high mortality rate. Many die within six months.\u201d A number of previous studies have shown that health care proxies, who make medical decisions for such patients, overwhelmingly say that their primary goal is comfort.\n\nYet pharmacy records revealed that most of these patients, almost 54 percent, received at least one of what the researchers delicately called \u201cmedications of questionable benefit.\u201d More than a third were given a cholinesterase inhibitor (Aricept is the best known) and a quarter received memantine (Namenda), both commonly prescribed for dementia. More than 20 percent were on statins to lower cholesterol, and 7 percent were on blood thinners.\n\nAll these drugs were deemed \u201cnever appropriate\u201d for palliative care patients with advanced dementia, in a list developed by a panel of geriatricians and published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. And the United States Preventive Services Task Force recently concluded that in some patients with mild to moderate (not advanced) dementia, drug therapies brought \u201csmall improvements\u201d in cognitive measures, but \u201cthe clinical significance of these improvements is uncertain.\u201d\n\n(Then why, I asked Dr. Tjia, describe them as of \u201cquestionable benefit?\u201d Why not call them \u201cmedications of zero benefit\u201d? She said that the drugs had their proponents and that discontinuing them remained controversial in some quarters, despite little evidence of effectiveness.)\n\nIf the only problem with such medications was uselessness (and cost, which averaged $816 per quarter), perhaps we would shrug. But as with any medical treatment, they can also do harm.\n\n\u201cI was a nursing home doc for years,\u201d Dr. Tjia told me. \u201cThere\u2019s an unappreciated personal cost to these patients in continuing these medications.\u201d\n\nAricept and Namenda, for instance, can induce nausea and fainting and uncomfortable urinary retention. They can also cause heart arrhythmia, which in turn can lead to implanting a pacemaker. \u201cA classic prescribing cascade,\u201d Dr. Tjia said. \u201cWe\u2019re treating the side effect of a drug with more drugs or, in this case, devices.\u201d\n\nPeople with severe dementia, one recent study found, are more likely than seniors with normal cognition to receive pacemakers. Statins have a documented risk of muscle pain, along with elevated blood glucose.\n\nPeople who have lost the ability to speak can\u2019t tell their doctors that they ache or constantly feel like vomiting. But the agitation or lashing out sometimes seen in patients with dementia \u2014 possibly triggering another round of drugs \u2014 sometimes reflects their physical discomfort. Discontinuing drugs sometimes helps them to remain alert and relaxed, although, again, there\u2019s no strong published evidence either way.\n\nWhy are so many people in this unhappy situation, being given questionable drugs when even swallowing pills can be difficult?\n\nAs with many treatments, geography is destiny. In the Census Bureau\u2019s Middle Atlantic Region \u2014 New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania \u2014 about 45 percent of patients got at least one of these drugs. In the West South Central Region (Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana), 65 percent did. Moreover, they were more frequently prescribed in nursing homes with higher use of feeding tubes.\n\n\u201cThat indicates that there\u2019s a level of discretion in what\u2019s happening,\u201d Dr. Tjia said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just clinical need driving this.\u201d\n\nNursing homes, hospitals, even cities and regions have their own cultures and practice patterns, and professionals often tend to follow their peers.\n\nBut emotions play a part as well, Dr. Tjia said. And who could disagree? The idea that a family is \u201cdoing everything\u201d for a failing loved one, or a doctor for his or her patient, remains potent despite many warnings that not every drug or procedure is benign, despite full-fledged campaigns to persuade people to weigh the pluses and minuses.\n\n\u201cThe idea that there could be benefits to stopping medication is still a pretty radical issue for most people,\u201d Dr. Tjia said \u2014 and she meant both professionals and families. \u201cFor some folks, it\u2019s a marker that the end is near, and that\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Greg A. Sachs, an Indiana University geriatrician, said the findings \u201cshould cause all clinicians to reconsider their prescribing practices and other decision-making for a broad population of patients late in life.\u201d\n\nThat would be nice. But meanwhile, family members can question the purpose and value of drugs their loved ones continue to receive as they decline. Especially when they\u2019ve lost the ability to speak for themselves.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140909050012, "BN": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "per": "Sachs, Greg", "org": "JAMA Internal Medicine (Journal);United States Preventive Services Task Force", "keywords": "Sachs Greg,Dementia,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Elder Care,JAMA Internal Medicine (Journal),United States Preventive Services Task Force,News & Research", "GBLC": "News & Research", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/Near Death, and Overmedicated ( 20140909 )", "news_keywords": "Dementia,Elderly care,Greg Sachs,JAMA Internal Medicine Journal,Pharmaceuticals,United States Preventive Services Task Force", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Paula Span", "SCG": "newoldage", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Paula Span", "byl": "Paula Span", "twitter": {"description": "Why are patients with advanced dementia so often receiving \u201cmedications of questionable benefit\u201d?", "title": "Near Death, and Overmedicated", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/near-death-and-overmedicated/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "description": "Why are patients with advanced dementia so often receiving \u201cmedications of questionable benefit\u201d?", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 9, 2014", "article": {"tag": "News & Research", "published_time": 1410253212, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-09-09T09:00:16-04:00"}, "utime": 20140909090016, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140909, "pdate": 20140909, "des": "Dementia;Drugs (Pharmaceuticals);Elder Care", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "Why are patients with advanced dementia so often receiving \u201cmedications of questionable benefit\u201d?", "title": "Near Death, and Overmedicated", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/near-death-and-overmedicated/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/near-death-and-overmedicated/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Near Death, and Overmedicated", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 9, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1e5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA lot also have severe swallowing difficulties.\u201dMoreover, Dr. Tjia added: \u201cThese folks have a very high mortality rate.\n\u201cThe idea that there could be benefits to stopping medication is still a pretty radical issue for most people,\u201d Dr. Tjia said \u2014 and she meant both professionals and families.\nBut emotions play a part as well, Dr. Tjia said.\n\u201cA classic prescribing cascade,\u201d Dr. Tjia said.\n\u201cThat indicates that there\u2019s a level of discretion in what\u2019s happening,\u201d Dr. Tjia said."}
