Mr. Craig made national news earlier this month after he said armed citizens could serve as a deterrent to criminals, The Detroit News reported.\n\n\u201cComing from California, where it takes an act of Congress to get a concealed weapon permit, I got to Maine, where they give out lots of CCWs (carrying concealed weapon permits), and I had a stack of CCW permits I was denying; that was my orientation,\u201d he said at a press conference on Jan. 2. \u201cI changed my orientation real quick. Maine is one of the safest places in America. Clearly, suspects knew that good Americans were armed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could lead to vigilantism,\u201d Detroit resident Sandra Hines said Thursday during a Detroit Board of Police Commissioners meeting. \u201cWe already have the open-carry law here, and we have the stand-your-ground law. We don\u2019t need anybody encouraging citizens (to carry guns).\u201d\n\nMr. Craig argued that research done by the Department of Justice shows that \u201carmed citizens, good citizens, can have a deterring effect on violent crime,\u201d The Detroit News reported.\n\n\u201cWhile I sit here with lots of optimism and encouragement that crime is declining, we still have incident after incident where individuals like elderly people get dragged out of their cars at gunpoint,\u201d the police chief continued.\n\n\u201cThis is not often talked about: responsibility. I do not condone vigilantism. I don\u2019t support individuals arming themselves and doing the work of police officers. Police officers are trained to enforce the law. I think you put people at risk when you have people that are out playing police. I do see that a concealed weapon is an opportunity for self-protection only; not to go out and enforce the law,\u201d he said.\n\nDetroit police reported a 14 percent decline in homicides from 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Detroit's police chief is sticking to his guns after being criticized for supporting citizens to arm themselves.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Detroit\u2019s police chief is sticking to his guns after being criticized for supporting citizens to arm themselves.", "title": "Detroit police chief: Armed citizens can make city safer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/2/detroit-police-chief-armed-citizens-can-make-city-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/31/35b02339615781044a0f6a706700f08b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/31/35b02339615781044a0f6a706700f08b.jpg", "description": "Detroit's police chief is sticking to his guns after being criticized for supporting citizens to arm themselves.", "card": "summary", "title": "Detroit police chief: Armed citizens can make city safer"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, James Craig"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae29\"", "article_summary": "Clearly, suspects knew that good Americans were armed.\u201d\u201cIt could lead to vigilantism,\u201d Detroit resident Sandra Hines said Thursday during a Detroit Board of Police Commissioners meeting.\nPolice Chief James Craig responded Thursday to a Detroit resident who challenged his pro-gun stance.\nMr. Craig made national news earlier this month after he said armed citizens could serve as a deterrent to criminals, The Detroit News reported.\nWe don\u2019t need anybody encouraging citizens (to carry guns).\u201dMr. Craig argued that research done by the Department of Justice shows that \u201carmed citizens, good citizens, can have a deterring effect on violent crime,\u201d The Detroit News reported.\nI do see that a concealed weapon is an opportunity for self-protection only; not to go out and enforce the law,\u201d he said."}
