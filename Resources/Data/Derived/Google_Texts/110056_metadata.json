Aaron Bean, sponsor of the bill, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe legislature, if this bill passed, would take away that, and [sanctuary cities] would be able to be held responsible in court for their actions.\u201d\n\nBean, a Republican who previously served in the Florida House, represents all of Nassau County and part of Duval County.\n\nAs of October, Florida has seven \u201csanctuary counties,\u201d all in the Tampa and Miami areas, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe bill, along with two others recently filed in the Florida state legislature, is \u201cgoing to take a little pushback over illegal immigration in our state,\u201d Bean, 48, said. He added:\n\nWe\u2019re going to work on defining what a sanctuary city is. But we envision it [as] any city or county or municipality or entity that doesn\u2019t cooperate. In fact, it could actually be a constitutional officer of a county that doesn\u2019t cooperate with the federal government in tracking, enforcing, keeping up with illegal citizens[.] \u2026 We would deem them as a sanctuary.\n\nBean\u2019s bill, SB 872, was filed Nov. 17 in the Florida Senate. A section reads:\n\nUpon adjudication by the court or as provided in a consent motion declaring that a state entity, state official, law enforcement agency, local governmental entity, or local government official has violated this chapter, the court shall enjoin the unlawful policy or practice and order that such entity or official pay a civil penalty to the state of at least $1,000 but not more than $5,000 for each day that the policy or practice was found to be in effect before the injunction was granted.\n\nState Rep. Larry Metz introduced an identical bill, HB 675, in the Florida House.\n\nAbout 340 counties, cities, and states nationwide have been deemed sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrants from deportation\u2014including criminals.\n\n\u201cCities that provided sanctuary to illegal aliens are also providing sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens who, according to GAO reports, are repeat criminal offenders who victimize thousands of Americans,\u201d said Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, referring to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nEarlier this year, Kate Steinle, 32, was shot to death by an illegal immigrant in San Francisco. The accused man had been deported five times, had been convicted of seven felonies, and was in the San Francisco County Jail on drug-related charges a couple of months before the shooting.\n\n\u201cCities providing sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens should be fined by the states to deter such misbehavior,\u201d von Spakovsky said, adding:\n\nThe state legislature should also consider lifting the sovereign immunity of all city officials who implement sanctuary policies, so that citizens who are injured by criminal aliens can directly sue those officials for their actions in providing such criminals with safe havens in which to commit their crimes.\n\nBean said that under his bill, a sheriff who lets an illegal immigrant out of jail \u201cwould be able to be sued and not have that immunity that he would enjoy otherwise.\u201d\n\nSome who defend sanctuary cities are worried that cities and other jurisdictions will pass laws that hurt illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cInnovative regions of the world depend on ambitious, creative people who come from other parts of the world to contribute to our economy,\u201d San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, told USA Today. \u201cI think cities that become viewed as hostile toward immigrants will ultimately be forced to rethink their approach.\u201d\n\nAnother bill filed in the Florida Senate, SB 750, would limit the amount of money that low-income households of illegal immigrants could receive from the state. A similar bill, HB 563, was filed in the Florida House.\n\nThe federal government gives Florida money to distribute to families. Florida subtracts the amount of benefits those families already receive, and other income, from the total benefits for which a family qualifies, Bean said.\n\n\u201cRight now, the state of Florida doesn\u2019t recognize illegal citizens for what they earn, and so they get nothing subtracted,\u201d Bean said. \u201cIllegal citizen households are getting more in benefits than the traditional legal residents in our state.\u201d\n\nA third bill \u201cramps up the degree of charges\u201d for illegal immigrants accused of committing crimes, he said.\n\nThe next legislative session in Florida opens Jan. 12. Bean said he intends to make these bills the top priority and \u201chopefully make our state a safer one.\u201d\n\nA \u201chandful\u201d of lawmakers will push to get the bills through the legislature, he said, noting that he has joined with Metz, state Sen. Travis Hutson, and state Rep. Matt Gaetz.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s just a shame the federal government hasn\u2019t done its duty in defending our borders, enforcing our rules,\u201d Bean said, \u201cand that\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided as a state we\u2019re going to step up and see what we can do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We\u2019re going to work on defining what a sanctuary city is,\" he says. \"But we envision it any city or county ... or entity that doesn\u2019t cooperate .\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"We\u2019re going to work on defining what a sanctuary city is,\" he says. \"But we envision it any city or county ... or entity that doesn\u2019t cooperate .\"", "title": "This Lawmaker Wants to Slap $5K Fines on Sanctuary Cities", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151125_FloridaMigrantPolicy_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-01T13:19:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1XgLe8e"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"We\u2019re going to work on defining what a sanctuary city is,\" he says. \"But we envision it any city or county ... or entity that doesn\u2019t cooperate .\"", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151125_FloridaMigrantPolicy_Jessen.jpg"}, "title": "This Lawmaker Wants to Slap $5K Fines on Sanctuary Cities", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-11-30T16:16:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T13:19:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Florida illegal immigration, illegal aliens, sanctuary city, Aaron Bean, Kate Steinle, Hans von Spakovsky"}, "article_summary": "About 340 counties, cities, and states nationwide have been deemed sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrants from deportation\u2014including criminals.\nA Florida state senator proposes to impose a fine of up to $5,000 a day on officials of \u201csanctuary cities\u201d who don\u2019t follow federal immigration enforcement policies.\nAs of October, Florida has seven \u201csanctuary counties,\u201d all in the Tampa and Miami areas, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\nThe bill, along with two others recently filed in the Florida state legislature, is \u201cgoing to take a little pushback over illegal immigration in our state,\u201d Bean, 48, said.\n\u201cIn Florida, [sanctuary cities] enjoy sovereign immunity, meaning they\u2019re shielded from being sued on any of their decisions in conducting their business,\u201d state Sen.
