After months of Clintonesque stonewalling, during which Hillary repeatedly misled the public and the media, the FBI has seized Clinton\u2019s private email server and a backup storage device. Some conspicuous failures \u2013 among them Russian Federation, Libya, Syria \u2013 implicate Hillary.\n\nSo now we\u2019re supposed to believe that not only did Hillary not know what it meant to wipe a server clean, but her communications director-who by the way uses computers to electronically communicate with supporters and the press-didn\u2019t know either? Now, as she seeks the White House again, Clinton has tried to pull a few pages from Obama\u2019s playbook.\n\nDemocrats are approaching RED-Alert panic.\n\nQuestions remain: Will President Barack Obama direct his politically-militarized Justice Dept.to protect Hillary? If Hillary escapes and wins, the Clintons will prevail. She has said, had she, she would have done it differently. Will an egocentric Obama accept a Clinton-centric Democratic Party?\n\nWhenever she crashes, pre-primary, primary or general election, Hilary\u2019s wholly-predictable wreck will be anticlimactic.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Press Examiner", "description": "2016 Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Jeb Bush face off at dueling town hall events in New Hampshire, capping a day of campaigning in the early-voting state.
