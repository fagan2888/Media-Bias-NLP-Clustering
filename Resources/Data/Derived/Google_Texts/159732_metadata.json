First, here\u2019s a look back at one of the odder ramifications in 1937 \u2014 a market in rare passenger pigeon eggs:\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Library of Congress:\n\nPassenger pigeon eggs at $300 a piece. Washington, D.C., Dec. 1. Since the last passenger pigeon in existence died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914, the eggs from the now extinct birds have become so scarce that G. Ellis Miller, of this city, is asking $300 a piece for the three perfect ones in his possession\u2013with no takers. The eggs were left to Miller by his grandfather from a collection made 75 years ago \u2014 when the birds flew in flocks that darkened the sun and broke branches off trees when they roosted en masse. Marjorie Beall, biology student at George Washington University, is shown studying the eggs, which are kept in a display with carved birds and other eggs. 12/1/37\n\nBut I want to focus attention on a point made in a fascinating Carl Zimmer essay in National Geographic \u2014 on the role of 19th century social networks (the telegraph) and railroads in facilitating mass slaughter:\n\n\u201cThe telegraph allowed word to go out: \u2018The pigeons are here,'\u201d says David Blockstein, a senior scientist at the National Council for Science and the Environment and a founder of Project Passenger Pigeon. Thousands of hunters would then jump on newly built trains to ride out to wherever the pigeons had settled and start slaughtering them. The hunters weren\u2019t just killing the birds to feed their families, however. Pigeons would be stuffed into barrels and loaded back onto the trains, which would deliver them to distant cities, where they\u2019d be sold everywhere from open air markets to fine restaurants. \u201cTechnology enabled the market,\u201d says Blockstein.\n\nThese days, global social networks \u2014 a keystone of the expanding Knowosphere \u2014 may do more to forestall future extinctions than accelerate them. Two cases in point are the online push against consumption of shark fins and elephant ivory by WildAid and allies like the basketball star Yao Ming.\n\nAnother is Greenpeace\u2019s clever use of YouTube campaigns focused on orangutans and popular chocolate bars to press companies like Nestle to pay attention to the source of palm oil.\n\nTime will tell.\n\nAddenda | In an email discussion I initiated with some conservationists and journalists, my friend Keith Kloor noted that eBay abetted the sales of endangered species and related contraband before conservation groups and journalists (including Kloor) exposed what was going on. Here\u2019s eBay\u2019s policy now.\n\nThe writer and conservationist Carl Safina added this thought in the same chat:", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140901135407, "BN": "dotearth", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/dotearth", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/dotearth/post", "per": "Yao Ming;Zimmer, Carl", "org": "Greenpeace;Library of Congress", "keywords": "Yao Ming,Zimmer Carl,Birds,Endangered and Extinct Species,Hunting and Trapping,Pigeons,Greenpeace,Library of Congress,biology,birds,endangered species", "GBLC": "biology;birds;endangered species", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/dotearth/The Role of Social Media in Wiping Out Passenger Pigeons, and Conserving Species Now ( 20140901 )", "news_keywords": "Bird,Carl Zimmer,Endangered Species,Greenpeace,Hunting,Library of Congress,Pigeons,Yao Ming", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Andrew C.
