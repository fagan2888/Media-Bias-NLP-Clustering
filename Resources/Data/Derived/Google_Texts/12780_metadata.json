(AP Photo)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in the House\u2019s upcoming vote on a reconciliation bill Friday.\n\n\n\nPelosi told reporters in her Thursday press briefing that \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d saying that there could be legislative compromise, which was \u201cwhat Pope Francis told us to do.\u201d Then she cited remarks in the Pope\u2019s September speech to Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublicans are moving forward with a GOP reconciliation package that once again lays the groundwork for another Republican government shutdown. It\u2019s a waste of time. It will go nowhere in the Senate,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be their 61st vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they will of course be wanting to defund Planned Parenthood, destroy the Affordable Care Act, dismantle newfound health security for millions of Americans,\u201d she continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Pelosi emphasized. \u201cInstead we could be working together recognizing a Republican Congress, a Democratic president, the ability for Democrats to use their leverage legislatively to have compromise for the good of the American people. That\u2019s what Pope Francis told us to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said leaders should have transparency. That would be wonderful - openness, he said. He used the word openness and pragmatism, and he said we have to move forward for the good of the people. Let\u2019s in the spirit of Francis do that,\u201d she added.\n\nPelosi was referencing the Pope\u2019s September 24th speech before Congress in which he praised \u201copenness and pragmatism\u201d as qualities of a good leader, although it was in the context of countries resuming dialogue.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen countries which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue \u2013 a dialogue which may have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons \u2013 new opportunities open up for all,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cThis has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility. A good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe pope also mentioned moving forward for the common good.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven in the developed world, the effects of unjust structures and actions are all too apparent. Our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of peoples,\u201d the pope said, \u201cWe must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good.\u201d\n\n\n\nPelosi cited these same words of Pope Francis, again in relation to avoiding a government shutdown, in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell shortly after the pope\u2019s September visit.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis Holiness gave us good guidance \u2013 to be in dialogue \u2013 that was the message of Saint Thomas Merton, of Thomas Merton, in terms of dialogue \u2013 find a path, go forward \u2026 make progress, go forward \u2026 respect other people\u2019s views, and come to solutions that do just that,\u201d Pelosi told Mitchell. \u201cSo, I feel quite certain that we\u2019ll keep government open, because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know there are those who want to express themselves as opposed to respect for women\u2019s health \u2013 but have them express that\u2026 but our higher responsibility is to get the job done for the American people,\u201d she added. \u201cThat was an overriding thing of Pope Francis, to do what we come here to do for the greater good, and to do it for our home.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe pope also spoke before the United Nations during his U.S. visit and called for \u201crespect for the sacredness of every human life,\u201d including that of \u201cthe unborn.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives will vote Friday on the budget reconciliation bill. Republicans will attempt to employ the reconciliation process to approve legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. The bill would block, for one year, at least 89% of federal payments to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\nIn its last annual report, Planned Parenthood said it performed more than 327,653 abortions in fiscal 2013-2014. The organization also reported that it received $528.4 million in government health grants and reimbursements for that year, which equaled about 41 percent of its income.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in the House\u2019s upcoming vote on a reconciliation bill Friday.", "title": "Pelosi Slams Planned Parenthood Defunding Attempts, Encourages Compromise: \u2018That\u2019s What Pope Francis Told Us to Do\u2019", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/lauretta-brown/pelosi-slams-planned-parenthood-defunding-attempts-encourages-compromise", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/pelosi_4.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-22T16:04:21-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-22T16:02:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-22T16:04:21-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in the House\u2019s upcoming vote on a reconciliation bill Friday.", "title": "Pelosi Slams Planned Parenthood Defunding Attempts, Encourages Compromise: \u2018That\u2019s What Pope Francis Told Us to Do\u2019", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/lauretta-brown/pelosi-slams-planned-parenthood-defunding-attempts-encourages-compromise", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/pelosi_4.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in the House\u2019s upcoming vote on a reconciliation bill Friday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In its last annual report, Planned Parenthood said it performed more than 327,653 abortions in fiscal 2013-2014.\nThe bill would block, for one year, at least 89% of federal payments to Planned Parenthood.\nRepublicans will attempt to employ the reconciliation process to approve legislation to defund Planned Parenthood.\nThat\u2019s what Pope Francis told us to do.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
