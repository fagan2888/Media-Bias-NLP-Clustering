The money in the fund was meant to help cover costs for unpaid medical bills.\n\nThe activity was uncovered by whistleblower Robert Baker, a former revenue manager at Community Health Systems Professional Services Corp. (CHSPSC).\n\n\"For every dollar a CHS hospital donated to the county, it received an amount equivalent to the 'donation' plus $3 back in supplemental Medicaid payments \u2013 making it a very lucrative investment for CHS and its hospitals,\u201d said Peter W Chatfield, an attorney with Phillips & Cohen LLP, which filed the suit on behalf of Baker.\n\nCHS denied that it did anything wrong, but agreed to the settlement, which resolves the claims against its CHSPSC subsidiary and two other hospitals, the Lea Regional Medical Center and Carlsbad Medical Center.\n\nBaker and his lawyers will earn $18.67 million from the settlement under the federal False Claims Act, which encourages whistleblowers to uncover corporate fraud by giving them up to 25 percent of the recovered funds.\n\nPublicly traded CHS manages more than 200 hospitals in 29 states.\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/community-health-systems-pay-75-pay-whistleblower-case-over-medicaid-fraud", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Alta-Vista-Regional-Hospital-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Suit claimed the hospital operator illegally donated money to New Mexico counties in return for higher Medicaid payments.", "title": "Community Health systems to pay $75 to pay whistleblower case over Medicaid fraud"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Alta-Vista-Regional-Hospital-feature.gif"}, "description": "Suit claimed the hospital operator illegally donated money to New Mexico counties in return for higher Medicaid payments.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Community Health systems to pay $75 to pay whistleblower case over Medicaid fraud"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Community Health Systems and three of its hospitals in New Mexico on Monday agreed to pay a $75 million settlement to the federal government over a whistleblower suit that claimed it illegally donated money between 2000 and 2011 to New Mexico counties in return for higher Medicaid payments to cover the costs of indigent care.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The activity was uncovered by whistleblower Robert Baker, a former revenue manager at Community Health Systems Professional Services Corp.
