A man in custody Wednesday afternoon was shot and wounded by police after he pulled a gun at a Denver police station, police said.

The suspect had been arrested about 4:40 p.m. in the 300 block of South Eliot Street on drug charges and an outstanding felony warrant, police said. He was handcuffed and driven in a police cruiser to the District 4 police station at 2100 S. Clay St.

Police Chief Robert White said at a news conference that somehow, after the cruiser arrived in the station parking lot, the suspect produced a weapon and fired a shot at officers but didn’t hit anyone.

Another police officer opened fire and hit the suspect, who was taken to Denver Health Medical Center in critical condition, but he is expected to live.

No officers were injured.

“It appears he did absolutely the right thing,” White said of the officer who shot the suspect.

The suspect was identified late Wednesday night as 32-year-old Isaac Vigil.

Colorado court records show Vigil had been arrested April 8 on felony menacing and weapons charges in Adams County. He failed to appear at his preliminary hearing last week, and a felony warrant was issued for his arrest.

His record also shows previous assault and escape charges.

Police will now investigate how, or even whether, Vigil had been searched or frisked before he was taken to the substation.

Searching is standard procedure, White said, but added, “This might not have been a typical situation.”

White said it is unlikely the suspect took or used the officer’s weapon.

The name of the officers involved have not been released.
