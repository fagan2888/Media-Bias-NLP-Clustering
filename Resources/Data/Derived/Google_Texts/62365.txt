While Andy Serkis' "Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens" role remains a mystery, possible new details have emerged to shed some light on his character.



4Chan user SpoilerMan recently claimed Serkis will be playing a "species we've never seen before" who is a "legit" and "worthy foe to [Luke Skywalker]."



If SM is right about Luke still being one of the good guys, we guess that means Serkis' character is a villain.



Additionally, we'll find out who trained the character sometime in the third act.



SM continues, "Serkis’ machinations and outlook are very different from Palpatine’s. He believes the Rule of Two is a foolish edict and considers Palpatine as having made a couple of mistakes."
