Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Ben Carson, and successfully making the argument he has hobbled Obamacare, a law Republicans hate, could be a big boost to his campaign.\n\nNews reports by the Associated Press and Washington Post have questioned his claims of victory, giving most of the credit to others.\n\nRubio\u2019s argument stems from a 2013 bill he introduced aimed at killing a provision in the Affordable Care Act, referred to as \u201crisk corridors,\u201d that provided funding to insurance companies in the event they incurred losses on the ACA exchanges in their first three years. The provision, which Rubio called a \u201cbailout,\u201d was based on the idea that because the exchanges were new, insurers might not be able to accurately predict what their claims would be and could need a financial backstop.\n\nRubio\u2019s 2013 bill wasn\u2019t passed, but a provision that congressional Republicans got inserted into a big spending bill has kept a lid on risk corridor spending.\n\nThe question is, how much credit does Rubio deserve for the provision.\n\nAn Associated Press \u201cfact check\u201d earlier this month reported that rather than the \u201cfrontal assault\u201d Rubio\u2019s bill represented, what has worked to neutralize funding for the corridors was \u201can inside maneuver\u201d by other Republicans and their staffers that \u201crestricted the administration\u2019s legal authority to make payments to insurers under the program.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker also says Rubio has gone \u201cway too far\u201d in claiming credit.\n\nRubio\u2019s defenders, including in other publications, have fought back, saying it was Rubio who brought the issue to the fore \u2014 and that none of it would have happened without him.\n\nA New York Times story also gave Rubio the credit for the provision.\n\nJeff Sadosky, a spokesman for the PAC, said in an email Wednesday: \u201cGoing as far back as 2013, when Rubio introduced legislation addressing the issue, there\u2019s been only one candidate for president fighting the taxpayer-funded bailout of the insurance industry and showing the GOP the path to defeating Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much impact the disputed provision will have. The Associated Press questioned whether the risk corridors have been disabled permanently, saying the Obama administration intends to make payments with future revenues.\n\nThe Conservative Solutions ad is running statewide. Records filed with the Federal Election Commission say the PAC has purchased $1.2 million in television airtime, with most of the rest of its buy paying for digital ads.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | The Super PAC backing GOP presidential hopeful Marco Rubio is plunking down $1.4 million for television and digital ads in Iowa, and has begun airing a new spot", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "The Super PAC backing GOP presidential hopeful Marco Rubio is plunking down $1.4 million for television and digital ads in Iowa, and has begun airing a new spot arguing the Florida senator dealt a devastating blow to the Affordable Care Act.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/iowa-caucus/iowa-ads-tout-rubio-assault-on-obamacare-20151224", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20151224/ARTICLE/151229821/AR/0/AR-151229821.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/iowa-caucus/iowa-ads-tout-rubio-assault-on-obamacare-20151224", "description": "The Super PAC backing GOP presidential hopeful Marco Rubio is plunking down $1.4 million for television and digital ads in Iowa, and has begun airing a new spot arguing the Florida senator dealt a devastating blow to the Affordable Care Act.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Iowa ads tout Rubio assault on Obamacare"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2015-12-24T14:00:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2015-12-24T14:00:04-05:00", "title": "Iowa ads tout Rubio assault on Obamacare"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The Associated Press questioned whether the risk corridors have been disabled permanently, saying the Obama administration intends to make payments with future revenues.\nIn emails to supporters and on the campaign trail, Rubio has touted the claim that he scored a victory against the law.\nA New York Times story also gave Rubio the credit for the provision.\nThe question is, how much credit does Rubio deserve for the provision.\nNews reports by the Associated Press and Washington Post have questioned his claims of victory, giving most of the credit to others."}
