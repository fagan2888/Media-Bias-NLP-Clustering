And the tone of her current presidential campaign on illegal immigration is noticeably different from the one she conducted eight years ago.\n\n\u201cI want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others,\u201d Clinton said during Tuesday\u2019s debate, which was held at the Wynn hotel and casino.\n\n\u201cI want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she continued, though stopping short of saying that illegal aliens should be allowed to qualify for subsidies under Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s a marked shift from the position Clinton staked out in a previous attempt at health-care system overhaul.\n\n\u201cAs to illegal aliens, we agree with you that we do not think the comprehensive health-care benefits should be extended to those who are undocumented workers and illegal aliens,\u201d she said during a 1994 House hearing on the health-care reform proposal that she attempted to force into law as first lady, dubbed \u201cHillarycare.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\n\u201cWe do not want to do anything to encourage more illegal immigration into this country,\u201d Clinton said then, adding that \u201cwe know now that too many people come in for medical care, as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want them having the same benefits that American citizens are entitled to have.\u201d\n\nClinton also took a blanket stance against illegal immigration \u2014 and illegal immigrants themselves \u2014 as a U.S. Senator from New York.\n\nIn a February 2003 radio interview Clinton said that she was \u201cadamantly against illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly we\u2019ve got to do more at our borders,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cpeople have to stop employing illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome up to Westchester, go to Suffolk and Nassau counties,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cStand in the street corners in Brooklyn or the Bronx. You\u2019re going to see loads of people waiting to get picked up to get yard work, and construction work, and domestic work.\u201d (RELATED: Unearthed Audio: Hillary Says She\u2019s \u2018Adamantly Against\u2019 Illegal Immigrants)\n\nNotable in Clinton\u2019s shift on immigration is not just her changes on policy, but also what language she uses \u2014 and no longer uses \u2014 on the campaign trail.\n\nWhile Clinton has long called for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship, she historically included calls for a more robust border wall.\n\n\u201cA country that cannot control its borders is failing at one of its fundamental obligations,\u201d Clinton told the New York Daily News in 2006.\n\n\u201cThere is technology that would be in the fence that could spot people coming from 250 or 300 yards away and signal patrol agents who could respond,\u201d she continued, while suggesting that the U.S. could model its fence after the one protecting Israel on the West Bank.\n\nBut gone is that version of Clinton, whose comments on immigration reform rarely if ever include mention of improving physical barriers of entry into the U.S.\n\nClinton has also gone back-and-forth on providing driver\u2019s licenses for illegal aliens. As a presidential candidate in 2007, she initially said she backed the measure. But after coming under fire, she said she opposed it. Now, she supports it again, her campaign has said.\n\nPerhaps atoning for her restrictive stance on immigration \u2014 at least by current Democratic standards \u2014 Clinton has indicated that she hopes to go even farther to the left on the issue than Obama has during his presidency.\n\nWhen Clinton announced her immigration platform in May, she said that she would take executive action to provide amnesty to even more illegal aliens than President Obama has through his two unilateral efforts. More recently, Clinton even criticized the Obama administration \u2014 which she used to work under \u2014 for its overly \u201charsh\u201d deportation policies.\n\nOf course, it remains to be seen whether Clinton\u2019s flip-flops will hurt her with supporters of immigration reform. Two that TheDC interviewed in Las Vegas said that they care little about her past positions and believe she is sincere in her latest efforts.\n\nDulce Valencia, a 19-year-old immigration activist, told TheDC on Tuesday that while Clinton has changed positions on many immigration issues, she is encouraged that she is \u201creaching out to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s actively done a lot to engage DREAMers and to hear our issues,\u201d said Valencia, who was brought to the U.S. by her parents in 2007.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that that justifies her saying those things, but\u2026her views have changed, and she\u2019s done a lot to reach out to DREAMers and to the Latino community,\u201d Valencia continued, while noting that she has not yet endorsed a candidate.\n\nAnd in the spin room prior to Tuesday\u2019s debate, Clinton surrogate Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, said that Clinton\u2019s calls for additional executive action on amnesty has won her strong support in the Latino community.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has supported the DREAM Act before she ran for President. She supported comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Villaraigosa told TheDC. \u201cThere\u2019s no question where she stands on President Obama\u2019s executive action, in fact even going beyond it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you compare her to the other Democratic candidates and certainly to the candidates on the other side of the aisle, I think that there\u2019s no comparison,\u201d Villaraigosa continued. \u201cAt the end of the day, she\u2019s got a great deal of support in the Latino community, in no small part because of that track record.\u201d\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "Hillary Clinton changed her position on whether illegal aliens can be allowed to sign up for a federal health care law.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "LAS VEGAS --\u00a0Hillary Clinton's support\u00a0here Tuesday night for allowing illegal aliens to sign up for Obamacare marked the latest in a series of clear-cut flip-flops for the Democratic front-runner o", "title": "Hillary Unveils Latest Flip-Flop.
