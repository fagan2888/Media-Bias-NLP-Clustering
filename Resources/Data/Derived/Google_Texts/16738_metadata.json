Police Commissioner William Bratton said Thompson\u2019s browsing history included organized terror groups, beheadings and the shooting in Canada earlier this week that officials there have called a terrorist attack.\n\nThompson was not on any watch lists, and officials found no indication he sought any training or affiliation to any groups.\n\nBratton said investigators were trying to determine whether the attack was planned or spontaneous but believe Thompson was self-radicalized. His father told officials he converted to Islam about two years ago and was described as a \u201crecluse\u201d who had been depressed lately.\n\nBratton said he was comfortable calling it a terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cThis was a terrorist attack, certainly,\u201d Bratton said.\n\nBut he also stopped short of including the attack in the list of terror plots against the city since Sept. 11, 2001, saying the investigation was continuing.\n\nThompson, 32, had once served in the U.S. Navy and had a history of run-ins with the law over domestic violence in California in 2003 and 2004, police said. In recent postings on social media, he ranted about injustices in American society and oppression abroad, but the postings didn\u2019t point to any affiliation with a terror group or direct influence of radical Islam, they said.\n\nSecurity video and witness accounts appeared to leave no doubt that Thompson purposely targeted four rookie New York Police Department officers who were in uniform and on foot patrol in a bustling Queens commercial district.\n\nMoments before the attack, the bearded suspect was seen on a street corner crouching down to pull the hatchet out of backpack before he charged the officers and began swinging the hatchet with a two-handed grip, police said.\n\nAt the time, the officers were posing for a photo for a passerby. Without a word, Thompson swung at an officer who blocked the blow with his arm, police said. Another officer was hit in the back of the head and fell to the ground.\n\nAs the suspect raised the hatchet again, the two uninjured officers drew their weapons and fired several rounds, police said. The bullets killed the assailant and wounded a bystander, police said. A bloody hatchet, about 18 inches long, was recovered.\n\nOfficer Kenneth Healey remained hospitalized on Friday with a head wound. The bystander, a 29-year-old woman, also was being treated for a gunshot wound to the back. Both were critical.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York City police Commissioner William Bratton says the hatchet attack on four rookie officers was a terrorist act by a homegrown radical.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "New York City police Commissioner William Bratton says the hatchet attack on four rookie officers was a terrorist act by a homegrown radical.", "title": "NYC police commissioner: Hatchet attack was terror", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/24/nyc-police-commissioner-hatchet-attack-was-terror/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/23/04b1a557d2a66029630f6a706700e2f6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/23/04b1a557d2a66029630f6a706700e2f6.jpg", "description": "New York City police Commissioner William Bratton says the hatchet attack on four rookie officers was a terrorist act by a homegrown radical.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "NYC police commissioner: Hatchet attack was terror"}, "Author": "Tom Hays", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Thompson, William J Bratton"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c86\"", "article_summary": "Police Commissioner William Bratton said Thompson\u2019s browsing history included organized terror groups, beheadings and the shooting in Canada earlier this week that officials there have called a terrorist attack.\nBratton said he was comfortable calling it a terrorist attack.\n\u201cThis was a terrorist attack, certainly,\u201d Bratton said.\nBratton said investigators were trying to determine whether the attack was planned or spontaneous but believe Thompson was self-radicalized.\nAs the suspect raised the hatchet again, the two uninjured officers drew their weapons and fired several rounds, police said."}
