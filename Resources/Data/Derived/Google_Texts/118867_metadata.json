A new analysis by Citigroup healthcare analyst Carl McDonald offers new details on what consumers can expect by company.\n\nKaiser was among the most expensive health plans in 2014 and staggered to a fourth-place finish in exchange enrollment. Anthem Blue Cross was the leader statewide, followed by Blue Shield of California and Health Net Inc.\n\n\"Kaiser doesn\u2019t seem particularly happy with its exchange market share, as it is the only company reducing exchange premiums in 2015,\" McDonald said.\n\nRates for Anthem Blue Cross, a unit of industry giant WellPoint Inc., are going up 4.6%, on average, according to Citigroup.\n\nBlue Shield's increases are 6% statewide and Health Net is raising premiums by 4.9%.\n\nDespite those 2015 rates going in different directions, McDonald and other industry analysts are skeptical that Kaiser will gain much ground on its rivals. Even with the slight decrease, Kaiser's HMO remains one of the more expensive options.\n\n\"There isn't likely to be a material market share shift,\" McDonald said in his analyst report. \"Health Net\u2019s products stand out as being by far the cheapest.\"\n\nTake Los Angeles, for instance.\n\nIn region 15, for a 40-year-old buying a silver plan this year, Kaiser was the highest-priced coverage at $297 a month. That's before any federal premium subsidies based on a person's income.\n\nIn 2015, that same silver plan would cost $287 from Kaiser. That's still the second-highest price in L.A. behind an Anthem exclusive-provider-organization, or EPO, plan.\n\nNext year, Health Net's HMO remains the cheapest coverage on the silver tier in L.A. at $231 a month for a 40-year-old, up $7 from this year's premium.\n\nThose low rates made Health Net the market leader in L.A. with 33% market share, beating out Blue Shield and Anthem.\n\nThose three insurers and Kaiser together accounted for 94% of Covered California's initial enrollment of 1.4 million people under the Affordable Care Act. About 1.2 million actually completed the sign-up process and started paying their premiums, according to state estimates.\n\nThese rates are still subject to review by regulators before open enrollment for 2015 starts Nov. 15. The changes in premiums for each company also vary by region and the type of health plan.\n\nAmong the smaller, regional health plans, L.A. Care is boosting its HMO premiums by 11.3%, according to Citigroup research. That's the biggest percentage change for any insurer in the state.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Kaiser cuts Obamacare rates 1.4% for 2015; Anthem hikes rates 4.6%", "date": "2014-08-11", "Description": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california, kaiser", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente is lowering its rates for Obamacare coverage in California by 1.4% next year, according to an industry report.", "title": "Kaiser cuts Obamacare rates 1.4% for 2015; Anthem hikes rates 4.6%", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-california-rates-20140810-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53e86620/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-california-rates-20140810", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81051900", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde2f\"", "article_summary": "Despite those 2015 rates going in different directions, McDonald and other industry analysts are skeptical that Kaiser will gain much ground on its rivals.\nHealthcare giant Kaiser Permanente is lowering its rates for Obamacare coverage in California by 1.4% next year, according to an industry report.\nThose low rates made Health Net the market leader in L.A. with 33% market share, beating out Blue Shield and Anthem.\nRates for Anthem Blue Cross, a unit of industry giant WellPoint Inc., are going up 4.6%, on average, according to Citigroup.\nCalifornia's health insurance exchange recently announced that premiums were rising 4.2%, on average, statewide for 2015 policies."}
