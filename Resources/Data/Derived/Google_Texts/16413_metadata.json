Pro\u2019s Paul Demko tried to track down who\u2019s advising Trump on health care. Here\u2019s a list of confirmed health policy advisers:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nEven though Trump\u2019s shut them out so far, wonks of all ideological stripes say they\u2019re willing to be locked in that room if a President Trump should summon them someday and say, \u201cYou\u2019re hired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as he provides food, and toilets,\u201d said Timothy Jost, professor emeritus at Washington and Lee University School of Law, and an ACA supporter. More from Paul: http://politi.co/1KCeTTT\n\nTRUMP DISSES MANDATE \u2014 AND OTHER REPUBLICANS' STANCE ON HEALTH CARE, TOO. Trump says he wasn't endorsing the ACA individual mandate at last week\u2019s CNN town hall when he said \u201cI like the mandate.\"\n\n\u201cThere's no mandate, no mandatory anything\u201d in his health plan, Trump told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday. \u201cWe were talking over each other \u2026 It was my fault.\u201d\n\nBut Trump also said that Republicans need to stop bashing national health coverage. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem with the Republicans,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cSomehow they got fed into this horrible position\u201d where they\u2019re against coverage expansion.\n\nCruz keeps trying to link Trump with Clinton on health care \u2014 \u201cI think if we nominate a candidate that has the same record as Hillary Clinton on partial birth abortion, the same record as Hillary Clinton on Obamacare and socialized medicine \u2026 I don't think that's a path to victory,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz said on CNN on Sunday.\n\n\u2014 But one Cruz delegate says Ted\u2019s wrong on health care. Steven Tucker, a health insurance broker and Tea Party activist who\u2019s on the Cruz Illinois leadership team and delegate slate, says he\u2019s fed up with the senator\u2019s claims on Trump\u2019s health care plan.\n\n\"He's actually still repeating a lie that Trump is for single-payer and socialized medicine and a plan that's exactly like Sanders and Hillary, which is a lie,\u201d Tucker told the Washington Examiner. \u201cI wish that [Cruz] would stop that and correct the record,\" he added, saying that he remains a Cruz supporter.\n\nNEVADA: CLINTON WINS HEALTH CARE VOTE \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory in Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses was partly because she was perceived as the better candidate on health care. Overall, about 23 percent of caucus-goers said that health care was the most important issue facing the country; Clinton won about six in 10 of these voters.\n\nWELCOME TO MONDAY PULSE \u2014 The field is slimming. Candidates are dropping out. A crucial decision looms. Of course, I\u2019m talking about The Bachelor \u2014 America\u2019s second-most important competition. Think you know the outcome of tonight\u2019s big matchup? Send tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nFDA VOTE TODAY - This isn\u2019t the story we\u2019re used to hearing: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is propelling a White House nominee right through opposition from at least three Democrats and one member of his own party.\n\nA procedural vote on Robert Califf as FDA commissioner is set for late Monday. That sets up his confirmation by Wednesday \u2014 or maybe sooner. It shows just how badly the regulated industries want a confirmed leader at the top of the agency.\n\n\u2014 Not everyone's on board: Four senators \u2014 Kelly Ayotte, Joe Manchin, Ed Markey and Bernie Sanders \u2014 have placed holds on Califf, who started out with an easy path toward confirmation but faced delays and opposition largely because of the growing opioid crisis. And at 12:30 p.m. today, Manchin and Markey will air their grievances, which Califf hasn\u2019t satisfied despite rolling out FDA\u2019s opioids \u201caction plan\u201d this month.\n\nCMS PROPOSES 1.35 PERCENT HIKE TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE \u2014 That\u2019s according to guidance issued by CMS on Friday. The administration also is proposing a \"coding trend\" to account for discrepancies with the traditional fee-for-service program. CMS estimates that when that measure is factored in, the actual increase in payments to plans will be 3.55 percent.\n\n\u2014 What\u2019s next: We\u2019re now into the 45-day notice period, and comments are due to CMS by March 4. And remember: Proposed rates aren\u2019t necessarily indicative of final numbers. Last year, CMS initially proposed a 1.7 percent MA rate hike; the final bump came in at 4.2 percent.\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

Two last-ditch amendments failed in the state senate on Friday, effectively ending hopes of expanding the program this year. The Wyoming Tribune-Eagle notes that the same legislators have spent several years making the same arguments for and against the program \u2014 although support is continuing to build. For instance, the Republican chair of the state senate appropriations committee says that he now believes that Medicaid expansion will reduce the state\u2019s deficit.\n\n\u2014 States that could still enact Medicaid expansion this year? A handful of legislatures, including Idaho, Missouri, and Utah, may still consider expansion bills.\n\nFIRST IN PULSE: EXPERTS CALL FOR MAJOR CHANGES TO LONG-TERM INSURANCE, MEDICAID \u2014 The Long-Term Care Financing Collaborative this morning will release its proposal for new ways to pay for long-term supports and services.\n\nThe collaborative \u2014 which includes Harvard\u2019s Sheila Burke, Brookings\u2019 Stuart Butler, and the Urban Institute\u2019s Howard Gleckman \u2014 will lay out their ideas about revitalizing the private long-term care insurance market, modernizing Medicaid's safety net, and moving toward catastrophic protection for all.

Peter Shumlin says that like Bernie Sanders, he still wants a single-payer health care system for the nation. But it isn't translating into a presidential endorsement for his home state senator. He's endorsed Hillary Clinton, Pro\u2019s Rachana Pradhan reports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also a realist,\u201d Shumlin said during Politico\u2019s State Solutions conference on Friday. \u201cDo I think this Congress is going to adopt a single-payer health care system? The answer\u2019s no.\u201d Shumlin's with Clinton, who\u2019s been attacking Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan as an unrealistic fantasy. But Shumlin dismissed that characterization, saying that Clinton and Sanders have had a \u201crespectful conversation\u201d about differences in their policy views.\n\nGOVS WANT GUIDELINES FOR OPIOID PRESCRIBING \u2014 Governors at the National Governors Association winter meeting this weekend voted to create standard guidelines for prescribing opioids as part of a nationwide effort to combat the prescription drug abuse epidemic, Pro\u2019s Brianna Ehley reports.\n\nShumlin proposed the idea during a panel on opioid abuse. \"We agree on this stuff so why wouldn\u2019t we say we\u2019re going to put together prescribing protocols for every state. Let\u2019s figure it out,\" he said. The NGA health committee is expected to come up with opioid prescribing guidance and the full NGA will vote on it at their summer meeting.\n\nHIGHMARK TO CUT DOCTORS' PAY FOR OBAMACARE PATIENTS \u2014 The Pennsylvania-based health plan, which says it lost about $500 million on Obamacare exchange plans last year, will reduce payment rates to participating physicians by 4.5 percent.\n\nHighmark says the move helps ensure that the exchanges remain a viable investment. But the executive director of the Allegheny County Medical Society told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that the pay cut could force doctors to set quotas for how many patients they cover.\n\nKASICH OFFICIALLY CUTS FUNDS FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD \u2014 Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Sunday signed a bill that would redirect about $1.3 million that Planned Parenthood currently receives from Ohio's health department. The move isn\u2019t a surprise, but it\u2019s another reminder that Kasich \u2014 despite the perception that he\u2019s the most pragmatic candidate left in the GOP presidential race \u2014 is no moderate when it comes to abortion.\n\n\u2014 But the bill might not take effect. Planned Parenthood has successfully fought other states\u2019 efforts to defund the organization, and it\u2019s expected to do the same in Ohio.\n\nVIDEOMAKER SAYS HE\u2019S GOT MORE FOOTAGE OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD \u2014 David Daleiden, the 26-year-old activist who\u2019s released a series of Planned Parenthood sting videos, tells the Washington Examiner\u2019s Paige Cunningham that he\u2019s still got \u201cplenty of unreleased footage,\u201d some of which is currently under court order.\n\nDaleiden \u2014 who\u2019s facing felony charges for the undercover videos \u2014 says that his \u201cbiggest goal\u201d was to get the public talking about Planned Parenthood\u2019s role in procuring fetal tissue. \u201cIt had been 15 years since the last time the trafficking of aborted fetal tissue had been in the news or had been a major topic in public discourse,\u201d he told the Examiner. http://washex.am/1Qv0ift\n\nDID PLANNED PARENTHOOD REPORT COST RESEARCHER HIS JOB? \u2014 Rick Allgeyer, director of research at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, helped author a report that implied that Texas\u2019 restrictions on Planned Parenthood were leading to a spike in the state\u2019s birth rate. The study appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in early February and sparked political controversy; last week, the Texas Tribune reported that Allgeyer would be stepping down.\n\nAllgeyer also faced disciplinary action for working on the study on taxpayer time, according to an agency spokesperson.\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF OPIOID-INDUCED CONSTIPATION MAN \u2014 What it\u2019s like to be the butt of a Super Bowl commercial.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
