Terry McAuliffe vetoed six Republican redistricting bills live on his monthly call-in radio show Thursday, then took the highly unusual step of signing the budget plan produced by Virginia\u2019s GOP-led legislature without a single amendment.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s actions came one day before the Democrat is expected to announce vetoes on a raft of Republican legislation turning on political flashpoints such as guns, home schooling, \u201cliving wage\u201d rules and the limits of federal power.\n\nTaken together, the moves seem intended to project twin images of McAuliffe, as both bipartisan dealmaker and stalwart defender of certain liberal causes. They also reflect the political reality that McAuliffe faces, with Republicans fully in control of both House and Senate. With his top campaign promise, to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, out of reach given the present configuration of the legislature, McAuliffe has abandoned the high-stakes budget brinkmanship that brought the commonwealth to the edge of a government shutdown last year.\n\nBy coming together quickly on a budget that contains no new taxes or fees, gives raises to teachers and state employees, provides health care to Virginians with severe mental illnesses and stashes away extra millions in the state\u2019s rainy-day fund, McAuliffe and Republican legislative leaders can make the case that Richmond can govern in ways that Washington cannot. Making note of the across-the-board federal spending cuts that are a symbol of congressional dysfunction and a threat to Virginia\u2019s defense-heavy economy, McAuliffe said sequestration had spurred the state\u2019s leaders to put partisanship aside.\n\n\u201cWe all know we do face tremendous cuts to defense with sequestration,\u201d McAuliffe, flanked by Republican budget leaders from the House and Senate, said in a bill-signing ceremony in the Capitol. \u201cThe debate has already begun up in Washington. But I think the actions that we\u2019ve taken here have prepared us for whatever they\u2019re gonna throw at us. We have a balanced budget, sustainable budget.\u201d\n\nWith his signature, McAuliffe became the first governor since James S. Gilmore III (R) in 1998 to agree to a budget without any tinkering. Gilmore was then in the first year of his term \u2014 and he was signing a budget that had been introduced by the outgoing governor of his own party, George F. Allen (R). You have to go back to 1989 and then-Gov. Gerald L. Baliles (D) to find another governor who had at least a year under his belt and was willing to take a budget without proposing amendments or exercising his line-item veto, said Robert Vaughn, staff director for the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nHours earlier, McAuliffe found a flamboyant way to make his first vetoes of the year\u2019s legislative session \u2014 on live radio. And on Friday, McAuliffe is expected to announce vetoes of about a dozen other bills, all sponsored by Republicans. They include legislation intended to allow home-schooled students to play public school sports, tighten restrictions on voting, loosen them on guns, reject Common Core educational standards and undermine local \u201cliving wage\u201d rules, several people with knowledge of his plans said.\n\nBy flexing his veto muscle while also seeming unusually conciliatory on the budget, McAuliffe reprises the balancing act he attempted as a candidate, when he ran for office promising to reach across the aisle while also vowing to be a \u201cbrick wall\u201d against Republican efforts to restrict abortion rights, said Bob Holsworth, a former Virginia Commonwealth University political scientist.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s decided that he\u2019s trying to position himself as someone who\u2019s bipartisan on economic issues, particularly on anything related to trying to reinvigorate Virginia\u2019s economy . . . and at the same time promote Democratic priorities on social issues,\u201d Holsworth said.\n\nThe redistricting bills would have made changes to the General Assembly district boundaries outside of the constitutionally mandated once-a-decade statewide redistricting process. With no prior notice, McAuliffe vetoed the bills while on air at Richmond\u2019s radio station WRVA (1140 AM and 98.5 FM), using the host\u2019s pen.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t think these bills are constitutional,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cI like nonpartisan redistricting, but what I won\u2019t stand for is to allow every two years you get to redraw lines and add certain voters to your district and take certain voters out. I just think that is wrong.\u201d\n\n[Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe expected to veto about 20 bills]\n\nThose vetoes came the day after the U.S. Supreme Court told a lower court to reconsider whether a redistricting plan drawn by Alabama\u2019s Republican-led legislature packed minority voters into districts to dilute their influence elsewhere.\n\nThe case is similar to one in Virginia challenging a dozen House of Delegates districts and another that deemed the commonwealth\u2019s congressional map unconstitutional for diluting the influence of African American voters.\n\nThe redistricting bills that McAuliffe vetoed would have made what lawmakers call \u201ctechnical amendments\u201d to state House and Senate lines.\n\nThe bills include one proposed by Sen. Bryce E. Reeves (R-Spotsylvania) that would have made his district more Republican \u2014 and safer for him \u2014 as he faces a Democratic challenger this year. The measure would have traded precincts with a neighboring district represented by Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D), giving Deeds a heavily Democratic precinct and Reeves a Republican one. Reeves denied a political motive.\n\nSuch bills often raise eyebrows because of the partisan nature of redistricting. Over the years, maps have been drawn with heavy concentrations of Democrats and Republicans to protect longtime lawmakers from election challenges.\n\nThat process, in turn, tends to attract candidates who appeal to the extremes of their parties. Where a district is heavily Republican, a more conservative candidate is more likely to win than in an evenly divided district; similarly, a deeply blue district is more likely to elect a very liberal Democrat.\n\nAdvocates for nonpartisan redistricting regularly blame the process for the gridlock and polarization that has increased in recent years in Richmond \u2014 and Washington. A raft of bills intended to reduce the influence of politics on the process died in the Republican-dominated House of Delegates during the recent Virginia legislative session.\n\nIn 2013, Senate Republicans took advantage of the absence of then-Sen. Henry L. Marsh III, who was attending President Obama\u2019s inauguration, to pass \u201ctechnical amendments\u201d that could have handed the GOP control of that chamber for decades.\n\nHouse Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) killed the map, but ever since, Democrats have ramped up their opposition to such amendments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Calling them unconstitutional, the Virginia governor killed the measures live on the radio.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Calling them unconstitutional, the Virginia governor killed the measures live on the radio.", "title": "McAuliffe vetoes six redistricting bills", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-vetoes-six-redistricting-bills/2015/03/26/f38886fc-d3b9-11e4-ab77-9646eea6a4c7_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/26/Local-Politics/Images/End_of_Session-0f689-612.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "vapolitics, redistricting, Terry McAuliffe", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "f38886fc-d3b9-11e4-ab77-9646eea6a4c7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "vapolitics, redistricting, Terry McAuliffe"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7cdd\"", "article_summary": "The redistricting bills that McAuliffe vetoed would have made what lawmakers call \u201ctechnical amendments\u201d to state House and Senate lines.\nThe redistricting bills would have made changes to the General Assembly district boundaries outside of the constitutionally mandated once-a-decade statewide redistricting process.\nAnd on Friday, McAuliffe is expected to announce vetoes of about a dozen other bills, all sponsored by Republicans.\nTerry McAuliffe vetoed six Republican redistricting bills live on his monthly call-in radio show Thursday, then took the highly unusual step of signing the budget plan produced by Virginia\u2019s GOP-led legislature without a single amendment.\nHours earlier, McAuliffe found a flamboyant way to make his first vetoes of the year\u2019s legislative session \u2014 on live radio."}
