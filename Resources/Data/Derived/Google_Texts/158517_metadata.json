Silly humans. Often this stereotyping manifests itself in what's called \"skin tone memory bias,\" or, in the common tongue, racism.\n\nFor all their academic euphemisms, the psychologists on a new study in the Journal Sage Open, are not aliens. But they do cooly describe the way subjects implicitly associate \"ignorance\" with dark skin tone, and \"education\" with light skin tone.\n\nThe students tested at San Francisco State University were shown words like \"ignorant\" and \"educated\" for 33 milliseconds. These subliminal prompts are part of a phenomenon known as priming, a manipulation by researchers that preps participants' minds for a given experiment. After the subliminal word, they saw a picture of a black man.\n\nPriming is a powerful tool for psychologists. Basically, simple words or cues activate semantic networks in the brain and make the ideas connected to that semantic network easier to access. The effect is commonly illustrated by a simple experiment: When a researcher hands a person a cup of warm water, they're more likely to describe someone as being warm or friendly. In flashing the word \"ignorance\" before their participant's eyes, the psychologists make everything with an \"ignorance\" association in their participant's mind all the more accessible.\n\nWhat they found was this: The students primed with \"educated\" were more likely to rate the black man's skin tone as lighter on a memory test later. \"Black individuals who defy social stereotypes might not challenge social norms sufficiently but rather may be remembered as lighter, perpetuating status quo beliefs,\" the authors summarize. That is, when primed to think of a \"black person\" and \"educated\" in the same mental space, the black person becomes whiter. The stereotype distorts the memory.\n\nThe researchers elaborate:\n\nWhereas encountering a Black individual after being primed with the word educated might pose a challenge to existing beliefs, encountering a Black individual after being primed with the word ignorant would likely not require resolution or a misremembering of skin tone to align with these beliefs.\n\nThe effects of skin bias have real consequences: The \"more black\" a person appears, the more they are likely to be sentenced to death (in an experiment). In the real world, darker-skinned women were found to spend more time in jail.\n\nNow, it's unfair to label this study's participants as outright racists. Just because a subliminal cue changes their perceptions of a person doesn't mean those perceptions change the way they might engage with or treat that person in the real world. What the study does show is that these connections exist, and they can subtly change our behavior without us ever knowing it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research participants remembered &#39;educated&#39; black men as having a lighter skin tone.", "author": "Brian Resnick", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Research participants remembered &#39;educated&#39; black men as having a lighter skin tone.", "title": "Study: People Associate 'Education' With Lighter Skin", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/RTR33T8I_2/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/01/study-people-associate-education-with-lighter-skin/283086/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But they do cooly describe the way subjects implicitly associate \"ignorance\" with dark skin tone, and \"education\" with light skin tone.\nOften this stereotyping manifests itself in what's called \"skin tone memory bias,\" or, in the common tongue, racism.\nThat is, when primed to think of a \"black person\" and \"educated\" in the same mental space, the black person becomes whiter.\nWhat they found was this: The students primed with \"educated\" were more likely to rate the black man's skin tone as lighter on a memory test later.\nFor all their academic euphemisms, the psychologists on a new study in the Journal Sage Open, are not aliens."}
