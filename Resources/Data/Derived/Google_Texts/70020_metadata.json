Annual sales growth for EHOB\u2019s wound-preventing surfaces for hospital beds has come down to 5 percent from roughly 10 percent as recently as 2012. In the next two years, it expects growth of less than 4 percent a year.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s one reason EHOB is bulking up its presence overseas. It has hired additional sales representatives in Europe the past few years. And in May, it opened its first office in China.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are seeing some great opportunities really starting to pile up in the last 10 to 12 months, a lot of interest from a lot of government entities in China and Europe,\u201d said President Scott Rogers. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty tough [in the U.S.] the last couple years.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, the future of Indiana\u2019s medical-device companies is increasingly overseas.\n\n\n\nWith growth hampered domestically for a host of reasons, device companies have turned to Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s true for both small and large companies. Bloomington-based Cook Group, which has roughly $2 billion in revenue, has grown its foreign sales from 50 percent of its total five years ago to 60 percent today.\n\n\n\nBatesville-based Hill-Rom Holdings Inc. is looking to both buy and build a larger foreign operation as U.S. sales of its hospital beds shrink.\n\n\n\nWarsaw-based OrthoPediatrics Corp., founded in 2007, pulls in a third of its nearly $30 million in annual revenue from overseas\u2014and it hasn\u2019t even tapped the lucrative Chinese market.\n\n\n\nSafis Solutions, a small consulting firm in Indianapolis, launched a China division two years ago to help device makers navigate the uncertain waters of that can\u2019t-miss market.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not that much growth left in the U.S.,\u201d said John Nadelin, Safis vice president of regulatory and compliance.\n\n\n\nMedical-device companies face a litany of domestic challenges.\n\n\n\nMakers of surgical implants and equipment have suffered the past five years as out-of-work Americans delayed elective procedures. Even those with jobs saw deductibles on their health insurance shoot up, causing them to put off some health care.\n\n\n\nSince President Obama\u2019s health reform passed in 2010, hospitals have been under intense pressure from the federal government and employers to cut costs. One of their first strategies has been to centralize purchasing of medical supplies, and push device makers for 20-percent price cuts, noted EHOB\u2019s Rogers.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, medical-device makers say the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has pushed up costs by requiring more studies of products before they\u2019re approved. For that reason, companies often find it easier to get approval in Europe first and then use the sales to sustain them while they await FDA approval.\n\n\n\nDevice companies also must pay two new fees in the United States. The Obamacare excise tax\u20142.3 percent of revenue\u2014kicked in Jan. 1, 2013. Later that year, the FDA also required device companies to place a unique identifying code on each product, raising costs again.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt makes it hard to compete with companies operating in lower-tax countries,\u201d Cook Medical President Pete Yonkman wrote in an email, citing both the Obamacare excise tax as well as U.S. corporate tax rates\u2014the highest among developed countries.\n\n\n\nThe issues have chased investors into other sectors and caused medical-device companies to resort to mergers to reduce costs.\n\n\n\nPete Kissinger, a serial entrepreneur in West Lafayette, is trying to raise money to fund a new company called Phlebotics, which has developed computer-operated blood-monitoring devices for hospitals. He said U.S. device makers are both pushed and pulled into overseas markets.\n\n\n\n\u201cAsia is not to be missed, and our government has been discouraging bold steps by thinking negative, scaring away capital and talking of taxing success,\u201d Kissinger wrote in an email.\n\n\n\nMedical-device companies have kept their average 25-percent profit margins steady the past four years by trimming costs, according to an Oct. 20 report by management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. But trimming has its limits. By 2020, Kearney predicted, profit margins will have shrunk across the industry to 16 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cCompanies will no longer be able to earn premium margins by simply selling clinical features and new devices into established market spaces. Rather, they will need to look at new segments,\u201d Kearney consultants Dave Powell, Oliver Scheel and Bill Tribe wrote.\n\n\n\nSeeking sales\n\n\n\nHill-Rom, the hospital-bed maker, is seeking to do exactly what Kearney advocates. It is building new businesses in surgical and respiratory products while looking to grow in emerging markets.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why: Hill-Rom\u2019s U.S. sales for the nine months ended June 30 were 10 percent less than in same period in 2012, the year before the Obamacare tax on devices and cuts to hospital reimbursement took effect.\n\n\n\nDuring the same two years, Hill-Rom\u2019s international sales inched up 1 percent.\n\n\n\nIn June, Hill-Rom announced it would spend $250 million to acquire Germany-based Trumpf Medical, in large part because about a third of Trumpf sales are in such emerging markets as Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.\n\n\n\nCEO John Greisch said during the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference for investors in September that Hill-Rom in the past year also launched a bed \u201cmore focused on the price points\u201d of the emerging markets and invested \u201cpretty significantly in feet on the street\u201d in many foreign regions.\n\n\n\nZimmer Holdings Inc.\u2019s sales in Europe and Asia were 5.5 percent higher in the first half of this year than in the first half of 2012 after adjusting for fluctuating foreign exchange rates.\n\n\n\nThat growth was more than twice as fast as the 2.4-percent rise in sales from the Americas division of the Warsaw-based company.\n\n\n\nSales from Europe and Asia accounted for 46 percent of Zimmer\u2019s total first-half sales of nearly $2.4 billion.\n\n\n\nBiomet Inc., which Zimmer is acquiring, has seen better U.S. sales growth than Zimmer in recent years, but its foreign sales have still been growing faster than its domestic sales.\n\n\n\nGetting a bigger foothold in emerging markets was one of the reasons Zimmer gave for its $13.4 billion purchase of Biomet, which is pending regulators\u2019 approval.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will also benefit from strengthening our presence in emerging markets and an expanded portfolio that covers upper and lower joints, which will position us to grow our extremities and trauma business going forward,\u201d Zimmer Chief Financial Officer Jim Crines told investors and analysts when the deal was announced April 24.\n\n\n\nBoth Zimmer and Biomet have been shifting manufacturing and sales resources to focus more on foreign markets\u2014in no small part due to the Obamacare excise tax on medical devices.\n\n\n\nFor OrthoPediatrics, a much smaller orthopedics company, the faster growth of foreign markets has been the biggest reason it has expanded there, with U.S. concerns playing a secondary role, said CEO Mark Throdahl.\n\n\n\nOrthoPediatrics developed a global strategy three to four years ago. In May, the company raised $39 million to build out its presence around the world.\n\n\n\nSales in its foreign markets are growing 40 percent to 50 percent per year, Throdahl said, while U.S. sales have grown half as fast.\n\n\n\nStill, the U.S. medical-device tax hasn\u2019t helped. OrthoPediatrics paid $300,000 last year in tax. But since the company still isn\u2019t quite to a break-even point, it could pay that bill only by holding back on other expenses.\n\n\n\nThrodahl said OrthoPediatrics would have added three or four more engineers to its nine-person product development team if it hadn\u2019t had to pay the tax.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very painful burden to have to bear, especially for a company that has no profit stream from which it can be paid,\u201d Throdahl said.\n\n\n\nTroubles in translation\n\n\n\nForeign markets are not for the faint of heart. Languages are different. Regulations for getting products approved are different\u2014and in emerging markets, not always consistent. And protections of intellectual property can be different.\n\n\n\nCook Group, for example, sees look-alike versions of its arterial stents sold routinely in China\u2014even though they do not have the special treatments of the metal Cook uses to make its products function.\n\n\n\nHill-Rom wants to build its presence in China, but even though the middle class has ballooned, it still doesn\u2019t have the same kind of money to spend as U.S. customers do. As a result, Hill-Rom hasn\u2019t figured out a way to sell its high-end hospital beds there profitably to the vast majority of hospitals.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe price point that we\u2019ve got with our products only is of interest to a very small percentage of the expansion that\u2019s going on in China, and I\u2019m not going to chase volume in those markets at the expense of margins,\u201d said Greisch, the CEO. \u201cAnd for us to compete in what I call the mass bed market in China, we\u2019re not going to do it. We just can\u2019t do it profitably.\u201d\n\n\n\nEHOB, the maker of hospital-bed surfaces, has spent four years building its presence in China, including training more than 15,000 nurses in wound care. But it has little to show for it yet.\n\n\n\nRogers, EHOB\u2019s president, acknowledged that it will take years just to boost overseas revenue from 5 percent to 10 percent of its overall sales.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like a 10-year plan for us,\u201d he said.\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like many small medical-device makers, Indianapolis-based EHOB Inc. derives nearly all its business from North America\u201495 percent of its revenue comes from the United States and Canada.
