Two years ago it was the surprise release of a Beyonc\u00e9 album. Last year it was, of course, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and all its accompanying #squadgoals that permeated the zeitgeist.\n\nThis year, the release of Adele\u2019s \u201c25\u201d may very well break album sales records that have stood since the pre-digital age.\n\nRelated: Jetpacks, Spying TVs, and the Post-Apocalypse: The Future is Now\n\nAdele is, in some ways, a surprising savior for the music business. She doesn\u2019t quite have the same star wattage as Beyonc\u00e9 or the weird cult of Taylor. Instead, the record-setting triumph of \u201c25\u201d basically comes down to talent, style and cunning strategy \u2014 plus, anticipation built up over Adele\u2019s lengthy sabbatical after the huge success of her last album.\n\nAdele\u2019s first album, \u201c19,\u201d was a moderate success in 2008 (when the bottom had only just begun to fall out on the industry), going seven times platinum and putting the singer on the map. But it was 2011\u2019s \u201c21\u201d that made her a phenomenon, channeling heartbreak into 30 million copies sold. Since then, the singer\u2019s only output was 2012\u2019s James Bond anthem \u201cSkyfall,\u201d until the release of the \u201cHello\u201d single last month.\n\nThat helps explain why \u201cHello\u201d instantly topped the charts in 28 countries, including the U.S. and her native U.K., and became the first single to sell 1 million downloads on release week.\n\nBut years of anticipation isn\u2019t the only reason analysts are so bullish on the prospects for Adele to shatter records. Adele\u2019s choice of genre also gives her some advantages.\n\nRelated: Star Wars: Everything You Wanted to Know but Were Afraid to Ask\n\nOnly two albums have even gone platinum in 2015: \u201c1989,\u201d which was released last year, and Drake\u2019s \u201cIf You\u2019re Reading This, It\u2019s Too Late,\u201d which took six months to reach the benchmark. Unlike Beyonc\u00e9 and Drake\u2019s obvious debts to hip-hop and soul or Swift\u2019s country-girl-gone-teen-pop act, Adele\u2019s torch-song style is just as appealing to wistful boomers as it is to lovelorn teens. And boomers still buy records. You know, actual physical items. In fact, in 2015 boomer icons with little crossover appeal like James Taylor and Don Henley were able to have No. 1 albums, a feat unthinkable as little as five years ago.\n\nIf boomers and gen Xers are still buying music because it\u2019s what they\u2019ve always done, millennials and whatever it is we\u2019re calling the teenagers that follow them will have no choice if they want to hear \u201c25.\u201d Adele, like Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, has decided to not allow her album to go to streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify. Analysts are predicting 1.5 million physical CD sales in the first week alone. Factor in iTunes and digital pre-sales and there is every indication that Adele\u2019s new album will break the 2.5 million sales record held by N\u2019Sync\u2019s \u201cNo Strings Attached\u201d from 2000.\n\nWhile this will certainly not address the industry\u2019s larger challenges with these services, it will at least allow the industry to celebrate another end-of-year smash. And for as long as Adele tops the charts and continues to set records, the industry can again hide its head in the sand and pretend that everything is ok.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For the past few years, the music industry has relied on a sort of Christmas miracle,", "title": "Why Adele\u2019s '25' Could Be the Music Industry\u2019s Best Hope", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/20/Why-Adele-s-25-Could-Be-Music-Industry-s-Best-Hope", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11202015_Adele.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/20/Why-Adele-s-25-Could-Be-Music-Industry-s-Best-Hope", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11202015_Adele.JPG", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For the past few years, the music industry has relied on a sort of Christmas miracle,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "This year, the release of Adele\u2019s \u201c25\u201d may very well break album sales records that have stood since the pre-digital age.\nFactor in iTunes and digital pre-sales and there is every indication that Adele\u2019s new album will break the 2.5 million sales record held by N\u2019Sync\u2019s \u201cNo Strings Attached\u201d from 2000.\nTwo years ago it was the surprise release of a Beyonc\u00e9 album.\nRelated: Jetpacks, Spying TVs, and the Post-Apocalypse: The Future is NowAdele is, in some ways, a surprising savior for the music business.\nInstead, the record-setting triumph of \u201c25\u201d basically comes down to talent, style and cunning strategy \u2014 plus, anticipation built up over Adele\u2019s lengthy sabbatical after the huge success of her last album."}
