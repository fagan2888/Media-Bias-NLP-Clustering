On Tuesday, Day 3.]\n\n[Click here for a gallery of photos from the series.]\n\n\u201cCan I tell you the whole story?\u201d asked Alonso Camarena while lying in an emergency room bed at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.\n\nDr. Chris Flynn took a seat beside the man, who was covered by a thin hospital gown and blanket, and leaned in closer.\n\n| Santa Barbara County's Safety Net | About This Series |\n\nCamarena was about to share a plight that is all too common for uninsured patients in Santa Barbara County.\n\nHe had finally come to the ER that afternoon because he was in too much pain to ignore.\n\nAs Flynn examined his distended stomach, Camarena explained that he has worked at a Carpinteria motel for almost a decade, but doesn\u2019t have health insurance because his employer doesn\u2019t offer benefits.\n\nPrimary care, even for basic check-ups, was out of the question for Camarena, who was wincing from the pressure of the doctor\u2019s touch.\n\nAbout two years ago, the only other time Camarena came into the hospital, was when they found it.\n\nA tumor.\n\nCamarena had surgery that removed some of the mass, but not all of it. He had to return to work instead of focusing on his health.\n\n\u201cI have a son, and I needed to pay child support,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just quit my job.\u201d\n\nWhen he came into the ER this time, Camarena was given pain killers and told to rest until he could be admitted to the hospital for treatment.\n\nFlynn pulled the curtain behind him as he left the room to look at some scans of Camarena in his office.\n\nA scan of the man\u2019s abdomen showed a menacing black mass in the middle of his body.\n\nAt this point, Camarena\u2019s liver is three times the organ\u2019s normal size.\n\nHe has a rare form of cancer that can be caused by environmental exposure to compounds such as asbestos, said Flynn, who added that the case is typical of local uninsured patients.\n\nMany men and women over the age of 26 don\u2019t qualify for any type of public insurance such as Medi-Cal, and can\u2019t afford private health plans, so they forego it altogether.\n\nFlynn, an experienced emergency medicine doctor, sees it all the time.\n\nAbout 5 percent of Cottage Hospital's 43,000 ER patients per year have no way to pay, and those numbers are even larger in the North County.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all taking a gamble,\u201d Flynn said, looking over Camarena\u2019s charts. \u201cIt\u2019s all really good until it gets really bad.\u201d\n\nWhen he sees patients forsake medical care until an illness is so advanced that treatment may not help, he gets angry.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Flynn said of his latest patient. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get the chance to fight this cancer when the odds were in his favor.\u201d\n\nGetting insurance coverage for these people is a big part of the federal health-care reform, which goes into effect Jan. 1.\n\nPreparing for the sweeping changes with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is challenging, said Liz Snyder, deputy director of primary care for the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department.\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t lose sight of how incredible this is,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is history. This is an incredible time.\u201d\n\nThere are major components to the federal reforms: individual mandates for most taxpayers, making more people eligible for insurance coverage through Medi-Cal expansions and the state exchange, and changing the care model to focus more on preventative, ongoing care for patients.\n\nThrough the Medi-Cal expansion, CenCal Health, the local administrator of Medi-Cal, expects 30,000 more people to enroll during the first 18 months of the Affordable Care Act between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. That\u2019s a 30 percent increase, CenCal CEO Bob Freeman said.\n\nCounties are taking the lead to get people signed up for Medi-Cal, since county agencies are the ones that determine whether someone is eligible, he said.\n\nExpanding eligibility will apply to thousands of county residents, and even more will be eligible for subsidies on the state insurance exchange, Covered California.\n\nThe exchange has plans from private insurance companies for pre-determined prices, but the California Department of Insurance has no control over the rates, at least for now.\n\nPeople who earn below $44,000, or $94,000 for a family of four, can receive subsidies for their insurance plans, but residents at every income level can buy a plan through the exchange.\n\nFor Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties, there are plans on the exchange from Anthem PPO, Blue Shield PPO, Kaiser Permanente HMO and Ventura County Health Plan HMO.\n\nRealistically, however, only two options are available for most local residents since there are no Kaiser providers serving Santa Barbara County and only Ventura County employees can sign up for the county health plan HMO.\n\nCovered California expects 95,000 people in the tri-counties to be eligible for subsidies and there will be five levels of coverage plans. Prices are based on a person\u2019s age, income and family size.\n\nMany newly eligible people could already be patients with the county clinics, but they may not be coming in regularly for preventative or ongoing care, said Dr. Takashi, Wada, director of the Public Health Department.\n\nIf people have insurance for the first time in 10 years, or ever, they could require a huge amount of care and referrals, which will severely tax the health-care system until it stabilizes, he said.\n\nPatients of the county often need more complex care, as well, with five to 10 different health issues because of the effects of poverty and stressors associated with that.\n\n\u201cDown the road I think it will be a lot better, but that first year is going to be a huge challenge for the whole system,\u201d Wada said.\n\nThe Public Health Department\u2019s eight clinics serve 31,000 patients a year, with about 120,000 visits.\n\nAs of now, 25 percent to 35 percent of Public Health Department patients have no insurance, and that population includes a lot of working poor people, many of whom don\u2019t get any coverage from their employers.\n\nThe highest concentration is in Carpinteria, where 35 percent of patients are uninsured, Snyder said.\n\nMore people \u2014 in fact, most \u2014 will be eligible for public or private insurance after the new laws are implemented, but some still won\u2019t be covered.\n\nSome patients are \u201cpaperwork challenged\u201d or can\u2019t find time to go to the doctor, said Dr. Charles Fenzi, chief medical officer for the Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics.\n\n\u201cWe have a large number of folks who are currently not well treated for their mental health issues,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a huge problem in the city of Santa Barbara. People aren\u2019t well enough controlled with meds to get in to see us or do paperwork, so for them, we want to provide case management.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe same is true with folks who are working two jobs, live in one room, raising six kids and have diabetes. When do you take care of your diabetes? There\u2019s no time.\u201d\n\nOutreach specialists are critical for these populations, and they offer rides to appointments, reminders about prescriptions, and help with disease management so people can continue to care for themselves and their families.\n\nUndocumented people \u2014 who aren\u2019t citizens or legal immigrants \u2014 are conspicuously left out of health-care reform altogether, and clinics and counties will not be reimbursed for providing care.\n\nThe Public Health Department receives more than $10 million in realignment funding to support the cost of caring for the uninsured and providing other health-care items that aren\u2019t reimbursable.\n\nHowever, the county will be losing 75 percent of that funding, making it one of the hardest hit in California.\n\n\u201cWe always knew the governor was going to take back some of our funding,\u201d Wada said.\n\nNext year, the Public Health Department will be losing $2.3 million of realignment funding, and in 2014-2015, that number jumps up $7.3 million.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s reasoning is that since the Affordable Care Act is kicking in, they assume people will now be insured,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with CenCal and our county Department of Social Services on ways to try convert the uninsured into the Medi-Cal system. We still may have to make some degree of cutbacks.\u201d\n\n| Santa Barbara County's Safety Net | Complete Series Index |\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writers Giana Magnoli and Lara Cooper can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) and .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) , respectively.
