Because that\u2019s where the money is.\u2019 Why do hackers target insurance companies? Because that\u2019s where the information is,\u201d said Cynthia Larose, who leads law firm Mintz Levin\u2019s privacy and security practice.\n\nIt\u2019s not medical information that hackers are after when they infiltrate an entity like Anthem, experts say. The target is the trove of names, Social Security numbers and other identity information that an insurance company stockpiles on its customers.\n\nThe Anthem hack compromised the information of an estimated 80 million people, stunning cybersecurity analysts who called it perhaps the largest successful hack in healthcare history.\n\nInvestigators in law enforcement and private firms have suggested the breach was the work of a state-sponsored Chinese hacking ring that gained access to the network by stealing an employee\u2019s security credentials.\n\nThe hackers\u2019 motivation remains unclear, though experts argued it was probably more than just financial gain.\n\nChinese hackers are known for their interest in U.S. corporate intelligence, for example, and a successful breach could allow them to inject malware into corporate networks.\n\nSimply collecting username and password combinations could help hackers break into other companies that hold information that they want, said Mike McNerney, a cybersecurity strategist and start-up adviser in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cOnce you get into the insurer, maybe you can use that position to swim upstream or downstream. Maybe hacking Anthem gives the attackers the ability to breach what they really want. Goldman Sachs? ... Chevron? Lockheed Martin? It\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nUnlike attacks on the banking and retail industry, healthcare hacks rarely generate headlines \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they are rare.\n\nA database maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services lists 17 healthcare breaches affecting 500 or more people since Oct. 1 alone.\n\nThe records list more than 1,000 hacks of healthcare providers, health plans and other medical businesses since the early 2000s, affecting millions of people in total.\n\nThe FBI also warned the healthcare industry 10 months ago that it was \u201cnot technically prepared to combat against cyber criminals\u2019 basic cyber intrusion tactics.\u201d\n\nExperts say the healthcare world is less prepared for cyberattacks than the defense industry or major financial institutions, though the struggle to guard against intrusions is universal.\n\nSome pointed to figures showing that advanced malware attacks against healthcare actors have increased.\n\n\u201cI think the larger insurers with the resources are going to start looking at the risks more carefully,\u201d Larose said. \u201cHealthcare remains a largely paper-based industry. The data that is online is in bits and pieces, and that is very hard to secure.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a trade group for the insurance industry, rejected suggestions that the industry is less prepared than its peers.\n\n\u201cAll health insurance plans must meet strict federal and state requirements on data security which protect individual member information. These strong protections have been in place for many years,\u201d said AHIP spokeswoman Clare Krusing in a statement.\n\n\u201cNew threats, however, are evolving. To prevent breaches in the future, the focus needs to be on accurately assessing the cyber attacks that occur across all industries and to work with the public and private sectors to identify those threats beforehand.\u201d\n\nAnthem customers affected by the breach have been warned to tread carefully when opening emails, with scammers reportedly trying to trick people into opening dangerous links by offering them free credit monitoring.\n\nThe so-called \u201cphishing\u201d attacks have created a headache for Anthem, forcing the company to resort to paper mail and phone calls when communicating with customers hit by the attack.\n\n\u201cThere is no easy fix for victims of this breach,\u201d said Neal O\u2019Farrell, a security and identity theft expert at Credit Sesame, an online credit-monitoring tool. \u201cThat information isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Anthem hack compromised the information of an estimated 80 million people.", "description": "The Anthem hack compromised the information of an estimated 80 million people.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Elise Viebeck", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Anthem hack compromised the information of an estimated 80 million people.", "title": "Anthem hack: Could your insurer be next?", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/232398-anthem-hack-could-your-insurer-be-next", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cyber_100412getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/232398-anthem-hack-could-your-insurer-be-next", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-11T06:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elise Viebeck", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Hacking, Cyberwarfare, America's Health Insurance Plans,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-11T06:00:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/232398-anthem-hack-could-your-insurer-be-next", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Anthem hack compromised the information of an estimated 80 million people.", "card": "summary", "title": "Anthem hack: Could your insurer be next?"}, "dcterms.title": "Anthem hack: Could your insurer be next?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d43\"", "article_summary": "The Anthem hack compromised the information of an estimated 80 million people, stunning cybersecurity analysts who called it perhaps the largest successful hack in healthcare history.\nThe successful breach of Anthem, America\u2019s second-largest health insurer, has left many people wondering: Could my provider be next?\nIt\u2019s not medical information that hackers are after when they infiltrate an entity like Anthem, experts say.\nIt\u2019s possible.\u201dUnlike attacks on the banking and retail industry, healthcare hacks rarely generate headlines \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean they are rare.\n\u201cAll health insurance plans must meet strict federal and state requirements on data security which protect individual member information."}
