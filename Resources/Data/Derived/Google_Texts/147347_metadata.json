In order to receive 450 million dollars per year from the feds, Hughes says the risks the state would bear in terms of undefined costs are too high, but that isn\u2019t to say they\u2019re giving up.\n\n\u201cWe do have the political will to help the needy,\u201d Hughes says. He and other House Republicans would like to see a plan that focuses on helping only the most medically frail or poor \u2013 an estimated 31,000 people - even if it means losing federal money available through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re not dealing with a behemoth of a federal government and all its regulations, we might be able to find a way to get water at the end of the row, and help those who truly need it without it being such a larger plan and having to comply with the ACA regulations,\u201d Hughes says.\n\nIf Utah refuses to expand up to 138 percent of the poverty level, the federal government will not provide 90% of the funds, and the match rate would drop to 70%. Speaking on KUER\u2019s RadioWest, Republican Senator Brian Shiozawa says this may be the best option to get House majority support, but he would rather see a full Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe get the enhanced federal match, all the hundreds of millions of dollars coming back to the state of Utah, creating thousands of jobs. We would alleviate the medical issues and enhance the access for thousands of Utahns who currently don\u2019t have that,\u201d Shiozawa says. \u201cNow you show me something that makes more sense than that, and I\u2019ll embrace that.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, there are about 53,000 Utahns who remain in the coverage gap, and Utah taxpayers continue to send about 750 million dollars a year to the federal government. The state receives at least 340 million of that for subsidies, but the remaining money goes into a Medicaid program that the state has not accepted.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "The latest proposal to expand Medicaid in Utah was overwhelmingly rejected by Republicans in the House of Representatives this week, but lawmakers may", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuer.org/post/will-utah-ever-close-coverage-gap", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuer/files/styles/medium/public/201510/CoverageGap.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The latest proposal to expand Medicaid in Utah was overwhelmingly rejected by Republicans in the House of Representatives this week, but lawmakers may", "title": "Will Utah Ever Close the Coverage Gap?"}, "story_id": 448725395, "twitter": {"site": "@KUERNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KUERNews"}, "author": "Andrea Smardon", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Will Utah Ever Close the Coverage Gap?"}, "nid": 69025, "datePublished": "2015-10-14", "keywords": "Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, Coverage Gap, Greg Hughes, Utah House of Representatives", "wordCount": 403, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "After Utah Republicans voted down this recent plan, House Speaker Greg Hughes suggested that the GOP caucus may never be comfortable with the federal requirements associated with a Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cNow you show me something that makes more sense than that, and I\u2019ll embrace that.\u201dIn the meantime, there are about 53,000 Utahns who remain in the coverage gap, and Utah taxpayers continue to send about 750 million dollars a year to the federal government.\n\u201cWe get the enhanced federal match, all the hundreds of millions of dollars coming back to the state of Utah, creating thousands of jobs.\nThe latest proposal to expand Medicaid in Utah was overwhelmingly rejected by Republicans in the House of Representatives this week, but lawmakers may have a way forward.\nThe state receives at least 340 million of that for subsidies, but the remaining money goes into a Medicaid program that the state has not accepted."}
