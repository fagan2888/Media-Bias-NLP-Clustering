Air Astana

Air Astana is targeting an initial public offering in two to three years as the Kazakhstan carrier prepares for a new wave of aircraft deliveries to drive growth.

“There is an absolute consensus among the owners Air Astana should be listed,” airline president Peter Foster said in London on Thursday. The company has been steadily paying a dividend to help build confidence among future investors, he said.

Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund, Samruk Kazyna, holds a 51% stake in the airline, with BAE Systems controlling the rest. BAE Systems’ involvement came as the defense company sought to win a military order in the country.

The airline, which began flying in 2002, had sales of $967 million last year and a profit of $46 million.

Air Astana is pursuing network expansion in Europe this year and next after the European Union in April lifted restrictions on its operations. Carriers from Kazakhstan are banned from flying into the EU because of safety concerns, though Air Astana had a limited waiver that has now been extended.

The airline this month increased its service to London to three times a week from twice, and will next year expand its network to add Paris and Prague services. Flights to Tel Aviv may commence next year, slightly ahead of plan, Mr. Foster said.

Air Astana is also expanding its network into Asia and through the Caucasus as it seeks to dominate a market that lacks large rivals.

After several years of growth, the airline this year has slowed capacity expansion after the Kazakhstan government in February devalued the national currency, the tenge, Mr. Foster said. “The market has come back,” he said, and “growth will resume.”
