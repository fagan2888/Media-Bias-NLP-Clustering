Another stunning loss for Dustin Johnson.\n\nChambers Bay delivered heart-stopping drama Sunday in the U.S. Open when Spieth birdied his final hole to become only the sixth player to win the Masters and the U.S. Open in the same year. The real surprise was not that he won, but how he won.\n\nJohnson had a 12-foot eagle putt for the victory. Two putts would force an 18-hole playoff Monday. Less than a minute later, Spieth was shocked to be the youngest U.S. Open champion since 1923.\n\nJohnson\u2019s eagle putt ran by the cup and stopped just over 3 feet away. With his future father-in-law Wayne Gretzky watching, Johnson\u2019s short birdie putt rolled by the left edge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still amazed that I won, let alone that we weren\u2019t playing tomorrow,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cSo for that turnaround right there, to watch that happen, I feel for Dustin, but I haven\u2019t been able to put anything in perspective yet.\u201d\n\nLost in Johnson\u2019s blunder was the clutch play of the Masters champion. Having lost control of the tournament with a double bogey on the 17th hole, Spieth drilled his tee shot and hit a 3-wood that caught the back bank and rolled below the cup. His eagle putt was wide left, giving him a 1-under 69.\n\nHe walked off the green at 5-under 275 and worried about golf\u2019s biggest hitter playing the par-5 behind.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was good enough,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cBut man, I couldn\u2019t be more happy right now.\u201d\n\nSpieth becomes the first player since Bobby Jones to make birdie on the 72nd hole to win the U.S. Open by one shot, all because of Johnson\u2019s three-putt. The 21-year-old Texan heads to St. Andrews next month in pursuit of golf\u2019s holy grail \u2014 the Grand Slam.\n\nTiger Woods in 2002 was the last player to get the first two legs of the slam. In 1960, Arnold Palmer went to St. Andrews for a chance at three in a row.\n\nFor all the criticism of the unique course at Chambers Bay, this was the theater at its finest.\n\nBut there will be lingering questions about the condition of the greens, so bumpy that they were referred to as broccoli and Billy Horschel said he lost respect for the USGA. This championship ended with a short miss, the target of complaints all week.\n\nThe final hour was so wild that four players could have won over the last two holes.\n\nTied for the lead with Branden Grace of South Africa, Spieth looked like he wrapped this up with a 25-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole. He turned toward Puget Sound, pumped his fist and yelled, \u201cYEAH!\u201d\n\nThat gave him a three-shot lead because Grace hit his tee shot onto the railroad tracks out-of-bounds and made double bogey.\n\nAnd then his lead was gone.\n\nSpieth hit into the fescue-covered mounds right of the 17th and made double bogey.\n\nLouis Oosthuizen made one last birdie \u2014 his sixth over the last seven holes \u2014 for a 67 to post at 4-under 276. Johnson, who had a two-shot lead at the turn until missing so many putts on the back nine, was forgotten until he stuffed his tee shot on the par-3 17th to 4 feet for birdie.\n\nSpieth, a wire-to-wire winner at Augusta National, showed he can be clutch with his 3-wood into the 18th. And then came Johnson in the final group, blasting his tee shot so far that he only needed a 5-iron, and he put that to 12 feet.\n\nMake it and win. Two putts and he still gets a playoff.\n\nHe made par.\n\nJohnson said he might have hit it even farther past the hole if he had not seen the speed of Jason Day\u2019s putt.\n\n\u201cI did everything I was supposed to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI hit the ball really well. I\u2019m proud of the way I handled myself and the way I played today. I just really struggled getting it in the hole today. I didn\u2019t think I was hitting bad putts. I thought I was hitting them pretty good they just weren\u2019t going in.\u201d\n\nIt was the fourth heartache for Johnson in the majors, and this was the worst. He didn\u2019t shoot 82 in the final round like he did at Pebble Beach in the 2010 U.S. Open. He didn\u2019t ground his club in a bunker that cost him a spot in the 2010 PGA Championship at Whistling Straights. He didn\u2019t hit a shot out-of-bounds like he did in the 2011 British Open.\n\nTwelve feet from a win. Three putts and he lost.\n\n\u201cJust missed it left,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJason Day, who collapsed on Friday with vertigo only to rally for a share of the 54-hole lead, fell back with missed putt and was never in the hunt on the back nine. He closed with a 74 to finish five shots behind.\n\nGrace never recovered from that double bogey on No. 16 and shot 71 to tie for fourth with Adam Scott (64) and Cameron Smith (68).\n\nIt was a homecoming of sorts for Spieth \u2014 and his caddie, Michael Greller.\n\nGreller was a sixth-grade math teacher who caddied in the summer at Chambers Bay when he hooked up with a young Texan who needed a caddie at Gold Mountain, where Spieth won the U.S. Junior Amateur. Greller knew this course better than any caddie. And he had the right horse who\u2019s on the ride of his life.\n\nSpieth is the youngest player to win two majors since Gene Sarazen in 1922.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jordan Spieth wins U.S. Open for second straight major title", "title": "Jordan Spieth wins U.S. Open for second straight major title", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/21/jordan-spieth-wins-u-s-open-for-second-straight-major-title/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150621__jordan-spiethp1.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150621__jordan-spiethp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-21T20:32:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:40:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd48f4\"", "article_summary": "Spieth hit into the fescue-covered mounds right of the 17th and made double bogey.\nHe didn\u2019t hit a shot out-of-bounds like he did in the 2011 British Open.\nLess than a minute later, Spieth was shocked to be the youngest U.S. Open champion since 1923.\nHe didn\u2019t shoot 82 in the final round like he did at Pebble Beach in the 2010 U.S. Open.\nHaving lost control of the tournament with a double bogey on the 17th hole, Spieth drilled his tee shot and hit a 3-wood that caught the back bank and rolled below the cup."}
