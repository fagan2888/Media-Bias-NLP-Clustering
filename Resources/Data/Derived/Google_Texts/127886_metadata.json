Screen shot via YouTube\n\nJudy Brown, 47, didn't know she was pregnant. She arrived at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts on Wednesday, Nov. 3, with what she believed was abdominal pain, only to find out that she was actually in labor.\n\nABC affiliate WCVB-5 reported Brown had noticed \"some things going on with her body,\" but hadn't considered pregnancy. She experienced no morning sickness and figured her weight gain was a result of entering menopause. She and her husband, Jason, were completely surprised to hear she was pregnant.\n\n\"It's good news,\" the doctors told Judy. \"There's no blockage. You are pregnant and you are going to have her now!\"\n\nThe Browns told WCVB that their approach to children has always been \"if it happens, it happens.\" Now, they have an 8-pound baby girl named Carolyn. And they're reaching out to friends and family for baby items and furniture, including a bassinet and stroller.\n\nThough happy to welcome Carolyn, Jason told WCVB she will be the couple's only child. He added he'll get a vasectomy \"before it even becomes a thought.\" As for now, Judy added their daughter is already \"daddy's little girl.\"\n\nIt seems hard to believe Judy could not have known she was pregnant \u2014 but she's far fro the first woman to experience a \"surprise pregnancy.\" Parenting shared Jennifer West's story; she had simply missed \"all the obvious symptoms.\" West mistook morning sickness for the flu; missed periods as a normal part of her irregular cycle; and attributed heartburn and stomach pain to her ulcer.\n\nAccording to Slate, \"a very small number of mothers make it to the labor stage without finding out they're expecting.\" But of the women who do, they are more likely to have an irregular period, which means they're less likely to catch the first and most obvious sign of pregnancy: missed periods.\n\nThen, if women are older, they may not even think pregnancy is possible, making it easier to \"explain away\" symptoms. In fact, how old is too old for a woman to give birth remains heavily debated in the scientific community.\n\nYou can see more of the Browns and baby Carolyn in the video below.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "massachusetts, woman, who, showed, hospital, abdominal, pain, finds, out, shes, pregnant, gives", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Judy Brown arrived at Beverly Hospital with abdominal pain, only to find out she was in labor with her baby girl, Carolyn.", "title": "This Woman Had No Idea She Was Pregnant Before Giving Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/massachusetts-woman-who-showed-hospital-abdominal-pain-finds-out-shes-pregnant-gives-360718", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/07/jason-and-judy-brown.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Judy Brown arrived at Beverly Hospital with abdominal pain, only to find out she was in labor with her baby girl, Carolyn.", "title": "This Woman Had No Idea She Was Pregnant Before Giving Birth", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/massachusetts-woman-who-showed-hospital-abdominal-pain-finds-out-shes-pregnant-gives-360718", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/07/jason-and-judy-brown.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/07/jason-and-judy-brown.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-11-07T13:46:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-07T13:46:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Judy Brown arrived at Beverly Hospital with abdominal pain, only to find out she was in labor with her baby girl, Carolyn."}, "article_summary": "Judy Brown arrived at Beverly Hospital with abdominal pain, only to find out she was in labor with her baby girl, Carolyn.\nYou can see more of the Browns and baby Carolyn in the video below.\n\"It's good news,\" the doctors told Judy.\nIn fact, how old is too old for a woman to give birth remains heavily debated in the scientific community.\nShe arrived at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts on Wednesday, Nov. 3, with what she believed was abdominal pain, only to find out that she was actually in labor."}
