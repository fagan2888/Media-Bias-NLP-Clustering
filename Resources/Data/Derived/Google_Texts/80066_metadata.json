The injury rates are sky high,\" said report author Scott Harris, Ph.D., MSPH, the director of EHS advisory services for UL Workplace Health and Safety in Franklin, Tenn., an article by Risk & Insurance.\n\nThe report found 15.2 million employees were injured across tens of thousands of work sites. Sprains and strains were the most common types of injuries with more than 16,000 reported in each category at nursing and residential care facilities, costing more than $983 million and $1.1 billion in total losses from days away from work respectively. Slips, trips and falls, violence and chemical exposure are the most frequent injuries among healthcare workers with nurses experiencing the highest rates.\n\nStatistics found hospital injuries most frequently occurred:\n\nIn female employees with more than 5 years on the job;\n\nIn employees who were between the ages of 45- to 54-years-old;\n\nWithin two to four hours on duty; and\n\nOn Tuesdays between 12:01 p.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nHarris said the data should be a wakeup call for the healthcare industry and an opportunity to change its poor safety culture. The report said hospitals would benefit from more rigorous and frequent inspections from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nAnother report that links quality patient care directly to healthcare worker safety said the healthcare sector has an injury and illness rate of 5.6 per 100 full-time workers compared with 4.2 for all of the private sector, FierceHealthcare previously reported. To keep workers feeling safe, the report suggested hospitals create a culture of continuous learning, teamwork and transparency.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report\n\n- check out the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospital workplace safety means better patient care\n\nTeamwork leads to better hospital safety, care quality\n\nHealthcare worker injuries jump by up to 10%\n\nHospital violence strikes nurses' aids the most", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare workers had the highest injury rates of almost any industry in the country in 2011, costing the industry $13.1 billion and more than 2 million lost workdays,\u00a0according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0published in the American Society of Safety Engineers'\u00a0Professional Safety\u00a0journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare workers had the highest injury rates of almost any industry in the country in 2011, costing the industry $13.1 billion and more than 2 million lost workdays,\u00a0according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0published in the American Society of Safety Engineers'\u00a0Professional Safety\u00a0journal.", "title": "Workplace injuries cost healthcare industry billions", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/report-workplace-injuries-cost-healthcare-industry-billions/2013-11-12", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Hospital Workers,HR & Workforce Management,injury rates,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Occupational Safety And Health Administration OSHA,workplace injuries,workplace safety", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc31\"", "article_summary": "\"Healthcare worker injury rates are only less than outdoor wilderness professions, such as commercial loggers and fishermen.\nSlips, trips and falls, violence and chemical exposure are the most frequent injuries among healthcare workers with nurses experiencing the highest rates.\nTo learn more:- read the report- check out the articleRelated Articles:Hospital workplace safety means better patient careTeamwork leads to better hospital safety, care qualityHealthcare worker injuries jump by up to 10%Hospital violence strikes nurses' aids the most\nThe injury rates are sky high,\" said report author Scott Harris, Ph.D., MSPH, the director of EHS advisory services for UL Workplace Health and Safety in Franklin, Tenn., an article by Risk & Insurance.\nHealthcare workers had the highest injury rates of almost any industry in the country in 2011, costing the industry $13.1 billion and more than 2 million lost workdays, according to a new report published in the American Society of Safety Engineers' Professional Safety journal."}
