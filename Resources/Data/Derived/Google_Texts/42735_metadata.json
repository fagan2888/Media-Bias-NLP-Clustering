Say goodbye to the ubiquitous self-serve blood pressure stations found next to the pharmacy counter. Say hello to the next generation of consumer self-serve health kiosks.\n\nThis trend may open a door for innovative clinical laboratories to add their service offerings to the kiosks in their communities. One example of the fast adoption of these new kiosks is the SoloHealth Station. SoloHealth has already placed its kiosks in 3,200 retail locations nationwide.\n\nEach day, more than 130,000 individuals use them and, on average, each consumer spends 4.5 minutes per session, according to a report issued by Marketwatch.com.\n\nSelf-service Kiosks Offer a Health Tests and Preventive Information\n\nThese machines are replacing the self-service blood pressure machines commonly found in pharmacies. for years with the new blue and white devices, which can perform a range of health screenings, from blood pressure and vision and depression, as well as assess your risk for heart disease, calculate your body mass index offer friendly advice on diet, exercise habits, and an expanding list of health topics, noted a report published by the Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nUsers answer on-screen questions about age, gender, allergies and potential symptoms, such as tingling in fingers and symptoms of depressions, then the machine tailors its preventive health answers, recommendations and advertisements to the user\u2019s profile. Additionally, it provides a list of local physicians and offers to help schedule an appointment if something worrisome is detected during the user\u2019s SoloHealth session.\n\nThe idea, 38-year-old Bart Foster, CEO & Founder of SoloHealth, said in the Star Tribune story, is to combine a few simple automated tests and questionnaires to help identify people at risk for common chronic health problems and then provide them instant information on what they can do about it. For example, he noted that a poor eye test may signal an underlying disease, such as glaucoma.\n\nExperts Voice Positive and Negative of Opinions of Health Kiosk Concept\n\nMeanwhile, healthcare experts are unsure if the kiosks are gimmick, breakthrough, or both. \u201cHandled the right way, they could be super beneficial, Dominque Tobbell, Ph.D., a Medical Historian a the University of Minnesota, told the Star Tribune. \u201cThey\u2019re addressing a problem within the health care field, which is the need to get more patients engaged in preventive health care.\u201d\n\nDavid Thorson, M.D., a family practitioner and chairman of the Minnesota Medical Association, commented that if the kiosks get a lot of people to pay attention to their health, \u201cthat\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d\n\nHe worries, however, that a kiosk test may unnecessarily alarm patients, if there is no medical professional to interpret it. \u201cIf we simply tell a person your blood pressure is high, you\u2019re overweight, your vision is off, [and] we don\u2019t do anything to help them fix that, we haven\u2019t changed anything,\u201d Thorson said. \u201cIt creates anxiety without helping them.\u201d\n\nFoster received a $1.2-million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop the kiosk. The service is free to customers, but to access the machine\u2019s interactive programming, users must sit through a stream of advertisements for health supplements, over-the-counter remedies and other products.\n\nSome medical experts contend that the ads and drug-company involvement distorts the health message, noted the Star Tribune article. Foster admitted that his company makes most of its money from advertising. But in response to the criticism, he noted that a medical board reviews the health information for accuracy, and the advertising keeps the service free.\n\nFoster is confident interest in his kiosk will grow. He will continue to add new health modules and is currently planning one on smoking cessation and pain control.\n\nSoloHealth Partners With eHealth and HHS to Promote Obamacare\n\nThe Santa Clara, California, company has also partnered with eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH), the parent company for eHealthinsurance.com, to promote individual and family health insurance plans, as well as the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) to help promote awareness and information about the new health insurance exchanges and Healthcare.gov.\n\nThe partnership with eHealth makes eHealthInsurance.com, the nation\u2019s first and largest private online health insurance Website, plan selections and comparison tools available on SoloHealth kiosks in selected regions throughout the nation.\n\nIn a SoloHealth press release announcing the partnership, Bart Foster, CEO & Founder of SoloHealth noted that this alliance coincided with the opening of state health exchanges, established under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe are pleased to be part of spreading awareness and information to empower consumers to take control of their healthcare and find plans that fit their personal needs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SoloHealth partnership with HHS educates consumers about their health insurance options under the ACA and helps them understand how Obamacare affects them.\n\nReleased in October 2013, a survey conducted on SoloHealth kiosks found that 64% of the more than 13,600 people polled admitted having \u201cno\u201d or only \u201ca little bit\u201d of knowledge about health insurance marketplaces. Additionally, 56% said they did not know before participating in the survey that they might qualify for government subsides to help pay for insurance. The survey also found that nearly 60% of respondents who have insurance \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d how the law will affect them, and 53% of those with no insurance \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d how it will affect them either.\n\n\u201cChampion organizations like SoloHealth are already serving people and are a trusted source of information in communities across the county,\u201d said Julie Bataille, Director of Communications for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, in last month\u2019s announcement of the partnership, noted an article published by KioskMarketplace.com. \u201cThese organizations are natural places for people to learn about the marketplace, and we want to make sure that [organizations] have access to the tools and information to respond to people who want to sign up and enroll for coverage on Oct. 1.\u201d\n\nTechnologies Add to Push for Patient Responsibility for Own Health\n\nConsumer-friendly technologies, such as the SoloHealth Station, are adding to the push employer and insurance payer for patients to take responsibility for their own health. As consumers become more aware of their health risks and status, medical laboratories can expect increase in business.\n\n\u2212 Patricia Kirk\n\nRelated Information:\n\nIn-store health kiosks could make Obamacare understandable\n\nSoloHealth & eHealth Announce Strategic Partnership to Promote Individual and Family Health Insurance Awareness & Options\n\nNew SoloHealth Survey Reveals Low Consumer Awareness and Understanding Around New Healthcare Law & Marketplace\n\nNews Release: Survey Data", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory, solohealth, health kiosk, health screening, obamacare, accountable care act, aca, health & human services, hhs, center for medicare and medicaid, cms, ehealth, ehealthinsurance.com, bart foster, dominque tobbell, david thorson md, minnesota medical association, mma, national institutes of health, julie bataille, health insurance     ,aca,accountable care act,bart foster,center for medicare and medicaid,clinical laboratory,cms,david thorson md,dominque tobbell,ehealth,ehealthinsurance.com,health & human services,health insurance,health kiosk,health screening,hhs,julie bataille,medical laboratory,minnesota medical association,mma,national institutes of health,obamacare,solohealth,instruments & equipment,laboratory instruments & laboratory equipment,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology", "description": "A next-generation self-service health kiosk, the SoloHealth Station is coming to retail stores across the nation.
