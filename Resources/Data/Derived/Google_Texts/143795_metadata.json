If you want to start a fight with your Fox News-o-phile uncle, just say, \u201cThe attorney general will not cast aspersions on my asparagus!\u201d as Rep. Louie Gohmert famously did during a House Judiciary hearing on the Boston Bombings in 2013. This was after Holder told the Congressman he could not know what he was talking about. Gohmert countered, defending the reputation of his veggies. Later, Holder wished Gohmert luck with his asparagus.\n\nIt\u2019s been ugly. Farmers-market-level ugly.\n\nHolder is the first attorney general to ever be held in contempt by Congress. You\u2019d think the Grand Old Party would be racing to get rid of Holder. His replacement has been named, hearings have been held and Loretta Lynch, the highly qualified United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, has broad support from both Republicans and Democrats. But in the Republican-controlled Senate there\u2019s been no move to bring her nomination up for a vote. So they will have Holder longer. As of this writing it\u2019s indefinite.\n\nThis seems pretty typical for the Republican Party these days. They may fly a banner of the tea party Gadsden Flag with a snake coiled ready to attack, but their snake would be more accurately depicted as eating itself. When Republicans get what they want then they no longer want that-they want something else!\n\nThey loved Chris Christie at the 2012 RNC. Just gushed over the governor. His speech was the highlight of the whole convention. \u201cIf only we could vote for Chris Christie instead of Romney,\u201d they swooned. His brash style. His copious use of the phrase \u201cshut up!\u201d He was the party\u2019s fantasy. When November came Republicans closed their eyes and pictured Christie while pulling the lever for Romney. And now that conservatives have their chance to vote for a President Christie he\u2019s polling seven points behind Undecided-trailing behind even Mike Huckabee.\n\nPlenty of people, even President Obama himself, think this is just a repulsion to anything Obama. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one side that is denying the facts, who are often motivated, principally, by opposing whatever it is that I propose,\u201d he said to VICE this week. It\u2019s very diplomatic of the President to say the GOP has principles.\n\nThe GOP has the largest majority in the House since the Great Depression and Speaker of the House John Boehner has had his own bills fail.\n\nIt actually feels dishonest to call them a party-or accuse Republicans of being a monolith when launching any criticism. Who\u2019s the leader of the party? They don\u2019t have one. Every Republican is a leader. Which is basically the tenet of anarchy.\n\nEveryone is a leader in the GOP and they\u2019re adored as long as they\u2019re not given any real power (Sarah Palin, Donald Trump, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O\u2019Reilly). Anarchists hate seeing anything actually get done. They have contempt for authority opting instead for protest, sabotage and (you guessed it) filibustering. Anarchists hate government. They dismiss its need or existence. There is no institution or tradition that anarchists revere. Doesn\u2019t this sound like the modern Party of Lincoln?\n\nThe current incarnation of the GOP is much more likely to tear things down than build anything. Even something as universally sought after as a deal with Iran to halt its nuclear program was happily torpedoed by 47 Republican Senators. The letter signed by theses \u201cstatesmen\u201d basically said Obama isn\u2019t really authorized to make a deal. Because to Republicans there are no leaders greater than each individual Republican spokesperson.\n\nObamacare? Repeal it! Replace it with nothing! IRS? Raze it. The Fed? Kill it! Anarchy! Yay!\n\nCan you name all the anarchist governments in the world? You can. There are none. The U.S. currently just has one branch \u201crun\u201d by them.\n\nPass the asparagus.\n\nGOP 2015: One God, No Masters.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1HaNVLY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Republicans are the new anarchists", "p": {"domain_verify": "815a1068696ac12ba65bd5231740d78d"}, "og": {"site_name": "delawareonline", "description": "Republicans are the new anarchists", "title": "Republicans are the new anarchists", "url": "http://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/03/20/republicans-new-anarchists/25098345/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delawareonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans are the new anarchists", "title": "Republicans are the new anarchists", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/298d90f45bd56a90115f9d917b1206fb1b25fe65/c=0-40-1155-1195&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wilmington/2015/03/20/B9316667092Z.1_20150320160910_000_GL9A9497G.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@delawareonline", "site": "@delawareonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600071892", "fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Plenty of people, even President Obama himself, think this is just a repulsion to anything Obama.\nIt actually feels dishonest to call them a party-or accuse Republicans of being a monolith when launching any criticism.\nWhen November came Republicans closed their eyes and pictured Christie while pulling the lever for Romney.\nThis seems pretty typical for the Republican Party these days.\nWhen Republicans get what they want then they no longer want that-they want something else!"}
