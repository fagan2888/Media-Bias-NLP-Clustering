Relationships that once were on autopilot, nestled within the daily routine of work, may now take a lot more time and energy to sustain. And finally, it can be challenging to rechannel the purpose provided by one\u2019s job or career into equally meaningful pursuits for the 30 to 40 post-early-retirement years, given current life-span projections.\n\nIf you are going to make the leap into early retirement, I would advise developing a unique document parallel to one\u2019s financial portfolio called a \u201csocial portfolio.\u201d\n\nNoted geriatric psychiatrist Gene Cohen proposed the social portfolio as a well diversified tally of one\u2019s personal assets such as interests, hobbies, relationships and personal resources, along with \u201cinsurance\u201d in the form of a long-term plan to adapt or add to the list based on changing personal circumstances.\n\nThese assets can be organized according to whether they require a high or low energy level and whether they can be pursued individually or in a group. The newly retired individual who thrives on tennis and golf might want to consider developing several other interests that involve less energy and are not dependent on partners, both for the sake of diversification and to account for times when solitude and/or physical torpor are either desired or imposed by infirmity or illness.\n\nWith retirement approaching, retirees may find that a broad and sustainable mission for the next few decades of life emerges from the creative process of developing and sharing their social portfolio.\n\nMarc Agronin (@MarcAgronin), is a geriatric psychiatrist and the author of \u201cHow We Age: A Doctor\u2019s Journey Into the Heart of Growing Old.\u201d He is the medical director for mental health and clinical research at Miami Jewish Health Systems and an affiliate associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\nRead the latest Encore Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "What advice would I give people who are retiring early\u2014say before they are 55 or 60?", "title": "The Case Against Early Retirement", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/17/the-case-against-early-retirement/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FB219_expert_P_20141016183901.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "The Case Against Early Retirement", "description": "What advice would I give people who are retiring early\u2014say before they are 55 or 60?", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "What advice would I give people who are retiring early\u2014say before they are 55 or 60?", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-17T10:33:23-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/17/the-case-against-early-retirement/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-4339", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "What advice would I give people who are retiring early\u2014say before they are 55 or 60?", "title": "The Case Against Early Retirement", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/17/the-case-against-early-retirement/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FB219_expert_P_20141016183901.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-4339", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-16T22:41:41-04:00"}, "article_summary": "According to the Center for Retirement Research in 2012, only about 30% of households are able to afford retirement at age 62 (which is currently the average age of retirement).\nThe few exceptions might be those fortunate individuals whose early retirement is facilitated by a major financial success such as selling a business, but even in those circumstances there are other nonfinancial pitfalls to consider.\nEven for those early retirees with a solid nest egg and keen planning, the increasing lifespan and the likelihood of needing significant physical assistance and even long-term-care placement for many years prior to death may significantly undermine financial projections.\nWith retirement approaching, retirees may find that a broad and sustainable mission for the next few decades of life emerges from the creative process of developing and sharing their social portfolio.\niStockMARC AGRONIN: What advice would I give people who are retiring early\u2014say before they are 55 or 60?"}
