Additionally, small employers statewide will have their first opportunity to buy coverage through the exchange; this option is currently available in only two counties.\n\nThe Office of the Insurance Commission has compiled information online about the plans and providers that should be helpful for those shopping for coverage.\n\nBut while members of the Washington Health Benefit Exchange board were pleased that the public will have more options to choose from, they were concerned about helping people sort through their choices. Plans vary in terms of how much people must pay before their insurance kicks in, which drugs are covered and which doctors are included in their network.\n\nThe board worried that people automatically will opt for one the cheapest \u201cbronze\u201d level plans \u2014 which can include deductibles of more than $6,000 \u2014 without realizing that it might cost less in the long run to buy a slightly more expensive plan with better coverage. And only the \u201csilver\u201d level plans, a step up from bronze, qualify for cost-sharing benefits that reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients, a fact that\u2019s easily overlooked.\n\nWhen it comes to educating the public, \u201cI want to make sure we are doing something a little more proactive this next year,\u201d said board member Teresa Mosqueda. \u201cI want to make sure people are making an informed decision.\u201d\n\nIt appears unlikely that the state will be able to make significant changes to the Washington Healthplanfinder website where people enroll in insurance plans to help with decision making. But exchange staff said they will work on outreach efforts to better educate people in their health-care choices.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe board certified 82 individual health plans Thursday and an additional eight plans are offered in multiple states so they await federal approval. Not all plans are sold everywhere in the state, with fewer options typically available in more rural counties. Plus, individual insurance plans from two companies have not yet been approved for sale by the state\u2019s Office of the Insurance Commissioner, but still could be.\n\nOn Wednesday, Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler announced that he had approved the 90 plans and an increase in individual insurance premiums for exchange plans of 1.9 percent on average. Before passage of the Affordable Care Act and last year\u2019s launch of the health insurance exchange, individual rates increased each year on average between 8 and 18 percent going back to 2007. (The 1.9 percent increase does not include individual plans sold outside of the exchange; those rates are still being finalized.)\n\nThe sign up for individual coverage begins Nov. 15 and runs until Feb 15, 2015. The enrollment period includes the sale of plans inside the exchange sold through the website, and outside from brokers or insurance companies. Only plans sold inside the exchange are eligible for federal tax benefits based on one\u2019s income that reduce the cost of premiums.\n\nBy Oct. 1, insurance companies must inform people if their plan was not renewed. By mid to late October, the exchange will send customers renewal notices, which will include an estimate of insurance premium costs and tax benefit estimates.\n\nNew options for small employers\n\nSmall employers interested in providing health insurance for their workers through the exchange, called Healthplanfinder Business, will be able to purchase coverage from Moda Health Plan anywhere in the state. In Clark and Cowlitz counties they can also choose coverage from Kaiser Permanente, which has been selling exchange plans there since last year. The board Thursday certified 23 plans for sale on the small employer exchange.\n\nBut only 10 businesses in Clark and Cowlitz currently are enrolled in the business exchange, formerly called the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP. Most small employers buy coverage from associations that typically offer discounted rates, and many experts expect that will remain the preferred option.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act includes a tax benefit to encourage small employers to insure their workers. The perk applies to businesses that paid at least half the cost of their workers\u2019 premiums, and employed fewer than 25 people making on average $50,000 a year. The benefit applies only to the government-run marketplaces, though in Washington it temporarily was extended to insurance bought outside of the exchange because of the limited marketplace. However, people have complained that it\u2019s difficult to figure out the amount of the tax benefit and to apply for it, making the incentive less effective.\n\nEven with exchange plans available statewide, \u201cit\u2019s hard for me to be wildly enthusiastic about the likelihood of sustainable success with the program,\u201d said Bainbridge Island attorney Jeff Gingold, who represents some of the associations selling insurance.\n\n\u201cWhether small business owners are receptive to Moda\u2019s new plan selection will depend largely on cost \u2014 premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs,\u201d added Patrick Connor, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, in an email. \u201cSmall employers want to offer health coverage to their workers and the families they support. But it has to be a value to the workers and a price employers and workers can both afford.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "The board overseeing the Washington's health insurance marketplace Thursday certified more than 100 health and dental plans to be sold this fall.
