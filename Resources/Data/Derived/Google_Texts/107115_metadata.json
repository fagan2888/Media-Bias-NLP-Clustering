Now, pro-life congressmen are demanding further investigations into the use of U.S. taxpayer funds to promote abortion-on-demand.\n\nThe issue came to light when a federal inspector general's report found that six Americorps volunteers had been acting as \"abortion doulas,\" giving emotional support to women who chose to have abortions.\n\nThe National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC) allowed the volunteers \u2013 who received tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars \u2013 to support abortions that took place inside a New York abortion facility run by the Institute for Family Health (IFH).\n\nAmericorps \u201cvolunteers\u201d illegally supporting abortion at taxpayer expense is an ongoing problem. But there's more to the story.\n\nThe IFH proudly advertises itself as a federally qualified health center (FQHC). Federal dollars are restricted from underwriting most abortion at FQHCs, in line with the Hyde Amendment. This does not hold true for the Affordable Care Act, conventionally known as ObamaCare.\n\nTo ease qualms raised by pro-life Democrat Bart Stupak and others, on March 24, 2010, Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13535. It states that \u201cthe Hyde [Amendment] language shall apply to the authorization and appropriations of funds for Community Health Centers...I hereby direct the Secretary of HHS to ensure that program administrators and recipients of federal funds are aware of and comply with the limitations on abortion services imposed on CHCs by existing law.\u201d\n\nPro-life groups warned at the time that an executive order was insufficient to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion, and the law itself had to be amended \u2013 or defeated.\n\nStupak, who voted for ObamaCare before retiring from Congress, later said he was \u201cperplexed and disappointed\u201d by President Obama's \u201cdouble cross\u201d during the law's implementation.\n\nPro-life experts today say Congress must investigate whether the law is being violated and, if so, if the offense is isolated to IFH.\n\n\"For years the Obama administration has claimed that the Affordable Care Act and federally-funded health centers do not subsidize abortion, and the president finally signed additional provisions, passed last year by Congress, to ensure that community health centers do not use federal funds to support abortion,\u201d said Arina Grossu, the director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council. \u201cNow we learn that CNCS is violating the law by helping women obtain abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis blatant violation of federal law by CNCS and AmeriCorps demands that Congress investigate government-funded community health centers,\u201d Grossu said. \u201cIt's time for this administration to stop foisting its radical abortion agenda on the American people and using their tax dollars to do so.\u201d\n\nPro-life advocates have long said that there is no need to fund Planned Parenthood, because federal women's health dollars could be reappropriated to FQHCs, which do not perform abortion.\n\nThere are 9,170 federally qualified health centers compared to about 700 Planned Parenthood facilities, according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute. FQHCs see 21.1 million patients a year, while Planned Parenthood saw 2.8 million people, the institute reported.\n\nThe latest example of federal dollars being channeled to support abortion, the law notwithstanding, has undermined some confidence in the FQHCs.\n\nRep. Diane Black, a pro-life Republican from Tennessee, said, \u201cNACHC didn\u2019t just break the rules; they broke trust with the American people. My constituents expect that federal funding given to our community health centers will be used to protect and enhance people\u2019s lives, not to be a willing partner in their destruction.\u201d\n\nAt least two Congressional leaders \u2013 the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the chair of the House Health Subcommittee \u2013 have promised they will take action immediately.\n\n\u201cFederal law demands that taxpayer dollars are never to be spent on abortion activities. Not one penny. Period. But a disturbing report from an independent watchdog reveals that was not the case with brazen pursuits by the National Association of Community Health Centers,\u201d said Congressmen Fred Upton and Joseph Pitts of Pennsylvania, both Republicans. \u201cThe law was violated and this shameful failure of trust will not be tolerated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "'This shameful failure of trust will not be tolerated,' Congressional leaders promise.", "title": "Federally funded community health center may have illegally performed abortions: Report", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/Family-Health-Center16-resized.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/federally-funded-community-health-care-provider-may-have-illegally-performe", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "'This shameful failure of trust will not be tolerated,' Congressional leaders promise."}, "description": "'This shameful failure of trust will not be tolerated,' Congressional leaders promise.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "There are 9,170 federally qualified health centers compared to about 700 Planned Parenthood facilities, according to the Charlotte Lozier Institute.\nNewsAbortionWASHINGTON, D.C., April 28, 2016 ( LifeSiteNews ) \u2013 A federally qualified health center (FQHC) apparently performed abortions, although nearly all federal funds are forbidden from being used for that purpose, sources tell LifeSiteNews.\nNow, pro-life congressmen are demanding further investigations into the use of U.S. taxpayer funds to promote abortion-on-demand.\nBut a disturbing report from an independent watchdog reveals that was not the case with brazen pursuits by the National Association of Community Health Centers,\u201d said Congressmen Fred Upton and Joseph Pitts of Pennsylvania, both Republicans.\nThe latest example of federal dollars being channeled to support abortion, the law notwithstanding, has undermined some confidence in the FQHCs."}
