Hundreds turned out on the hot and sunny day for the 28th annual Blessing of the Fleet and Seafood Festival at Mount Pleasant\u2019s Memorial Waterfront Park.\n\nDan Martin, of Mount Pleasant, said he\u2019s been attending the festival for a \u201clong, long, long time,\u201d and was pleased with this year\u2019s celebration.\n\n\u201cIt was great, I had a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI always want to support the shrimpers since I grew up around here.\u201d\n\nMildred Horlbeck, also of Mount Pleasant, brought her family to the event and said it was something they looked forward to every year.\n\n\u201cI just think everything is really lovely,\u201d she said, adding that her kids \u201cjust love it.\u201d\n\nNicole Harvey, special events planner for the town of Mount Pleasant, said the day could not have gone any smoother.\n\nShe said things that were new this year included a revamped layout and a larger number of shrimping and fishing boats in the parade. Led by one of the U.S. Coast Guard boats, there were 13 local shrimpers and fishermen that followed in their boats.\n\nThe mayor also announced this year a $10,000 donation to the Save the Fleet organization.\n\nHarvey said something else that was new was a big push via social media to encourage people to eat locally. She said she wants the hashtags #justask and #getwild to become big.\n\n\u201cThere is so much good, local seafood, there\u2019s really no need to buy the other, imported, stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI would rather pay a dollar or two more and know that it came from right here.\u201d\n\nShe added that the town is having an online contest. Anyone who posts a photo of themselves in a restaurant eating local seafood with the hashtag #justask or #getwild on Mount Pleasant\u2019s or Blessing of the Fleet\u2019s Facebook, Twitter or Instagram pages, will be entered in a drawing for various prizes.\n\nTressy Magwood Mellichamp, Capt. Wayne Magwood\u2019s oldest daughter, said the there\u2019s also been a big social media push among the shrimpers and fishermen to market their seafood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder for fishermen to keep up,\u201d she said, noting that her father, just purchased a smart phone for the first time a couple months ago. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way they can really market themselves now.\u201d\n\nMany of the local shrimpers and organizations can be found on Facebook, Mellichamp said, including Team Magwood, Rocky Magwood, Tommy Edwards, Community Seafood and Abundant Seafood.\n\nShe also encouraged residents to ask for wild American when buying seafood at stores and restaurants and to get educated about the three shrimps harvested in the area and the variation in sizes. The first crop is a large, white Roe shrimp, she said, then around June comes smaller, brown shrimp and then the white crop shows back up around November.\n\nThe annual party in Mount Pleasant was started 28 years ago by the Magwood family as a religious send-off for fleets before the commercial shrimp trawling season kicked off in mid-May. It was also started as a way to give back to the community, said Magwood.\n\n\u201cWithout our local communities, our shrimpers wouldn\u2019t survive,\u201d he said. \u201cThis festival is all about community and support. They support us and we support them.\u201d\n\nMichael and Rebecca Cobb, whose shrimping boat is named \u201cFamily Thing,\u201d said the event is a good time for family and friends to support the shrimpers and see what they do, adding that they enjoyed the blessing and boat ride.\n\n\u201cShrimping is not just a business, it\u2019s a family thing,\u201d said Rebecca Cobb, adding that the festival was no different.\n\nReach Melissa Boughton at 937-5594 or at Twitter.com/mboughton.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Blessing of the Fleet organizers, shrimpers make a social media push to buy local, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Blessing of the Fleet,Magwood,Mount Pleasant,shrimp boats,shrimpers", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The Blessing of the Fleet may be a centuries old tradition, but event planners in Mount Pleasant, along with the shrimpers themselves, have taken to social media to keep up with the times and keep the annual festival thriving.", "title": "Blessing of the Fleet organizers, shrimpers make a social media push to buy local", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150426/150429438/blessing-of-the-fleet-organizers-shrimpers-make-a-social-media-push-to-buy-local", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150426/PC16/150429438/AR/0/AR-150429438.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150426/PC16/150429438/AR/0/AR-150429438.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Blessing of the Fleet may be a centuries old tradition, but event planners in Mount Pleasant, along with the shrimpers themselves, have taken to social media to keep up with the times and keep the annual festival thriving.", "title": "Blessing of the Fleet organizers, shrimpers make a social media push to buy local", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150426/PC16/150429438/AR/0/AR-150429438.jpg?201504262108", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150429438}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Blessing of the Fleet organizers, shrimpers make a social media push to buy local , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Blessing of the Fleet,Magwood,Mount Pleasant,shrimp boats,shrimpers", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-26T20:56:19Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-26T21:08:00Z", "author": "Melissa Boughton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Blessing of the Fleet may be a centuries old tradition, but event planners in Mount Pleasant, along with the shrimpers themselves, have taken to social media to keep up with the times and keep the annual festival thriving."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f74\"", "article_summary": "Led by one of the U.S. Coast Guard boats, there were 13 local shrimpers and fishermen that followed in their boats.\n\u201cThere is so much good, local seafood, there\u2019s really no need to buy the other, imported, stuff,\u201d she said.\nHundreds turned out on the hot and sunny day for the 28th annual Blessing of the Fleet and Seafood Festival at Mount Pleasant\u2019s Memorial Waterfront Park.\nWayne Magwood\u2019s oldest daughter, said the there\u2019s also been a big social media push among the shrimpers and fishermen to market their seafood.\nDan Martin, of Mount Pleasant, said he\u2019s been attending the festival for a \u201clong, long, long time,\u201d and was pleased with this year\u2019s celebration."}
