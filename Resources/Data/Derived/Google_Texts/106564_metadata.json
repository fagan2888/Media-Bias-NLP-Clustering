Despite some marginally positive news on medium-term deficits -- Kevin has more here -- our long-term debts and obligations are dangerously unsustainable. The Associated Press summarizes CBO's core findings:\n\n\n\n\n\nA new government study says federal health care and retirement programs are threatening to overwhelm the federal budget and harm the economy in coming decades unless Washington finds the political will to restrain their growth. The Congressional Budget Office report says government spending on health care and Social Security would double, relative to the size of the economy, in 25 years and that spending on other programs like defense, transportation and education would decline to its smallest level by the same measure since the Great Depression. The report is one of a series by the agency and other budget watchdogs warning that spiraling long-term debt threatens to crowd out private investment, raise interest rates and limit Washington's ability to respond to a financial crisis.\n\n\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, perhaps best known for his string of attempts to corral these issues with needed reforms, pounced on the news. His bullet-point analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\nA Large Debt Hurts Jobs \u2014 Debt held by the public is projected to grow rapidly as a share of the economy in the years ahead from 73 percent today to 100 percent in 2038. CBO warns that \u201cthe high and rising amount of [projected] debt . . . would have significant negative consequences for both the economy and the federal budget.\u201d Spending Drives the Debt \u2014 CBO projects that government spending will increase as a share of the economy from 20.8 percent today to 26.2 percent by 2038\u2014a nearly 26 percent increase. The aging of the baby-boom generation, rising health-care costs, and Obamacare are \u201cexpected to steadily boost the government\u2019s spending.\u201d Obamacare Won\u2019t Help \u2014 The report warns that the President\u2019s health-care law won\u2019t stop the explosion in health-care costs. Mandatory spending on health care will increase by 74 percent from 4.6 percent of GDP today to 8.0 percent of GDP over the next 25 years. Over the next decade, Obamacare will account for over half the growth in government spending on health care. Higher Taxes Will Cost Jobs \u2014 CBO warns that if we raise taxes, as the President and his party\u2019s leaders insist, our economy will hit the brakes. The report says higher tax rates \u201cwould discourage people from working and saving, further reducing output and income.\u201d Entitlement Reform Still Necessary \u2014 Entitlement programs\u2014namely Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid\u2014and interest payments are driving our debt. CBO projects that government spending in these areas will consume 100 percent of total revenues by 2043.\n\n\n\nAEI's Jim Pethokoukis, formerly of Reuters, flags another troubling nugget within CBO's report. Namely, the primary 'top line' data point disseminate in the media (publicly-held debt will reach 100 percent of GDP by 2038) is likely a best-case scenario. Why?\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the next 25 years, Americans will be taxed more to pay for a federal government that will more purely become a redistribution, wealth-transfer mechanism. Taxes and spending at record highs. America as a nuclear-armed insurance company. But here\u2019s the thing: that forecast, as the CBO notes, does not factor in \u201cthe harm that growing debt would cause to the economy.\u201d Hey, that would be a good thing to know, right? Well, you have to dig deeper into the CBO study to find those numbers. And when you take into account stuff like how deficits might \u201ccrowd out\u201d investment in factories and computers and how people might respond to changes in after-tax wages, you find the debt is much, much larger, closer to 200% of GDP.\n\n\n\nPethokoukis notes that the worst-case scenario would lead to the public debt ballooning to 250 percent GDP, at which point CBO's economic model essentially breaks. Cannot compute. The \"official\" US national debt is approaching $17 trillion. With unpaid-for, long-term obligations known as \"unfunded liabilities\" factored in, the real number is closer to $90 trillion. As the hapless residents of Detroit have learned the hard way, ignoring long-horizon \"tomorrow\" problems eventually packs a destructive punch. As the Beltway gears up for another battle over raising the debt ceiling, a parade of elected Democrats have stated on the record that the US government does not have a spending problem. By roughly a two-to-one margin, Americans oppose Congress authorizing another increase in the federal government's borrowing authority. Though a hike is all but certain, Republicans are seeking to use this leverage point to force denialist Democrats into supporting off-setting spending reductions and other reforms. Congress and the president approved a debt ceiling increase of more than $2 trillion in 2011. Rapacious government spending has eaten through all of that borrowing in just over two years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iceberg ahead..05/25/2016 14:57:15PM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Iceberg ahead.", "title": "Guy Benson - CBO Warns: Long-term Debt Threatens to 'Overwhelm' Federal Budget", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2013/09/17/cbo-warns-longterm-debt-will-overwhelm-federal-budget-n1702405", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/259/0408ee06-7bfd-48d2-8137-7e01f5222852.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Iceberg ahead.", "title": "Guy Benson - CBO Warns: Long-term Debt Threatens to 'Overwhelm' Federal Budget", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2013/09/17/cbo-warns-longterm-debt-will-overwhelm-federal-budget-n1702405", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/259/0408ee06-7bfd-48d2-8137-7e01f5222852.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "CBO Warns: Long-term Debt Threatens to 'Overwhelm' Federal Budget, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf85\"", "article_summary": "The Associated Press summarizes CBO's core findings:A new government study says federal health care and retirement programs are threatening to overwhelm the federal budget and harm the economy in coming decades unless Washington finds the political will to restrain their growth.\nwould have significant negative consequences for both the economy and the federal budget.\u201d Spending Drives the Debt \u2014 CBO projects that government spending will increase as a share of the economy from 20.8 percent today to 26.2 percent by 2038\u2014a nearly 26 percent increase.\nCongress and the president approved a debt ceiling increase of more than $2 trillion in 2011.\nCBO warns that \u201cthe high and rising amount of [projected] debt .\nBy roughly a two-to-one margin, Americans oppose Congress authorizing another increase in the federal government's borrowing authority."}
