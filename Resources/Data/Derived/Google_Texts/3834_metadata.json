It is expected that since they have the majority in both chambers, that bill will pass and the President will naturally veto it. Therefore, 34 Senators would prevent the necessary two-thirds majority needed for a veto override.\n\nThe White House has given recent indications, however, that they would like to reach 41 votes in the Senate so that they can filibuster the motion and stop it there.\n\nThere are currently 46 Democrats in the Senate. So far only two have announced their opposition, Chuck Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of New Jersey.\n\nRecently, President Obama conducted an interview with Philadelphia\u2019s 6abc, in an attempt to convince Pennsylvanians and Sen. Casey to support the deal.\n\n\u201cAt some point it has to be a vote, I think, of conscience,\u201d Casey told Tamari, adding \u201cand I have many very good friends who will disagree with the decision, I\u2019m certain of that.\u201d\n\nYou can read Sen. Casey\u2019s full dissertation on the Iranian nuclear deal here.\n\nUPDATE: Barbara Mikulski of Maryland has since stated she will support the deal, meaning it has enough support to avoid a veto override.\n\nSeptember 1st, 2015 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Senate, Top Stories | 63 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Inquirer is reporting that Sen.
