Four of 39 went unsold.\n\nRelated: 15 Stunning Works of Stick Art\n\n\"The sale was overwhelmingly well-priced and tailored to today's tastes,\" said Brooke Lampley, head of Impressionist and modern art. \"We had participation from every part of the world,\" she added, with strong representation from the United States, Europe and Asia. Four of the evening's 10 highest-priced works were bought by clients from Britain.\n\nAmong other highlights, Alberto Giacometti's \"Stele III\" sculpture fetched $9.9 million, well above the high estimate of $6.5 million, while Joan Miro's \"Tuilerie a Mont-roig\" sold for $8.7 million, against an estimate of $5 million to $8 million.\n\nThe lone significant casualty was Fernand Leger's \"Les constructeurs avec arbre,\" which had been estimated to sell for $16 million to $22 million, but went unsold.\n\nThe fall auctions continue next week, when Sotheby's and Christie's hold their sales of post-war and contemporary art, a category marked by spiking prices which for years has eclipsed the once-dominant Impressionist and modern arena.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A celebrated 1881 portrait by French Impressionist Edouard Manet on Wednesday smashed", "title": "$65.1 Million for a Manet at Christie\u2019s Smashes Record", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/06/651-Million-Manet-Christie-s-Smashes-Record", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Christie_Employee_Manet_La_Printemps.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/06/651-Million-Manet-Christie-s-Smashes-Record", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Christie_Employee_Manet_La_Printemps.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A celebrated 1881 portrait by French Impressionist Edouard Manet on Wednesday smashed", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04de\"", "article_summary": "Among other highlights, Alberto Giacometti's \"Stele III\" sculpture fetched $9.9 million, well above the high estimate of $6.5 million, while Joan Miro's \"Tuilerie a Mont-roig\" sold for $8.7 million, against an estimate of $5 million to $8 million.\nA celebrated 1881 portrait by French Impressionist Edouard Manet on Wednesday smashed the record for the artist when it sold for $65.1 million at Christie's, going far towards the auction house's solid total takings of $165.6 million.\nChristie's officials worked to keep estimates conservative, and the strategy paid off handsomely as more than half the offerings exceeded the high estimate.\nThe lone significant casualty was Fernand Leger's \"Les constructeurs avec arbre,\" which had been estimated to sell for $16 million to $22 million, but went unsold.\nThe strong results were a testament to \"the widespread interest in Impressionist and modern art,\" said Doug Woodham, president of Christie's Americas."}
