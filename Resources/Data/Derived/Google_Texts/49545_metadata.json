Pinky swear.\n\nAt least that's what commissioner Roger Goodell told CBS News This Morning host Norah O'Donnell today as he tried to salvage what little face he had left in the wake of the scandal surrounding the former Baltimore Ravens running back.\n\nIn fact, Goodell goes so far to say that police flat out denied the league access to any footage stating:\n\nWe were told that was not something we would have access to. On multiple occasions, we asked for it. And on multiple occasions we were told no. I understand that there may be legal restrictions on them sharing that with us. And we've heard that from attorneys general and former attorneys general.\n\nNow, the Associated Press reports that law enforcement did in fact send NFL executives a full copy of surveillance footage from the incident back in April citing evidence of a 12-second voicemail from an NFL staff member confirming that the video had indeed arrived on April 9.\n\nGoodell originally suspended Rice for two games in July for the domestic violence incident\u2014a decision that was widely panned by pundits and fans. After TMZ released the full tapes on Monday, the Ravens terminated Rice's contract and the league suspended him indefinitely.\n\nThe latest revelations further suspicion that Goodell and other top execs had seen the tape and are covering up knowledge of the incident.
