Unfortunately, we\u2019re not getting it.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nTake the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold the greatest expansion of federal power since the New Deal by rewriting the Affordable Care Act (aka \u201cObamaCare\u201d) to transform the requirement that Americans purchase government-approved health insurance from a mandate enforced by a financial penalty into an option with an additional tax payment for those who choose not to exercise it.\n\nNever mind that the Affordable Care Act refers to this payment as a \u201cpenalty\u201d 18 times; and never mind Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 recognition of the fact that the \u201c[t]he most straightforward reading of the mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance.\u201d\n\nAccording to Roberts\u2019 understanding, the justices\u2019 role was not to strike down or uphold the law based on \u201cthe most natural interpretation of the mandate,\u201d but instead to bring their own creativity to bear in rationalizing a constitutional basis for the law if possible.\n\nBut that\u2019s not judging; it\u2019s advocacy. Judges are supposed to remain strictly neutral in all cases, including ones challenging the constitutionality of a law.\n\nRecall how Roberts compared judges to umpires in his confirmation hearing to be Chief Justice. Umpires, of course, do not bend over backwards to avoid calling outs or strikes against the home team the way Roberts did in changing ObamaCare\u2019s insurance provision from a mandate to an option in order to uphold the law.\n\nFor those who take seriously James Madison\u2019s assurance that the powers of the federal government would be \u201cfew and defined,\u201d that decision was a travesty.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not an anomaly.\n\nInstead, it reflects a judicial mindset much in vogue among conservatives (and sophisticated liberals who understand its power to clear the way for even more government) that calls for reflexive deference toward the other branches in most areas of law -- from the allocation of power between federal and state governments, to economic and business regulations, to property rights and the use of tax policy to manipulate individual behavior.\n\nCompare the absence of meaningful judicial review in those areas with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s recent lament in The New York Times that the current Supreme Court is \u201cone of the most activist courts in history,\u201d or Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s characterization of activist judges as \u201cMullahs of the West.\u201d\n\nEven Justice Anthony Kennedy has jumped on the bandwagon, arguing that \u201c[a]ny society that relies on nine unelected judges to resolve the most serious issues of the day is not a functioning democracy.\u201d\n\nBut America is not a democracy. It is a constitutional republic in which majorities are forbidden from pursuing a host of policies, including ones that violate individual rights or enable legislators and bureaucrats to exercise powers they do not lawfully possess.\n\nPreventing those things from happening is not judicial activism; it\u2019s judicial engagement. And as recent events involving the IRS, the NSA, the Department of Justice and countless other misbehaving agencies make plain, we need a lot more of it.\n\nClark Neily is a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice and director of the Institute's Center for Judicial Engagement.
