The total value rose to $1.1 billion this year, compared with $793 million last year. This year\u2019s total is the highest since 2007, Estin.\n\nEstin said there was a major spike in the sale of homes priced above $7.5 million. Among homes priced $1 million to $2 million, sales declined 42 percent, mostly because there is little for-sale inventory. In 2013, 1,078 homes were offered for sale, compared with 956 this year.\n\nEstin said the market \u201ccontinues to be very competitive and price sensitive as buyers still have a number of options to choose from in many cases. Unless priced well, it remains challenging to sell most \u2018average\u2019 properties.\n\nThe average cost of condos in Aspen jumped 20 percent this year to $1,176 per square foot, compared with $976 per square foot last year.\n\nIn the Snowmass Village market, 138 sales closed, compared with 156 last year and total value dropped to $212 million from $203 million in 2013.
