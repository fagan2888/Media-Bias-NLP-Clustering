The findings came in data compiled by ACAView, an Obamacare-measuring project of Athenahealth and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nJosh Gray, head of research at Athenahealth, said the findings disprove \"two nightmare scenarios\" suggested by some prior to the implementation of Obamacare. Those skeptics warned of a double whammy of too many patients to handle and fewer reimbursements for doctors.\n\n\"Neither of those scenarios came to pass,\" Gray said.\n\nThe ACA began taking full effect in 2014, when millions of people gained coverage from private health plans sold through government-run Obamacare exchanges, and others who previously had difficulty buying insurance purchased plans outside the exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "There was actually a drop in the number of patients seen by doctors, who nonetheless had payments rise.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "There was a drop in the number of patients seen by doctors, who still had increased payments.", "title": "About that 'flood' of patients from Obamacare...", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/06/obamacares-md-effect-no-patient-rush-but-more-money.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/10/07/101092540-Tool-Doctor-patient107429853.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There was a drop in the number of patients seen by doctors, who still had increased payments.", "title": "Obamacare's MD effect: No patient rush, but more money", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/06/obamacares-md-effect-no-patient-rush-but-more-money.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/10/07/101092540-Tool-Doctor-patient107429853.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, Politics, Medicaid, Medicare, US: News, Athenahealth Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-10-06T10:51:49-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-10-06T12:33:41-0400", "tag": "Athenahealth Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 103052628, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care, doctors, athena, health insurance, flood, payment"}, "article_summary": "But even in the face of that decline, primary care doctors actually saw a net revenue increase of 3 percent or more from their patients in 2014.\nJosh Gray, head of research at Athenahealth, said the findings disprove \"two nightmare scenarios\" suggested by some prior to the implementation of Obamacare.\nThe findings came in data compiled by ACAView, an Obamacare-measuring project of Athenahealth and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\nThose skeptics warned of a double whammy of too many patients to handle and fewer reimbursements for doctors.\nThe ACA began taking full effect in 2014, when millions of people gained coverage from private health plans sold through government-run Obamacare exchanges, and others who previously had difficulty buying insurance purchased plans outside the exchanges."}
