Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is scheduled to give a speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., Monday morning detailing his plans for a presidential campaign. The 2016 marathon is now officially underway, although in presidential races, being the first off the block isn't necessarily a good thing.\n\nWelcome to Wonkbook. To subscribe by e-mail, click here.

Darla Cameron and Ted Mellnik in The Washington Post.\n\n1. Top story: Ted Cruz 2016\n\nCruz said he's running for president just after midnight Monday. \"Cruz becomes the first major presidential contender to formally declare himself a 2016 candidate, a move likely to upend the dynamics of the nascent presidential race. ... Cruz, 44, a Harvard-and-Princeton-educated lawyer who was elected to the Senate in 2012, is best known for championing controversial efforts to block \u00adimplementation of President Obama\u2019s health-care law in 2013. The crusade led to a 16-day government shutdown.\" Katie Zezima and Robert Costa in The Washington Post.\n\nHis chances are slim. \"The most interesting question about Mr. Cruz\u2019s candidacy is whether he has a very small chance to win or no chance at all. Political scientists argue that the single most important determinant of the outcome of the nomination is support from party elites: those operatives who can staff a winning campaign; the donors who fund it; the elected officials, influencers and interest group leaders who bestow the credibility necessary to persuade voters and affect media coverage. ... Mr. Cruz has done nothing to endear himself to the elites. In April 2013, he was identified as 'The Most Hated Man in the Senate' by Foreign Policy magazine, which described him as 'the human equivalent of one of those flower-squirters that clowns wear on their lapels.' And that was before he led an ill-fated government shutdown over the Affordable Care Act.\" Nate Cohen in The New York Times.\n\nCruz is unrelentingly conservative on everything from health care to gay marriage to money in politics. \"How Cruz affects the 2016 primary will come down to how the other candidates react to him\u2014whether by moving to the right themselves on some issues or by using Cruz as a contrast to try to distinguish themselves as more moderate. Either way, Cruz has spent his last months before officially becoming a presidential candidate highlighting his ability to get on the most conservative side of an issue.\" Scott Bland in National Journal.\n\nHe's also a climate change skeptic, which disturbs California Gov. Jerry Brown. \"Brown, a Democrat, was appearing on NBC's 'Meet the Press' to discuss California\u2019s severe drought. His appearance coincided with news that Cruz, a Texas Republican, will announce his candidacy for president Monday at Liberty University in Virginia. 'That man betokens such a level of ignorance and a direct falsification of the existing scientific data. It's shocking and I think that man has rendered himself absolutely unfit to be running for office,' Brown said.\" David Cohen at Politico.\n\nLUDWIG: Cruz relies on paranoia to rally his supporters. \"In 2010, the former Texas solicitor general claimed that Harvard Law School had employed a dozen communist professors during the time he studied there. Running for office in 2012, Cruz warned supporters about a George Soros-led United Nations environmental initiative to banish golf courses from the local American communities. ... These intricate conspiracies avoid the ambiguity of reality in exchange for simple and easy to understand narratives. Instead of wading into complex issues and weighing ramifications, Cruz sets up straw men.\" The Atlantic.\n\n2. Top opinions\n\nFRUM: America is not exceptional. \"As Americans have become more uncertain of their nation\u2019s continued hegemony, their leaders and would-be leaders have insisted ever more emphatically upon the doctrine of 'American exceptionalism.' As a guide to action, however, the concept is proving of dwindling utility in the 21st century. ... You might think that the last developed country to adopt universal health coverage would closely examine the systems developed elsewhere. You might think the designers of a new healthcare system for America would identify international best practices, while carefully assessing what might be applicable in American conditions and what would not. If so, you\u2019d think wrong. The debate over healthcare reform unfurled with an almost surreal indifference to the rest of the world. Ditto for the debate over financial reform after the crisis of 2008. Ditto the debate over social mobility, over school performance, or over policing of disadvantaged communities.\" The Atlantic.\n\nDIONNE: For a minute there, Republicans were talking seriously about helping the middle class. \"It would be wonderful if conservatives really wanted to deal constructively with the predicament they so passionately describe. But thanks to the House and Senate GOP budgets, we now know that conservatives and Republicans (1) aren\u2019t serious about the plight of working-class and lower-income Americans and (2) would actually make their situations much worse. Their spending plans fail even on conservative terms: They are not fiscally responsible. Instead, they rely on all sorts of magic tricks that shove choices and problems down the road.\" The Washington Post.\n\nHIATT: A progressive compromise would strengthen Social Security. \"Today there are fewer than three workers for every pensioner. In 2030, the ratio will be two to one. ... What would be the rational \u2014 and politically progressive \u2014 response? Raise taxes sufficiently to protect Social Security retirement benefits for the poor and middle class, but limit the burden on working Americans as much as possible, while redirecting some funds from wealthier beneficiaries and taxpayers to programs that young people depend on, such as Head Start, Pell grants and Medicaid.\" The Washington Post.\n\nClose the trade deal in the Pacific. \"Letting this effort collapse would be a grave mistake. ... Lowering barriers to trade is disruptive. Jobs get destroyed and new ones take their place. But this is a criticism of capitalism itself, and of economic growth. And it ignores the central fact about open markets: Globalization has transformed living standards everywhere and, in the developing world, is lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. ... The president should be granted negotiating authority to bring the talks to a conclusion. The whole effort is doomed otherwise. Then, when Congress sees the details, it can decide whether it wants the TPP or not. With so much at stake, letting the talks fold at this stage would be an unforgivable abdication of U.S. leadership.\" The editors of Bloomberg View.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) should run for president. \"Democrats would be making a big mistake if they let Hillary Clinton coast to the presidential nomination without real opposition, and, as a national leader, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren can make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. ... Fairly or not, many Americans already view Clinton skeptically, and waltzing to the nomination may actually hurt her in the November election against the Republican nominee. ... The big-picture debate on financial regulation and income inequality is what\u2019s most at peril if the Democratic primaries come and go without top-notch opponents for Clinton. While she has a great many strengths, Clinton seems far more likely to hew to a cautious approach on economics. Her financial backing from Wall Street, her vote in the Senate to reduce bankruptcy protections, and her past reluctance to raise capital-gains taxes are no secret. Nothing about her record suggests much gumption for financial reform or tackling the deeply entrenched economic problems that increasingly threaten the American dream.\" The editorial board of The Boston Globe.\n\nThe Supreme Court should protect the Clean Air Act. \"The name of the law at issue before the Supreme Court on Wednesday is the Clean Air Act. It is not the Coal Industry Protection Act... Industry supporters point to a single phrase in the law \u2014 that the agency must regulate pollutants only when \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d \u2014 to mean that if a regulation would cost too much in their eyes, it\u2019s not appropriate. ... Standard cost-benefit analyses can never precisely account for environmental risks to public health. Given that reality, why should the cost of any uncertainty always fall on the American public, rather than on the industries that create the health risks to begin with?\" The editorial board of The New York Times.\n\nPolitics gets in the way of science and safety when it comes to landslides, write researchers David R. Montgomery and Joseph Wartman. \"The science of landslide mapping has advanced rapidly, largely because of improvements in remote sensing technologies that allow us to see Earth\u2019s surface in unprecedented detail. Today, it would be possible to create high-resolution hazard maps for the entire nation for significantly less than the estimated $1 billion or more in losses that landslides cause each year in the United States. ... State and local mapping programs have been hampered by a lack of money and, in some cases, politics. Concern about the impact of mapping on development was among the factors that led the North Carolina Legislature to shut down a hazard-mapping initiative in 2011. The effort was begun in 2004 after landslides killed five people in the state.\" The New York Times.\n\n3. In case you missed it\n\nMedical researchers are questioning convictions based on Shaken Baby Syndrome. \"The diagnosis gave a generation of doctors a way to account for unexplained head injuries in babies and prosecutors a stronger case for criminal intent when police had no witnesses, no confessions and only circumstantial evidence. It has also led to more than a decade of fierce debate: Testing has been unable to show whether violent shaking can produce the bleeding and swelling long attributed to the diagnosis, and doctors have found that accidents and diseases can trigger identical conditions in babies. ... In the United States, 16 convictions have been overturned since 2001, including three last year. In Illinois, a federal judge who recently freed a mother of two after nearly a decade in prison called Shaken Baby Syndrome 'more an article of faith than a proposition of science.' Despite the uncertainty, prosecutors are still using the diagnosis to help prove criminal cases beyond a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d against hundreds of parents and caregivers.\" Investigative series. Debbie Cenziper in The Washington Post.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider whether state license plates should feature Confederate flags. \"Nine states let drivers choose specialty license plates featuring the flag and honoring the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which says it seeks to celebrate Southern heritage. But Texas refused to allow the group\u2019s plates, saying the flag was offensive. ... The Sons of Confederate Veterans filed a First Amendment challenge, winning in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans.\" Adam Liptak in The New York Times.\n\nA lawsuit claims au pairs are underpaid. \"The attorneys who filed the lawsuit say the sponsor agencies have turned the au pair program into a source for the cheapest child care in America, a far cry from its roots as a cultural exchange program. Pay for au pairs has remained extraordinarily low, even as salaries for traditional nannies and the cost of day care have soared in recent years.\" Lydia DePillis in The Washington Post.\n\nUPCOMING EVENT: Washington Post Live presents \u201cChanging the Menu,\u201d March 26 at Arena Stage.
