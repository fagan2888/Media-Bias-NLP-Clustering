Westar Energy and Kansas City Power & Light will both ask for rate increases in 2015 to recover some of the costs of environmental upgrades at the LaCygne power plant.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that the companies, which co-own the plant in Linn County, spent $1.2 billion on the upgrades and have recovered about half the costs through previous rate cases.

KCP&L filed Friday for a 12.5 percent rate increase for its Kansas customers, saying it wanted an annual revenue increase of $67.3 million.

The Kansas City Star reported that besides the La Cygne environmental upgrades, the utility also attributed the request to infrastructure upgrades at the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant. Westar will submit its rate request in March.
