(Whitney Bryen / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nNearly 100 people gathered outside Lyons Elementary School on Sunday afternoon clapped, waved their hands in the air and blew kisses in honor of the former teacher, coach and resident who died during last year's flood.\n\nAmy Hoh, one of Gerald \"Gerry\" Boland's daughters, asked the crowd to celebrate her father's life and legacy by performing the three gestures, which signal a job well done to her deaf dogs.\n\nBoland was a teacher and coach in Lyons schools for 30 years and was the only Lyons resident who died during the 2013 flood.\n\nOne year later, Boland's three children, Amy Hoh, Holli Stetson and Brent Boland, unveiled a sandstone in front of the elementary school in remembrance of their dad. The stone reads \"May we forever remember Gerald Boland, teacher, coach and lifelong resident of Lyons. Through caring, compassion and leadership, he taught our children well for 30 years.\"\n\nFrom left: Holli Stetson, Amy Hoh and Brent Boland unveil a stone outside Lyons Elementary School Sunday honoring their father, Gerald Boland, who died during last year's flood.

But the stories told by former students and friends of Boland softened the blow.\n\n\"It was a beautiful event after a tough week,\" Cheron Boland said. \"We're ready for the week to be over.\"\n\nHoh recognized and thanked the men who rescued her mother from her drowning car.\n\nLyons resident Rusty Ripple drove the front-loader that carried Cheron Boland from the raging water. Evan Patronik of the Lyons Fire Protection District helped her into the vehicle's scoop and held her hand and comforted her during the evacuation.\n\n\"Amy said I was just doing my job and, honestly, that's what it is,\" Patronik said. \"That's what I signed up for, but Rusty, he's the real hero. He's just a guy with a front-loader who had the courage to perform some pretty incredible rescues when his town needed him.\"\n\nThe Celebration of Life ceremony ended with one of Gerald Boland's former students, George Finnell, performing two songs, including one that he wrote about the last time he saw Boland.\n\n\"Mr. Boland lost his life that very night, the night the river rose,\" Finnell sang. \"We all lost a little bit of our lives the night the river rose.\"\n\nContact Times-Call community reporter Whitney Bryen at 303-684-5274 or wbryen@times-call.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/colorado-flood/ci_26533344/lyons-honors-gerald-boland-only-resident-who-died", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0914/20140914_053819_BolandCeremony_79_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Whitney Bryen \n  Times-Call community reporter", "description": "Nearly 100 people gathered outside Lyons Elementary School on Sunday afternoon clapped, waved their hands in the air and blew kisses in honor of the former teacher, coach and resident who died during last year's flood.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26533344:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-14T17:36:23-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/colorado-flood/ci_26533344/lyons-honors-gerald-boland-only-resident-who-died", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0914/20140914_053819_BolandCeremony_79.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Nearly 100 people gathered outside Lyons Elementary School on Sunday afternoon clapped, waved their hands in the air and blew kisses in honor of the former teacher, coach and resident who died during last year's flood.", "title": "Lyons honors Gerald Boland, only resident who died during 2013 flood"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Nearly 100 people gathered outside Lyons Elementary School on Sunday afternoon clapped, waved their hands in the air and blew kisses in honor of the former teacher, coach and resident who died during last year's flood.", "title": "Lyons honors Gerald Boland, only resident who died during 2013 flood", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/news/colorado-flood/ci_26533344/lyons-honors-gerald-boland-only-resident-who-died", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0914/20140914_053819_BolandCeremony_79.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-14T17:36:23-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Lyons honors Gerald Boland, only resident who died during 2013 flood", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0914/20140914_053819_BolandCeremony_79.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Colorado Flood", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2014-09-14T18:27:19-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-14T17:31:00-0600", "byline": "By Whitney BryenTimes-Call", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-09-14T17:42:05-0600", "news_keywords": "colorado flood, weld county, longmont, times call, longmont flood, st vrain, flooding, carbon valley, longmont times call, big thompson flood, big tompson"}, "article_summary": "Boland was a teacher and coach in Lyons schools for 30 years and was the only Lyons resident who died during the 2013 flood.\nFrom left: Holli Stetson, Amy Hoh and Brent Boland unveil a stone outside Lyons Elementary School Sunday honoring their father, Gerald Boland, who died during last year's flood.\nThe stone reads \"May we forever remember Gerald Boland, teacher, coach and lifelong resident of Lyons.\nFormer teacher, coach remembered during Celebration of Life ceremony SundayThe crowd waves their hands at the Celebration of Life ceremony Sunday for Gerald Boland at Lyons Elementary School.\n(Whitney Bryen / Longmont Times-Call)A sandstone bench that reads \"In loving memory of Gerald Boland, teacher, coach, father and mentor to all\" was also dedicated near the school's bus lane, which was renamed Boland Lane."}
