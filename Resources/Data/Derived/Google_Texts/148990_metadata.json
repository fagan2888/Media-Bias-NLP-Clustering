It doesn't take long before his audience-come-congregation is voicing its assent. \"Yes sir!\" calls out one man; \"Oh yes!\" agrees another; \"He's right!\" says a third.\n\n\n\nDr. Ben Carson is interviewed during a live streaming Web-A-Thon with Wake Up America (Laura Segall/Getty Images)\n\nThe monologue is a reprise of the speech that brought Dr Carson to overnight political stardom last year when he spoke at a televised White House prayer breakfast, decrying America's fiscal and moral decay while President Barack Obama looked on, fuming and humiliated.\n\nAmerica, the \"pinnacle nation\", risks going the way of the Roman Empire, warned Dr Carson. \"Moral decay, fiscal irresponsibility \u2026 They [the Romans] destroyed themselves. If you don't think that can happen to America, you get out your books and you start reading.\"\n\nDr Carson was already no stranger to attention \u2013 George Bush had awarded him the Presidential Medal of Honour, America's highest civilian award, and his life was made into a 2009 TV movie called \"Gifted Hands\" \u2013 but nothing could have prepared him for the instantaneous explosion of interest.\n\n\"I expected a reaction, but nothing like what actually happened,\" he told The Telegraph before his Somerset speech. \"I thought when I retired I was going to learn to play the organ and get good at golf, but then came the prayer breakfast and it all changed.\"\n\nThe 26-minute speech launched a conservative media phenomenon that shows little signs of fading 18 months after it began. Even the usually sober Wall Street Journal was prompted to write an ecstatic editorial titled: \"Ben Carson for President.\"\n\nDr Carson remains the longest of long-shots, but until the race begins, the question of whether he could really be president is moot. By getting out ahead of the Republican field, he now has a chance to impact significantly how the GOP nomination fight plays out in 2016.\n\n\"He's a smart guy and he's got star quality,\" says Jeffrey Lord, a former Reagan aide and Republican Party historian and commentator. \"He can really attract crowds and get them going in a way that others can't manage. That's a very important quality to have \u2013 Barack Obama certainly once had it.\"\n\nEven for conservatives it is a big stretch to compare Mr Carson's political acumen to that of America's current president, but it is also true that like with then-Senator Obama back in 2007, the Carson phenomenon has a demonstrated ability to attract interest from outside the political mainstream.\n\nAt a recent event in Iowa, the state whose caucuses will fire the starting gun on 2016 nomination fight, local operatives were reportedly \"floored\" recently by the turnout for Carson \u2013 not because of the numbers, but because of the number of unfamiliar faces.\n\nAlready the 63-year-old is running in second place in recent Iowa polls behind only Mitt Romney, a testament to the name recognition generated by the prayer breakfast, his punditry work on the conservative Fox News network and his incessant rounds of public appearances.\n\nHe has promised to declare formally his candidacy by May, and after Republicans stormed the midterm elections last month he says the Lord appears to be pushing him firmly away from golf and organ lessons and towards a bid to save the nation.\n\n\"To see the children out with their signs saying 'you gotta save our future',\" Dr Carson says with a shake of the head, his voice suddenly loaded with sadness. \"You recognise that sometimes you just have to do what you're called upon to do.\"\n\nThe Carson backstory \u2013 a boy with a semi-literate mother who made it to Yale and became a neurosurgeon through sheer hard work and determination \u2013 plays straight into the conservative ideals of an America where everyone is left free to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.\n\nLike America itself, he is a mass of contradictions: a scientist who does not accept evolution, a rhetorical pyrotechnician who hardly ever raises his voice and a black man from a poor upbringing who espouses conservative ideology.\n\nHis campaign prospects are given weight by the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, a promotional group similar to the Ready for Hillary organisation that is paving the way for Mrs Clinton's putative 2016 run. Astonishingly, the pro-Carson group out-raised the pro-Clinton one last quarter.\n\nIf the enthusiasm continues and the cash keeps rolling in, Carson has the potential to upset the form book on the Republican right, reckons Mr Lord, stealing votes from other Tea Party favourites like Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and setting up a duel with an establishment candidate.\n\n\"Somebody \u2013 Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz \u2013 is going to emerge as the 'outsider' candidate to go up against the perceived 'insider', a Chris Christie or a Jeb Bush,\" he adds. \"There is this vast pool of sentiment out there that is actively hostile to Washington DC and its insiders and he's tapping into it.\"\n\nBeltway pundits have queued up to write off Dr Carson as just another 'book-tour Republican' who will run simply to boost his profile and sell more copies his latest tome, although his title \"One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America's Future\" is already a New York Times bestseller.\n\nHe has been castigated on the left for a series of politically incorrect \"gaffes\" that included describing the ObamaCare reforms as \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\" and arguing that contemporary America is \"very much like Nazi Germany\".\n\nHe also implicitly compared homosexuality to bestiality when weighing in on the gay marriage debate and most recently blamed the Ferguson riots on the \"women's lib\" movement of the 1970s for creating so many broken homes.\n\nSuch outbursts may scandalise the left and are even too strong for many establishment Republicans, but back among the crowd in Somerset \u2013 mostly white and intensely religious \u2013 that is the kind of straight-shooting they would like to see in the Oval Office.\n\n\"He doesn't have to flower his words,\" enthuse Darrell and Christy Bartley, a couple who bought a table at the fundraising dinner just for the chance to see Dr Carson. \"I hope he runs for president because he tells it like it is.\"\n\nDr Carson appears to know this, conceding in a rare moment of candour during our interview that comparing ObamaCare to slavery might have been injudicious, but was also necessary to attract attention and make his point. \"They're not going to understand it if you make it all powder-puff,\" he says with a smile.\n\nBack up on stage, game face on, he introduces his talk with a gleeful disclaimer that he is \"not politically correct\", warning that he may even \"offend some people\" with his truth-telling, before going on to tell his audience exactly the kind of truth it wants to hear.\n\nIn a talk sprinkled with one-liners, he declares America's $18 trillion national debt to be \"immoral\", laments falling education standards and welfare dependency, and castigates Mr Obama's failures \u2013 from his \"unconstitutional\" health care reforms to the rise of Islamic State.\n\n\"It's simple,\" Mr Carson says of the threat posed by the Isil militants, \"I would make 'I-sis' into 'I-was'\". It may not amount to a foreign policy position, but it draws roars of laughter from the audience.\n\nWashington's political cognoscenti laugh at Dr Carson too, although no one out in the conservative heartlands cares \u2013 they are too busy dreaming that come November 2016 a Republican candidate \u2013 perhaps even one like Dr Carson \u2013 may yet have the last laugh.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03129/ben_carson_3129562k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@pmdfoster"}, "keywords": "ben carson, us, republicans, election, president, 2016, Republicans,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;North_America;USA;Republicans;Peter_Foster;US_Politics", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/republicans", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "ben carson, us, republicans, election, president, 2016", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Ben Carson prepares for next operation - to win America for the Republicans", "section-id": 2335, "GSAGenre": "republicans", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-republicans", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/republicans", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "As US presidential candidates jostle for position ahead of the 2016 election, a firebrand neurosurgeon who once embarrassed Barack Obama is stealing the spotlight", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 11276120, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-06", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-republicans", "last-modified": "2014-12-06", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 1516, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Peter Foster", "tag": "US Politics", "subsection": "Republicans", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 9, "imagecount": 2, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 11276120, "tmgads.articleid": 11276120, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Ben Carson prepares for next operation \u2013 to win America for the Republicans  \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/republicans/11276120/Ben-Carson-prepares-for-next-operation-to-win-America-for-the-Republicans.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03129/ben_carson_3129562k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"11276120\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-06T06:00:55Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"Peter Foster\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"Republicans\",\"Peter Foster\",\"US Politics\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "As US presidential candidates jostle for position ahead of the 2016 election, a firebrand neurosurgeon who once embarrassed Barack Obama is stealing the spotlight", "title": "Ben Carson prepares for next operation - to win America for the Republicans", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/republicans/11276120/Ben-Carson-prepares-for-next-operation-to-win-America-for-the-Republicans.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03129/ben_carson_3129562k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "republicans", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.republicans", "DCSext.author": "Peter Foster", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-12-05 16:36"}, "article_summary": "Even the usually sober Wall Street Journal was prompted to write an ecstatic editorial titled: \"Ben Carson for President.\"\nFor nearly two decades Dr Ben Carson was famous for being the neurosurgeon who successfully separated twins who had been joined at the head, even though many experts had warned that it was impossible.\nAmerica, the \"pinnacle nation\", risks going the way of the Roman Empire, warned Dr Carson.\nDr Carson remains the longest of long-shots, but until the race begins, the question of whether he could really be president is moot.\n\"To see the children out with their signs saying 'you gotta save our future',\" Dr Carson says with a shake of the head, his voice suddenly loaded with sadness."}
