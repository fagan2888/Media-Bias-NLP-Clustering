But they do know they are spending more time learning how to think deeper and more critically, even in their art classes.\n\nThe Common Core lays out goals for students in language arts and math, but Hillsborough County school district teachers of non-core subjects \u2013 like Carpenter \u2013 are using the standards in their classes, too.\n\nThe state adopted the educational goals for students in 2010 and renamed them the Florida Standards last month. And over the summer, district art teachers \u2013 as well as teachers of other electives such as music, physical education and drama \u2013 received Common Core training.\n\nCarpenter is embracing the standards, which supporters say are more rigorous and will better help students prepare for college and careers. In fact, she said they reaffirm some of the methods she was already using, such as teaching students to find a deeper meaning when observing others\u2019 artwork.\n\n\u201cI think people get the idea that because it has the word \u2018core\u2019 in it, that it\u2019s not stuff that we do,\u201d said Carpenter, who has taught for 16 years. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite. So many of the expectations in Common Core are deeply rooted in our arts curriculum. We look at a piece of art and say, \u2018What was going on financially and politically?\u2019 We make those cross-curricular connections all the time.\u201d\n\nCarpenter works the standards into her photography classes, as well as her drawing, painting and studio classes. She uses more words with her students that Common Core emphasizes, such as \u201cevidence.\u201d She also is adjusting to carving out time for more class discussion.\n\n\u201cThere are days we may not be making art,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe, we are spending the whole day doing a close reading. It might take a whole class to do it effectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cClose reading\u201d exercises \u2013 or reading something multiple times \u2013 are frequently done in language arts classes.\n\nIn her second-period photography class on Friday, Carpenter split the students into groups of three and four to analyze a photograph called \u201cHouse of Hysteria,\u201d taken in 1941 by Clarence John Laughlin and depicting a decrepit building in Louisiana with no roof, a girl and a hand reaching in from the corner.\n\nThe class is studying shadows, which are prominent in the photograph.\n\n\u201cWrite any word that comes to mind when you\u2019re looking at that image,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cSecond, look at the image and tell me what mood or feeling you get when you look at it.\u201d\n\nThe students got to work, first writing down their own answers and then discussing them with their groups.\n\nWords that came to mind: creepy, sketchy, depressing, disorienting.\n\nThen, they wrote down art-related vocabulary words they thought of when looking at the image: value, space and texture.\n\nFinally, Carpenter asked the students what message they thought the photographer was trying to send.\n\nOne group thought the photographer was trying to convey something that happened in the past that still affects him. Another suggested that the outstretched hand in the photograph was meant to show that \u201cin the midst of hysteria, there\u2019s always hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe artist was trying to express the craziness of modern life,\u201d Carpenter explained, at the end of the lesson, which took up the majority of the 50-minute class. \u201cHe\u2019s saying, \u2018this is what\u2019s happening now in our society.\u2019\u201d\n\nFreshman Celia Adams, 15, said she doesn\u2019t know much about Florida\u2019s education standards, but she enjoys the way Carpenter conducts her class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite classes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou learn things you use in other classes and real life.\u201d\n\nRylie Seda, 14, agrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a photographer,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing in this class has made me want to more. She actually shows examples.\u201d\n\nAcross the county, at Gorrie Elementary School in Hyde Park, students are also getting a taste of the new standards in their art classes.\n\nThere, art teacher Karen Barmore has her students \u201cread\u201d artwork they are studying. She has them describe, analyze, interpret and judge each piece.\n\n\u201cI have children tell me all the time, \u2018I didn\u2019t like that painting in the beginning, but now that I saw the meaning I\u2019m looking at it differently,\u2019\u201d said Barmore, who was a finalist for the county\u2019s teacher of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s very Common Core. Teaching children to look deeper, not just on the surface, is important.\u201d\n\nekourkounis@tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7999\n\nTwitter: @ErinKTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 09 Mar 2014 15:27:08 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2013 The students in Nicole Carpenter\u2019s Photography 1 class at Plant City High School may not have not heard much about the Common Core State Standards.
