That hotline will be up and running in January 2015.\n\n\u201cAlthough my plan had been to complete my second term as commissioner and then to continue serving Douglas County as a state representative, the opportunity to serve and protect our state\u2019s youngest and most vulnerable population was an opportunity I could not let pass me by,\u201d Hilbert said in a statement.\n\nHilbert was elected Douglas County commissioner in 2006 and re-elected to a second term in 2010.\n\nA committee of the Douglas County Republican Party will choose who will fill Hilbert\u2019s seat, which expires in November. One potential candidate is Douglas County Sheriff David Weaver, who already is running for Hilbert\u2019s seat.\n\nThe committee has 10 days from Hilbert\u2019s last day on the commission to name a temporary county commissioner.\n\n\u201cDouglas County\u2019s loss is the state\u2019s gain, and great news for families and children in Colorado,\u201d Commissioner Jill Repella said.\n\nCarlos Illescas: 303-954-1175, cillescas@denverpost.com or twitter.com/cillescasdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Douglas County commissioner resigning to run new child welfare hotline", "title": "Douglas County commissioner resigning to run new child welfare hotline", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/18/douglas-county-commissioner-resigning-to-run-new-child-welfare-hotline/", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140618__jack_hilbertp1.jpg", "height": 625}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140618__jack_hilbertp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-18T12:08:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:19:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaea7\"", "article_summary": "Douglas County Commissioner Jack Hilbert is leaving the board July 13 and is taking a job with the Colorado Department of Human Services.\nHilbert was elected Douglas County commissioner in 2006 and re-elected to a second term in 2010.\nHilbert will take over as systems manager for the new child welfare hotline of the child welfare protection division in human services.\nA committee of the Douglas County Republican Party will choose who will fill Hilbert\u2019s seat, which expires in November.\nThe committee has 10 days from Hilbert\u2019s last day on the commission to name a temporary county commissioner."}
