But getting there requires data governance teamwork. At the State Healthcare IT Connect Summit in Baltimore on April 1, health IT leaders from several states discussed the challenges they are trying to overcome.\n\nSean Vinck, CIO of the State of Illinois, teamed up with Kathleen Monahan, executive director of the Illinois Framework Project, to talk about their effort to create a multi-agency collaborative to share technology and business processes among 60 programs in seven health and human services agencies.\n\n\u201cThese seven agencies have signed an agreement committing themselves to the idea,\u201d Monahan said, which means agency directors don\u2019t own their data anymore. \"The state owns it. We want them to think about data as an asset to be used to benefit the state and not kept or owned by an agency,\u201d she continued. \u201cOne of the first things we did was bring together agency general counsels to begin discussions of how to start sharing data.\u201d\n\nDuring a separate panel discussion, Rex Plouck, portfolio manager in the Ohio Governor\u2019s Office of Health Transformation, said a few years ago Ohio health agencies struggled to work on enterprise data governance. \u201cAgencies were trying to work together, but it came down to attorneys slowing things down working on contracts between agencies,\u201d he said. But recent legislation clarified that projects sponsored by the Office of Health Transformation don\u2019t have to have those types of legal contracts replicated in data-sharing agreements. That has sped up data and resource sharing, he added.\n\nVinck said recently passed legislation in Illinois, House Bill 1040, created an open data platform and regulatory architecture. \u201cIt requires us to make architecture choices that are presumptively open about data we collect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also requires agencies to plan application development to follow the federal cloud-first model.\u201d\n\nMonahan said her organization has developed a governance structure and handbook for its executive steering committee, which includes a set of attributes of good governance they could agree upon. \u201cNow when they discuss tough issues, they have ground rules,\u201d she said. \"And we only bring them together when we have something really challenging for them to work on.\u201d Steering committee members face a bigger challenge taking data-sharing plans back to their agency to get 2,000 employees to go along with it, she noted.\n\nVinck added that all the state agency silos grew up because the agencies report up to the federal agencies that fund them. \u201cWe brought in representatives of three federal agencies that fund health and human services programs at the state level, and it was the first time they had met each other. So it is difficult to corral all the cats at the state level, but we also have to corral them at the federal level, too.\u201d\n\nSonny Bhagowalia, chief advisor for technology and cyber-security for the State of Hawaii, talked about the state\u2019s health-care transformation plan developed during a six-month planning process made possible by a federal grant from the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Among its goals are enrolling at least 80 percent of state residents in a patient-centered medical home by 2107, and implementing programs to help high-risk/high-need individuals by establishing Medicaid Health Homes and Community Care Networks.\n\nThe transformation relies on an enterprise architecture that allows data sharing and analytics to feed back into the system for improvements.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, business process re-engineering and governance are the hardest issues to work through in state government,\u201d Bhagowalia said. \u201cWhat is needed is a will to drive collaboration. This is solvable.\u201d\n\nDuring another panel about health insurance exchanges, leaders from Connecticut and Rhode Island both said their organizations had initially deferred building data warehouses until their systems were up and running, so their analytics capabilities are limited so far. \u201cWe hope to have that completed by the July time frame,\u201d said James Wadleigh, CIO of Access Health Connecticut. Initially, data analysis will help the organization understand the demographics of who signed up to assist with marketing for the next open enrollment period, he said. But in the long run, the data can help educate consumers. Connecticut is creating an all payer claims database, he said, which will help the state share information with customers about cost and quality and could help drive costs down.\n\nBrenda Gleason, special advisor to HealthSource R.I., said her state\u2019s leaders are thinking in terms of a 3- to 5-year time frame. Rhode Island has an all payers claims database and is working on adding Medicaid data and data from the new insurance exchange. She said the state would like to identify new variables it could measure that touch on public health, such as work and school absenteeism. \u201cIf we could look at those figures before the exchange opened as the baseline and look at it three years later,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps we could identify improvements that we could attribute to more people being covered.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Multi-agency collaborative efforts key to attaining benefits of ACA, say officials speaking at the State Healthcare IT Connect Summit.", "pubDate": "2014-04-2", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/Sean_Vinck.jpg", "title": "Overcoming Data Governance Challenges in HHS"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb8a\"", "article_summary": "But getting there requires data governance teamwork.\nRhode Island has an all payers claims database and is working on adding Medicaid data and data from the new insurance exchange.\nVinck added that all the state agency silos grew up because the agencies report up to the federal agencies that fund them.\nBut recent legislation clarified that projects sponsored by the Office of Health Transformation don\u2019t have to have those types of legal contracts replicated in data-sharing agreements.\n\u201cThese seven agencies have signed an agreement committing themselves to the idea,\u201d Monahan said, which means agency directors don\u2019t own their data anymore."}
