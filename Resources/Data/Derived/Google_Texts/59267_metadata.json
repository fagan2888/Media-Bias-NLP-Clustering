Greg Trott -- The Reporter\n\nKaiser Permanente mental healthcare workers stood up for patient care along Vaca Valley Parkway, another stop on day 3 of a statewide, weeklong strike.\n\nThe bone chilling temperatures Wednesday morning didn\u2019t stop the 30 picketers from spreading their message, \u201cCare delayed is care denied.\u201d\n\nThousands of Kaiser Permanente mental health clinicians and other healthcare providers, members of the National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW), are participating in a week-long, multi-city strike to protest Kaiser\u2019s approach to treating patients seeking help with mental health issues.\n\nBundled up carrying a picket sign, Marsh Maslan, a licensed clinical social worker who has worked for Kaiser for 25 years, said that today Kaiser has the lowest standard of care, in terms of staffing, that she has witnessed.\n\nShe said timing is the issue.\n\n\u201cI could have a very acute client who might be suicidal or even a mother of a child that was murdered and my ability to respond is delayed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stress that creates is tremendous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really what has galvanized us,\u201d Maslan said. \u201cThe jobs are not sustainable. We really need help.\u201d\n\nDr. Horace Beach, a psychologist for Kaiser Vallejo agreed.\n\n\u201cThe administration won\u2019t admit there is a staffing problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to spend any money. Hiring more staff will solve the problem.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the system is \u201cfront loaded\u201d in that the number of intakes have increased, but the clients then they have to wait weeks before being seen by someone on staff. Instead, Beach explained that the patients are then sent to group therapy in the meantime.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t see a therapist for weeks and group therapy isn\u2019t the answer for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe return access time is the problem. It\u2019s the dark secret of Kaiser.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problems have only increased with more patients accessing care through the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he continued. \u201cPsychiatry has been hit hard, no doubt about it. Even the group sessions are breaking down because of lack of staff.\u201d\n\nJohn Nelson, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s vice president of Government Relations, explained that finding equipped mental healthcare workers is a challenge throughout the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a shortage of mental healthcare workers in America,\u201d he said, adding that nationally there is a push for more people to enter the profession. \u201cIt\u2019s a real thing and we\u2019re trying to change it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNelson said that Kaiser Permanente isn\u2019t immune to that need.\n\n\u201cThe issue is finding qualified licensed therapists,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, Nelson said, Kaiser has hired 25 percent more licensed therapists between 2011 and mid 2014, that does not include those that were hired to fill positions. He said Kaiser saw an 8 percent increase in membership during that same time and not all were mental health patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been easy at all because of the shortage,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is absolutely more to do and we\u2019ll continue that effort. We know there is a need and we\u2019re not finished hiring.\u201d\n\nHe added that the strike is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the strategy is to attack the organization,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to work through those disagreements. We support the right to join or not to join a union, and to strike. But strikes are never productive or the solution.\u201d\n\nHe said Kaiser is more than willing to continue with negotiations with the bargaining unit if they would return to the table.\n\nThe strike continues today at the Kaiser Medical Center in Vallejo, and in South Sacramento, Santa Rosa and Oakland on Friday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kaiser Permanente mental healthcare workers stood up for patient care along Vaca Valley Parkway, another stop on day 3 of a statewide, weeklong strike.The bone chilling temperatures Wednesday morning didn\u2019t stop the 30 picketers from spr", "title": "Day 3 of strike: Kaiser mental health workers picket in Vacaville", "og": {"url": "http://www.thereporter.com/article/NG/20150114/NEWS/150119917", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.thereporter.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NG/20150114/NEWS/150119917/AR/0/AR-150119917.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1027px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Day 3 of strike: Kaiser mental health workers picket in Vacaville"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thereporter.com", "description": "Kaiser Permanente mental healthcare workers stood up for patient care along Vaca Valley Parkway, another stop on day 3 of a statewide, weeklong strike.The bone chilling temperatures Wednesday morning didn\u2019t stop the 30 picketers from spr", "title": "Day 3 of strike: Kaiser mental health workers picket in Vacaville", "url": "http://www.thereporter.com/article/NG/20150114/NEWS/150119917", "image": {"src": "http://www.thereporter.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NG/20150114/NEWS/150119917/AR/0/AR-150119917.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@vacareporter", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id499680399", "iphone": "id509333965", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.vacavillereporter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "homepagecenterpiece,news_50, News", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "homepagecenterpiece,news_50, News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce30f\"", "article_summary": "Chanting and carrying signs, mental health workers from Kaiser Permanente strike along Vaca Valley Parkway in front of the local hospital on Wednesday.\nHe said Kaiser saw an 8 percent increase in membership during that same time and not all were mental health patients.\n\u201cThere is a shortage of mental healthcare workers in America,\u201d he said, adding that nationally there is a push for more people to enter the profession.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real thing and we\u2019re trying to change it.\u201dAdvertisementNelson said that Kaiser Permanente isn\u2019t immune to that need.\nGreg Trott -- The ReporterKaiser Permanente mental healthcare workers stood up for patient care along Vaca Valley Parkway, another stop on day 3 of a statewide, weeklong strike."}
