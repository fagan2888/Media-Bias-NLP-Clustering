Anti-illegal immigration demonstrators clashed with pro-amnesty advocates at the United Nations in New York on Saturday, as anti-illegal immigration protests were held in at least 300 cities across America.

Many localities from Maryland to California are protesting the illegal immigrants, who are being secretly dumped in their towns and cities. Residents have complained of potential diseases that may be spread and the financial strain on their communities.

There have been nearly 60,000 illegal immigrant children who have flooded across the border since October of last year, and the United Nations has pushed America to designate the illegal immigrant children as “refugees” so they can receive asylum. Pro-amnesty advocates held banners and signs that read “Open the borders” and “No human is illegal.”

One anti-illegal immigration activist who is a legal immigrant said everyone should play by the same set of rules.

“I’ve been through the process, it works just fine,” Astoria, Queens resident Brad Morris told New York’s CBS affiliate. “It costs money and it takes time. If these people want to come here, they have to submit to the same process.”
