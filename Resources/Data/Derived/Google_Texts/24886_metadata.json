This wasn\u2019t news to top party strategists. But it produced a palpable panic among Democrats along Pennsylvania Avenue, from the White House to Capitol Hill.\n\nRationalizations followed. Maybe the assumptions were flawed, or Republicans would overreach and set the stage for Democrats to come back in 2016. In any case, President Barack Obama has the veto pen for the last two years of his term. That glosses over the profound policy implications of a change that would affect many areas.\n\n\u2022 The Affordable Care Act: The president can stop repeal of Obamacare, but a determined congressional majority can wreak havoc by using the initial budget process, known as reconciliation, which allows major changes to be made with only a majority Senate vote that isn\u2019t subject to filibusters.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans can use reconciliation to pass lots of policies \u2013 even repealing parts of Obamacare,\u201d says Lanhee Chen, formerly a top policy adviser to Mitt Romney and now a research fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution and a Bloomberg View columnist.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to come up with any palatable alternatives to the health care law. That means major components such as the subsidies and tax credits, or the ban on discrimination against insuring those with preexisting conditions, wouldn\u2019t be changed. But deep cuts in funding for running the program and getting new enrollees would take a toll.\n\n\u201cThere could be a big hit in day-to-day administration,\u201d says Chris Jennings, a health care expert who has worked with the Obama administration.\n\n\u2022 Fiscal priorities: Despite the power of the presidential veto, all the compromises would move to the right. Congress would adopt measures closer to those favored by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, cutting social spending for the poor and increasing defense spending.\n\nRepublicans would try to enact conservative tax measures. Reform of the corporate code might be a starting point, though changes to individual income taxes would be unlikely for budgetary and political reasons.\n\n\u2022 Regulation: A Republican Congress would hold the upper hand. Regulatory agencies the party doesn\u2019t like \u2013 a long list that includes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 could turn into toothless watchdogs with slashed budgets.\n\nThere would be a big push for the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, which requires congressional approval for all major regulations.\n\n\u2022 Appointments: Senate confirmation for all but the most routine nominations would be a slog. Republicans might repeal the so-called nuclear option rule, which requires only 51 votes (not 60 to break a filibuster) to confirm an executive or judicial appointment short of the Supreme Court.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to envision a Republican-run Senate confirming any Supreme Court appointment by Obama.\n\n\u2022 Foreign policy: The biggest issue might be a nuclear deal with Iran. Odds are the current negotiations will be extended until the end of this year or next year. For now, only the strong hand of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid prevents legislation that might scuttle the negotiations from coming to the floor.\n\nIf a deal is reached, a Republican Congress would probably refuse to repeal the sanctions imposed on Iran. The president can waive some of these measures by executive order. But Congress would still have latitude to complicate any arrangement.\n\nAs to investigations of alleged administration misconduct, take the current number and double it. Democrats, when not in a state of panic, predict that such a scenario would lead to Republican overreach, paving the way for a Democratic president \u2013 and Senate \u2013 two years later. If so, the agenda of that new president would be to undo much of what had been done the previous two years.\n\nAlbert R.
