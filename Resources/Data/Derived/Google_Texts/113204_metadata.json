George Mason University in Fairfax fell squarely in the middle of the pack overall, with a 4.8 percent increase in tuition and mandatory fees, or $474.\n\n\n\nTuition and instructional fees saw the steepest rise \u2014 6.8 percent on average across four-year institutions. Other mandatory fees covering other facets of university life, including student health services, athletics and transportation, climbed just 2.3 percent on average.\n\n\n\nThat bump for noninstructional mandatory fees barely rises above the annual rate of inflation (2.1 percent).\n\n\n\n\u201cThe increase in these fees is actually the smallest we\u2019ve seen in at least 20 years,\u201d said Dan Hix, SCHEV\u2019s finance policy director.\n\n\n\nGeorge Mason was one of only three schools that saw a greater rate of increase in these noninstructional fees than in academic costs, according to the report. Its tuition and instructional fees went up by 4.7 percent, less than the state average, but its other mandatory fees increased by 4.9 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cGeorge Mason strives to keep college affordable and accessible while providing a strong return on investment for students,\u201d school spokeswoman Michele McDonald said in a statement.\n\n\n\nYet universities walk a fine line between providing affordability and improving the student experience, Hix said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome people might think these fees, which pay for things like athletics and student recreation, are going too far,\u201d Hix said.\n\n\n\nNoninstructional fees are easier for a university to control than its tuition, as public universities rely on state funding for educational costs. This year, due to the budget impasse in the General Assembly, higher education institutions had to set tuition rates without knowing how much money they would receive from the state.\n\n\n\nEven if schools had all the cards on the table, though, it would not have changed much, Hix said. Despite initial promises of up to $100 million in additional higher education funding, in the end funding increased by just $5 million.\n\n\n\nWith tuition continuing to increase year after year, the student share of the cost of college education in Virginia has reached a record high, Hix said.\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s tuition policy sets a target for the General Assembly of covering at least 67 percent of the cost of education, leaving 33 percent for students. For the 2014-15 school year, Virginia students instead will cover 53 percent of educational costs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe weight of that burden has shifted significantly to the shoulders of students and parents,\u201d Hix said. \u201cThat\u2019s a result of the erosion of state support over the last decade. It would take a huge change to even approach that goal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nContact the writer at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\nPost a comment\n\nCommenting is not available in this channel entry.\n\nComments express only the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of this website or any associated person or entity.
