Next week, however, in oral arguments concerning two cases, the justices\u2019 task will be to teach remedial reading to Congress and to Arizona.\n\nOn Wednesday, the justices will consider this: Did Congress mean what it said when, with patently coercive intent, it stipulated in the Affordable Care Act that subsidies for persons compelled to purchase health insurance can be disbursed only through exchanges \u201cestablished by the state\u201d? If so, billions have been illegally disbursed through federal exchanges in the 34 states that resisted the ACA\u2019s pressure to establish exchanges.\n\nOn Monday, however, the court will consider whether the Constitution\u2019s Framers meant what they said when, in the election clause, they assigned an important function to each state\u2019s \u201clegislature.\u201d This clause says: \u201cThe times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.\u201d\n\nArizona\u2019s Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) supposedly is a better idea. It was created by a state constitutional amendment passed by voter initiative. The commission is composed of five members. Four are chosen by the majority and minority leaders of the two parties in the two legislative chambers \u2014 but these leaders must pick from a list of just 25 (of the 4.9 million Arizonans of voting age) selected by another state commission, one for appellate court appointments. No member of the legislature may serve on the IRC. It draws congressional district maps that are not subject even to such checks as a gubernatorial veto or referendum. The legislature\u2019s role is reduced to submitting nonbinding recommendations to the IRC \u2014 \u201ca function without consequence,\u201d as the legislature says in its brief to the court.\n\nThe question is whether this process, which reduces the Arizona legislature\u2019s role to the vanishing point, complies with the Constitution\u2019s mandate that the \u201cmanner\u201d of elections shall be \u201cprescribed\u201d by the state\u2019s legislature. The Supreme Court\u2019s elections clause jurisprudence permits limited checks on the legislature\u2019s redistricting prerogative, such as a governor\u2019s veto. It has, however, never authorized a state to divest its legislature of all meaningful power to prescribe district lines.\n\nClearly the clause restricts states\u2019 abilities to do what the IRC does \u2014 nullify the Arizona legislature\u2019s primacy in the redistricting process. The \u201cI\u201d in the IRC denotes independence from the legislature.\n\nTo the suit brought by Arizona\u2019s legislature, the IRC\u2019s limp response is that the elections clause uses \u201clegislature\u201d to denote any process, such as a referendum, that creates any entity, such as the IRC, that produces binding edicts. Surely, however, in writing the elections clause the Framers used the word \u201clegislature\u201d as it was and still is generally understood, to mean the representative body that makes a state\u2019s laws. Arizona cannot strip its legislature of a power that flows to it from the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWere it not for an unfortunate 19th-century decision, the court could rule that Arizona\u2019s redistricting arrangement also violates the guarantee clause, which says \u201cthe United States shall guarantee to every state in the Union a republican form of government.\u201d To the Framers, who were economical and precise with words, this clause had clear content. They believed that in a republic, the involvement of the people in governance is indirect and mediated but real. The essence of republicanism is the principle of representation: The people do not decide questions, they decide who will decide \u2014 their elected representatives, such as state legislatures.\n\nIn 1849, however, the court held that the meaning of the guarantee clause is non-justiciable. That is, its meaning is a \u201cpolitical question\u201d to be determined by Congress rather than courts. But Clint Bolick of Arizona\u2019s Goldwater Institute says that here \u201cnon-justiciable\u201d means that the clause \u201cis written in disappearing ink.\u201d So, the guarantee clause is less a guarantee than a suggestion.\n\nThis is another example of what is lost when judicial modesty becomes dereliction of the judicial duty to judge. It is, Bolick says, arguable that the guarantee clause is inapplicable in the Arizona case because the clause is \u201can affirmative obligation on the national government rather than a restriction on the states. But because of the judicial abdication 166 years ago, we never get that far in the argument.\u201d\n\nSo the Arizona case is another legal log fueling the crackling fire of the conservative argument for a vigorously engaged rather than passive judiciary. Which is another reason not to wait until Wednesday to watch the court.\n\nRead more from George F.
