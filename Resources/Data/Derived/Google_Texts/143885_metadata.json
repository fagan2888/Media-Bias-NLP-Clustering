Bush launched Operation Just Cause, sending tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of aircraft into Panama to execute a warrant of arrest against its leader, Manuel Noriega, on charges of drug trafficking. Those troops quickly secured all important strategic installations, including the main airport in Panama City, various military bases, and ports. Noriega went into hiding before surrendering on January 3rd and was then officially extradited to the United States to stand trial. Soon after, most of the U.S. invaders withdrew from the country.\n\nIn and out. Fast and simple. An entrance plan and an exit strategy all wrapped in one. And it worked, making Operation Just Cause one of the most successful military actions in U.S. history. At least in tactical terms.\n\nThere were casualties. More than 20 U.S. soldiers were killed and 300-500 Panamanian combatants died as well. Disagreement exists over how many civilians perished. Washington claimed that few died. In the \u201clow hundreds,\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s Southern Command said. But others charged that U.S. officials didn\u2019t bother to count the dead in El Chorrillo, a poor Panama Citybarrio that U.S. planes indiscriminately bombed because it was thought to be a bastion of support for Noriega. Grassroots human-rights organizations claimed thousands of civilians were killed and tens of thousands displaced.\n\nAs Human Rights Watch wrote, even conservative estimates of civilian fatalities suggested \u201cthat the rule of proportionality and the duty to minimize harm to civilians\u2026 were not faithfully observed by the invading U.S. forces.\u201d That may have been putting it mildly when it came to the indiscriminant bombing of a civilian population, but the point at least was made. Civilians were given no notice. The Cobra and Apache helicopters that came over the ridge didn\u2019t bother to announce their pending arrival by blasting Wagner\u2019s \u201cRide of the Valkyries\u201d (as in Apocalypse Now). The University of Panama\u2019s seismograph marked 442 major explosions in the first 12 hours of the invasion, about one major bomb blast every two minutes. Fires engulfed the mostly wooden homes, destroying about 4,000 residences. Some residents began to call El Chorrillo \u201cGuernica\u201d or \u201clittle Hiroshima.\u201d Shortly after hostilities ended, bulldozers excavated mass graves and shoveled in the bodies. \u201cBuried like dogs,\u201d said the mother of one of the civilian dead.\n\nSandwiched between the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, and the commencement of the first Gulf War on January 17, 1991, Operation Just Cause might seem a curio from a nearly forgotten era, its anniversary hardly worth a mention. So many earth-shattering events have happened since. But the invasion of Panama should be remembered in a big way. After all, it helps explain many of those events. In fact, you can\u2019t begin to fully grasp the slippery slope of American militarism in the post-9/11 era \u2014 how unilateral, preemptory \u201cregime change\u201d became an acceptable foreign policy option, how \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d became a staple of defense strategy, and how war became a branded public spectacle \u2014 without understanding Panama.\n\nOur Man in Panama\n\nOperation Just Cause was carried out unilaterally, sanctioned neither by the United Nations nor the Organization of American States (OAS). In addition, the invasion was the first post-Cold War military operation justified in the name of democracy \u2014 \u201cmilitant democracy,\u201d as George Will approvinglycalled what the Pentagon would unilaterally install in Panama.\n\nThe campaign to capture Noriega, however, didn\u2019t start with such grand ambitions. For years, as Saddam Hussein had been Washington\u2019s man in Iraq, so Noriega was a CIA asset and Washington ally in Panama. He was a key player in the shadowy network of anti-communists, tyrants, and drug runnersthat made up what would become Iran-Contra. That, in case you\u2019ve forgotten, was a conspiracy involving President Ronald Reagan\u2019s National Security Council to sell high-tech missiles to the Ayatollahs in Iran and then divert their payments to support anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua in order to destabilize the Sandinista government there. Noriega\u2019s usefulness to Washington came to an end in 1986, after journalist Seymour Hershpublished an investigation in the New York Times linking him to drug trafficking. It turned out that the Panamanian autocrat had been working both sides. He was \u201cour man,\u201d but apparently was also passing on intelligence about us to Cuba.\n\nStill, when George H.W. Bush was inaugurated president in January 1989, Panama was not high on his foreign policy agenda. Referring to the process by which Noriega, in less than a year, would become America\u2019s most wanted autocrat, Bush\u2019s National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft said: \u201cI can\u2019t really describe the course of events that led us this way\u2026 Noriega, was he running drugs and stuff? Sure, but so were a lot of other people. Was he thumbing his nose at the United States? Yeah, yeah.\u201d\n\nThe Keystone Kops\u2026\n\nDomestic politics provided the tipping point to military action. For most of 1989, Bush administration officials had been half-heartedly calling for a coup against Noriega. Still, they were caught completely caught off guard when, in October, just such a coup started unfolding. The White House was, at that moment, remarkably in the dark. It had no clear intel about what was actually happening. \u201dAll of us agreed at that point that we simply had very little to go on,\u201d Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney later reported. \u201cThere was a lot of confusion at the time because there was a lot of confusion in Panama.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were sort of the Keystone Kops,\u201d was the way Scowcroft rememberedit, not knowing what to do or whom to support. When Noriega regained the upper hand, Bush came under intense criticism in Congress and the media. This, in turn, spurred him to act. Scowcroft recalls the momentum that led to the invasion: \u201cMaybe we were looking for an opportunity to show that we were not as messed up as the Congress kept saying we were, or as timid as a number of people said.\u201d The administration had to find a way to respond, as Scowcroft put it, to the \u201cwhole wimp factor.\u201d\n\nMomentum built for action, and so did the pressure to find a suitable justification for action after the fact. Shortly after the failed coup, Cheney claimed on PBS\u2019s Newshour that the only objectives the U.S. had in Panama were to \u201csafeguard American lives\u201d and \u201cprotect American interests\u201d by defending that crucial passageway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, the Panama Canal. \u201cWe are not there,\u201d he emphasized, \u201cto remake the Panamanian government.\u201d He also noted that the White House had no plans to act unilaterally against the wishes of the Organization of American States to extract Noriega from the country. The \u201chue and cry and the outrage that we would hear from one end of the hemisphere to the other,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2026raises serious doubts about the course of that action.\u201d\n\nThat was mid-October. What a difference two months would make. By December 20th, the campaign against Noriega had gone from accidental \u2014 Keystone Kops bumbling in the dark \u2014 to transformative: the Bush administration would end up remaking the Panamanian government and, in the process, international law.\n\n\u2026Start a Wild Fire\n\nCheney wasn\u2019t wrong about the \u201chue and cry.\u201d Every single country other than the United States in the Organization of American States voted against the invasion of Panama, but by then it couldn\u2019t have mattered less. Bush acted anyway.\n\nWhat changed everything was the fall of the Berlin Wall just over a month before the invasion. Paradoxically, as the Soviet Union\u2019s influence in itsbackyard (eastern Europe) unraveled, it left Washington with more room to maneuver in its backyard (Latin America). The collapse of Soviet-style Communism also gave the White House an opportunity to go on the ideological and moral offense. And at that moment, the invasion of Panama happened to stand at the head of the line.\n\nAs with most military actions, the invaders had a number of justifications to offer, but at that moment the goal of installing a \u201cdemocratic\u201d regime in power suddenly flipped to the top of the list. In adopting that rationale for making war, Washington was in effect radically revising the terms of international diplomacy. At the heart of its argument was the idea that democracy (as defined by the Bush administration) trumped the principle of national sovereignty.\n\nLatin American nations immediately recognized the threat. After all,according to historian John Coatsworth, the U.S. overthrew 41 governments in Latin America between 1898 and 1994, and many of those regime changes were ostensibly carried out, as Woodrow Wilson once put it in reference to Mexico, to teach Latin Americans \u201cto elect good men.\u201d Their resistance only gave Bush\u2019s ambassador to the OAS, Luigi Einaudi, a chance to up the ethical ante. He quickly and explicitly tied the assault on Panama to the wave of democracy movements then sweeping Eastern Europe. \u201cToday we are\u2026 living in historic times,\u201d he lectured his fellow OAS delegates, two days after the invasion, \u201ca time when a great principle is spreading across the world like wildfire. That principle, as we all know, is the revolutionary idea that people, not governments, are sovereign.\u201d\n\nEinaudi\u2019s remarks hit on all the points that would become so familiar early in the next century in George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cFreedom Agenda\u201d: the idea that democracy, as defined by Washington, was a universal value; that \u201chistory\u201d represented a movement toward the fulfillment of that value; and that any nation or person who stood in the path of such fulfillment would be swept away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Twenty-five years ago this month, George H.W.
