That\u2019s what I was saying during several of the graphic tooth-pulling and surgery scenes of \u201cThe Ether Dome,\u201d a play about the origins of modern anesthesia now running at the Calderwood Pavilion in the South End through Nov. 23.\n\nAnd that\u2019s also what I said when I read this devastating but (in my opinion) perfectly on-point line in Carolyn Clay\u2019s review of the show on WBUR\u2019s arts blog, \u201cThe Artery\u201d: \u201c\u2026it seems clear that the dramatist needs to administer some pain balm to herself, pick up scalpel and saw, and hack a few limbs off baby.\u201d\n\nClay\u2019s review begins:\n\nBOSTON \u2014 You won\u2019t require anesthesia to get through \u201cEther Dome,\u201d Elizabeth Egloff\u2019s relatively new play built on the introduction of ether \u2014 right here at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1846 \u2014 to alleviate the horrific pain of surgery. But neither will you be held to the edge of your lecture-hall seat (we the audience are medical-student observers in the dome). The three-act play is so diffuse, with at least four questionable protagonists, that there is really no one to root for \u2014 except, of course, the ether, which both transformed Hippocratic barbarism into a pretty smooth ride and started the medical ball rolling in the direction of big business.\n\nAs an utterly amateur theater-goer who was drawn to the show by the medical history, I humbly concur. It was a great pleasure to watch some of the grand old men of Massachusetts General, men whose names now grace the hospital\u2019s buildings, brought to life in all their quirky, grumpy, brilliant glory. But I did wish for more of an editorial scalpel.
