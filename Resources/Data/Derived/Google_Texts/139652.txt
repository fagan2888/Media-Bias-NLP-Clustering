Health care summit highlights: Hospital mergers, health reform and patient value

The Affordable Care Act, benefits of hospital and physician collaboration and what providers and insurers are doing to curtail rising prices, waste and overutilization were front and center Thursday at Crainâ€™s 6th annual Health Care Leadership Summit.



More than 450 attendees, including at least 45 CEOs of health care organizations in Southeast Michigan, gathered at the Shriners Silver Garden Events Center in Southfield to hear futurist Joe Flower and two panels of top executives discuss current events affecting health care.



"Our most massive problem is costs," high prices and ordering of medically unnecessary services, said Flower. "Lack of access and quality all stem from this. Is the Affordable Care Act addressing these problems?"



Carl Camden, CEO of Troy-based Kelly Services Inc., said the Affordable Care Act is helping millions of people gain access to health insurance and should remain the law of the land, despite Republican takeover this week of the U.S. Senate.



But the law needs to be tweaked to help employers manage part-time workers and ease data reporting requirements, especially for small businesses, Camden said.



Scott Eathorne, M.D., interim CEO of Together Health Network, said physicians and hospitals are redesigning their business operations to accept reimbursement based on quality.



"We are improving quality, but consumers may not see that. How do they define quality? They want their questions answered, they want to be part of the process" and want affordable prices, Eathorne said.
