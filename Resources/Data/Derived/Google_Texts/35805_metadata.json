A huge part of the problem is a lack of both primary care and specialty providers in rural and other underserved communities. Without local providers who can meet patients\u2019 needs, health care coverage does not necessarily translate to access to care.\n\nDeveloping Health U.S., the GE Foundation\u2019s signature health program, strives to help as many people as possible gain access to health care by partnering with community health centers around the country. Community health centers are the backbone of the health care safety net, providing affordable primary care services to millions of uninsured and working poor Americans.\n\nOver the years, we have worked with more than 160 community health centers in forty-two cities in an effort to improve follow-up care, reduce patient wait times, improve access to behavioral health services, and increase the numbers of patients who keep their medical appointments. (Click on this link and then click on the \u201cCapacity Building\u201d box to read about some examples of successes.)\n\nWe have learned a great deal from these efforts. What they highlight for us, more than anything, is the tremendous ability of properly supported community providers to do more for underserved populations.\n\nSo, we are now embarking on an ambitious new strategy to support community providers by connecting them to a transformative model of medical knowledge-sharing and collaborative practice called Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes).\n\nOrigins of Project ECHO\n\nLaunched in 2003, Project ECHO grew out of one doctor\u2019s vision. Sanjeev Arora, a liver disease specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center in Albuquerque, was frustrated that he could serve only a fraction of the hepatitis C patients in that state who needed treatment. An estimated 36,000 New Mexicans had that disease, but only 5 percent were in treatment. In the entire state of New Mexico, just two clinics\u2014Arora\u2019s in Albuquerque and another in Santa Fe\u2014had the necessary treatment expertise. New Mexico desperately needed more providers capable of managing hepatitis C in their local communities.\n\nAccordingly, Arora created a free, virtual clinic to mentor community providers in how to treat hepatitis C. In Albuquerque, he assembled a multidisciplinary specialist team\u2014including himself, a psychiatrist, a pharmacist, a nurse, and a social worker\u2014to host weekly teleECHO clinics via videoconference for primary care providers from around the state.\n\nAlthough the clinics featured brief lectures on hepatitis C management, the most important learning occurred when primary care providers presented their patients\u2019 cases to the specialist team. During these \u201cvirtual clinical rounds,\u201d Arora and his specialist colleagues worked with primary care providers to determine patient treatment\u2014training them to manage a condition that previously was outside of their expertise.\n\nAfter the first Hepatitis C TeleECHO Clinic launched, the wait time for hepatitis C treatment in New Mexico dropped from eight months to two weeks. More than 500,000 miles of patient treatment travel were avoided.\n\nAnd the quality of care, as demonstrated in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was excellent, as good as care provided in the university\u2019s specialty clinic. That same study also showed that the ECHO model can reduce\u2014and even eliminate\u2014racial and ethnic disparities in treatment outcomes by bringing more services to minority communities. With Project ECHO, for the first time, patients with hepatitis C in New Mexico could get the high-quality treatment they needed from nearby providers.\n\nWith initial funding from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and with crucial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the ECHO model has since expanded. Today, teleECHO clinics addressing dozens of common complex conditions take place every week\u2014all following the model of the original Hepatitis C TeleECHO Clinic. Currently, more than fifty ECHO programs are running in ten countries across North and South America, Europe, and Asia. In the United States, primary care providers from every state have connected into a teleECHO clinic.\n\nLaunching a New Partnership\n\nNow the GE Foundation is working to scale the model even further, with a new $14 million, three-year grant to Project ECHO to substantially increase the number of community health centers participating in ECHO nationwide.\n\nAlso under this grant, Project ECHO will partner with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to design and implement a quality improvement program for Project ECHO. This program will support community health centers in improving effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nWe believe that community health centers are the key to improving health care access. They already do so much for so many people. By joining with Project ECHO, providers at community health centers helped by the foundation\u2019s grant to Project ECHO will gain new knowledge and expertise to treat patients in their own communities. This empowerment creates what Arora calls a \u201cforce multiplier effect\u201d\u2014an exponential increase in workforce capacity.\n\nThe combined commitment and service of our nation\u2019s community health centers with the ingenuity of the ECHO model will, we anticipate, drive extraordinary improvements in health care access and community health.\n\nRelated Health Affairs GrantWatch Blog content:\n\n\u201cProject ECHO GEMH: Disruptive Technology for Geriatric Mental Health,\u201d by Brian Byrd and Bronwyn Starr of the New York State Health Foundation, May 28, 2015.\n\n\u201cProject ECHO Is Awarded $6.4 Million Grant For Diabetes And Endocrinology Care To New Mexico Underserved,\u201d by Tracy Gnadinger, July 23, 2014.\n\n\u201cA Workforce That Can Do More: Project ECHO At Ten Years Brings Behavioral Health Care To Underserved Areas,\u201d by John Lumpkin of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, July 8, 2013.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/07/20/project-echo-force-multiplier-for-community-health-centers/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Featured-Topic-Image-Grantwatch-640-x-360-at-72-PPI.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Project ECHO: Force Multiplier For Community Health Centers"}, "description": "Project ECHO: Force Multiplier For Community Health Centers | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda96a\"", "article_summary": "Developing Health U.S., the GE Foundation\u2019s signature health program, strives to help as many people as possible gain access to health care by partnering with community health centers around the country.\nThe combined commitment and service of our nation\u2019s community health centers with the ingenuity of the ECHO model will, we anticipate, drive extraordinary improvements in health care access and community health.\nCommunity health centers are the backbone of the health care safety net, providing affordable primary care services to millions of uninsured and working poor Americans.\nWe believe that community health centers are the key to improving health care access.\nThis program will support community health centers in improving effectiveness and efficiency."}
