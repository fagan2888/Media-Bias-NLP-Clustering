Sorry Peeps, I feel like this gal writing about it today, but I think it\u2019s worth spreading the word.\n\nBaby chicks \u2014 as well as ducklings, goslings, and baby turkeys \u2014 may harbor the bacteria in their droppings and on their bodies. If you hold, cuddle or kiss the birds, or touch contaminated surfaces such as cages and water bowls, you can pick it up on your hands. Then touch your mouth or use your hands to eat, and salmonella can sneak its way into your body.\n\nThe U.S. CDC issues warnings about salmonella in the spring to coincide with Easter. While people come into greater contact with baby chicks, adult poultry also can carry the bacteria and both pose a potential risk anytime of year.\n\nYoung children are particularly at risk because their immune systems are still developing and they\u2019re more likely to cuddle the baby birds and then put their fingers in their mouths. Health officials recommend that children younger than 5 don\u2019t handle baby chicks at all.\n\nSalmonella typically causes diarrhea, vomiting, fever and abdominal cramps. The illness can be severe and sometimes requires hospitalization.\n\nTips to stay safe\n\nHealth officials recommend that children:\n\n\u2022 Do not put their hands in their mouths after touching chicks\n\n\u2022 Do not kiss chicks on their beak or feathers\n\n\u2022 Do not handle or clean cages or food containers\n\n\u2022 Do not eat or drink near baby chicks\n\n\u2022 Do not put their mouths on objects that have been near chicks or their cages\n\nChildren younger than 5 should not handle baby chicks, but if they do:\n\n\u2022 Keep chicks out of the kitchen and other living areas\n\n\u2022 Wash children\u2019s hands thoroughly with running water and soap after contact with chicks\n\n\u2022 Contact a health care provider or go to a clinic if the child experiences diarrhea or vomiting\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba0f\"", "article_summary": "Baby chicks \u2014 as well as ducklings, goslings, and baby turkeys \u2014 may harbor the bacteria in their droppings and on their bodies.\nHealth officials recommend that children younger than 5 don\u2019t handle baby chicks at all.\nBaby chicks may look adorable all nestled in Easter baskets this weekend, but bacteria could be hiding in those downy yellow feathers.\nWhile people come into greater contact with baby chicks, adult poultry also can carry the bacteria and both pose a potential risk anytime of year.\nThe little fuzz balls can carry salmonella, the germ we most often associate with eggs and undercooked poultry."}
