More importantly, one of the caveats of ERISA is it allows participants to pursue personal liability for individuals that were involved in the sponsorship or administration of those qualified plans.\n\nSo, in theory, the HR administrator, CFO, CEO, owner/shareholder \u2014 potentially anyone who played a role in the selection and administration of those qualified plans \u2014 can be held personally liable, says Chris Zito, president of Zito Insurance Agency, Inc.\n\nThe greater degree they are involved in those decisions, the greater the level of fiduciary exposure.\n\n\u201cFiduciary claims aren\u2019t as frequent as other types of claims that may be filed against your organization. But unlike the claims that are protected under the corporate shield, fiduciary liability is one area where participants may pierce the corporate shield and go after personal assets,\u201d Zito says.\n\n\u201cNot that protecting the corporation\u2019s assets isn\u2019t important, but if your house could be at risk you should at least be aware of that.\u201d\n\nSmart Business spoke with Zito about misconceptions employers have about fiduciary liability and how you can protect yourself \u2014 and your personal assets.\n\nWhat misconceptions do you see from plan trustees?\n\nMost commonly, plan sponsors confuse their fiduciary exposure with the ERISA bond. They are entirely different \u2014 one is a form of employee dishonesty coverage and one is liability coverage. The ERISA bond protects employee investment assets from theft of their retirement funds by trustees. It\u2019s not liability coverage; it\u2019s a requirement the IRS imposes on qualified plans.\n\nIn addition, some retirement plans aren\u2019t subject to ERISA. People generally lump retirement plans into one bucket, but they are different, in terms of their legal and compliance requirements.\n\nDo plan sponsors only need to worry about their fiduciary liability for retirement plans?\n\nTraditionally retirement plans are the largest driver of these types of claims because they\u2019re the most visible. But legally, any qualified benefit plan \u2014 all of which are subject to the ERISA law \u2014 could trigger a fiduciary claim.\n\nHow can plan trustees best mitigate their fiduciary liability exposure?\n\nQuantity and diversity of investment selection, along with plan education, are key to minimizing the exposure of retirement plan-related liability.\n\nDefined benefit plans used to impose a significant fiduciary responsibility on employers because they had the actuarial responsibility of making sure the plan was funded properly. Today\u2019s 401(k)s and profit-sharing plans have migrated to a self-directed model, where employees choose from different mutual funds, varying from low risk to high risk. The more control and direction the employees have, the lower the fiduciary exposure, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate it entirely.\n\nPlan trustees want to make sure they\u2019re providing ample education about how any qualified benefit plan works \u2014 retirement or otherwise. Education is a requirement under ERISA.\n\nYou also can buy trustee and fiduciary liability (TFL) coverage. A key consideration in buying a TFL policy is coverage for defense costs, regardless of whether negligence exists.\n\nFiduciary liability is fairly generic in terms of what the coverage does, but the breadth of the policy varies by company. You can get pricing from multiple companies, and the coverage limits and deductibles may be identical but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re getting the same policy. It is important to review the policy language to determine how or if coverage applies to Affordable Care Act compliance.\n\nThe right agent will be familiar with the policy language in terms of what types of fiduciary claims and allegations it will cover and defend, like regulatory expenses.\n\nInsights Business Insurance is brought to you by Zito Insurance Agency, Inc.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Smart Business Magazine", "description": "Chris Zito, president of Zito Insurance Agency, Inc., covers the misconceptions employers have about fiduciary liability and how you can protect yourself \u2014 and your personal assets.", "title": "The ins and outs of your fiduciary exposure and what you can do about it - Smart Business Magazine", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.sbnonline.com/article/the-ins-and-outs-of-your-fiduciary-exposure-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SmartBusiness/", "tag": "Zito Insurance Agency"}, "shareaholic": {"site_name": "Smart Business Magazine", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.sbnonline.com/article/the-ins-and-outs-of-your-fiduciary-exposure-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/", "article_author_name": "Jayne Gest", "site_id": "75b6dd55541159703e2dcc47492301ad", "article_published_time": "2016-03-01T21:40:38+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-27T04:01:06+00:00", "keywords": "chris zito, fiduciary exposure, zito insurance agency", "wp_version": "7.8.0.1"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "How can plan trustees best mitigate their fiduciary liability exposure?\nDo plan sponsors only need to worry about their fiduciary liability for retirement plans?\nThey are entirely different \u2014 one is a form of employee dishonesty coverage and one is liability coverage.\nPeople generally lump retirement plans into one bucket, but they are different, in terms of their legal and compliance requirements.\nFiduciary liability is fairly generic in terms of what the coverage does, but the breadth of the policy varies by company."}
