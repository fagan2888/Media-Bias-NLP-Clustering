Authorities have not found a suspect following a report of a person with a gun at Pinnacle Charter School in Federal Heights but are evacuating the school as a precaution.

Parents will be able to pick the students up at the nearby Water World Park at 8801 N. Pecos St.

At 9:40 a.m., a caller told Federal Heights police that they had spotted two juveniles in a blue BMW that may be linked to a stabbing, Deputy Chief Donald Vallero said.

The caller explained that they had just seen a TV crime special on the stabbing and thought the car seen at a Valero gas station could be connected, Vallero said.

When police arrived at the gas station, the car was gone. An unoccupied blue BMW was later seen two block from the school at 1001 W. 84th Ave., he said.

The school was placed in lockdown. While police were searching the school an anonymous caller told dispatchers they had seen a person with a gun inside the charter school.

Pinnacle’s elementary and middle schools were placed in lockdown and Pinnacle High School was put in lockout during a search of the high school, Vallero said.

Thornton police and Adams County Sheriff’s Department deputies also helped search the charter school.

A perimeter was set up around the school, Vallero said.

Larry Devan, who works at an auto parts store across the street, said he saw officers flowing into the area. He said there were about eight or nine patrol vehicles parked outside the campus.

“They were going around the street like they were looking for somebody,” Devan said.

The high school was evacuated as a precaution and kids were bused to the water park, Vallero said.
