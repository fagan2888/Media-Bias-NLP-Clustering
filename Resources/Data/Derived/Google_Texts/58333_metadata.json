Phoenix reported 36 water-related incidents as of July 1, including 10 deaths, six of which were children, according to the city\u2019s website.\n\nPima County reported seven incidents, one of which was a fatality involving a child. In Tucson, there has only been one water-related call this year, said Fire Department Capt. Barrett Baker, and it was non-fatal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way we\u2019d like to keep it,\u201d Baker said.\n\nChildren\u2019s Safety Zone, a collaboration between hospitals, police and fire departments, reported one non-fatal incident each in Graham and Yuma counties this year.\n\nLori Schmidt, president of the Drowning Prevention Coalition of Arizona, said that while this has been a fairly typical year for water-related incidents, she has seen an increase in emergencies involving kids 12 to 17 in the Valley.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Safety Zone reported six incidents involving that age group in Maricopa and Pinal counties this year. Four of those were fatalities. No deaths involving that age group were reported in 2012 and 2013.\n\nSchmidt also said boys tend to drown at a higher rate than girls and that drownings occur more often on weekends and holidays, when families are distracted.\n\nSchmidt agreed with Thomson that water safety needs to be practiced around any body of water in the state \u2013 and that safety measures do not vary from one place to another.\n\nParents should ensure that children know how to swim, and should consider putting kids in Coast Guard-approved life vests, even in the pool, she said, and not rely on water-wings, inner tubes or water noodles.\n\n\u201cLife vests aren\u2019t allergic to chlorine,\u201d she said.\n\nNo matter where they are, Schmidt also warned adults not to swim alone, when impaired or feeling ill.\n\nKelly Liebermann, community education specialist with the Phoenix Fire Department, encouraged the ABC\u2019s of water safety \u2013 adult supervision, barriers, and classes, both swim lessons and CPR.\n\nHe said pool owners should not just rely on just a fence. They should also add alarms that warn when a door or window is opened and a sensor that signals if someone goes in the pool, to prevent what he calls a silent killer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s (drowning) not this Hollywood image of someone screaming and flailing their arms,\u201d Liebermann said. \u201cA distressed swimmer, soon to be drowning, has their head bobbing up and down in the water trying to grasp air.\u201d\n\nAll the advocates pointed to education as a critical element in preventing water tragedies.\n\nTucson Medical Center and the YMCA have run more than 1,000 kids, ages 4 to 17, through a swim lesson program since 2012 that gives participants eight, 30-minute swim lessons and their personally fitted flotation device.\n\nJessica Mitchell, community outreach specialist with the medical center, said in an email that it also sponsors a school-based water-safety program in first-grade classrooms in nine schools. She said the program, which has been completed by 4,285 students since 2009, is \u201cunique because we return to the same schools each year.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince its inception we have zero known water incidents at the participating schools,\u201d Mitchell\u2019s email said.\n\nEducation efforts will gear up in August, when Schmidt said agencies around the state will host safety events as part of the 10th annual Drowning Impact Awareness Month. The events are timed to remind parents that water-related incidents spike with distractions, such as the start of a new school year.\n\nBut Thomson urges people to be alert at all times.\n\nSince Brenan\u2019s death, he has distributed water-safety packets in his neighborhood, urged other parents to be aware of nearby canals and worked with canal operators to push for more safety measures, like stairs to help people climb out.\n\nThat becomes increasingly important, he said, as canal beautification projects attempt to turn canal systems into recreational areas. Planners need to think about safety, too, he said.\n\n\u201cWater can be fun but it can be very dangerous,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get the respect it deserves unless it hits you right in the face. I\u2019m guilty of it too.\u201d\n\n- 30 -", "article_metadata": {"DC.identifier": "http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/071814_water_safety/experts-water-safety-message-needs-reach-all-ages-all-bodies-water/", "twitter": {"description": "Gilbert dad Cody Thomson has a problem with pool-safety campaigns: the pool part.
