The tower will be equipped with modern medical equipment and operating rooms that are more than twice as large as current rooms, said Kathy Bollinger, executive vice president of Banner\u2019s University Medicine division.\n\nBanner also will also spend about $100 million on a 250,000-square-foot building next to the Arizona Cancer Center on its Tucson North campus. The multi-specialty clinic will include services such as imaging so cancer patients will no longer need to travel to another site, according to Bollinger.\n\nConstruction won\u2019t be limited to Tucson.\n\nThe Phoenix health system plans to spend nearly as much on a trio of major projects at or near Banner-University Medical Center Phoenix, formerly known as Good Samaritan Medical Center.\n\nBanner-University Medical Center Phoenix is under renovation.

These hospitals offer advanced medical care \u2014 organ transplants, for example \u2014 that typically is not available at community hospitals.\n\nTeaching hospitals traditionally have relied on revenue from hospital care to offset the cost of medical-student training and cutting-edge research, said Scott Cain, CEO of Cain and Associates, a Phoenix-based health-management consulting company.\n\nBut Cain said teaching hospitals nationwide are facing a financial crunch as health insurers and consumers scrutinize costs in the Affordable Care Act era. Insurers are increasingly relying on smaller networks of doctors and hospitals to reduce expenses and at times are eliminating teaching hospitals from these networks. And more patients are covered by high-deductible health insurance plans that require them to pay $1,000 or more out-of-pocket before coverage begins, which has led to more unpaid bills.\n\n\"The real challenge is the environment we are working in,\" Cain said. \"They (teaching hospitals) need to do things like modernize. That's where this (investment) comes into play.\"\n\nBanner is still seeking to shore up the finances of its newly acquired Tucson hospitals. Those two facilities \u2014 the former University Medical Center and Kino hospitals \u2014 lost more than $50 million in 2014. They also reported nearly $25 million in losses through February 2015.\n\nThose losses sharply declined after Banner acquired UA Health Network's hospitals, a physician's practice and a health-insurance plan as part of a $1.2 billion deal that included a 30-year alliance with the University of Arizona College of Medicine.\n\nBanner Health projects that it will take another year to halt the flow of red ink at the two Tucson hospitals, renamed Banner-University Medical Center Tucson and Banner-University Medical Center South.\n\nBanner Health CEO Peter Fine said the Phoenix health system did not pursue the merger more than a year ago simply to provide financial stability for the Tucson hospitals. The goal was to support University of Arizona\u2019s medical education mission, promote research and supply a steady stream of new doctors for the state. Banner must finance a $20 million fund that subsidizes key hires and research at UA's medical school campuses in Phoenix and Tucson.\n\n\u201cNobody would do this to be opportunistic,\u201d Fine said, explaining the Tucson acquisitions. \u201cIt is very risky from a stabilization perspective. You have to do it very well for it not to be a giant drag and impact the whole organization.\u201d\n\nBanner, the state's largest private employer and largest hospital system in metro Phoenix, has been able to absorb the financial losses of the UA Health Network and still turn a profit, albeit at smaller margins, bond documents show.\n\n\u201cThis whole issue of reinventing a business \u2014 it is not easy and it is not for the timid.\u201d Peter Fine, Banner Health CEO\n\nFine said Banner has tried to reduce administrative and overhead expenses, and to perform better in areas such as scheduling appointments and seeing patients in a more timely manner.\n\nBy fall 2017, Banner will replace the Epic electronic health-records system used by the two Tucson hospitals with Cerner system used by Banner hospitals. The Tucson hospitals switched to Epic in 2013 but reportedly lost $115 million in training, education and other costs related to the new system.\n\nSwitching electronic health-records systems will provide \"significant savings\" to the Tucson hospitals, Fine said.\n\nBeyond the administrative changes, Fine said, Banner is still working to meld the cultures of the two organizations.\n\n\"This whole issue of reinventing a business \u2014 it is not easy and it is not for the timid,\" Fine said. \"You've got to be relatively strong in making people move down a particular path, adapting to a new environment and new processes that may exist.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1MuPEDv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A year after Banner Health bought the University of Arizona Health Network, the hospital system plans substantial investment in Arizona facilities.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "A year after Banner Health bought the University of Arizona Health Network, the hospital system plans substantial investment in Arizona facilities.", "title": "Banner to invest $1 billion for facilities in Tucson, Phoenix", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/health/2016/03/28/banner-invest-1-billion-facilities-tucson-phoenix/82096184/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A year after Banner Health bought the University of Arizona Health Network, the hospital system plans substantial investment in Arizona facilities.", "title": "Banner to invest $1 billion for facilities in Tucson, Phoenix", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e46941c489f336c2aab624efdbdcd0d783bc9c92/c=639-0-3092-2453&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/24/Phoenix/Phoenix/635944349741000389-Banner007.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/ken.alltucker"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix", "title": "Banner to invest $1 billion for facilities in Tucson, Phoenix", "author": "Ken Alltucker", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/business/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a8a8f5d545b431ed0fec73dd0ded6112d63b37ec/c=880-0-2720-2453/local/-/media/2016/03/24/Phoenix/Phoenix/635944349741000389-Banner007.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/20ed9e0e6ce0cdd80818a2e4bf75fd8f0d81b484/c=639-0-3092-2453/local/-/media/2016/03/24/Phoenix/Phoenix/635944349741000389-Banner007.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5da50687244b6c59b46e9763531e4193a6af3ef/c=169-0-3431-2453/local/-/media/2016/03/24/Phoenix/Phoenix/635944349741000389-Banner007.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d5c29abd45294e15b41848eab191ea41c2c28bab/c=0-210-3600-2244&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/03/24/Phoenix/Phoenix/635944349741000389-Banner007.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-27T21:49:58.860000-07:00", "shorthed": "Banner to invest $1 billion for facilities in Tucson, Phoenix", "articleid": 82096184, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c472e2b2f354224323276626285c7d595262faba/c=0-210-3600-2244/local/-/media/2016/03/24/Phoenix/Phoenix/635944349741000389-Banner007.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/69a6f0d44170c878800a60c3bd25d87de1ae0d8b/c=1113-0-2487-2453/local/-/media/2016/03/24/Phoenix/Phoenix/635944349741000389-Banner007.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "renovation, construction, teaching hospital, modernize, Banner Health, Banner-University Medical Center, University of Arizona Health Network, Peter Fine, Phoenix, Tucson"}, "article_summary": "Banner will invest nearly $1 billion in clinics and new teaching-hospital towers in Tucson and Phoenix, and offices for managers and department leaders at the Tucson hospital tower, officials said.\nBy fall 2017, Banner will replace the Epic electronic health-records system used by the two Tucson hospitals with Cerner system used by Banner hospitals.\nThe Phoenix health system plans to spend nearly as much on a trio of major projects at or near Banner-University Medical Center Phoenix, formerly known as Good Samaritan Medical Center.\nBanner Health projects that it will take another year to halt the flow of red ink at the two Tucson hospitals, renamed Banner-University Medical Center Tucson and Banner-University Medical Center South.\nBanner Health CEO Peter Fine said the Phoenix health system did not pursue the merger more than a year ago simply to provide financial stability for the Tucson hospitals."}
