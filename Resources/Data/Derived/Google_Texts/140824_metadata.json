He\u2019s got great size, great athleticism, and he has great skill. When you see a guy that\u2019s an All-American, and has proven everything that he can prove at the Division II level, it\u2019s exciting to bring a player like that who can score, rebound, and pass into your program.\u201d\n\nWhite was named to the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) All-America Team during his junior season, when he averaged 25.8 points, 7.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists per game. He helped the Mountain Lions to their first Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Tournament Championship and to the second round of the 2015 NCAA Division II National Tournament. UCCS finished the 2014-15 season with a program-best 27-6 record.\n\nBoyle called White \u201ca terrific player with a great upside. I look at the last guy that we brought in, that had to sit one year and play one year, his name is Carlon Brown (Pac-12 Conference Tournament's Most Outstanding Player in 2012). Carlon had a pretty good experience and I\u2019m hoping Derrick can do the same.\u201d\n\nWhite, who started every game he played in (87) at UCCS, holds the school career scoring (1,912 points) and assists (343) records. During his sophomore and junior seasons, he helped the Mountain Lions to a 48-15 overall record (.762) and a 33-11 RMAC mark (.750). He reached 11 assists in a game \u2013 a school record \u2013 three times in 2014-15 and recorded 15 career double-doubles.\n\nWhite will be the seventh player to transfer to the CU men\u2019s basketball program under Boyle.\n\nTransfers to CU Program Under Boyle\n\nCarlon Brown (Utah): 2010-12\n\nJeremy Adams (Navarro Junior College [Texas]: 2011-13\n\nSabatino Chen (Denver): 2011-13\n\nBeau Gamble (Santa Clara): 2012-14\n\nKevin Nelson (Missouri State University-West Plains): 2013-2015\n\nJosh Fortune (Providence): 2014-present\n\nDerrick White (UC Colorado Springs): 2015-present", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "University of Colorado men\u2019s basketball head coach Tad Boyle announced Sunday that Derrick White has transferred from Division II University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and has signed a financial aid agreement to play with the Buffaloes.", "language": "english", "author": "CU Media Relations", "og": {"description": "University of Colorado men\u2019s basketball head coach Tad Boyle announced Sunday that Derrick White has transferred from Division II University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and has signed a financial aid agreement to play with the Buffaloes.", "title": "Former UCCS Star Derrick White Transfers to Colorado", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Derrick-White--300601921.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/AE1/3A8/AE13A84971DA49E486D11A975378C424", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/780/203/780203160B3D43EDBD33C042416F1500.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "University of Colorado men\u2019s basketball head coach Tad Boyle announced Sunday that Derrick White has transferred from Division II University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and has signed a financial aid agreement to play with the Buffaloes.", "title": "Former UCCS Star Derrick White Transfers to Colorado", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Derrick-White--300601921.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/cubasketball1.jpg", "creator": "@kktv11news", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Former UCCS Star Derrick White Transfers to Colorado", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Former UCCS Star Derrick White"}, "article_summary": "BOULDER \u2013 University of Colorado men\u2019s basketball head coach Tad Boyle announced Sunday that Derrick White has transferred from Division II University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and has signed a financial aid agreement to play with the Buffaloes.\n\u201cDerrick\u2019s a versatile Division II All-American,\u201d Boyle said.\nHe helped the Mountain Lions to their first Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Tournament Championship and to the second round of the 2015 NCAA Division II National Tournament.\nPer NCAA transfer rules, White, a 6-5, 180-pound guard and a three-year standout at UCCS, will sit out the 2015-16 season and have one year of eligibility remaining.\nHe\u2019s got great size, great athleticism, and he has great skill."}
