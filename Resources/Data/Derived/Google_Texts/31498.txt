Vermillion, SD

While Coyote fans are celebrating Dakota Days, the Vermillion Police Department is working to make sure everyone stays safe and they're doing it in a humerous way on Twitter.

The goal is to deter crime, and they're live tweeting their calls for the second night in a row Saturday.

V-P-D says their goal is to deter the serious crimes, by addressing the routine.

Here are some of the tweets:
