As of June, 23 biosimilar products were in U.S. clinical trials, and as of April, 42 biosimilars were in development-phase meetings.\n\nAccording to Keeping, \u201cSeveral Phase III biosimilar trials started this quarter,\u201d including two for Herceptin (trastuzumab) biosimilars for early breast cancer, two for Humira (adalimumab) biosimilars for rheumatoid arthritis and one for Enbrel (etanercept) for RA and psoriasis.\n\nBioTrends closely tracks the development of these drugs, and Keeping explained that what the company expected last year in terms of biosimilars launching in the U.S. was fairly different from what actually happened. Sandoz\u2019s filgrastim \u2014 which BioTrends expects will be the first biosimilar on the U.S. market \u2014 was expected in late 2013. However, the company said July 24 that the FDA had just accepted its application (see story, p. 1), and the drug now is expected to launch in 2015. The patents for the reference product, Neupogen, have expired.\n\nOther expectations include the following:\n\nCelltrion Inc.\u2019s infliximab, a Remicade biosimilar, was expected in February 2014, but the company just said Aug. 11 that it had filed its application with the FDA (see story, p. 7). The last of Remicade\u2019s patents expire in September 2018, but Celltrion said it has filed a lawsuit against Remicade manufacturer Janssen Biotech, Inc. seeking declaratory judgment that those patents are invalid and unenforceable.\n\nHospira, Inc.\u2019s epoetin alfa, a biosimilar version of Epogen and Procrit, was expected in June 2014, but the filing is expected in the fourth quarter of this year or early next year. The reference drugs\u2019 patents have expired.\n\nSandoz\u2019s pegfilgrastim was expected this August, and the company is preparing to file. The patents for reference drug Neulasta expire in October 2015.\n\nThe FDA has released seven guidance documents \u2014 the most recent one earlier this month on reference product exclusivity and before that in May with a document on clinical pharmacology data (SPN 6/14, p. 1) \u2014 since the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) establishing the 351(k) approval pathway for biosimilars became law as part of the Affordable Care Act. Keeping says additional guidance still expected in 2014 will address the following topics:\n\nDemonstrating interchangeability,\n\nLabeling for biosimilars, and\n\nAdditional questions and answers on BPCIA implementation.\n\nThe first two topics are \u201cthe most important,\u201d Keeping tells SPN, adding that she assumes the labeling guidance would include information on naming biosimilars, which has been a contentious issue (SPN 7/14, p. 11; SPN 9/12, p. 11).\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of pressure on the FDA to do something on naming,\u201d says an industry source who asks not to be identified. However, BPCIA does not use the word \u201cname\u201d anywhere, and when you come down to it, a biosimilar is first and foremost a biologic, points out the source. As such, the system that has been used for all other biologics, including those currently on the U.S. market with shared international non-proprietary names, would seem appropriate. In fact, explains the source, this is the position articulated in the FDA policy paper on biosimilar naming and archived on the FDA website.\n\nView the FDA policy paper at http://tinyurl.com/l8l9dnb.\n\n\u00a9 2014 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
