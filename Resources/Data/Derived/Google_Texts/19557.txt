Bobby Jindal yesterday threw down the gauntlet to try and challenge Ted Cruz to a one-on-one debate.

In the wake of the widely-panned CNBC debate, Cruz declined to sign the joint GOP letter to networks, saying he would be willing to debate anyone, anytime, anywhere.

Well, in speaking to The Washington Post yesterday, Jindal said, “He said he’ll debate anyone, anytime, so let’s do it in Milwaukee. I’m happy to do it.”

He wants the debate to be focused around Obamacare and what they would each replace it with. Jindal told WaPo that “we’ve written our own plan and campaigned on it, rather than just complaining about Obamacare,” even taking some shots at Cruz for “want[ing] to shut the government down.

Now, this might seem like a somewhat desperate move, seeing as how Jindal is polling way below Cruz and is in the undercard debate next week, but it’s not the first time he’s honed in on the Texas senator. He took some shots at Cruz months ago for leeching onto Donald Trump in the hopes of getting his supporters once he falters, and more recently pressed Cruz on his silence about Trump’s health care plan.
