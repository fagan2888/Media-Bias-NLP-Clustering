But as his foot hovers over the water, James notices a figure watching him in the dark: the World\u2019s First and Foremost Consulting Detective, Sherlock Holmes.\n\nUntil recently, Holmes had been under the impression that his partner, Dr. Watson, was the author of his exploits appearing in The Strand, and that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was merely his literary agent. However, Holmes has noticed continuity errors in his life, and through his powers of deduction, come to a disturbing realization.\n\n\u201cI am, the evidence has proven to me most conclusively, a literary construct. Some ink-stained scribbler\u2019s creation.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Holmes\u2019 appetite for unsolved mysteries has led him to the real-life suicide in 1885 of American socialite Clover Adams, the inspiration for Henry James\u2019 early novel, \u201cThe Portrait of a Lady.\u201d\n\nHolmes believes Clover was murdered. Every year on the anniversary of her death, Clover\u2019s late husband Henry Adams (grandson of former president John Quincy Adams) receives an anonymous calling card in the mail embossed with five hearts, one of which has been scratched out: like the novel\u2019s title, it\u2019s an allusion to the Five of Hearts, a group of influential Washingtonians who regularly gathered for tea in Clover\u2019s parlor.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Dan Simmons, who lives in Boulder, has infused his Hugo award-winning fiction with history. \u201cThe Terror\u201d (2007) reimagined the lost Arctic expedition of John Franklin as an encounter with mythical horror, while \u201cDrood\u201d (2009) explored the final years of Charles Dickens\u2019 life through the eyes of Wilkie Collins.\n\nThis time, Simmons has essentially written a literary buddy comedy, and the result is his funniest and breeziest novel to date, despite its heft. The reluctant, cantankerous Henry James is a perfect foil for Holmes. At first, James balks at the prospect of a transcontinental goose chase: \u201cThere is no power, means, force, blackmail, inducement, or other method of persuasion \u2014 in this lifetime or in any other possible variation of this life \u2014 that you could use to persuade me to travel with you tomorrow,\u201d he quips. And Simmons\u2019 Holmes is full of such delightful non sequiturs as \u201cI see the physiognomy of men, not their added facial-hair accoutrements. I am, for instance, somewhat of an expert on ears.\u201d\n\nAs they travel from Paris to Washington, and finally to the same World\u2019s Fair in Chicago that Erik Larson brought to life in \u201cThe Devil in the White City,\u201d the odd couple encounters Teddy Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge and Mark Twain in the search for truth.\n\nEven with a body of work as impressive as Simmons has accrued in the past 30 years, \u201cThe Fifth Heart\u201d is one of his most engrossing and addictive books to date.\n\nFICTION: MYSTERY\n\nThe Fifth Heart\n\nby Dan Simmons (Little, Brown)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Review: \u201cThe Fifth Heart\u201d by Dan Simmons", "title": "Review: \u201cThe Fifth Heart\u201d by Dan Simmons", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/26/review-the-fifth-heart-by-dan-simmons/", "image": {"width": 260, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150326__20150329_E10_BK29REVIEWFIFTHHEARTp1.jpg", "height": 404}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150326__20150329_E10_BK29REVIEWFIFTHHEARTp1.jpg?w=240", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-26T18:10:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:44:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb404\"", "article_summary": "And Simmons\u2019 Holmes is full of such delightful non sequiturs as \u201cI see the physiognomy of men, not their added facial-hair accoutrements.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Dan Simmons, who lives in Boulder, has infused his Hugo award-winning fiction with history.\nFICTION: MYSTERYThe Fifth Heartby Dan Simmons (Little, Brown)\nThe reluctant, cantankerous Henry James is a perfect foil for Holmes.\nEven with a body of work as impressive as Simmons has accrued in the past 30 years, \u201cThe Fifth Heart\u201d is one of his most engrossing and addictive books to date."}
