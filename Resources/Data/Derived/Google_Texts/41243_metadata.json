But we\u2019re not surprised. We\u2019ve been watching government chip away at this for some time.\n\nAccording to the AAMC, \u201cunder every combination of scenarios modeled, the United States will face a shortage of physicians over the next decade. . . . ranging between 61,700 and 94,700, with a significant shortage showing among many surgical specialties.\u201d\n\nAAMC President and CEO Darrell G. Kirch said \u201cthe physician shortage is real, it\u2019s significant, and the nation must begin to train more doctors now if patients are going to be able to receive the care they need when they need it in the near future.\u201d But being a doctor isn\u2019t quite what it once was. Filling the gaps won\u2019t be easy.\n\nThe folks who forced ObamaCare on us said this shortage wouldn\u2019t happen. In fact, they told us that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would \u201cexpand the number of primary-care doctors, nurses, and physician assistants.\u201d We knew better, though. In 2009 we commissioned a poll that told us just the opposite: Hundreds of thousands \u2014 45% of those surveyed \u2014 said that if ObamaCare became law, they would shut down their practices or retire early.\n\nDriving the shortage is ObamaCare\u2019s attempt to expand access to health care. The increased demand to see a doctor is outstripping the supply of physicians. With so many new patients, the medical colleges can\u2019t produce enough doctors to keep up.\n\nObamaCare is also harming the incentives to practice medicine. Michael Tanner of Cato Institute reminds us that due to the law\u2019s effort to cut costs, \u201cby mid century, Medicare will be reimbursing at barely 50 cents on the dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter that,\u201d writes Tanner, \u201cplaying golf in Florida is going to look pretty good to a number of physicians.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the doctor who told our poll that \u201cphysicians will be expected to work more for less, so many will just opt out.\u201d\n\nOf course ObamaCare is not driving the shortage alone. There are other factors.\n\nOne of those is the tax burden that many physicians have to deal with. Another Cato scholar points out that \u201chigh income tax rates inhibit the supply of top earners across all industries,\u201d including health care. Doctors \u2014 who slog through years of school and internships, incur heavy school debts and often put in grueling workdays \u2014 are saddled with \u201cpunitive marginal income tax rates on them of up to 40%, with state income taxes on top of that,\u201d says Cato\u2019s Chris Edwards.\n\n\u201cWith high tax rates,\u201d he adds, \u201cfewer people will want to go into this difficult profession, stay in it, and work the long hours \u2013 \u2013 and that ends up hurting all of us who use the nation\u2019s health care system.\u201d\n\nThe real threat of abusive, frivolous and costly malpractice lawsuits is another element that can push physicians into other fields or retirement. That\u2019s not to say that all malpractice suits are spurious \u2014 many are legitimate. But physicians need better protection from patients seeking jackpot justice. We suggest that lawmakers limit court awards in these cases so that doctors\u2019 malpractice insurance costs won\u2019t be so unreasonably high.\n\nAs is too often the case, poor government policy is causing widespread problems. Will lawmakers ever learn? Unfortunately, history shows us that too many of them are incapable of understanding just how destructive they are.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A doctor shortage that will surely have a negative impact on our well-being is looming.
