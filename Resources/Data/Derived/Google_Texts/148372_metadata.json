Across genres, new songs were unveiled and fresh obsessions cemented.\n\n\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all love; with acts like Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers scheduled at the same time as Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, friendly rivalries heated up in competition. Artists had to bring their A-games in order to hold the fickle crowd\u2019s attention. Read on to see who managed to shine in a sea full of stars:\n\nOutside Lands Friday Highlights: Kanye, Kacey & More\n\n1:40 PM: Tennessee treasure Valerie June teases out new songs for the small but ardent audience members who have gotten an early jump on their day. She\u2019s enviably positioned at the Sutro stage, the area that greets guests as they come through the gates.\n\n\n\n1:55 PM: Britpop preservationists The Kooks have drawn an impressive amount of people to the main stage at this hour. It\u2019s already evident that even though all three days of the festival were sold out, there are a lot more bodies in attendance today than the day before.\n\n\n\n2:30 PM: Australia\u2019s psychedelic dance trio Jagwar Ma are tripping out over the trees. \u201cIt\u2019s cool seeing all these eucalyptus trees here,\u201d says frontman Gabriel Winterfield. \u201cWhere we're from, there's koalas in them.\u201d\n\n\n\n2:50 PM: \u201cRelease your wiggle!\u201d On the GastroMagic stage, where food and music mash up, New Orleans bounce ambassador Big Freedia eggs on awkward audience members to make it clap for fluffy beignets from local institution Brenda\u2019s French Soul Food. (Chef Brenda Buenviaje is standing behind them, giggling.) Freedia\u2019s own female and male backup dancers bounce into the splits, leap in Capoeira-like flips and execute other fierce, gravity-defying maneuvers not seen too often around these parts. The whole scene is ridiculously infectious; we\u2019re twerking in a tree.\n\n\n\n3:12 PM: Unicorns are spotted sipping rare vintages inside the Wine Lands pavilion. In fact, there are a lot of furries in here and it suddenly occurs that they are the smartest group at the festival. No, really -- they\u2019re shrouded in fuzzy, head-to-toe warmth and protected from the misty and upper 50-degree weather that is Golden Gate Park\u2019s hallmark.\n\n\n\n3:21 PM: East Bay indie rockers Finish Ticket recently made the leap into the major label world, signing with Atlantic Records to release the album Tears You Apart. As they perform \u201cTranquilize,\u201d a big and memorable single with a sedate name, it\u2019s clear how far they\u2019ve grown since working the local all-ages concert circuit. Singer Brendan Hoye (whose twin Michael Hoye is on bass) expresses how excited they are to be back home.\n\n\n\n3:52 PM: San Francisco\u2019s own rising electronic producer Scott Hansen (aka Tycho) is also so happy to be playing at Outside Lands after a lengthy stint on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s really great to be home,\u201d he says, \u201cWe never could have dreamed of this!\u201d His lush basslines and leisurely downtempo-to-ambient pace has people laying down blankets for the perfect en masse chill moment.\n\n\n\n4:14 PM: A sizable line is forming for the Sip and Shave lounge, an old-fashioned grooming service for men hosted by Esquire Network. Huh?\n\nEste at Outside land #haim pic.twitter.com/kMGpTyWGCs \u2014 Amnesia (@RealPatex) August 10, 2014\n\n\n\n4:45 PM: Haim woke up like this; they\u2019re flawless. But why are they on so early? Can these goddesses of rock please come back on later? Lead sister Danielle Haim insists that San Francisco is their second home and asks everyone to pretend they\u2019re in the Haim family living room, complete with beer coozies and endless snacks. A gajillion girls instantly rise up on shoulders. Then the jam really begins, and Este Haim\u2019s infamous \u201cbass face\u201d comes out to play. They look so good tonight.\n\n\n\n5:17 PM: Fried dough has been on the brain since Big Freedia\u2019s booty bounce beignet brunch earlier in the day. Fortunately, the epicurean caliber of this festival is second to none, and carby cravings are not hard to find here. These come dusted in powdered sugar and drizzled in chocolate sauce.\n\n\n\n6:00 PM: Death Cab For Cutie eschews brand new for retro, even though there\u2019s a demand for new material. The band starts this set with early songs like \u201cI Will Possess Your Heart,\u201d \u201cCrooked Teeth\u201d and \u201cI Will Follow You Into The Dark.\u201d It almost feels like eavesdropping on a private conversation.\n\n\n\n6:45 PM: Queen diva Big Freedia and his dancers have way more wiggle room on the larger Panhandle stage, and the booty quaking is even more widespread out here. Particularly among less-than-coordinated dude bros.\n\n\n\n7:22 PM: As A-Trak and Armand Van Helden spin tough tunes by their dance duo Duck Sauce from the flashy confines of a neon bowl, plastic duck bills are thrown out into the crowd. \u201cI wanna see some bills up on shoulders!\u201d commands A-Trak. \u201cLemme see my female quacks. My duck ladies -- make it beautiful!\u201d Just as we start to think that they\u2019re having too much fun up there, they come out from behind the decks to spray everyone with Supersoaker-powered streams of water.\n\n\n\n8:14 PM: After singing the patriotic favorite \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down,\u201d Tom Petty expresses gratitude: \u201cThank you for singing, I can hear you out there!\u201d The field is even louder for the next song, the MTV hit \u201cFree Fallin.'\u201d\n\n\n\n8:36 PM: This is a Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers set, but the band still performs \u201cTweeter and the Monkey Man,\u201d a 1988 song by The Traveling Wilburys, the supergroup consisting of Petty, Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, George Harrison and Jim Keltner.\n\n\n\n9:03 PM: The crowd sings the chorus on an acoustic version of \u201cLearning To Fly.\" It\u2019s an intimate moment shared among tens of thousands.\n\n\n\n9:09 PM: The consequence of arriving late to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis\u2019 set is having no clue as to why they\u2019ve started their set dressed as a mariachi man and the Karate Kid. But they soon shed the flair for basic white as they invite Chris Mansfield aka Fences onstage to perform their new single \u201cArrows\u201d for the second time ever.\n\n\n\n9:15 PM: Mack praises the Bay Area\u2019s history of civil rights, including the fight for \u201cthe right for all hearts to have the freedom to love whoever they wanna love.\u201d He brings a woman named Jenny onstage to propose to her stunned girlfriend Natalie. The betrothed walk off as Mary Lambert, resplendent in a bright red dress, starts singing \u201cSame Love.\u201d Dry eyes, we hardly knew ye.\n\n\n\n9:29 PM: \u201cI\u2019m a huge Tom Petty fan,\u201d Macklemore insists, \u201cbut when we drop this beat I want everyone at Tom Petty to hear you turn the f--k up!\u201d That\u2019s right, the Heartbreakers \u201cCan\u2019t Hold Us!\u201d\n\n\n\n9:41 PM: Tom Petty\u2019s stage is lit up in red, white and blue for the second and final song of the encore, \u201cAmerican Girl.\u201d \u201cThe first time we played this was at The Keystone in Palo Alto,\u201d recalls Petty. \u201cWe're gonna reach back to 1976!\u201d\n\n\n\n9:48 PM: Petty takes his guitar off and waves to the crowd. The band locks arms and takes a collective bow as he says, \"God bless and good night.\" With some of Outside Lands\u2019 biggest acts still to come on Sunday, there are boundless potential blessings still to be revealed.\n\n\n\nAdditional reporting by Jason Black", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "The second day of San Francisco\u2019s annual music and arts festival Outside Lands brought classic rock hits, booty bouncing beats, furry freaks and even a surprise same-sex wedding proposal to scenic Golden Gate Park.", "title": "Outside Lands 2014 Saturday Highlights: Tom Petty, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Haim and More", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6214276/outside-lands-2014-saturday-highlights-tom-petty-macklemore", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/macklemore-outsidelands-2014-billboard-650-430.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The second day of San Francisco\u2019s annual music and arts festival Outside Lands brought classic rock hits, booty bouncing beats, furry freaks and even a surprise same-sex wedding proposal to scenic Golden Gate Park.", "title": "Outside Lands 2014 Saturday Highlights: Tom Petty, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Haim and More", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6214276/outside-lands-2014-saturday-highlights-tom-petty-macklemore", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/macklemore-outsidelands-2014-billboard-650-430.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The second day of San Francisco\u2019s annual music and arts festival Outside Lands brought classic rock hits, booty bouncing beats, furry freaks and even a surprise same-sex wedding proposal to scenic Golden Gate Park.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Outside Lands 2014 Saturday Highlights: Tom Petty, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Haim and More | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecf2\"", "article_summary": "But it wasn\u2019t all love; with acts like Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers scheduled at the same time as Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, friendly rivalries heated up in competition.\nWith some of Outside Lands\u2019 biggest acts still to come on Sunday, there are boundless potential blessings still to be revealed.\n3:52 PM: San Francisco\u2019s own rising electronic producer Scott Hansen (aka Tycho) is also so happy to be playing at Outside Lands after a lengthy stint on the road.\nEste at Outside land #haim pic.twitter.com/kMGpTyWGCs \u2014 Amnesia (@RealPatex) August 10, 20144:45 PM: Haim woke up like this; they\u2019re flawless.\nThe second day of San Francisco\u2019s annual music and arts festival Outside Lands brought classic rock hits, booty bouncing beats, furry freaks and even a surprise same-sex wedding proposal to scenic Golden Gate Park."}
