Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, accepted an ice bucket challenge Saturday from former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

Mrs. Giffords has spent her post-congressional career pushing for stricter gun control after she was critically injured by a gunshot wound to the head in 2011. She challenged the NRA executive to dump a bucket of ice water over his head in the viral trend that benefits charities fighting ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, Mediaite reported.

The rules of the game dictate that if the person challenged completes the stunt, the challenger then has to donate to an ALS charity. If the challenged person doesn’t agree, he or she then has to pay.

Mr. Pierre said he’ll be writing a check and challenged NBA player Karl Malone, NASCAR driver Austin Dillon and retired Lieutenant Col. Oliver North.
