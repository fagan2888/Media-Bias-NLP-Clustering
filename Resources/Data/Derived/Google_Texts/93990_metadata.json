He tried to get some attention to attract a candidate to actually run against the president when he was running for re-election,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told a gymnasium full of voters near the campus of a historically black college here.\n\nIt was a reprisal of her offensive at Thursday night\u2019s debate, but she escalated her assault further, portraying Mr. Sanders as an impediment to the health care law so associated with Mr. Obama that, she noted, it bears his name. \u2026\n\nSeparately, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her, Priorities USA, said it would begin running ads that Mrs. Clinton is the true heir to Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.\n\nThe electorate in the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27 is expected to be at least half black, a constituency that reveres Mr. Obama and was crucial in his defeat of Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 Democratic contest here.\n\nMrs. Clinton still enjoys a substantial advantage over Mr. Sanders among African-Americans in polls, but her campaign is plainly concerned about his making inroads with such voters. Her campaign has conducted focus groups of African-American voters, an aide said, which revealed that many of them associate attacks on the health law as no different from attacks on Mr. Obama himself.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.vdare.com/posts/hillary-campaigns-to-be-americas-third-black-president?page=no-campaign", "image": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/13105306/13dems1-master675.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Mrs. Clinton still enjoys a substantial advantage over Mr. Sanders among African-Americans in polls, but her campaign is plainly concerned about his making inroads with such voters.\nIt was a reprisal of her offensive at Thursday night\u2019s debate, but she escalated her assault further, portraying Mr. Sanders as an impediment to the health care law so associated with Mr. Obama that, she noted, it bears his name.\n\u2026Separately, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her, Priorities USA, said it would begin running ads that Mrs. Clinton is the true heir to Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.\nHer campaign has conducted focus groups of African-American voters, an aide said, which revealed that many of them associate attacks on the health law as no different from attacks on Mr. Obama himself.\nThe electorate in the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27 is expected to be at least half black, a constituency that reveres Mr. Obama and was crucial in his defeat of Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 Democratic contest here."}
