Although many celebrity writers were focused on who won, others writing about the CMAs were chiming in about Carrie Underwood\u2019s baby bump. Regardless, Twitter users were not afraid to quickly define the ugliest, baddest, and horrible aspects of the Country Music Awards \u2014 and post about it on their news feed.\n\nFashion is usually the highlight of the CMAs, and Perez Hilton referenced Carrie Underwood\u2019s bellbottom yellow floral pants as hideous in 2013.\n\nThis year, Perez Hilton had criticisms of Ariana Grande\u2019s outfit.\n\n\u201cShe wore the same outfit during her Today Show performance this past August. Well, minus those super cool LED lights outlining her midriff! Other than the deja vu we\u2019re getting, the singer showed off those sexy stems in this shiny, silver ensem[ble]!\u201d\n\nWhile there were some hints about the several badly-dressed celebrities at the CMAs, specific stars were targeted. For instance, Kacey Musgrave was the the epitome of terrible appearances for a few Twitter users who were critical of her overall style at the 2014 CMAs.\n\nCriticisms of the CMAs in the past have included long lists of red carpet fumbles, but the types of subjects the stars talk about on the show have also been criticized. For instance, fans despised Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley for being critical of Obamacare during the 2013 CMAs.\n\nThe Daily Mail UK covered the skit saying, \u201cCountry music stars Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood treated an approving crowd to a mocking skit about Obamacare during Wednesday night\u2019s Country Music Awards broadcast. The hilarity began with Paisley saying he had sustained a \u2018twerking injury,\u2019 and his co-host Underwood suggesting Obamacare as the solution.\u201d\n\nFor the 2014 CMAs, Twitter was full of critics. A majority of the posts that denoted the awards show was terrible focused on technical malfunctions with the audio. There was also a general complaint about the CMAs that country music had gone downhill, was no longer the genre it was in the past, and had become heavily inundated with rock-n-roll and pop stars.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The CMAs were not up to par for 2014, and several Twitter users were quick to explain why.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The CMAs were not up to par for 2014, and several Twitter users were quick to explain why.", "title": "Twitter CMAs Critics Define The Worst: Audio Was \u2018Horrible,\u2019 Country Music Is Too Pop", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1589314/twitter-cmas-critics-define-the-worst-audio-was-horrible-country-music-is-too-pop/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Perez-Hilton-was-critical-of-Ariana-Grandes-CMA-2014-dress.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-06T05:58:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T07:22:06+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Perez-Hilton-was-critical-of-Ariana-Grandes-CMA-2014-dress.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-11-06T05:58:21+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "cmas,awards,bad,brad paisley,carrie underwood,celebrities,country music,country music awards,kacey musgrave,nashville,pop music,steven tyler,tennessee,twitter,music", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Perez-Hilton-was-critical-of-Ariana-Grandes-CMA-2014-dress.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The CMAs were not up to par for 2014, and several Twitter users were quick to explain why."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc1a\"", "article_summary": "Regardless, Twitter users were not afraid to quickly define the ugliest, baddest, and horrible aspects of the Country Music Awards \u2014 and post about it on their news feed.\nThe Daily Mail UK covered the skit saying, \u201cCountry music stars Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood treated an approving crowd to a mocking skit about Obamacare during Wednesday night\u2019s Country Music Awards broadcast.\nMembers of the music industry voted for their favorites for the 2014 CMAs, but Twitter users had their own critical views of the show.\nFor instance, fans despised Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley for being critical of Obamacare during the 2013 CMAs.\nFor instance, Kacey Musgrave was the the epitome of terrible appearances for a few Twitter users who were critical of her overall style at the 2014 CMAs."}
