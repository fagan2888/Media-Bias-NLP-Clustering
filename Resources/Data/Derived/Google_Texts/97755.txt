DENVER -

VA investigators say workers at a Colorado Springs clinic incorrectly reported that 59 veterans got health care appointments sooner than they did.

The Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General said Thursday it found the false records at the Floyd K. Lindstrom Outpatient Clinic. The report didn't say whether the records were deliberately falsified to make the clinic's performance look better.



The VA took issue with parts of the report but said it had removed a manager and reorganized staff to address the problems.



The investigation reviewed 450 appointments from October 2014 through September 2015 after a veteran complained about the clinic.



The VA has been struggling nationwide to shorten the time veterans have to wait for appointments. Some employees have been accused of falsifying documents to cover up the problem.
