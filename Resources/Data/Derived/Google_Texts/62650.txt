Ardian, Led by Dominique Senequier, Raises Fourth Infrastructure Fund

The investment firm recently closed a co-investment fund and a European debt fund

Expecting to leverage the shakeup in the global energy industry, Ardian has raised capital to invest in European infrastructure. The Ardian Infrastructure Fund IV with €2.65 billion ($2.88 billion) surpasses the $1.9 billion fund the firm closed in 2013.

The new fund attracted $980 million from new investors. It also raised capital from European, North American and Asian pension firm, along with sovereign wealth and insurance companies.

“The speed at which this process was conducted demonstrates the market recognition of the team,” says Ardian president Dominique Senequier. She founded the private equity group of French insurer Axa in 1996 and spun it off in 2013, renaming it Ardian. Senequier also serves on supervisory board of luxury brand Hermes International.

Ardian has already begun investing out of the new fund. Commitments include: Italy’s largest airport holding company; a Portuguese toll network operator; and a French oil transportation and storage company. Ardian will seek targets in the oil sector, hoping to take advantage of low prices.

In 2015, Ardian raised its fourth co-investment fund with $1.17 billion as well as a $2.25 billion European debt fund. The firm recently sold its majority stake in medical device manufacturer Lima Corp. to EQT. In 2014 the firm purchased a $1.3 billion limited partnership portfolio from GE, which consists of LP interests in U.S. buyout funds.

Private equity firms have been active raising funds. On Jan. 11, Nautic Partners closed a $900 million fund and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners raised a $3.5 billion fund.
