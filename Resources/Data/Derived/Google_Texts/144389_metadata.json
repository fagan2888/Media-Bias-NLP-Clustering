No one was killed or injured in the explosion, and there was \u201conly minimal surface charring to the exterior wall of the building,\u201d which also includes a hair salon. The explosion could have been much worse, however, as the explosive device was placed next to a gasoline can in an apparent attempt to increase the force of the explosion. The gasoline did not ignite.\n\nThe FBI statement adds that a \u201cpotential person of interest in this investigation is a Caucasian male, approximately 40 years of age, and balding. He may be driving a 2000 or older model dirty, white pick-up truck with paneling, a dark colored bed liner, open tailgate, and a missing or covered license plate.\u201d\n\nAlthough the apparent bomber\u2019s motives are not yet known, bombings were a common terrorist tactic during the Jim Crow era. The city of Birmingham, Alabama became known as \u201cBombingham\u201d due to a rash of bombings targeting black homes and churches, including a 1963 church bombing that killed four girls.
