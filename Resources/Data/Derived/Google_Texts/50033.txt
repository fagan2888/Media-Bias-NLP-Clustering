THE world is rallying behind the young fast bowler who delivered the bouncer that struck Phillip Hughes, causing the freakish and very rare injury which led to his death.

There have been growing concerns around the country for Sean Abbott, who is distraught at the tragic news.

Hughes died on Thursday as a result of his “catastrophic head injury” suffered from the blow.

The family of Hughes have shown their support for Abbott, including Hughes’ sister Megan who has spent “significant time” with the devastated cricketer.

Former Test fast bowler player Stuart Clark said he’d spent time with the NSW bowler on Thursday night.

The 22-year-old had a naturally quiet temperament but appeared OK, with at least three supporters always around him, Clark said.

“It will be the hardest for him when it’s quiet and there’s nothing happening,” he told Sky Sports Radio.

“When he’s sitting at home at night before he goes to bed — that’s when the thoughts will start recurring in his mind.”

Fellow Test veteran Jason Gillespie said Abbott’s personal and professional life had been rocked by an unprecedented tragedy.

“That lad is absolutely shaken and broken at the moment,” he told Fox Sports News.

While the cricket fraternity had rallied around the young bowler, former Australian captain Mark Taylor said Abbott would be haunted by the tragic accident.

“He’s got no questions to answer but I’m sure he’ll be feeling some guilt today and probably will be for a long time,” he said.

“I really hope Sean can get over it and we one day see Sean back playing for NSW and maybe Australia.”

Phillip Hughes Death is so incredibly tragic... Thoughts go out to his family and to Sean Abbott in this very diificult time for them all — Andy Murray (@andy_murray) November 27, 2014

“What Sean has gone through has been an incredibly traumatic experience, as it has been for everyone who was present on the field that day,” Australia team doctor Peter Brukner said on Thursday.

“Sean is receiving all the possible support from Cricket NSW and Australia.

“Sean came to the hospital yesterday. He’s been receiving a lot of support from Cricket NSW and his teammates.

“When he came to the hospital yesterday, Michael Clarke came down and spent a significant amount of time with him.

“Phillip’s sister also spent significant time with Sean.”

Bouncers have long been a key component of cricket and no one is placing any blame whatsoever on the 22-year-old Abbott.

Australian Test legend Ian Chappell added: “It’s going to be hard for (Abbott).

“There’s a lot of people to feel for.”

News_Rich_Media: Prime Minister Tony Abbott says Phillip Hughes' death should act as a reminder of the risks that our sportspeople run to entertain us.

Abbott has been receiving counselling over the incident.

Clark explained it was a fast bowler’s job to “intimidate” and he hoped the freak accident would not jeopardise Abbott’s career.

“I’ve heard at different stages that [Abbott] is struggling a little bit with it all,” Clark told Fox Sports News.

“[But] he’s out there to get Phil Hughes out. It’s a competitive sport. It’s professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment.

“You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don’t want that.

“We want Sean Abbott to have the best possible career he can.”

Former Test wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist led the chorus on social media.

“May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott,” Gilchrist wrote.

Cricket Australia added: “The strength of the cricket family is more important than ever on this incredibly sad day. Please keep Sean Abbott in your thoughts.”

Former England captain Michael Vaughan also took to Twitter to support Abbott.

Another huge talent was also just doing what he loved...doing his job...and is brilliant at it.....#SeanAbbott #RIPHughes — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) November 27, 2014

Former England cricket captain Sir Ian Botham tweeted: “A very sad day for the world of cricket. So sorry for Phillip Hughes and his family. Spare a thought for Sean Abbott.”

Former Test bowler Bryce McGain told the ABC Hughes and Abbott have a long history together.

“They’ve been close mates all the way through,” he said.

“Phil Hughes started his cricket with New South Wales and all these boys grew up together, they played under-age cricket for New South Wales and it’s quite a shock for them all.

“You could see was the first player there and he was holding him in his hands, there was a lot of care shown.”

News_Rich_Media: Stuart Clark says former teammate Phillip Hughes loved the game of cricket and there was nothing else he wanted to do.

On a day where cricketers past and present paid tribute to Hughes, the impact of his passing also extended to other sports, with tennis stars Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal, regular visitors to Melbourne for the Australian Open, taking to Twitter to extend their condolences.

“Phillip Hughes Death is so incredibly tragic... Thoughts go out to his family and to Sean Abbott in this very difficult time for them all,” Murray tweeted.

Cricket has little following in Spain but Nadal, one of the country’s greatest sportsmen, wrote: “Shocked about the news of Oz’s cricketer Phil Hughes. My thoughts with the family and the cricket fans.”
