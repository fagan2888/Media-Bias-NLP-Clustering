Raised by a single mother of three who held three jobs to support the family, Cole entered the workforce as soon as it was legal. At 15, she started selling clothes at a mall. At 17, she added a second job at a restaurant\u2014first as a hostess and then as a waitress. After juggling these jobs through high school, Cole became the first person in her family to attend college. She studied engineering and planned to go to law school, but those aspirations would soon be shattered. The restaurant was Hooters, and Cole continued working there in college. When a cook quit, she volunteered to fill in. When a manager departed, she didn\u2019t hesitate to cover that role too. By age 20, her restaurant responsibilities were so consuming that she failed her classes and dropped out of school. There\u2019s little doubt that Cole\u2019s helpfulness paid off for Hooters. By filling in for a cook and a manager, she prevented long wait times and maintained customer service standards. Indeed, research shows that in restaurants, the more often employees help, the higher their revenue, operating efficiency, cleanliness, and customer satisfaction. This evidence holds up in a wide range of industries, from banking and manufacturing to healthcare and retail: helping behaviors play an important role in organizational effectiveness.\n\nUnfortunately, when people like Kat Cole step up to help, they seem to make their organizations better at their own expense. In professional settings, it\u2019s all too easy to take generosity for granted, especially when it comes from women. In a series of studies, NYU psychologists Madeline Heilman and Julie Chen found that volunteering to help colleagues boosted performance evaluations and rewards for men, but not women. NYU psychologists found that volunteering boosted the performance evaluations of men, but not women. Simmons management professor Joyce Fletcher refers to helping behaviors by women as disappearing acts, as they often vanish without proper credit or reciprocity. \u201cWhen a man helps a colleague, the recipient feels indebted to him and is highly likely to return the favor. But when a woman helps out, the feeling of indebtedness is weaker,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg observed in Lean In. There\u2019s no need to reciprocate, because \u201cshe wants to help.\u201d Wanting to help may have stalled Kat Cole\u2019s education, but it\u2019s also the force that accelerated her career. At age 32, Cole was named the president of a company called Cinnabon, Inc. She is now 35, and the company reached $1 billion in global branded sales last year. Although Cole\u2019s helpfulness didn\u2019t necessarily reap rewards right away, it paid dividends over time. In my book Give and Take, I report evidence that being a \u201cgiver\u201d who enjoys helping others can be inefficient in the short run but surprisingly productive in the long run. Givers tend to start out with lower sales revenue and lower medical school grades. In sales, givers often put their customers\u2019 needs above their own sales targets. In medicine, before big exams, givers are so busy helping their friends study that they fail to fill the holes in their own understanding. Yet after a year in sales, the highest revenue belongs to those same generous people, and by the end of medical school, the top grades belong to the students with the most passion for helping others. When I wrote the book, I attributed the long-term success of givers to two major forces: relationships and motivation. From a relationship perspective, givers build deeper and broader connections. When a salesperson truly cares about you, trust forms, and you\u2019re more likely to buy, come back for repeat business, and refer new customers. From a motivation perspective, helping others enriches the meaning and purpose of our own lives, showing us that our contributions matter and energizing us to work harder, longer, and smarter. When medical students focus on helping others, they\u2019re able to weather the slings and arrows of long hours and devastating health outcomes: they know their colleagues and patients are depending on them. Related Story Why We're Sometimes Kind Without Reason Beyond relationships and motivation, Kat Cole\u2019s story reveals a third reason why helping others can yield long-term benefits: learning. By volunteering to help with different roles, she acquired a set of knowledge and skills. \u201cWhen the cook quit, I learned how to run the kitchen, and when the manager quit, I learned how to run a shift,\u201d Cole says.\n\nAt the time, Hooters was expanding internationally. At age 19, Cole was invited to Australia to open the first Hooters restaurant there. Although other candidates had college degrees and more experience, \u201cI was one of the few people who had worked every job in the building,\u201d Cole explains. \u201cI was in the right place at the right time with a company that was growing. But at the same time, I\u2019d worked my buns off to be known as someone who could get the job done\u2026 I genuinely wanted to help.\u201d When she dropped out of college at 20, it was because she was flying around the world to launch Hooters in Australia and Latin America. \u201cI sacrificed the pursuit of higher education, and my dream of being an attorney with an engineering degree,\u201d Cole tells me, \u201cto follow my passion and help others build their businesses.\u201d That year, she was invited to become the head of corporate training. She climbed up the ladder from there, opening more restaurants along the way in Asia and Africa. Did Cole benefit from each of her individual decisions to help out by learning a new role? No. Over time, though, there was a cumulative benefit of learning the full set of jobs. Even when there aren\u2019t different positions to learn, helpfulness can fuel the acquisition of knowledge. Peter Audet is the managing director of a financial advisory firm in Australia, and his career was launched by the knowledge he acquired through helping. At 19, he worked as a customer service representative in an insurance company. He was so motivated to help the policyholders and agents who called in that he ended up educating himself about investing and retirement planning. Soon, he was the youngest department supervisor in the company, won the Personality of the Year award, and was profiled in a local newspaper under the headline, \u201cYou only get back what you give.\u201d By 22, he had obtained the expertise necessary to become a financial adviser. New evidence supports the notion that giving facilitates learning. In a study of employees at a large consulting firm led by Rutgers professor Neha Shah, the highest performers were those who provided the most help to colleagues in solving task-related problems. Why? As the consultants shared knowledge about the challenges that colleagues confronted, they gained specific insights about their own work and became better problem-solvers in general.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research shows that even if the rewards aren&#39;t immediately apparent, contributing to the success of others pays off in the long run.", "author": "Adam Grant", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Research shows that even if the rewards aren&#39;t immediately apparent, contributing to the success of others pays off in the long run.", "title": "How to Succeed Professionally by Helping Others", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/03/1204630277_438b59e54f_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/how-to-succeed-professionally-by-helping-others/284429/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95d0\"", "article_summary": "After juggling these jobs through high school, Cole became the first person in her family to attend college.\nIn sales, givers often put their customers\u2019 needs above their own sales targets.\nSimmons management professor Joyce Fletcher refers to helping behaviors by women as disappearing acts, as they often vanish without proper credit or reciprocity.\nKat Cole started helping out early.\nIn medicine, before big exams, givers are so busy helping their friends study that they fail to fill the holes in their own understanding."}
