COLORADO SPRINGS — There’s a lot of foot traffic on North Nevada Avenue in Colorado Springs and often the Prices noticed that some would be walking by in frigid temperatures without hats or gloves.

The Prices bought gloves and hats and attached them to the fence in front of their home for those who are in need.

On the fence, along with gloves and hats, a sign reads, “If you are cold, please take something with our compliments – Happy Winter!”

During the recent cold spell, the Prices put up a second batch of the apparel.
