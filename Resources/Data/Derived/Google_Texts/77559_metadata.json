Stride Health so far has raised more than $15 million.\n\nThe company essentially is an online insurance broker and helps workers find health coverage. And to be clear, consumers \u2014 not the start-ups they work for \u2014 foot the bill for coverage if they decide to enroll. Stride Health doesn't charge consumers to use the service. The company makes money by pocketing a commission from insurance company plans, featured on Stride Health's platform.\n\nStride Health is available in all 50 states. The company's online platform lists more than 230 insurance carriers, including the big five \u2014 UnitedHealth Group, Cigna, Anthem, Humana and Aetna.\n\n\n\n\"We identified a pretty compelling market need in the on-demand economy,\" said Noah Lang, chief executive and co-founder of Stride Health. \"We had independent working Americans gathering on these platforms to build their own self-employed lifestyle, but there was one major gap \u2014 benefits.\"\n\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, which requires Americans to have health insurance or face penalties, many of those who enroll on Stride Health pocket insurance subsidies to lower their plan costs, Lang said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "As the debate grows over worker protections in the gig economy, benefits start-up Stride Health is winning by partnering with Uber and Etsy.", "author": "Kate Rogers", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "As the debate grows over worker protections in the gig economy, benefits start-up Stride Health is winning by partnering with Uber and Etsy.", "title": "Stride Health: The health insurance broker Uber is using", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/09/stride-health-the-health-insurance-broker-uber-is-using.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/09/103373585-dental-hero.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the debate grows over worker protections in the gig economy, benefits start-up Stride Health is winning by partnering with Uber and Etsy.", "title": "Stride Health: The health insurance broker Uber is using", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/09/stride-health-the-health-insurance-broker-uber-is-using.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/02/09/103373585-dental-hero.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@katerogersnews", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Small Business, Small Business, Health Care, Technology, US Economy, Transportation, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-02-09T12:45:55-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Small Business", "modified_time": "2016-02-09T12:45:56-0500", "tag": "Transportation"}, "pageNodeId": 103369499, "news_keywords": "stride health, uber, etsy, benefits startup, benefits health care"}, "article_summary": "Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which requires Americans to have health insurance or face penalties, many of those who enroll on Stride Health pocket insurance subsidies to lower their plan costs, Lang said.\nThe company essentially is an online insurance broker and helps workers find health coverage.\nLaunched in 2013, San Francisco-based Stride Health has secured partnerships with companies including TaskRabbit and Postmates, an on-demand network of couriers.\nStride Health so far has raised more than $15 million.\nThe company makes money by pocketing a commission from insurance company plans, featured on Stride Health's platform."}
