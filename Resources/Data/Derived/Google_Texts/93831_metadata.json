Steve Scalise (R-LA) CREDIT: U.S. House of Representatives\n\nThe Republican Party has come under scrutiny for failing to supplement its endless demands to delay, defund, and repeal the Affordable Care Act with alternative policies to address America\u2019s broken health care system. On Wednesday, the Republican Study Committee (RSC) \u2014 a collection of conservative House GOP members \u2014 aimed to address that criticism by introducing the American Health Care Reform Act.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue fighting to repeal the president\u2019s health care law, it is also important to lay out the reforms we stand behind and support,\u201d said RSC chairman Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) in a press release. \u201cAmerican families and businesses deserve and demand real solutions to the serious problems that exist in our health care system.\u201d Scalese went on to describe the proposals as \u201cfree-market solutions\u201d that would expand health coverage and lower costs.\n\nThe bill has five main propositions: a standard deduction against payroll and income taxes of $7,500 for individuals and $20,000 for families that would be given to Americans who have qualifying insurance plans; government funding for statewide high-risk pools to help those with pre-existing medical conditions get coverage; allowing people to buy insurance across state lines; an expansion of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs); and medical malpractice liability reform.\n\nIf that all of this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Republicans have been proposing some combination of these ideas since at least 2007. President George W. Bush proposed the standard deduction idea during his January 2007 State of the Union address. At the time, the Center for American Progress (CAP) criticized the plan as one that \u201cwould do little to help the uninsured and could replace the employer health insurance system with individual coverage that in most states is inaccessible and unaffordable to many.\u201d\n\nState-run high-risk pools for Americans with a history of costly illnesses were a mainstay of Sen. John McCain\u2019s health care plan when he was running against Barack Obama in 2008. But critics rightly pointed out that these pools are often plagued by waiting periods, premiums that are out of reach for many families, high deductibles and co-pays, and limits on many types of speciality care such as mental health and maternity care services.\n\nMitt Romney regularly endorsed allowing Americans to buy insurance across state lines during the 2012 presidential election that put the health law front and center. But the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that older and sicker people who continue to purchase robust plans within their own states would likely have to pay more money under this scheme. Many critics also predicted that without a minimum standard of offered coverage, insurers would simply engage in a race-to-the-bottom where they move to states that impose the lowest level of benefit requirements.\n\nRomney also included an expansion of HSAs as a major portion of his health care plan. While the RSC\u2019s plan has some differences from Romney\u2019s proposal, it would be subject to the same flaws \u2014 namely, that it\u2019s a great tool for healthy people, but Americans with costly chronic illnesses would quickly deplete their accounts and be left to fend for themselves.\n\nFinally, medical malpractice reform was an idea proposed by Bush, McCain, and Romney \u2014 and also by President Obama during the debate over health reform (it didn\u2019t make it into the ultimate bill). Unfortunately, study after study has shown that this would only reduce health care spending by somewhere between one and three percent.\n\nThe RSC proposal would do very little to address the plight of the uninsured, since it doesn\u2019t set robust benefit standards or provide help unemployed Americans without health coverage. And even aside from that, none of the individual aspects of this supposedly \u201cnew\u201d Obamacare replacement are even new to begin with.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A Republican House committee's proposals for replacing Obamacare are simply a rehash of GOP health care policies dating back to George W.
