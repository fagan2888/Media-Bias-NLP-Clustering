The MinuteClinic is a walk-in medical clinic within CVS pharmacies where customers can see nurse practitioners and physician assistants for minor ailments. (Amanda Voisard/For the Washington Post)\n\nIt was a cold Monday in late March, and at 8:30 a.m. 23-year-old Lindsey Menard was second in line to be seen at the MinuteClinic in a CVS Pharmacy in D.C.\u2019s Tenleytown. \u00b6 \u201cIt was the closest place that was open early,\u201d she said. Her doctor\u2019s office was downtown, and traveling downtown \u201cjust seemed like too much of a hassle when I\u2019m dying,\u201d said Menard, 23, who lives nearby with her parents and teaches with the Metro D.C. Reading Corps. \u00b6 CVS is fast expanding its MinuteClinics, exemplifying a trend of retailers opening health-care services to supplement traditional doctors\u2019 offices. CVS, the largest retail clinic operator in the Washington area, has 800 clinics nationwide, and it expects to add 150 more this year and to have 1,500 clinics by 2017, or almost as many as the more than 1,600 retail clinics across the country now, according to the Convenient Care Association. \u00b6 Retail walk-in clinics are relatively new on the health-care landscape, dating to 2000. After several years of very slow growth coinciding with the recession and its aftermath, they are taking off again. Accenture, a global management consulting firm, predicted last year that the number of walk-in retail clinics would almost double by 2015, to nearly 3,000.\n\nSeveral trends are driving the expansion of health care into retail stores \u2014 including pharmacies, big-box stores and grocery stores \u2014 and some of those trends will be accelerated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOne is the growing deficit in primary care doctors. The shortfall is expected to reach 45,000 by 2020, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. This dearth has been blamed on more doctors choosing higher-paying specialties, too little money for hospital residencies and the aging of the baby boom generation, which now needs more medical care.\n\nThe health-care law will only add to the demand. It is designed to provide insurance for millions of additional customers through Medicaid and subsidized private plans and by allowing individuals up to age 26 to remain covered by their parents\u2019 health insurance. That will make getting in to see a primary care doctor even harder.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a strong driver of retail clinics,\u201d said Ateev Mehrotra, a doctor who is an associate professor at Harvard medical school and a policy analyst at the research organization Rand Corp. \u201cIf your primary care provider says you can have an appointment in three days, and you\u2019re worried about a urinary tract infection or your daughter has an ear infection, the retail clinics are going to benefit from that.\u201d\n\nRetail walk-in clinics treat a variety of non-life-threatening but frequent ill\u00adnesses, including bronchitis, mononucleosis, pink eye and sties, sinus infections and minor injuries. Usually open in the evening and on weekends, they also offer vaccinations for flu, pneumonia, childhood diseases, tetanus and other diseases, physical exams for jobs or team sports and preventive measures such as checking blood sugar.\n\nA study by Mehrotra and colleagues published in 2009 in the Annals of Internal Medicine looked at 700 episodes of each of three common conditions \u2014 inflammation of the middle ear, urinary tract infections and pharyngitis, an infection that causes most sore throats. Using 12 quality-of-care measures, it found that treatment was \u201csimilar for retail clinics, physician offices and urgent care centers, and lower for [emergency rooms].\u201d The costs of care for each episode averaged $110 at retail clinics, $166 at doctors\u2019 offices, $156 at urgent care centers and $570 in emergency departments\n\nMost walk-in clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners or physicians\u2019 assistants, and nearly all take private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid. Costs per visit are in the $79 to $89 range, with additional charges for lab tests. A quick strep throat test, for instance, is $30 at a CVS clinic.\n\nTransparency in pricing is one way in which retail clinics reflect growing trends in health care, said Ceci Connolly, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers Health Research Institute. \u201cThe price is just out there on a giant board\u201d for consumers who want to comparison shop for care the way they shop for other services, she said.\n\nBecause many people are buying insurance with higher deductibles, \u201cthey are looking for those alternatives to hospital or physicians office visits that are going to be more cost-effective and convenient,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nJeff Gitlin, a principal in PwC\u2019s health industries practice, said he foresees walk-in clinics adding to their services \u2014 for instance, offering more lab services that require patients to go without eating before the tests. He said the busiest hours for medical testing are between 7 and 10 a.m., hours when a nearby retail clinic that opens early could be attractive.\n\nPatients once might have hesitated before turning to a retail clinic, but that is fast changing. \u201cFive years from now, you won\u2019t think twice about taking your kid in there for an ear infection,\u201d Gitlin said.\n\nAnd once you\u2019re in the store \u2014 whether it\u2019s Walgreens or CVS, the two biggest pharmacies with clinics, a big-box store such as Target or a grocery story such as Krogers \u2014 you might buy more.\n\n\u201cThe pharmacy business is a cutthroat business,\u201d said Rand\u2019s Mehrotra. \u201cPeople always go to the same pharmacy. These clinics can be a real carrot to shift where you go for care.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is an unabashed fan. The American Academy of Family Physicians has warned that growing use of the clinics might result in a \u201cmissed opportunity to address more complex patient needs.\u201d It noted that \u201cthe overwhelming majority of family physicians offer same-day scheduling\u201d and that many have extended their hours.\n\nIn its talking points on retail clinics, the American Academy of Pediatrics says: \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018minor illness\u2019 when it comes to children. Pediatricians use these \u2018minor illness\u2019 visits to identify other, potentially more serious issues.\u201d\n\nFor their part, retail clinic executives emphasize that they want to be part of a broad health-care landscape, augmenting rather than replacing what doctors call \u201cthe Patient-Centered Medical Home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve evolved the role of the retail clinic to be complementary and supportive,\u201d said Andrew J. Sussman, associate chief medical officer of CVS Caremark and president of the MinuteClinic.\n\nAll of the clinics have collaborating medical doctors who review charts and to whom clinic staff can turn for advice. The clinics also provide patients with a copy of their notes about the visit and send a copy to patients\u2019 doctor, he said. He said that MinuteClinic is now affiliated with 32 health-care providers, including Inova and the Cleveland Clinic, and relies on the most widely used electronic medical records system in the nation to communicate with doctors and other care providers.\n\nSussman also noted that the clinics have been accredited by the Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that accredits more than 20,000 health-care organizations and programs nationally.\n\nThe recent decision by CVS to stop selling cigarettes at its stores says a lot about the prospects for retail clinics. MinuteClinics recently added weight loss and smoking cessation counseling to its services. \u201cSelling tobacco is not consistent with our purpose as a health-care organization,\u201d Sussman said.\n\nThe move cost CVS about $2 billion in sales, but that is less than 2 percent of the company\u2019s 2013 revenue. And cigarette sales were dropping, while revenue growth from the MinuteClinics is climbing, albeit from a smaller base. \u201cFor 2014, we anticipate revenues of approximately $300 million, nearly tripling our total in the past five years,\u201d Sussman told stock analysts in December.\n\nBack at the MinuteClinic in Northwest Washington, the five-minute strep test was already registering positive two minutes after nurse practitioner Katie Skiff swabbed Menard\u2019s throat for bacteria. Skiff prescribed penicillin and recommended drinking tea with honey and lemon, gargling with salt water and listening to her body about staying off her feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you a call in 48 hours,\u201d Skiff said. \u201cWe want to make sure you\u2019re on the mend.\u201d\n\nIn parting advice, she said, \u201cThe biggest thing with strep throat is changing your toothbrush in 24 hours.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "minuteclinic, walgreens, cvs, target, krogers, convenient care, retail care, health care, clinics, primary care physicians, flu, cold, bugs, strep, blood pressure, blood sugar, martha hamilton", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It was a cold Monday in late March, and at 8:30 a.m. 23-year-old Lindsey Menard was second in line to be seen at the MinuteClinic in a CVS Pharmacy in D.C.\u2019s Tenleytown. \u00b6 \u201cIt was the closest place t...", "title": "Why walk-in health care is a fast-growing profit center for retail chains", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-walk-in-health-care-is-a-fast-growing-profit-center-for-retail-chains/2014/04/04/a05f7cf4-b9c2-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/03/24/Others/Images/2014-03-24/DSC_02921395699316.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-walk-in-health-care-is-a-fast-growing-profit-center-for-retail-chains/2014/04/04/a05f7cf4-b9c2-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "minuteclinic, walgreens, cvs, target, krogers, convenient care, retail care, health care, clinics, primary care physicians, flu, cold, bugs, strep, blood pressure, blood sugar, martha hamilton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a05f7cf4-b9c2-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "It was a cold Monday in late March, and at 8:30 a.m. 23-year-old Lindsey Menard was second in line to be seen at the MinuteClinic in a CVS Pharmacy in D.C.\u2019s Tenleytown. \u00b6 \u201cIt was the closest place t..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d1a\"", "article_summary": "Accenture, a global management consulting firm, predicted last year that the number of walk-in retail clinics would almost double by 2015, to nearly 3,000.\n\u00b6 Retail walk-in clinics are relatively new on the health-care landscape, dating to 2000.\nThe MinuteClinic is a walk-in medical clinic within CVS pharmacies where customers can see nurse practitioners and physician assistants for minor ailments.\nTransparency in pricing is one way in which retail clinics reflect growing trends in health care, said Ceci Connolly, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers Health Research Institute.\nPatients once might have hesitated before turning to a retail clinic, but that is fast changing."}
