Florida's Second Congressional District's newly sworn-in representative spent some time in Bay County Friday.

Congresswoman Gwen Graham visited Tyndall Air Force Base for the first time since she was elected to office in November.

The event was closed to the public, but NewsChannel 7 caught up with Graham at her Bay County office Friday afternoon.

She says the military community is one of her top focuses. Graham was also assigned to the House Armed Services Committee this month, which she said was her top choice.

"The men and women who serve our country, active and veterans, are my number priority, to do everything i can to serve them," Graham said. "And so the opportunity today to tour Tyndall and find out about the activity on Tyndall Air Force Base, military and otherwise, it's a little city, was just wonderful."

Graham says Tyndall offered the opportunity for a work day, which she hopes to take advantage of soon.

She's back in Tallahassee tonight, and says she hopes to spend as much time as she can in the Second Congressional District during her term.
