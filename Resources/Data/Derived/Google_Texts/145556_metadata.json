Breast pumps are crucial for working women and other moms who can\u2019t physically breast-feed every few hours: They help babies consume breast milk when their mother is not present, and moms can store the milk produced while at work.\n\nUnder Obamacare, insurers were essentially told they needed to stop gaming health insurance policies to cover only what they perceived as important to their near-term bottom line and to provide sensible coverage based on people\u2019s needs. No longer could they duck expensive cancer treatment costs by dropping patients\u2019 coverage after they were diagnosed, for example. The Affordable Care Act also gave pregnant women the right to insurance for prenatal care, labor, delivery, and postpartum care, among other services, to ensure the health of mother and child.\n\nBut those basics aren\u2019t being met. For example, at least 20 insurance companies in six states are running afoul of a rule to provide breast-feeding support and supplies\u2014without co-payments, deductibles or co-insurance\u2014for the duration of breast-feeding, the study found.\n\nRELATED: Working Moms Are Being Forced to Pump Breast Milk in Dirty Closets and Bathroom\u2014Though It's Illegal\n\nThough the Institute of Medicine recommends breast-feeding, the report found illegal coverage limitations that place limits on when a woman can get a breast pump or how long she can use it.\n\nIn one state, issuers allowed women to rent a pump for one year, and the report says that flies in the face of the federal guidance that says the equipment and support must be covered for the duration of breast-feeding. The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends breast-feeding exclusively for six months and continuing to breast-feed for another year \u201cas mutually desired by mother and infant.\u201d Some families choose to do so for even longer.\n\nHave a different problem with your health insurance?
