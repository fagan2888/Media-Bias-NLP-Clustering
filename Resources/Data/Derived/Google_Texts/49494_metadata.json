The red tape of gaining access to health care can seem like a daunting task for many people. Not only are wait times long, but the amount of face-to-face time that a person gets with a doctor often averages less than 20 minutes. Technology experts and physicans around the country are trying to implement a better way to manage their time and health care costs for patient visits.\n\nEarlier this month, celebrity doctor and emergency physician, Dr. Travis Stork, announced that he was going to be a partner at MDLIVE, which is an interactive and web-based doctor\u2019s office. The idea of a virtual physician could potentially change the face of medicine completely \u2014 for the better, Dr. Stork believes.\n\nMDLIVE is a cloud-based virtual office, which allows members to gain access to board-certified physicians anytime, day or night, for 365 days a year. According to a service representative for the website, the service is only available for individuals whose employers are subscribed to it, and as of now individual plans are not offered. Similar to regular health insurance, the employer pays a portion of the cost and then the rest is picked up by the employee.\n\nIn a phone interview with Medical Daily, Randy Parker, the CEO of MDLIVE, and Dr. Stork discussed how telemedicine and telehealth will enhance the way that medicine is practiced.\n\n\u201cOur service allows customers to get access to the provider [board-certified physician] whenever they need it so that the doctors can assess whether telehealth is appropriate or not,\u201d Dr. Stork said. \"If not, they will refer the patient to an actual physician.\"\n\nThere is some apprehension as to how reliable and successful a virtual doctor\u2019s office could be. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to replace the hands-on physician visit. It\u2019s not going to replace the emergency department\u2026 It\u2019s going to offer another avenue of access to affordable quality care,\u201d said Dr. Stork.\n\nParker said that his objective is to make affordable health care easier to access. \"The goal is to make this the gold-standard \u2014 truly quality care and treating what is appropriate,\u201d he said.\n\nA person is able to connect 24/7 via telephone, video conference, or e-mail to the correct physician. Primary care doctors, emergency physicians, pediatricians, and therapist are available. They treat common conditions like acne, allergies, cold and flu, sore throat, urinary tract infections, rashes, and many other minor issues.\n\nEach year, there are approximately 129.8 million visits to the emergency room, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and only 13.3 percent of those visits require hospital admission and 25.1 percent of those patients are seen for fewer than 15 minutes (which could still cost thousands of dollars).\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things for me is making sure that the patients get the best quality of care that they can in the right arena, [MDLIVE's] not going to replace the hands-on physician visit,\u201d said Dr. Stork.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act and all of the legislation soon to be implemented under the new health care laws, access and affordability are concerns for many Americans, employers, and employees. Currently, 70 percent of doctors believe that long wait times will plague emergency rooms. A full 83 percent of physicians foresee increased wait times for primary care appointments, according to a report by Forbes. With a website like MDLIVE, however, the wait lines would be shorter, and conditions or injuries that actually warrant an in-person physician visit could be better managed.\n\n\u201c[MDLIVE] is focusing its efforts on being effective with the lowest cost of quality care,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe have always believed that medicine is local, and our model is to partner with as many major health systems across the county.\"\n\nMDLIVE is currently connected with 10 health systems, including Sentara Health System in North Carolina and Trinity Health System in Michigan.\n\nFounded in 2006, the company currently has two million members with over 2,000 practitioners in 49 states.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mdlive, dr stork, virtual doctors office, telehealth", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Celebrity physician, Dr. Travis Stork, joins an interactive telehealth clinic called MDLIVE.", "title": "Dr. Travis Stork Joins MDLIVE \u2014 A Virtual Physician's Office [EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/travis-stork-celebrity-doctor-joins-mdlive-virtual-physicians-office-exclusive-interview-260059", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/16/dr-travis-stork_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Celebrity physician, Dr. Travis Stork, joins an interactive telehealth clinic called MDLIVE.", "title": "Dr. Travis Stork Joins MDLIVE \u2014 A Virtual Physician's Office [EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/travis-stork-celebrity-doctor-joins-mdlive-virtual-physicians-office-exclusive-interview-260059", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/16/dr-travis-stork_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/16/dr-travis-stork_1.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-10-16T15:01:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-17T11:47:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Celebrity physician, Dr. Travis Stork, joins an interactive telehealth clinic called MDLIVE."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4cc\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this month, celebrity doctor and emergency physician, Dr. Travis Stork, announced that he was going to be a partner at MDLIVE, which is an interactive and web-based doctor\u2019s office.\nThe idea of a virtual physician could potentially change the face of medicine completely \u2014 for the better, Dr. Stork believes.\nPrimary care doctors, emergency physicians, pediatricians, and therapist are available.\nIn a phone interview with Medical Daily, Randy Parker, the CEO of MDLIVE, and Dr. Stork discussed how telemedicine and telehealth will enhance the way that medicine is practiced.\nTechnology experts and physicans around the country are trying to implement a better way to manage their time and health care costs for patient visits."}
