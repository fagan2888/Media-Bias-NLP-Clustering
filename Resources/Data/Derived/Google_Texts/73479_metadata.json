Instead, he said, he likes that posting class lists gets students excited about the school year.\n\n\"It gives kids a feel for their classroom and gets them in the mindset for coming back to school,\" he said.\n\nOn the other side, Sean Corey, principal at Frederick's Legacy Elementary, said he's never been comfortable posting student names so publicly.\n\nYears ago, he said, he mailed letters home with teacher assignments. Now, he provides the teacher assignments directly to parents through the private Infinite Campus system \u2014 and then watches \"the social media frenzy.\"\n\nHe said parents and older students post on Facebook, text and call to share information, so there's still a sense of community.\n\nThe difference, he said, is \"they're sharing it on their own terms.\"\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28643846/class-list-posting-ritual-disappears-boulder-valley-over", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28643846:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-15T10:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The ritual of students and families crowding around the front doors of the elementary school to see the class lists before school starts is on its way out in the Boulder Valley School District.", "title": "Class-list posting ritual disappears in Boulder Valley over privacy concerns", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28643846/class-list-posting-ritual-disappears-boulder-valley-over", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0814/20150814__16dcaposw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "modificationDate": "2015-08-14T18:38:19-0600", "endDate": "2025-08-15T10:00:00-0600", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-08-14T18:32:13-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-15T10:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Class-list posting ritual disappears in Boulder Valley over privacy concerns", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0814/20150814__16dcaposw~2_300.jpg", "description": "The ritual of students and families crowding around the front doors of the elementary school to see the class lists before school starts is on its way out in the Boulder Valley School District.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28643846/class-list-posting-ritual-disappears-boulder-valley-over", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The ritual of students and families crowding around the front doors of the elementary school to see the class lists before school starts is on its way out in the Boulder Valley School District.", "title": "Class-list posting ritual disappears in Boulder Valley over privacy concerns"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0814/20150814__16dcaposw~2.jpg"}, "article_summary": "School starts this week for students in the Boulder Valley and St. Vrain Valley school districts, among others.\nIn the neighboring St. Vrain Valley School District, most principals posted class lists outside their schools Friday afternoon.\n\"We've emailed the teacher assignments for the last few years.\"\nInstead, he said, he likes that posting class lists gets students excited about the school year.\nTradition continuing at most St. Vrain Valley schoolsThe ritual of students and families crowding around the front doors of the elementary school to see the class lists before school starts is on its way out in the Boulder Valley School District."}
