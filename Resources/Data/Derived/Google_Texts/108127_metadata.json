Here are three quotes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a gifted politician that is appealing to people\u2019s anger and frustration that is quite legitimate\u2026 I think that people are going to see that Donald Trump is not a serious candidate, that his message of division is not what we need.

Jeb Bush on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cHe will say whatever he wants to say,\u201d said Democratic candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same program. \u201cI think that, you know, there\u2019s a certain attractiveness to people that here\u2019s a guy who says exactly what he believes, untrue as it may be, inflammatory as it certainly is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, more than any other time, we need to have\u2013 we need to have America united. And we need to have an American president who is going to unite us and not divide us,\u201d said GOP candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI believe that Donald Trump will not be the nominee.
