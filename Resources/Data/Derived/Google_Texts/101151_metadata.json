It boosts the production of immune system cells and helps to ward off infection in patients receiving strong chemotherapy .\n\n\"Biosimilars are likely to create greater competition in the medical marketplace,\" FDA's Leah Christl said in a statement.\n\nThat means cheaper prices. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts says Neupogen cost, on average, $3,500 a month. The new biosimilar should cost at least 30 percent less, it says.\n\n\"We have forecasted that this particular biosimilar will save the U.S. healthcare system $5.7 billion over the next decade,\" Express Scripts said in a statement.\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act directs FDA to quickly approve certain biosimilars.\n\nIt's not necessarily easy to make a biosimilar. \"Biologics are different from conventional medications. Conventional medications\u2014drugs\u2014are generally made from chemicals, or chemically synthesized, and therefore their structure can be relatively easily defined,\" Christl said.\n\n\"A biosimilar is not an exact duplicate of another biologic; rather, a biosimilar is highly similar to the reference product.\"\n\nNonetheless, more are coming. Consulting firm Avalere Health says the FDA has received four other applications from companies making biosimilars and expects to get 10 this year.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Drug Protects Ovaries During Chemo, Study Demonstrates 2:01 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nIN-DEPTH:\n\n-- Maggie Fox", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FDA has approved the first so-called biosimilar - that's a generic version of a biologic as opposed to a chemically synthesized drug.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "The FDA has approved the first so-called biosimilar - that's a generic version of a biologic as opposed to a chemically synthesized drug.", "title": "FDA Okays First Type of a New Generic", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-okays-first-type-new-generic-n318681", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_48/781001/141124-fda-building-arp-1105a_5322c0e7299f7246b8ad60fe2027f979.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "The FDA has approved the first so-called biosimilar - that's a generic version of a biologic as opposed to a chemically synthesized drug.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_48/781001/141124-fda-building-arp-1105a_5322c0e7299f7246b8ad60fe2027f979.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "FDA Okays First Type of a New Generic - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-06", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-okays-first-type-new-generic-n318681", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health news,Business News"}, "article_summary": "The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first so-called biosimilar \u2014 that's a generic version of a biologic as opposed to a chemically synthesized drug.\nPharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts says Neupogen cost, on average, $3,500 a month.\nConsulting firm Avalere Health says the FDA has received four other applications from companies making biosimilars and expects to get 10 this year.\n\"We have forecasted that this particular biosimilar will save the U.S. healthcare system $5.7 billion over the next decade,\" Express Scripts said in a statement.\nIt's a near-copy of Neupogen, a lab-made version of a natural protein called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor."}
