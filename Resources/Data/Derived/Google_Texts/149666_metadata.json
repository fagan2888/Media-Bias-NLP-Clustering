Dick Durbin said in an interview with POLITICO on Wednesday. \u201cBut if he comes up with an agreement and it meets his standards, he wanted us to take an honest look at it and not prejudge.\u201d\n\nOver drinks and hors d\u2019oeuvres in the State Dining Room, Obama also discussed a range of Democratic priorities with his Senate colleagues, including an upcoming fight over spending bills, climate change and the latest court victory for Obamacare, according to senators who attended. The invitation came just weeks after a hard-fought legislative battle over trade policy that frayed relations between the president and his congressional allies.\n\nObama spoke at length about Iran, senators said. This wasn\u2019t the first time Obama has said the odds are against a deal, but his remarks reflect the White House\u2019s message to both the Iranians and domestic opponents that U.S. negotiators would sooner walk away than back away from Obama\u2019s core goals.\n\nOn their own, Democrats in the Senate can shield an eventual pact from actions by congressional opponents, and the president urged his party to ignore naysayers.\n\n\u201cHe took us back to what the framework was when the initial agreement was announced in Lausanne,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Tuesday night as he prepared to board a bus parked in front of the White House\u2019s Northwest Gate with other senators headed back to the Capitol. \u201cHe said, \u2018Don\u2019t get nervous, don\u2019t get concerned about statements by the supreme leader, about statements in the press. I am not going to sign a deal where we can\u2019t assure that we\u2019ve blocked all pathways to a bomb for Iran.\u2019 I found that very reassuring.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama \u201ccovered every hot topic there was,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), when it came to Iran, \u201che wanted to make it clear to us that if it\u2019s a bad deal, there\u2019s no deal.\u201d\n\nObama on Wednesday discussed Iran during a video conference with his national security team, Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, and the U.S. negotiating team in Vienna, according to a White House readout.\n\nThe Obama administration, especially Kerry, has worked in recent days to dismiss suggestions that desperation will prompt the president to sign a deal \u2014 any deal \u2014 for the sake of a legacy. Officials shrugged off a July 7 deadline and are now downplaying the significance of July 9, even though that date has concrete consequences: Congress will have 60 days instead of just 30 to consider the pact if it doesn\u2019t receive it by midnight Thursday.\n\nBut Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said the president seemed \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned about the implications of giving Congress more time to scrutinize the deal in a meeting that Cardin characterized as \u201csomewhat social, somewhat businesslike.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He tells senators that he won\u2019t accept a bad nuclear deal with Iran.", "title": "Obama puts odds of Iran deal at 'less than 50-50'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/obama-said-to-put-odds-of-an-iran-deal-at-less-than-50-50-119848.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/08/150708_barack_obama_irane3_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Congress,John Kerry,Democrats,Iran,Secretary Of State,Iran Deal,State Department,Defense,Iran Nuclear Program", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He tells senators that he won\u2019t accept a bad nuclear deal with Iran.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Obama puts odds of Iran deal at 'less than 50-50' The president told senators at a gathering Tuesday that he won\u2019t accept a bad nuclear deal with Iran.\nObama spoke at length about Iran, senators said.\nPresident Barack Obama pegged the chances of a nuclear agreement with Iran at \u201cless than 50-50,\u201d even as he worked to reassure Senate Democrats that he won\u2019t accept a bad deal, according to a U.S. senator who attended a gathering at the White House.\nThe Obama administration, especially Kerry, has worked in recent days to dismiss suggestions that desperation will prompt the president to sign a deal \u2014 any deal \u2014 for the sake of a legacy.\n\u201cHe took us back to what the framework was when the initial agreement was announced in Lausanne,\u201d Sen.
