Ellis of Duke University Medical Center, who is optimistic the new policy will help. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to apply commonsense principles to address those issues.\u201d\n\nThe long-awaited changes from the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, come as the gap between who needs a new kidney and who gets one widens. Nearly 102,000 people are on the national waiting list for a kidney, while fewer than 17,000 transplants are performed each year.\n\nRoughly 11,000 transplants are thanks to kidneys donated from someone who just died rather than living donors. How long you\u2019ve been waiting is the main factor in deciding who gets the next available cadaver kidney.\n\nBut starting Thursday, the fittest of those kidneys \u2014 based on donor age and medical history \u2014 will be offered first to patients who are expected to survive a transplant the longest.\n\nCalled longevity matching, the hope is that these typically younger adults won\u2019t outlive their new organ and need another that could have gone to someone else.\n\nNearly 15 percent of transplant candidates are awaiting a repeat operation, and \u201cthe potential here is that we will reduce return to the waiting list,\u201d said Dr. Richard N. Formica of Yale University, who chairs UNOS\u2019 kidney transplant committee.\n\nAnother big change: People who started dialysis before getting in line for a transplant will be credited for that dialysis time, moving them up on the waiting list.\n\nThe less time spent on dialysis, the better the prognosis after a transplant. Yet how quickly people are put on the transplant list varies around the country, and minorities and people who live in rural and poorer areas tend to spend more time on dialysis.\n\nMichael Brown, 31, of Cleveland has undergone dialysis since he was 20 because of an inherited disorder. But he wasn\u2019t put on the transplant list until three years ago, when he saw a new doctor who told him, \u201cYou need to be active, and you shouldn\u2019t be tied to a machine.\u201d\n\nBrown said he hadn\u2019t pushed to be listed sooner partly because of fear, and partly because no one had fully explained the benefits of an earlier transplant. He got in shape for a transplant, and was excited to learn he\u2019ll get credit for those years on dialysis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Changes coming to kidney transplant waiting list", "title": "Changes coming to kidney transplant waiting list", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Changes coming to kidney transplant waiting list", "title": "Changes coming to kidney transplant waiting list", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/02/changes_coming_to_kidney_transplant_waiting_list/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/kidney-transplants.jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Changes coming to kidney transplant waiting list", "title": "Changes coming to kidney transplant waiting list", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/kidney-transplants.jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lauran Neergaard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dc7\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 102,000 people are on the national waiting list for a kidney, while fewer than 17,000 transplants are performed each year.\nNearly 15 percent of transplant candidates are awaiting a repeat operation, and \u201cthe potential here is that we will reduce return to the waiting list,\u201d said Dr. Richard N.
