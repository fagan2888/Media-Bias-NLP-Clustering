Steve Beshear \u2014 a principal with the nonprofit \u2014 said Kynect and Medicaid expansion had a big impact.\n\n\u201cThe successful rollout was largely due to thorough coordination by officials throughout the state, and a comprehensive effort to ensure that all aspects of Kynect and the expansion were ready to launch on day one,\u201d he said.\n\nKentucky\u2019s uninsured rate has experienced one of the sharpest declines in the country. In 2013, the uninsured rate was 16 percent in the state; in 2014 it was 8 percent, according to KFF.\n\nEnrollment in Medicaid grew by 94 percent between July 2013 and December 2015, according to the foundation. And about 94,000 people are enrolled in a qualified health plan through Kynect, according to the report.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s analysis also examined the ACA implementation\u2019s economic impact on the state. It found a net positive fiscal impact from Medicaid expansion of $919.1 million from 2014 to 2021 compared with what the state would have spent had it not expanded the service.\n\nThe state\u2019s health care system and overall economy gained $1.16 billion due to new federal payments to health care providers for Medicaid expansion enrollees in 2014, according to the analysis.\n\nThe foundation also looked at the future of ACA in Kentucky under Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\nKentucky Public Radio previously reported that Bevin plans to dismantle Kynect and transfer users to the federally run healthcare.gov exchange. He also has plans to apply for 1115 and 1332 waivers to customize the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program.\n\nJessica Ditto, spokeswoman for Bevin, said in an email that Kentucky\u2019s current health care system is unsustainable. She said the state is spending nearly $4 billion on Medicaid this biennium, and that is expected to grow by $380 billion in the current budget.\n\n\u201cWe are working to transform our health care system into one that is sustainable, encourages personal responsibility and provides quality affordable health services for Kentuckians,\u201d she said.\n\nIn February, Bevin\u2019s administration launched Benefind, a new website for Kentuckians to enroll in Medicaid, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. But there have been numerous problems with the rollout of Benefind.\n\nThe analysis from Kaiser said timely and effective data transfers between Benefind and healthcare.gov would be key for providing a seamless enrollment experience and preventing delays in eligibility determinations and gaps in coverage.\n\nThe report also says these changes could affect whether insurers participate in the market.\n\nDitto said the administration\u2019s focus is on growing jobs and the economic opportunity so that more people enroll in private insurance.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government", "description": "A recent report by Kaiser Family Foundation says Kentucky has one of the most successful implementations of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. The report", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wkms.org/post/report-kentucky-health-care-expansion-among-most-successful", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wkms/files/styles/medium/public/201411/health_care_doctor_laptop.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A recent report by Kaiser Family Foundation says Kentucky has one of the most successful implementations of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. The report", "title": "Report: Kentucky Health Care Expansion Among Most Successful"}, "story_id": 475576735, "twitter": {"site": "@wkms", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wkms"}, "author": "Ja'Nel Johnson", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Report: Kentucky Health Care Expansion Among Most Successful"}, "nid": 61583, "datePublished": "2016-04-25", "keywords": "KYnect, benefind, Kentucky Medicaid", "wordCount": 898, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The state\u2019s health care system and overall economy gained $1.16 billion due to new federal payments to health care providers for Medicaid expansion enrollees in 2014, according to the analysis.\n\u201cWe are working to transform our health care system into one that is sustainable, encourages personal responsibility and provides quality affordable health services for Kentuckians,\u201d she said.\nJessica Ditto, spokeswoman for Bevin, said in an email that Kentucky\u2019s current health care system is unsustainable.\nHe also has plans to apply for 1115 and 1332 waivers to customize the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program.\nAnd about 94,000 people are enrolled in a qualified health plan through Kynect, according to the report."}
