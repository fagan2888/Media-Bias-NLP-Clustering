But as the companies operate now, it\u2019s up to users of the sites to take their word for it.\n\nDraftKings CEO Jason Robins said Wednesday the company is committed to creating an open and transparent environment.\n\n\u201cWe have great records of when data is pulled, when communications were sent,\u201d he said in an interview on Fox Business. There was no wrongdoing, he said.\n\nAs for regulation, \u201cwe\u2019re open to that,\u201d Robins said on ESPN\u2019s \u201cOutside the Lines\u201d show, signaling a change of course for the company.\n\nDraftKings hasn\u2019t responded to questions from The Associated Press about the degree of access employees have to internal information and when they can access it.\n\nWhile legal in most U.S. states, daily fantasy sports is unregulated, unlike casinos and lotteries. Participants put together virtual teams based on real players and compete for points based on the players\u2019 statistics. The incident has been likened to insider trading. The internal data, describing how often players are selected by all players in the salary-cap style game, could be used strategically to build a lineup of players with a lot of potential who aren\u2019t popular selections among opponents.\n\nIf the companies were licensed casinos in Las Vegas, rules would govern who has access to what and when - it\u2019s likely a team of badge-wearing law-enforcement investigators would already be looking into the situation. Violating the rules would put valuable licenses to do business - both for high-ranking employees and the companies themselves - at risk.\n\nDepending on the crime, employees could be prosecuted or added to the state\u2019s black book, formerly a home to mobsters and unsavory characters and more recently a yearbook for cheats and scammers banned from Nevada casinos for life.\n\n\u201cWhen companies get licensed, the very fact that these things could occur act as a deterrent to this type of activity,\u201d said Nevada Gaming Control Board chief A.G. Burnett.\n\nRegulators approve house rules, negotiate disputes between players and the casinos and require reserves that can pay off any unpaid wagers and future bets. State agents can show up whenever they want, unannounced, and audits are routine.\n\n\u201cYou can certainly debate how much regulation is important for just about anything. But I don\u2019t think you can debate the proposition that daily fantasy sports betting needs to be regulated,\u201d said Joe Asher, chief executive of the U.S. operations for sports betting company William Hill. \u201cWhat you have going on is unregulated Internet gambling.\u201d\n\nThe operator of another, smaller, daily fantasy site called for outside oversight, too.\n\nAmaya, which operates StarsDraft.com and is a licensed gambling operator for online poker said the recent incidents \u201cdemonstrate that the current self-regulatory practices have fallen short and that we need stricter state regulation.\u201d It said the company would lobby states to require regulations akin to those the gambling regulators set, including rules it already follows for its daily fantasy site.\n\nOthers say self-regulation would ultimately suffice if the industry proves to customers that the sites are fair, including stepping up internal controls.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a good thing going and they need to build these businesses,\u201d said Warren Packard, a venture capitalist and CEO of startup Thuuz Sports, which tracks particularly exciting moments in sports matches to play back highlights. \u201cThey need to be squeaky clean.\u201d\n\nBoth daily fantasy sports companies had hired outside law firms and former prosecutors to investigate the allegations raised and review their internal controls.\n\nNew York\u2019s attorney general sent letters to DraftKings and FanDuel Tuesday demanding they turn over details of any investigations into their employees.\n\nFanDuel said it is also creating an advisory board led by Michael Garcia, a lawyer who led the investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bid process then resigned from the FIFA ethics committee in protest over the handling of his findings.\n\n\u201cThere absolutely needs to be much stricter regulations from outside governing bodies. Otherwise the players are at the mercy of the sites which is not a good scenario,\u201d said David Paredes, a professional poker player who said he lost at least $180,000 to an unregulated poker site several years ago.\n\nIn 2007, he and friend Mike Fosco started to see something amiss when playing online poker on sites Absolute Poker and Ultimate Bet. They crunched the numbers and realized that some of the wins that were occurring were an extreme statistical anomaly, eventually helping prove there was a robot program looking at the other players\u2019 critical hole cards, the ones kept secret to bet and bluff.\n\n\u201cWe should have never had to figure it out in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should have been up to the regulators.\u201d\n\nThe sites reported only to a Canadian tribal gambling commission even though the owner of the sites was a former tribal chairman.\n\nPeredes, a professional poker player, said he\u2019s a fan of the daily fantasy sites, but hasn\u2019t played, and less likely to join given the lack of oversight.\n\nBut if there\u2019s money to be made, \u201csometimes you have to take that risk as a gambler,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that a former tribal chairman owned the unregulated poker sites, not the tribal gambling commission.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As daily fantasy sports operators FanDuel and DraftKings hustle to prove they can be trusted by thousands of users each week, cheating allegations have served as a backdrop for lingering questions about an industry that has been unregulated.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As daily fantasy sports operators FanDuel and DraftKings hustle to prove they can be trusted by thousands of users each week, cheating allegations have served as a backdrop for lingering questions about an industry that has been unregulated.", "title": "DraftKings open to regulation as it works to regain trust", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/7/fanduel-bans-employees-from-all-daily-fantasy-play/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/07/ec7bd79c106f1b2d840f6a706700972f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/07/ec7bd79c106f1b2d840f6a706700972f.jpg", "description": "As daily fantasy sports operators FanDuel and DraftKings hustle to prove they can be trusted by thousands of users each week, cheating allegations have served as a backdrop for lingering questions abo", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "DraftKings open to regulation as it works to regain trust"}, "Author": "KIMBERLY PIERCEALL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f69\"", "article_summary": "\u2013This story has been corrected to reflect that a former tribal chairman owned the unregulated poker sites, not the tribal gambling commission.\nWhile legal in most U.S. states, daily fantasy sports is unregulated, unlike casinos and lotteries.\n\u201cWhat you have going on is unregulated Internet gambling.\u201dThe operator of another, smaller, daily fantasy site called for outside oversight, too.\nPeredes, a professional poker player, said he\u2019s a fan of the daily fantasy sites, but hasn\u2019t played, and less likely to join given the lack of oversight.\nAs for regulation, \u201cwe\u2019re open to that,\u201d Robins said on ESPN\u2019s \u201cOutside the Lines\u201d show, signaling a change of course for the company."}
