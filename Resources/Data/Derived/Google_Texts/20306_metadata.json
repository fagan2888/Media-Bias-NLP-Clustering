In a closed-door meeting, the Planning and Zoning Commission voted 7-1 against bringing a propane facility to town.\n\nClinton Residents Still Do Not Want Propane Distribution Facility\n\nHundreds turned out to try and stop a business from moving into the old Stanley Bostitch plant in Clinton. The developer wants to turn an old factory into a propane storage facility. Residents say their safety is in jeopardy.
