He wore red while playing for the Thomasville (Ga.) High Bulldogs, red while quarterbacking and helping coach the Georgia Bulldogs, and even red in his single season as a young assistant with the Jacksonville (Ala.) State Gamecocks.\n\nGAMETRACKER: Colorado State vs. Savannah State football\n\nSo just when he starts to get used to the Rams\u2019 green and gold, when his family, including his wife and five children, have rounded up appropriately hued wardrobes, what does CSU do for his first game as a head coach?\n\nIt\u2019s Orange Out Saturday at Hughes Stadium.\n\nWhen the Rams open the Bobo era against the Savannah State Tigers, they\u2019ll be wearing orange jerseys, albeit with green trim, on the annual Ag Day. The color honors CSU\u2019s Aggie roots, including as the Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts.\n\nThe \u201cA\u201d on the hill above Hughes Stadium salutes that tradition too as the Rams head into the first of their two scheduled remaining seasons in the off-campus facility.\n\nWin No. 1 for Bobo \u2014 and it would be a shock if that didn\u2019t occur Saturday, given that Savannah State is an FCS program mired in a 23-game losing streak \u2014 will be win No. 500 for the CSU program. His parents, George and Barbara Bobo, also will be in attendance, as well as many other family members.\n\n\u201cThey got the memo about the Orange Out,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cA lot of them are Georgia fans. My uncle graduated from Georgia. They\u2019ve been supporting Georgia since 1993, when I went there. My family\u2019s always been involved supporting me, as a player and a coach. At Georgia, we never wore orange. I don\u2019t own orange, anything orange \u2026 until somebody gave me one of those (\u2018Bobo Knows\u2019) shirts those kids are trying to sell the other day.\n\n\u201cClemson wore orange, Auburn wore orange, Florida wore orange. But I\u2019m getting used to it. I do have a green hat with an orange A on it.\u201d He noted that Lainie, his wife, \u201chad to spend some money on the children to buy them some orange stuff.\u201d\n\nBobo, 41, is in the unique position of being a complete outsider taking over a program that didn\u2019t get its previous coach fired or otherwise nudged out the door. In the wake of 10-3 season in 2014 that preceded Jim McElwain\u2019s departure to Florida, he has been open that not facing a major rebuilding project was one of the attractions of the CSU job. He accepted the job without ever seeing Fort Collins.\n\nBut that success also raises the bar \u2014 and lowers patience. CSU\u2019s 2014 season and anticipation of the move to the new stadium has created momentum, and the season ticket count at midweek was 8,812, up from the final total of 6,710 last year.\n\n\u201cI think you have to embrace the expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you want to be at a place that has those types of expectations, to compete at a high level, week in and week out and be in that championship race at the end of the season. I wouldn\u2019t be here and a lot of these players feel the same way. They want to be the expectations are high and you\u2019re expected to play well every week and compete at a high level and hopefully win every game.\u201d\n\nBobo, the former Georgia quarterback, will call the Rams\u2019 plays and work with sophomore Nick Stevens, who won the battle with freshman Coleman Key to open the season.\n\n\u201cI just have to remember that I\u2019ve been preparing for this for a long time now,\u201d Stevens said. He said that included his previous two seasons at CSU, one as a redshirt and one as Garrett Grayson\u2019s backup. \u201cBut specifically in this offense for six months now. I have to trust in my teammates and know we\u2019re going to make plays and the defense is going to make plays and we\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d\n\nThree key questions for the Savannah State-CSU game Saturday in Fort Collins:\n\n1. How merciful will first-time head coach Mike Bobo be in the CSU opener?\n\nForget that on-any-given Saturday stuff. Savannah State isn\u2019t just an FCS program, it\u2019s one that has lost 23 consecutive games. Last year the Tigers lost their season opener 64-0 at Brigham Young.\n\n2. How fast will the Rams\u2019 no-huddle approach be?\n\nIt isn\u2019t quite Oregon fast, but Bobo \u2014 who calls the plays \u2014 wants the opponent to become exhausted.\n\n3. Will first-year starting QB Nick Stevens be able to get the ball to All-America wide receiver Rashard \u201cHollywood\u201d Higgins?\n\nFar more significant tests of that will come in later games, of course, but we\u2019ll start to have hints of this Saturday.\n\nTerry Frei: TFrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike Bobo ready to make his CSU coaching debut dressed in orange", "title": "Mike Bobo ready to make his CSU coaching debut dressed in orange", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/04/mike-bobo-ready-to-make-his-csu-coaching-debut-dressed-in-orange/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150831_020328_mike-bobo.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150831_020328_mike-bobo.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-04T16:30:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T19:49:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cClemson wore orange, Auburn wore orange, Florida wore orange.\nSavannah State isn\u2019t just an FCS program, it\u2019s one that has lost 23 consecutive games.\nWhen the Rams open the Bobo era against the Savannah State Tigers, they\u2019ll be wearing orange jerseys, albeit with green trim, on the annual Ag Day.\nAt Georgia, we never wore orange.\nI don\u2019t own orange, anything orange \u2026 until somebody gave me one of those (\u2018Bobo Knows\u2019) shirts those kids are trying to sell the other day."}
