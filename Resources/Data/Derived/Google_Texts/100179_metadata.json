There are two levels of weirdness here, although I don\u2019t think either has to do with the basic concept. A mom lamenting that her little boy\u2019s all grown up is easy enough to relate to and the \u201cstalking\u201d scenarios are so over-the-top that they\u2019re more corny than creepy. What\u2019s weird is the execution. What\u2019s with the bad singing? The production sounds like a Meat Loaf B-side except that the vocals in places are strikingly amateurish. I assume that was to lend verisimilitude, i.e. that an average mom wouldn\u2019t sing so great, but I don\u2019t know why Old Spice would care about that in a hallucinatory spot like this. Also, what\u2019s with the camera tricks? The one at the end, of the mom sliding across the floor in stop-motion, is especially odd and gratuitous. Either this is a parody of something and I\u2019m not getting the cultural reference or Old Spice decided to go balls-out freaky on it purely in the name of getting attention. Not sure how that\u2019s going to move units for a brand that everyone already knows, but okay.\n\nThe other weirdness is the target audience. I think Dan Riehl\u2019s right that this is, ostensibly, aimed at teen boys to convince them that Old Spice will get them as much action as Axe will. But that\u2019s not how it translates. To my eye, it looks like moms are the audience. Right? The kids are an afterthought; the attractive girlfriend character, which usually drives ads aimed at adolescent boys, goes all but completely unnoticed. Hard for me to believe you\u2019ll convince teens they\u2019re going to get laid by playing up, however jokingly, the psychic toll that doing so will inflict on mom. The look of the ad is oddly timeless, too. There\u2019s really nothing here to suggest we\u2019re in 2014 instead of, say, 1985; the hairstyles and clothes in the high-school cafeteria seem outdated. That detail would be lost on an 18-year-old but a fortysomething mom might recognize it from her own youth. Why do that if you\u2019re pitching this at kids? Maybe the ad is pitched at moms \u2014 specifically, moms who do the grocery-shopping for their families and are responsible for picking up deodorant/body spray for junior at the supermarket. Here\u2019s what you get your pride and joy if you want to make him popular with the ladies. Which is \u2026 yeah, pretty creepy.\n\nAnyway, I know, I know \u2014 any publicity is good publicity.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Mama\u2019s boys.", "title": "I guess we need to talk about the new \u201cOld Spice\u201d commercial", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/06/i-guess-we-need-to-talk-about-the-new-old-spice-commercial/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-06T21:41:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-06T20:40:27+00:00"}, "keywords": "axe, commercial, mom, old spice, stalk,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd171e\"", "article_summary": "I guess we need to talk about the new \u201cOld Spice\u201d commercialposted at 4:41 pm on January 6, 2014 by AllahpunditEd beat me to the punch in the Greenroom but this needs a bit more palate-cleansing attention.\nthat an average mom wouldn\u2019t sing so great, but I don\u2019t know why Old Spice would care about that in a hallucinatory spot like this.\nEither this is a parody of something and I\u2019m not getting the cultural reference or Old Spice decided to go balls-out freaky on it purely in the name of getting attention.\nI think Dan Riehl\u2019s right that this is, ostensibly, aimed at teen boys to convince them that Old Spice will get them as much action as Axe will.\nAnyway, I know, I know \u2014 any publicity is good publicity."}
