That\u2019s the actor and former wrestler\u2019s message to people suffering from mental illness, speaking during a video segment of Oprah\u2019s Master Class.\n\nIn the video, 43-year-old Johnson describes his own experience battling the darkness in his 20s. After graduating from the University of Miami, Johnson was cut from the Calgary Stampedes, a Canadian Football League team and was passed over by the NFL. At 23, he moved back in with his parents and fell into depression \u2014 which he wasn\u2019t able to overcome until he decided to quit football and try something new: get into the wrestling business.\n\n\u201cYou just feel like you\u2019re alone,\u201d Johnson said in the video. \u201cYou feel like it\u2019s only you. You\u2019re in your bubble.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat comforting to see the huge, strong man who \u201cain\u2019t got time to bleed\u201d open up about emotional pain and mental illness \u2014 helping to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. Stereotypes often paint depressed people as weak, pathetic, or useless, but Johnson shows that\u2019s certainly not the case \u2014 and it\u2019s important to reach out for help, even though that might be especially difficult for alpha males like him.\n\nThe Rock offers some words of advice to others out there suffering from depression, noting that the most important thing is to \u201chold onto that fundamental quality of faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found that, with depression, one of the most important things you could realize is that you\u2019re not alone,\u201d Johnson said in the video. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first to go through it; you\u2019re not going to be the last to go through it. \u2026 I wish I had someone at that time who could just pull me aside and [say], \u2018Hey, it\u2019s gonna be OK. It\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nHe reminds people to \u201chave faith that on the other side of your pain is something good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dwayne, rock, johnson, talks, about, battling, depression, speak, if, youre, struggling", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson describes his battle with depression, reminding people it\u2019s important to reach out for help.", "title": "The Rock's Touching Message About Overcoming Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dwayne-rock-johnson-talks-about-battling-depression-speak-if-youre-struggling-362404", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/11/20/dwayne-rock-johnson-talks-about-battling-depression-speak-if-youre-struggling.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson describes his battle with depression, reminding people it\u2019s important to reach out for help.", "title": "The Rock's Touching Message About Overcoming Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dwayne-rock-johnson-talks-about-battling-depression-speak-if-youre-struggling-362404", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/11/20/dwayne-rock-johnson-talks-about-battling-depression-speak-if-youre-struggling.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/20/dwayne-rock-johnson-talks-about-battling-depression-speak-if-youre-struggling.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-11-20T12:45:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-20T12:45:58-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson describes his battle with depression, reminding people it\u2019s important to reach out for help."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1149\"", "article_summary": "No one \u2014 not even Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson \u2014 is immune from depression.\nIn the video, 43-year-old Johnson describes his own experience battling the darkness in his 20s.\nThat\u2019s the actor and former wrestler\u2019s message to people suffering from mental illness, speaking during a video segment of Oprah\u2019s Master Class.\nYou\u2019re in your bubble.\u201dIt\u2019s somewhat comforting to see the huge, strong man who \u201cain\u2019t got time to bleed\u201d open up about emotional pain and mental illness \u2014 helping to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.\n\u201cYou just feel like you\u2019re alone,\u201d Johnson said in the video."}
