The October rollout of Obamacare\u2019s go-to web portal for health insurance needs, \u201chealthcare.gov\u201d was an HTML-based disaster in public relations.\n\nSo much so that by comparison, the problems with Hawai`i\u2019s own web-based insurance exchange, the \u201cHawai`i Health Connector\u201d seem to be getting repaired at break-nerd speed.\n\nNot that it\u2019s a perfect experience. Errors abound, in both code and good old-fashioned grammar, as one of the messages frequently encountered on the site demonstrates:\n\n\u201cMahalo for your patient during this time.\u201d\n\nThe site can also be a tad redundant, with a seemingly endless series of pictures of dismembered hands flashing a \u201cthumps up\u201d signal, and head-scratching tips like \u201call applicants are encouraged to prepare in advance of preparing their application \u2026.\u201d\n\nAwkwardly-worded, sure. But mock it all we like, the most important point to be made is that the site is active, and for the most part, functional.\n\nIf you\u2019re an individual currently without health insurance, you absolutely should be using it. Soon. Tax penalties for the uninsured will start kicking in on April 1, 2014.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Part 1 of our series explains the penalties for non-compliance.\n\nChoosing a plan through the health exchange also happens to be the only way for you to receive federal subsidies meant to offset the cost of health insurance.\n\nBefore we explain how the Health Connector itself functions, let\u2019s take a look at who qualifies for federal assistance under Obamacare, and who doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s All About Income\n\nThough the administration has never described it as such, there are really three distinct income brackets recognized by Obamacare, and the system treats each bracket very differently. In short, the more you earn, the less help from Uncle Sam you can expect.\n\nBracket 1: The Medicaid-Eligible\n\nOne of Obamacare\u2019s key provisions has been a dramatic expansion of Medicaid. Now, anyone with income levels up to 138% of the federal poverty line could possibly qualify.\n\nTo see how that works, let\u2019s start at the very bottom income level, and by that we mean everyone from those earning zero income to individuals earning up to around $18,257 per year.\n\nAny individual in Hawai`i with yearly income falling somewhere between those two numbers may be eligible for Medicaid health coverage, and the Hawai`i Health Connector is designed to point them in that direction.\n\nMedicaid eligibility also extends to families with anywhere from zero income to $37,384 for a household of four family members. To calculate family eligibility limits, count yourself as an individual ($18,257) and add $6,376 for each additional family member in your household, up to a total of eight people including yourself. If you have more than eight in your household, add an additional $4,620 per family member.\n\nOf course, the Health Connector is designed to help you figure out which bracket you fall into. More on that in a minute.\n\nBracket 2: Subsidized Insurance Coverage\n\nObamacare provides subsidies to offset insurance costs for people with family incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level.\n\nIn Hawai`i, this means if you\u2019re an individual with an income somewhere between $18,257 and $52,920 per year, you may qualify for some sort of financial subsidy to assist with your health insurance costs.\n\nTo calculate family income limits, count yourself as an individual ($52,920) then add an additional $18,480 per family member. A family of four, for instance is eligible for assistance up to an income level of $108,360 yearly.\n\nSubsidies for these income brackets are being calculated based on a \u201csliding scale.\u201d Meaning simply, the more you make, the less help you should expect.\n\nWhen the Health Connector determines you are eligible for a subsidy (given as a tax credit), the subsidy will be paid directly to the health insurer. The benefit to you will be a lower health insurance bill than you otherwise would have faced.\n\n(Reportedly, you may choose to pay the full cost of health coverage and opt to receive the subsidy as a year-end tax credit.)\n\nSo just how much help can you expect?\n\nObamacare is designed to cap entry-level health insurance premiums (to be exact, the second-lowest \u201csilver\u201d level plan on the Health Connector) at anywhere from 2% of income for families hovering at the federal poverty line, to 9.5% of income for families at up to 400% above the poverty line.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo help figure out what you or your family may be entitled to, we highly recommend using the Kaiser Foundation\u2019s easy-to-use subsidy calculator, though you won\u2019t actually know the exact help you will be getting until you fill out a formal application at the Hawaii Health Connector website.\n\nBracket 3: You\u2019re on Your Own\n\nFolks with incomes above the aforementioned limits can expect to pay full freight, so to speak, for their insurance coverage. On the plus side, filling out an application via the Hawai\u2019i Health Connector will still allow them to view competing health plans.\n\nObamacare is intended to slow the growth in health care costs over the long haul, theoretically helping to lower expenses even for people not eligible for subsidies, but how that works out remains to be seen.\n\nIs This the Insurance Olympics?\n\nSort of.\n\nThe Hawai`i Health Connector breaks insurance plans down into four categories: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum plans.\n\nNot surprisingly, the more costly the plan, the better coverage it offers. Costs will vary depending on your age and the size of your family (and whether you qualify for subsidies).\n\nAn important warning: although insurance companies cannot discriminate based on pre-existing conditions, tobacco users can expect to pay up to 50% more for all plans. That\u2019s written into the law.\n\nUsing one of our writers as a guinea pig, we found that a 35-year-old single male (non-smoker) with no children, who doesn\u2019t qualify for subsidies, could expect to pay anywhere from $132 per month for \u201cBronze\u201d coverage to $355.89 for a \u201cPlatinum\u201d plan.\n\nThe cheaper plans are \u201cHMO\u201d-style plans, with limited choice of physicians, while the most expensive plans give buyers the ability to choose their health providers.\n\nBronze plans typically pay up to 60% of health care expenses incurred in a given year, with individuals protected against out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $5,000.\n\nSilver plans pay up to around 70% of costs, while gold and platinum plans pay around 80% and 90% of health care expenses in a given year, respectively.\n\nOut-of-pocket expenses were capped at $2,000 for the platinum plan we evaluated, while the gold and silver plans capped yearly expenses at $4,000 and $5,000, respectively.\n\nDeductibles and co-payments varied immensely (from several-thousand-dollar deductibles to a few hundred or less), so we highly encourage you to fill out an application on the Health Connector, and to read each plan you\u2019re interested in very thoroughly to fully understand the level of protection you can expect.\n\nHawai\u2019i Health Connector Survival Guide\n\nApart from using the handy subsidy calculator from Kaiser, the best thing you can do for yourself to understand your insurance options is to go ahead and plunge into the Health Connector\u2019s application tool here.\n\nGetting through the site requires patience, so plan on doing this when you\u2019re in a relaxed mood. Ten minutes of swearing at your monitor apparently doesn\u2019t work. We tried that.\n\nAnyhow, once you\u2019ve created an account, you\u2019ll begin filling in necessary info (social security, age, number of dependents, etc).\n\nA helpful tip: If you get kicked out of the system at some point (like our guinea pig did), just head straight back to the application page to sign in, then hit the \u201cmy account\u201d button. Maddeningly, the home page of the Health Connector doesn\u2019t have a sign-in function.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve finished your application, you\u2019re ready to pick a plan and see your potential subsidy. Mind you, don\u2019t expect an \u201capplication complete\u201d message here. Instead, once you see a new screen appear with the \u201cmy eligibility\u201d button, go ahead and click on that, then click on \u201cselect a plan.\u201d\n\nIntuitive? Nope. But take a deep breath, as you\u2019re well on your way.\n\nAs we mentioned, read through those plans very carefully, then pick the one that best suits your needs.\n\nBest wishes, and should you find yourself needing assistance, best to contact the professionals. The Hawai`i Health Connector support team can be reached at (877) 628-5076.\n\nSpanish speakers may need additional assistance though. This may be the only telephone tree on Earth offering \u201cHawaiian\u201d as the alternate language option.\n\nPomaika`i.", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Who qualifies for subsidies, and our \"Hawai`i Health Connector Survival Guide.\"", "og": {"url": "http://bigislandnow.com/2013/11/05/analysis-obamacare-explained-part-2-the-hawaii-connection/", "site_name": "Big Island Now  |  ANALYSIS: Obamacare Explained \u2013 Part 2 \u2013 the Hawaii Connection", "image": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/doctor-with-stethoscope-health-care.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Big Island Now: ANALYSIS: Obamacare Explained \u2013 Part 2 \u2013 the Hawaii Connection"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/themes/BigIslandNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "obamacare hawaii,hawaii health connector,hawaii medicaid,hawaii federal poverty level,hawaii health exchange,hawaii insurance subsidy,hawaii insurance,obamacare insurance subsidy,discussion,featured articles", "theme-color": "#57ace2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8414\"", "article_summary": "The Hawai`i Health Connector breaks insurance plans down into four categories: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum plans.\nThe Hawai`i Health Connector support team can be reached at (877) 628-5076.\nOn the plus side, filling out an application via the Hawai\u2019i Health Connector will still allow them to view competing health plans.\nBefore we explain how the Health Connector itself functions, let\u2019s take a look at who qualifies for federal assistance under Obamacare, and who doesn\u2019t.\nThe October rollout of Obamacare\u2019s go-to web portal for health insurance needs, \u201chealthcare.gov\u201d was an HTML-based disaster in public relations."}
