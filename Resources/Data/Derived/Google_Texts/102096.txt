Munis became even more useful in 2013, when tax rates went up. The top rate was raised to 39.6 percent from 35 percent, and an additional 3.8 percent tax on investment income for high earners, a provision of the Affordable Care Act, was introduced.

But why settle for one tax write-off when you can get two or even three? States generally don't tax interest on munis issued within their borders, so residents who buy them can collect interest free of state and federal tax alike.

Residents of cities or counties that assess their own income tax could deduct income on munis issued within the state on their city tax forms, too, completing a tax-break trifecta. New York is the most notable example of a city that has its own income tax, but it's far from alone. Yonkers, just over the New York City border from the Bronx, is another one, as are Wilmington, Delaware; Birmingham, Alabama; eight cities in Kentucky and on and on.

Muni-bond investments in taxable accounts are smart choices for residents of New York or other cities with income taxes, and a sensible (or clear) choice for those who live in high-tax states. But they may even make sense for everyone else who gets to deduct the earnings from their federal income taxes. Consult a tax professional to learn the full tax consequences of munis for your financial situation.
