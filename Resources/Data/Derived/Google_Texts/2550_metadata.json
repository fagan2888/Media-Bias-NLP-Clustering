Set to the catchy jingle, \u201cLive Long Oregon,\u201d the costly ads feature folk singer Laura Gibson and promote Cover Oregon.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s appropriate to hold off on any further advertising,\u201d Goldberg said during a press conference Monday, according to Northwest Watchdog.\n\nThe ads have been largely removed, though some billboards remain. Cover Oregon planned to spend $10 million on the ad campaign, but then doubled that amount to $21 million in October.\n\nSince the Oct. 1 launch of the Affordable Care Act, Cover Oregon has been the lead car of the Obamacare train wreck. A grand total of 44 Oregonians selected a health insurance plan through the state\u2019s exchange in both October and November, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAnd the state exchange has only recently begun reporting enrollments \u2014 via paper application. According to Northwest Watchdog, 7,500 have enrolled in private insurance plans, and 13,374 signed up for the Oregon Health Plan for low-income residents of the Beaver State. Additionally, 30,000 appellations still need to be processed, but half are laden with mistakes.\n\nOregon received $300 million from the federal government to build its own state exchange and plans to enroll a grand total of 100,000 by Jan. 1, most of which will receive coverage through Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Oregon hipsters can breath a sigh of relief as the state's folksy, counter-culture ads promoting Cover Oregon are being pulled from the waves of mainstream Oregonians.", "title": "Oregon state exchange kills 'Live Long Oregon' ads - Red Alert...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/12/Long-Live-Oregon-600x335.jpg", "height": 335}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/12/18/oregon-state-exchange-kills-live-long-oregon-ads/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "the-beaver-state", "published_time": "2013-12-18T14:13:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-18T14:37:05+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9522\"", "article_summary": "Set to the catchy jingle, \u201cLive Long Oregon,\u201d the costly ads feature folk singer Laura Gibson and promote Cover Oregon.\nOregon hipsters can breath a sigh of relief as the state\u2019s folksy, counter-culture ads promoting Cover Oregon are being pulled from the waves of mainstream Oregonians.\nSince the Oct. 1 launch of the Affordable Care Act, Cover Oregon has been the lead car of the Obamacare train wreck.\nAnd the state exchange has only recently begun reporting enrollments \u2014 via paper application.\nCover Oregon planned to spend $10 million on the ad campaign, but then doubled that amount to $21 million in October."}
