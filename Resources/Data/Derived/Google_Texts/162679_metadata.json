Morial Convention Center on tap to exceed 600,000.\n\nAnd that\u2019s on top of a record year in 2013, featuring closing-night headliner Beyonc\u00e9, which saw a 30% increase from the year prior to 543,000 people. Doug Thornton, executive VP of Superdome management company SMG, expects more than 130,000 people to attend the festival each night \u2013 that\u2019s more than Coachella or Lollapalooza.\n\nWith a fourth night added for the first time on Thursday \u2013 featuring performances from Nas, Trey Songz, Jazmine Sullivan and K. Michelle \u2014 and Prince\u2019s 4th of July headlining set sold out more than a week in advance, expect a weekend full of surprises with musical legends.\n\nOther performers throughout the weekend include Saturday-night headliner Mary J. Blige (a 12-time veteran of the Essence stage) and Sunday\u2019s one-two punch of Charlie Wilson and Lionel Richie (\u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone will have any energy left,\u201d jokes Michelle Ebanks, president of Essence Communications.)\n\nThe daytime programming at the convention center also brings an A-list lineup of speakers, including Kevin Hart, Steve Harvey and Alicia Keys, the latter of whom appeared on a panel Friday subtitled \u201cEmpowering Black Women To End AIDS.\u201d\n\nRead on for minute-by-minute highlights from Day 2 of the Essence Festival.\n\n\n\n8:20 p.m.: Janelle Monae takes the stage for her second consecutive Main Stage performance, kicking things off appropriately with \u201cElectric Lady\u201d album cut \u201cGivin \u2018Em What They Love\u201d \u2013 the studio version of which features Prince. No sign of The Purple One on this one, but\u2026\n\n\n\n9:05 p.m.: After Monae tears through hits like \u201cDance Apocalyptic,\u201d \u201cPrime Time\u201d and \u201cTightrope,\u201d it\u2019s time to pay tribute to her mentor and friend with \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d And guess who shows up for a guitar solo?\n\nJanelle Monae performs during the 2014 Essence Music Festival on July 4, 2014 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Though she had to liven up a venue that was barely half-full by this point, she more than made up for the lukewarm response she received from the crowd just a year prior, who were clearly more in the mood to see closing headliner Beyonc\u00e9.\n\n\n\n9:25 p.m.: A packed house crowds the Ford SuperLounge to catch SWV, back for a second time after appearing in 2012. The trio\u2019s hour-long set kicks off with \u201cAll About You,\u201d an uptempo jam from their recent comeback album \u201cI Missed Us,\u201d and goes straight into \u201cRight Here (Human Nature Remix)\u201d and \u201cSo Into You,\u201d in case there was any doubt the hundreds of fans were going to get exactly what they came for.\n\n\n\n10:10 p.m.: Lead SWV singer Coko asks the crowd if they can take things back for a remake. \u201cThis song actually earned us a Grammy nod,\u201d she says before kicking off the group\u2019s cover of Patti Labelle ballad \u201cIf Only You Knew,\u201d which indeed scored the group its first Grammy nomination since being up for Best New Artist in 1994. The crowd sings along at the highest volume it\u2019s registered all night, a sign that \u201cold school R&B\u201d goes a lot further back than SWV\u2019s heyday for the women who flock to Essence. At one point, in fact, the group\u2019s Leanne \u201cLelee\u201d Lyons shouts out, \u201cWhere my 40s, 50s and 60s sisters at?\u201d\n\n\n\n10:20 p.m.: How do you close a set by the queens of \u201890s R&B slow jams? With \u201cRain\u201d and \u201cWeak,\u201d of course.\n\n\n\n10:30 p.m.: As the SuperLounges empty so attendees can grab their seats for Prince, it turns out the headliner has already taken the stage once again during Nile Rodgers and Chic\u2019s set, for a rendition of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Dance.\u201d Lending his chops to another brief guitar cameo, Prince is already gone by the time the band rips into its signature hit \u201cLe Freak.\u201d\n\nNile Rodgers performs at the 2014 Essence Music Festival on July 4, 2014 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Josh Brasted/Getty Images\n\nJosh Brasted/Getty Images\n\n11:21 p.m.: \u201cDearly beloved, we are gathered here today\u2026\u201d Yup, it\u2019s Prince o\u2019clock. The singer supposedly turned 56 just last month, but he looks roughly half that sporting his \u2018fro of the moment, pants so tight they could very well be bell-bottomed leggings, and a long, flowy gray sweater that looks like something your art teacher wore in the \u201870s. In other words, he\u2019s looking as Prince-ly as you could possibly imagine.\n\n\n\n11:23 p.m.: The festival has a technical curfew of 1:00 a.m., but it\u2019s hard to imagine it being honored from a performer notorious for encores that can go as long as his main sets. \u201cWe gon\u2019 play 14 hits in a row!\u201d Prince announces before going into a hard-rock version of \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d that segues nicely into some guitar work inspired by Queen guitarist Brian May\u2019s \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d solos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11:28 p.m.: With 2014 being the 30th anniversary of \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d it\u2019s not a surprise to find nearly half of that iconic album\u2019s tracks scattered among the set. Up next: \u201cTake Me With U,\u201d an overlooked latter-period single. With the show already batting 2 for 2 in following the album\u2019s exact sequence, could \u201cComputer Blue\u201d be up next? (Alas, it\u2019s not. And given Prince\u2019s family-friendly policy nowadays, best believe \u201cDarling Nikki\u201d is off the table.)\n\n\n\n11:32 p.m.: \u201cRaspberry Beret\u201d time. Also, time for dancers \u2013 over a dozen of them, it appears, each dressed in different all-white ensembles with purple accents, from ascots to suspenders to, yes, berets. A trio of backup singers also take to the nose of the stage, including breakout star Liv Warfield, who plays the Superlounges later in the weekend. The dance party quickly segues into \u201cU Got The Look\u201d (no Sheena Easton sightings), which doubles as a showcase for a stunningly gorgeous dancer. She\u2019s clad in a black-and-gold dress with a slit cut up to there, and her body is indeed hecka-slammin\u2019.\n\nPrince performs with Liv Warfield at the Essence Late-Night After-Party at House of Blues on July 5, 2014 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Erika Goldring/Getty Images\n\nErika Goldring/Getty Images\n\n11:37 p.m.: Quick Michael Jackson tribute, as Prince asks for the house lights to go up on a special rendition of \u201cDon\u2019t Stop \u2019Til You Get Enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n11:43 p.m.: \u201cYou know how many hits I got?\u201d Prince skipped his humble pie for dessert, and thank goodness. Now it\u2019s time for \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d and \u201cSign O The Times.\u201d\n\n\n\n11:56 p.m.: We\u2019re cruising into midnight with a relentlessly funky trio of Prince classics: \u201cControversy,\u201d \u201c1999\u201d and \u201cLittle Red Corvette.\u201d By the time he slows things down a bit with \u201cNothing Compares 2 U,\u201d he\u2019s more than earned the right to let the crowd do most of the singing.\n\n\n\n12:10 a.m.: \u201cThank you to New Power Generation, Doug E. Fresh, Nile Rodgers and Janelle Monae. This is your party now. Any requests?\u201d This was an absurd question for Prince to ask, of course, since it was posed to an arena full of 130,000 people. \u201cSince y\u2019all can\u2019t make up your mind, lemme pick one.\u201d\n\n\n\n12:11 a.m.: Surprise! It\u2019s \u201cKiss.\u201d And on the line \u201cI know how to undress me,\u201d Prince doffs the old-lady sweater to reveal a long-sleeved blouse emblazoned with his own face. Well, kind of anyway \u2013 there\u2019s a third eye poking out of his sunglasses, a reference to his all-female band, 3RDEYEGIRL (who are effortlessly shredding this two-hour set while somehow looking like they just came from a \u201cV\u201d magazine photo shoot the whole time.)\n\n\n\n12:15 a.m.: The first true surprises guests of the night show up for \u201cSometimes It Snows In April\u201d \u2013 British jazz-soul singer Lianne La Havas, who\u2019s otherwise not on the bill during Essence weekend, and New Orleans stalwart Trombone Shorty.\n\n\n\n12:25 a.m.: Prince began 2014 teasing a new album with 3RDEYEGIRL dubbed \u201cPlectrum Electrum,\u201d and appeared on \u201cThe New Girl\u201d and \u201cThe Arsenio Hall Show\u201d to debut songs from it. That LP has now apparently been shelved for now, according to a recent interview Prince gave to his hometown paper, but didn\u2019t stop Prince from revisiting \u201cPlectrum Electrum\u201d cut \u201cFunkNRoll\u201d during the set. \u201cAct Of God,\u201d from his last proper full-length \u201c20TEN,\u201d also makes a surprise appearance.\n\n\n\n12:40 a.m.: Prince is being exceptionally generous in paying it forward to his peers tonight. There\u2019s back-to-back covers of Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cWhat Have You Done For Me Lately,\u201d which pairs seamlessly with The Time\u2019s \u201cJungle Love,\u201d since both are the brainchildren of Minnesotans Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Sheila E.\u2019s \u201cGlamorous Life\u201d soon follows, and there\u2019s some more jamming.\n\n\n\n12:50 a.m.: Then Prince leaves. Of course, no one else in the crowd does, because we know what we came for. The sound of thunder pipes through the speakers, validating our patience. A chant of \u201cPurple Rain! Purple Rain!\u201d is summoned.\n\n\n\n12:52 a.m.: \u201cThirty years ago today this was the sound. You can sing along if you want to.\u201d And the whole Superdome does. Fittingly, Prince showers the crowd in purple confetti, and sets free over five dozen purple balloons into the sky as well.\n\n\n\n1:04 a.m.: More jamming. Looks like \u201cPurple Rain\u201d is not quite the grand finale.\n\n\n\n1:10 a.m.: Prince has said goodnight, but no one\u2019s buying it. Two minutes later, he\u2019s back, and this time so is Janelle Monae. One more song and then it\u2019s really over. At least, at the Superdome. Liv Warfield is due onstage momentarily cross-town at the House of Blues, backed by the NPG Hornz. And guess who just might show up around 3 a.m\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Highlights from day 2 of the 20th annual Essence Festival in New Orleans.", "title": "Essence Festival 2014 Day 2 Highlights: Prince, Janelle Monae, Nile Rodgers & More", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6150275/essence-festival-2014-day-2-highlights-prince-janelle-monae-nile-rodgers-chic-swv", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/prince-essence-fest-2014-billboard-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Highlights from day 2 of the 20th annual Essence Festival in New Orleans.", "title": "Essence Festival 2014 Day 2 Highlights: Prince, Janelle Monae, Nile Rodgers & More", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6150275/essence-festival-2014-day-2-highlights-prince-janelle-monae-nile-rodgers-chic-swv", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/prince-essence-fest-2014-billboard-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Highlights from day 2 of the 20th annual Essence Festival in New Orleans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Essence Festival 2014 Day 2 Highlights: Prince, Janelle Monae, Nile Rodgers & More | Billboard"}, "article_summary": "Janelle Monae performs during the 2014 Essence Music Festival on July 4, 2014 in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nFor its 20th anniversary, the Essence Festival recruited Prince to headline, doubled the number of stages at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome (10 to 20) in New Orleans and added a fourth day to showcase developing artists.\nLooks like \u201cPurple Rain\u201d is not quite the grand finale.\nPurple Rain!\u201d is summoned.\n12:10 a.m.: \u201cThank you to New Power Generation, Doug E.
