The Heritage Foundation, the premier right-wing think tank in the nation, practically grew out of that narrative. In the mid-1970\u2019s, conservatives understood that they needed a new, spunky, uncompromising and ideologically-based organizations that would \u2013 unlike the stodgy Hoover Institution and American Enterprise Institute \u2013 bypass the mainstream liberal media, and establish a modern-day beachhead for conservative ideas.\n\nWhen the Heritage Foundation opened its doors in 1973, the Vietnam War was finally winding down, Vice President Agnew had been shown the door and President Richard Nixon would soon follow, victories for civil rights and women\u2019s rights had been won, and the arc of justice seemed to be bending towards greater economic fairness. Belief in a social safety net was still strong, and privatization was not yet the clarion call that it has become. The \u201cculture wars\u201d were still a few years off.\n\nIn his 1979 book, A Time for Truth, William Simon, Nixon\u2019s former energy czar and Treasury Secretary, and the then-president of the conservative Olin Foundation, understood that the conservative movement would only grow if it could slap back against the liberal establishment\u2019s belief in \"equality\" and of being \"possessed of delusions of moral grandeur.\" A year later, the award-winning journalist and investigative reporter Robert Parry reported for consortiumnews.com that Simon published A Time for Action, \u201cwhich demanded that the \u2019death grip\u2019 of the Liberal Establishment and its \u2018New Despotism\u2019 be broken. Simon saw the news media as part of the enemy camp. He especially targeted journalists who, Simon charged, \u2018have been working overtime to deny liberty to others.\u2019\"\n\nSimon and other wealthy benefactors were able to mobilize a number of right wing foundations, including the John M. Olin Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Koch brothers' foundations, the Smith Richardson Foundation, and the Scaife family foundations, and the transformation of the country\u2019s political landscape was under way.\n\nIn his 1986 book, The Rise of the Counter-Establishment, Sidney Blumenthal wrote: \"The Bastille to which they [conservative foundations] laid siege was the fortress of liberalism, the hollow doctrine of the old regime. These intellectuals impressed their thoughts on public activity, staffing the new institutes, writing policy papers and newspaper editorials, and serving as political advisors, lending the power of the word to the defense of ideology.\"\n\nThe Heritage Foundation essentially made its bones during the presidential campaign of 1980 when it produced \u201cMandate for Leadership,\u201d a 3,000-page, 20-volume set of policy recommendations that would be a blueprint for the so-called Reagan Revolution. \u201cMandate for Change\u201d advocated trickle-down economics, called for massive cutbacks in social programs, and the Star Wars Defense Strategy.\n\nWhile it would be vastly overstating the case to attribute the gains of the conservative movement and the changing political landscape in the country over the past forty years solely to the Heritage Foundation, the growth of Heritage definitely parallels the growth of the movement.\n\nHeritage Action Embraces Cruz\n\nIn its current iteration, with former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint at the helm, Heritage has become bolder, louder and even more hard line. Heritage Action, the think tank\u2019s 501(c)(4) nonprofit arm, recently produced its first-ever presidential scorecard. According to Politico, the 50-page report, titled \u201cPresidential Platform Review,\u201d \u201cgrades the candidates across six categories: growth, opportunity, civil society, limited government, favoritism and national security.\u201d\n\nAlthough it didn\u2019t directly endorse any candidate, the candidate leading the pack is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. During the GOP\u2019s CNBC debate, Cruz brought the \u201cliberal media is the problem\u201d theme into the spotlight.\n\nWhile Heritage Action\u2019s report criticizes most of the candidates, Cruz appears to have escaped relatively unscathed, as the report praises Cruz for \u201cwilling to pay a political price for taking on government favoritism\u201d as well as his efforts to \u201celiminate government-imposed barriers to opportunity.\u201d\n\nAs The Daily Beast\u2019s Betsy Woodruff recently pointed out, \u201cOver Cruz\u2019s three short years in Washington, he and the Heritage Action team have joined forces on so many issues that some suspect\u2014though always off-the-record\u2014that the group jiggers its scorecard to keep his perfect 100 percent score.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t even to mention all the times Cruz and Heritage Action leaders literally stood shoulder-to-shoulder. In the leadup to the 2013 effort to eliminate funding for the Affordable Care Act, Cruz teamed with the group for town halls designed to gin up support for their push. At the group\u2019s Dallas event, he sparred with hecklers and drew adoring praise from the crowd.\n\nPolitico pointed out that, \u201cJeb Bush, for instance, is accused of having \u2018kowtowed to the state\u2019s environmental lobby\u2019 in Florida. Chris Christie \u2018has shown favoritism toward well-connected real estate developers.\u2019 Rand Paul\u2019s \u2018views at times veer outside the conservative mainstream.\u2019 And Donald Trump backs \u2018massive tariffs that would damage the American economy.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith DeMint at the helm, the Heritage Foundation and its Heritage Action entity \u201chave become increasingly aggressive.\u201d And while they claim that they will not endorse any candidate, Cruz appears to have set their hearts on fire.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The debate over liberal media bias is one of the conservative movement\u2019s most cherished, successful and long-lived memes.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Bill Berkowitz", "og": {"url": "http://truth-out.org/buzzflash/commentary/conservatives-bashing-the-liberal-media-aided-by-think-tanks", "type": "article", "site_name": "Buzzflash", "description": "The debate over liberal media bias is one of the conservative movement\u2019s most cherished, successful and long-lived memes.", "title": "Conservatives Bashing the Liberal Media Aided by Think Tanks"}, "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Heritage Foundation, the premier right-wing think tank in the nation, practically grew out of that narrative.\nDuring the GOP\u2019s CNBC debate, Cruz brought the \u201cliberal media is the problem\u201d theme into the spotlight.\nHeritage Action, the think tank\u2019s 501(c)(4) nonprofit arm, recently produced its first-ever presidential scorecard.\nHeritage Action Embraces CruzIn its current iteration, with former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint at the helm, Heritage has become bolder, louder and even more hard line.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t even to mention all the times Cruz and Heritage Action leaders literally stood shoulder-to-shoulder."}
