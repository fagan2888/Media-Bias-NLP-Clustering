By 2023, employers will be paying 8.4 percent more than \u201cwhat they would otherwise be spending\u201d for their employees\u2019 health care.\n\nIn the next 10 years, the total cost of Obamacare to all large American employers is estimated to be from $151 billion to $186 billion, according to the study.\n\n\u201cThis study is a c-suite diagnosis of how [the Affordable Care Act] ACA is shaping large employer behavior,\u201d Tevi Troy, president of the American Health Policy Institute, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet precisely how employers will react, but the study shows that employers will have to make real changes or incur heavy costs, which means that the ACA will have a significant impact on those in employer-sponsored health care.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that some will say the results will \u201clead to more economical use of health care dollars,\u201d the study questions whether the increase in health costs could bring the \u201cend of the employer-sponsored health care system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the law leads to significant cost increases for [employers], this would affect the behavior of employers, which could in turn affect how\u2014and even whether\u2014they provide health care for their employees,\u201d the study said.\n\nHealth care costs have already been increasing for large businesses, which spend $578.6 billion each year to provide health coverage for 170.9 million employees, retirees, and dependents. However, numerous studies suggest that Obamacare is adding to employers\u2019 burdens.\n\nFor instance, a report by the Urban Institute found that Obamacare increased large employer health costs by $11.8 billion in 2012, and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the excise tax on high-cost plans would cost $32 billion from 2018 to 2019.\n\nThe novel survey by the American Health Policy Institute asked companies directly what their costs will be, rather than \u201cspeculating from the outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the study looked at direct costs to companies from the ACA\u2019s requirements, over and above projected employer health care cost trends without the ACA,\u201d the study said.\n\nDirect costs resulting from the law include the excise tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d plans; Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute fees; and benefit mandates, such as covering 100 percent of preventative care services.\n\n\u201cIn light of the uncertainty related to projected ACA-related savings, this study provides an important look into what America\u2019s employers themselves believe will happen, and presumably, what projections they will use in determining future benefit designs as well as employment strategies,\u201d the study concluded. \u201cThe results of this study demonstrate that employers have a significant incentive to make fundamental changes to their health offerings as a result of the ACA.\u201d\n\n\u201cCost increases in the range of $163 million to $200 million per large employer over the course of a decade will not be overlooked by CEOs, CFOs, or Boards of Directors,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is not yet clear what these changes will be. What is clear, however, is that the ACA has already altered the landscape of employer-provided health care, and will do so even more over the next decade.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Businesses reveal in confidential survey that Obamacare will add up to $200 million in costs", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Obamacare will cost large companies between $4,800 and $5,900 more per employee and add hundreds of millions to their overhead, according to a new survey.
