Trump keep insisting that everyone is covered, but denied he ever said the government would pay for it.\n\nCruz posted the following video of their exchange as well as excerpt of a video that Trump gave.\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript:\n\nCruz: \u201cDonald, true or false, you\u2019ve said the government should pay for everyone\u2019s healthcare?\u201d Trump: \u201cThat\u2019s false.\u201d Cruz: \u201cYou\u2019ve never said that?\u201d Trump on 60 Minutes, 9/27/2015: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be covered\u2026 I am going to take care of everybody\u2026 The government\u2019s going to pay for it, but we\u2019re gonna save so much money on the other side!\u201d\n\nThis my friends is single payer health care \u2013 something the Donald says he doesn\u2019t support, but obviously does.
