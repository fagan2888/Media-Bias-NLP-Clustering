Moderately priced housing urged for NH



The Cotton Mill in Nashua began accepting tenants last summer, the Woodbury Mill in Dover was completed last spring, and the Townhomes at Whittemore Place in Londonderry just had a grand opening last month.

..

The affordable housing they offer is desperately needed in New Hampshire, where high rents are crimping what would otherwise be more robust growth in the state's economy.



“Our members in the business community are telling us this lack of affordable and available housing is beginning to impact their ability to hire and retain employees,” said David Juvet, senior vice president of the Business and Industry Association, New Hampshire's statewide chamber of commerce. “It has emerged as one of the number one employer issues in the state.”

..

Juvet was kicking off the 2015 Housing Forum, hosted by the BIA in partnership with the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority, Housing Action New Hampshire and the Workforce Housing Coalition of the Greater Seacoast.

..

The consensus of the panel gathered Friday at the Radisson in Manchester was that some progress is being made, but much more needs to be done to foster public-private partnerships, boost the state's Affordable Housing Trust Fund, ease restrictive zoning regulations and counter neighborhood opposition to mixed-use housing projects.

..

“I think we're seeing some positive trends, both in terms of recognizing that this is a business need, and a community need, and that the developments that are being created are quality additions the community,” said Elissa Margolin, director of Housing Action NH. “They are ascetically pleasing and they enhance our communities and our state as whole.”

..

But it's not nearly enough in a state where the average renter earns $13.91 an hour and the median 2-bedroom rent is affordable only at $20.50 an hour or higher, according to Housing Action. Despite the state's high level of home ownership, renters still make up 30 percent of the households.

..

More importantly, the young professionals the state desperately needs to keep its economy humming are primarily renters, who will simply choose to take their talents elsewhere.



Direct cost to business



In the Lebanon-Hanover area, the problem has become so severe that most renters have to commute 25 to 30 miles each way from apartments in Claremont or Newport, and in some cases still pay more than the recommended 30 percent of earnings on rent.

..

“Lack of affordable housing creates a big problem for us in recruiting top talent,” said Carolyn Maloney, treasurer of Hypertherm, a manufacturer with 1,400 employees headquartered in Lebanon.



“Some of our engineering positions have been open for at least two years,” she said. “We bring candidates up here, they get a taste of the housing costs, and how far they have to drive to find affordable housing, and they decline.”

..

The problem creates a direct cost to a business like Hyperthem.



“Most of the quality people we've hired — engineers, sales, finance — have to be recruited from the outside with large relocation packages of $50,000 to $100,000,” said Maloney, “mostly due to housing costs.”

..

Tough row



The state has the buildings and the available land to create more rental housing, but the construction industry, land-use regulations, and opposition from abutters have made it difficult to build anything except a “McMansion” on a two-acre lot with 200 feet of road frontage.

..

“Nashua could create 1,000 units of affordable housing,” said James Vayo, community liaison for the Visualize Nashua project. “But the industry builds this (pointing to a slide of a McMansion subdivision). “If you just build this, you really limit the kind of buyers you have.”

..

The hope for the future, he said, rests with people such as Rebecca Perkins, a young attorney who lives in Portsmouth and helped launch the “603 Initiative,” which is focused on issues critical to young professionals.

..

“If you want mill apartments in downtown Nashua, show up at meetings that are open to the public and talk about how that would be a positive thing for downtown Nashua,” she said.



The 603 group is planning a statewide summit this spring in the hope of bringing the issue to the forefront.

..

“Young people are starting to come back to New Hampshire. They are interested,” she said, “but if we don't do something to move this issue forward, it's going to be the death of a thousand cuts to the spark of vitality we have here.”

..

Seeking partnerships



In recognition of the problem, lawmakers added $800,000 to the New Hampshire Affordable Housing Trust Fund in the recently approved capital budget. The fund was launched under Gov. John H. Sununu in the 1980s, when housing costs first became an issue.

..

The $800,000 contribution this year brings the fund, administered by the New Hampshire Housing Authority, to around $1.8 million. Maine just contributed $30 million to its moderately priced housing trust fund, which is financed through a portion of the real estate transfer tax.

..

“The real estate transfer tax is used in most states, but in New Hampshire it's funded through the capital budget process,” said Margolin at Housing Action.



She called the recent appropriation “a small amount but symbolically a step in the right direction” and pointed out that every dollar in state money leverages, on average, seven other dollars in private and federal funds. Margolin said the business community is emerging as a powerful ally in the effort.

..

“If we can get the momentum of the business community understanding that we need affordable housing, to talk to policymakers about the need for the state to step up, we will make great progress,” she said.

..

Cliff Sinnott, executive director at Rockingham Planning Commission, says a change of heart is also needed at the grassroots. “We've understood this problem for a long time,” he said. “We've also understood some of the solutions for a long time, but there's been relatively little progress.

..

“The opposition that typically comes with workforce housing projects comes when a planning board is reviewing the project and the only people in the audience are nine abutters, 10 of whom are vehemently, vocally, angrily opposed.”

..

He encouraged people such as Perkins and her associates in the 603 Initiative to press on. “We have to balance that negativity and the nimbyism with some positivity,” he said.
