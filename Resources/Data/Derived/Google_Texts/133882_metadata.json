Members spoke by conference call from Austria with reporters Tuesday, including WAMC\u2019s North Country Bureau Chief Pat Bradley.\n\nLuge is the Olympic sport in which athletes slide down a track lying on their back on a sled. According to USA Luge Association, the average luge run\u2019s vertical drop is 30 stories and speeds can exceed 95 mph.\n\nSeveral of the international athletes are from the region and train at the tracks in Lake Placid and Park City, Utah. They are currently in Igls, Austria in advance of this weekend\u2019s opening World Cup Competition. The track is where luge became an Olympic sport 51 years ago and is shorter than most others.\n\nThe last time the USA team competed together was during last winter\u2019s Olympic games in Sochi.\n\n2013 Junior World Champion Emily Sweeny is from Suffield, CT and has family in Saranac Lake, NY. She is excited to begin the first sliding of the season and has been doing some different types of training in the offseason. \u201cMost of our training in the past has been very weight room based. Trying to put a lot of mass on because mass converts into power. We are a power sport. But I didn\u2019t feel good on the sled. So this year I\u2019ve started working with a local gym and their training is more gymnastics based. I still feel powerful and explosive, but just more comfortable overall.\u201d\n\nThe luge athletes have been training all summer, and slider Aiden Kelly says confidence is also enhanced by changing sled techniques and new sled technology. \u201cWe have a new shell design this year which has been working out pretty well. It\u2019s a little bit more comfortable for the male athletes. The sled is more aerodynamic. It\u2019s mostly that and having Lubo (Lubomir Mick) as a new coach. He\u2019s got some fresh ideas. He\u2019s a former Slovakian coach and former Olympian. So it\u2019s just nice to have a fresh set of eyes and some more comfortable sled technology because that\u2019s probably one of the biggest parts of our sport is trying to be comfortable and relaxed.\u201d\n\nThe athletes report that the weather in Igls has been warm and rainy. While that\u2019s not ideal, they agree that preseason training has been good.\n\nOlympic Bronze medalist Erin Hamlin of Remsen, NY has had four top 5 finishes at Igls. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively easy track. It\u2019s pretty short though. There\u2019s not a lot of time to really make up any mistakes. I\u2019m comfortable on this track. The Olympics gave me a little bit of a confidence boost but at the same time I\u2019m excited to just enjoy sliding and not feel much pressure for anything.\u201d\n\nUSA Luge doubles teams have won four overall World Cup titles, the last in 2003. This year, newly paired Matt Mortensen of Huntington Station, NY and Jayson Terdiman of Berwick, PA have been training since March. Terdiman says the challenge has been getting back into driving mode and adjusting to his new partner\u2019s style. \u201cEach run we\u2019re getting more and more comfortable. We\u2019re getting better at communicating. If something does go wrong on the track as soon as we get done we talk it out and figure out what we need to do to better ourselves for the next run. So for me it\u2019s becoming more and more comfortable even just by the run.\u201d Matt Mortensen adds \u201cFor me I guess one of the major things that we had to iron out was exactly what each one of us meant when we\u2019re talking about how we steer. We just have to figure out those little nuances with each other. When I tell him to steer, how much is it? What does that mean to him? When I ask him to roll back, how much does that mean? Every run we\u2019re learning each other\u2019s sliding abilities a little bit better.\u201d\n\nFollowing the competition in Austria, the athletes will be in Lake Placid for the second round of World Cup Luge. Training begins on December 3rd and races are scheduled on December 5th and 6th.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Sports", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/us-luge-athletes-prepare-world-cup-opener", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201411/366812262.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "US Luge Athletes Prepare For World Cup Opener"}, "org_id": 298, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Pat Bradley", "wordCount": 822, "dc": {"title": "US Luge Athletes Prepare For World Cup Opener"}, "nid": 32010, "datePublished": "2014-11-26", "story_id": 366812237, "keywords": "sports, world", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Luge is the Olympic sport in which athletes slide down a track lying on their back on a sled.\nAccording to USA Luge Association, the average luge run\u2019s vertical drop is 30 stories and speeds can exceed 95 mph.\nEvery run we\u2019re learning each other\u2019s sliding abilities a little bit better.\u201dFollowing the competition in Austria, the athletes will be in Lake Placid for the second round of World Cup Luge.\nThe USA Luge team is preparing for its first World Cup competition of the season.\nThe track is where luge became an Olympic sport 51 years ago and is shorter than most others."}
