Another off to the side \u2013 usually a card table with a tablecloth thrown over it \u2013 for the kiddies.\n\nIt was OK, except the mashed potatoes tended to get cold by the time they made it to the card table.\n\nThat\u2019s sort of the way Thursday\u2019s Fox News debate among the small army of Republicans who want the GOP presidential nomination will work \u2013 the first such gathering of the 2016 presidential campaign season.\n\nAnd Ohio\u2019s governor, John Kasich, one of a field of now 17 GOP candidates (former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore jumped in Thursday), needs to be at the \u201cbig people\u2019s table.\u201d\n\nTuesday night, Fox News is going to take the average of five national polls and invite the top 10 candidates \u2013 maybe the top 11, if there is a tie \u2013 to a 9 p.m., 90-minute, prime time debate on a stage at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. And Quicken Loans Arena just happens to be the site of the 2016 Republican National Convention, where the presidential nominee and running mate will be crowned.\n\nThe candidates who don\u2019t make the cut, Fox News says, will be invited to a one-hour debate at 5 p.m. \u2013 when there will be a whole lot fewer people watching.\n\nFox News says it will take the average of the five latest national polls at the end of the day Tuesday \u2013 although it is not exactly clear which polls the network will be using.\n\nAs of now, there are indications that Kasich, who announced his candidacy formally on July 21, will make the cut \u2013 just barely.\n\nOn Friday, the Real Clear Politics website had Kasich finishing 9th in an average of the sixth most recent national polls, with 3.5 percent support. Donald Trump led the pack with nearly 21 percent support; and there is some fear among other campaigns that the outspoken Trump will suck all the air out of the room at Quicken Loans Arena Thursday night with his rhetoric.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on Kasich's home turf, in his home state, and he needs to be there,\u2019\u2019 said political scientist Gene Beaupre, the director of government relations at Xavier University. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t make it, it\u2019s one of those lines that gets written into every news story about him. And that doesn\u2019t project him as a winner.\u201d\n\nThe debate, Beaupre said, is not so much for the voters \u201cwho aren\u2019t paying that much attention yet. It\u2019s really for the potential donors out there and the people who are looking to join one campaign organization or another.\u201d\n\nChris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Kasich\u2019s campaign committee, told WVXU Kasich\u2019s campaign is \u201cworking under the assumption that the governor will be in the prime time debate.\u201d\n\nKasich has been preparing for the debate, Schrimpf said, \u201cfocusing on using what time he will have on telling his story.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s likely, Schrimpf said, that each candidate on the stage for the prime time debate will have only six to eight minutes to make his or her points.\n\nSchrimpf said that while Kasich expects to be in the top 10, the debate is not the be-all and end-all of the Kasich campaign.\n\n\u201cThe debate, it\u2019s nice to be there, but it\u2019s not the end of the world if it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nDoing well in the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire is \u201cmore important,\u201d Schrimpf said.\n\nKasich is banking on a first-place finish in the Granite State \u2013 or a very strong finish \u2013 to give his campaign the momentum to be a first-tier candidate as the primary and caucus season grinds on next winter and spring.\n\nThat\u2019s why he spent all day there Friday; and will spend the day campaigning in New Hampshire on Monday.\n\nKyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, said that it is \u201cso far, so good\u201d for Kasich and his New Hampshire strategy. A poll last week of New Hampshire Republicans showed Kasich in third place. He had only seven percent support, but that was a considerable bump from the one or two percent he had at the time of his announcement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Kasich will make the cut on the prime time debate,\u2019\u2019 said Kondik, who is writing a book on the history of presidential elections in Ohio. \u201cA lot of candidates get a bump after they make their official announcements and Kasich did. And he gained some headway from early TV ads in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nOnce he gets on the stage, Kondik said, he will have to use his time wisely and try to make an impression.\n\n\u201cIf there is only one question asked of Kasich it would be about accepting Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,\u201d Kondik said. \u201cIf he says that people who don\u2019t support this aren\u2019t Christian enough, that\u2019s not going to go over very well.\u201d\n\nBut being on the big stage gives Kasich a chance to break through the clutter and make an impression on a national audience, Kondik said.\n\nNow, it is just a matter of whether or not Kasich is invited to the grown-ups\u2019 table or the kiddies\u2019 table.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "We don\u2019t know about your family, but, at our house, when Thanksgiving came around, there were two tables set up for the family feast.
