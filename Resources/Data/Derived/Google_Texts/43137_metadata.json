That creates his high-energy thought-provoking commentary with serious laughing out loud reactions from both sides of the issues. He is a favorite of leading journalists for his enjoyable personality, quick perceptiveness and interviewing ease. Many of today\u2019s key players on the national scene keep Edward Woodson on their short list.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of him yet, you soon will. As a Lawyer, Investor, Actor, Model and Entrepreneur, Edward has the perfect eclectic blend of experience, insight, humor and laid back attitude that is quickly making him our days most unique voice for exposing the naked truth of the everyday crisis-mongering of politicians and their media minions.\n\nEdward Woodson is the nationally syndicated host of The Edward Woodson Show which airs weekdays from 3-6pm on www.GCNLive. com and www.EdwardWoodson.com.\n\nAbout six-and-a-half years ago, on a pleasant Friday in May, the American Hospital Association put its name on the line for Obamacare. It was, it turns out, a highly profitable decision.\n\nOn that day, May 15, 2009, the well-funded lobbying heavyweight announced its backing for healthcare \u201creform\u201d along with a slew of other special interests and union groups. A few months into President Barack Obama\u2019s term, the statement underscored momentum for his effort to fundamentally transform the United States.\n\nContemporaneous documents show industry officials terrified they would miss the Obamacare train and eager to lock in favorable terms by sidling up to the negotiating table first. Meanwhile, Obama pulled a wink-and-nod routine with the public, like blasting pharmaceutical companies in a speech while relaying to their top lobbyist the bluster was just for show.\n\nWhen word leaked that AHA officials were chafing at the terms of an early draft bill, Obama\u2019s health reform \u201cczar\u201d Nancy-Ann DeParle emailed one of the group\u2019s top hired guns, Linda Fishman: \u201cI know you understand that you are much more likely to end up where you want to be if you don\u2019t box us in.\u201d\n\nIn other words, simmer down, we\u2019ve got you.\n\nAfter the law passed, AHA funded a million-dollar ad campaign in the districts of 16 House Democrats thanking them for their votes, one of many efforts the group undertook to help the Democratic party electorally.\n\nFrom this, it\u2019s sadly not surprising the AHA got pretty much exactly what it wanted out of Obamacare. But it\u2019s six years later that some of AHA\u2019s \u201cinvestments\u201d are really beginning to mature.\n\nLate last week we learned that the Department of Health and Human Services will be severely curtailing an audit program that has recovered billions in Medicare fraud, waste and abuse over the past several years from \u2013 guess who? \u2013 AHA\u2019s members.\n\nIn 2013, the program recovered $3.7 billion in illegal Medicare payments. In 2014, that number was down more than a third to $2.4 billion thanks to onerous restrictions on the auditors trying to identify fraudulent payments.\n\nNext year, it will be down further.\n\nAt issue is the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program, which pays private companies a portion of the funds they help the government recover. It\u2019s something of an oasis of common sense in a desert of rampant federal government waste, and one that should be emulated across the federal government. Taking a page from the laws of supply and demand, the RAC program aligns the incentives of the auditors to identify as much fraud as they can, while keeping in place careful reviews to stop any abuse of the process.\n\nThe RACs are already significantly hindered. The current rules allow them to review only 2 percent of payment claims from each hospital or provider. The news last week was that the Obama administration will be lowering that threshold further to 0.5 percent \u2014 yes, less than 1 percent \u2014 of all their payments.\n\nThis comes on top of recent actions like extending an enforcement \u201cmoratorium\u201d on a key billing loophole and other actions that have kept hospitals shielded from accountability.\n\nThe dirty secret of the medical profession is hospitals count on these fraudulent Medicare payments to pad their profits.\n\nBut while $3.7 billion the RACs found in 2013 is, by any measure, a significant amount of money, it\u2019s actually chump change compared to the actual amount of illegal payments going out the door.\n\nLast month, the Government Accountability Office testified that across the board, the federal government paid $125 billion in improper payments, up from $105 billion the year before. Medicare and Medicaid are roughly two-thirds of that total, or somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 billion per year.\n\nAs DeParle put it, \u201cyou are much more likely to end up where you want to be if you don\u2019t box us in.\u201d Obamacare cronies like the AHA are continuing to learn just how lucrative their alliance can be.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
