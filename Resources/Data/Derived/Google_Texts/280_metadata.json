Bit by bit, piece by piece. Our collective dialog is now filled with recrimination, retribution, and unhelpful reaction.\n\nThe political discussion at all levels -- from city councils to state legislatures to Washington -- is now harmful to our national interests and our national security.\n\nNo one is blameless here. Not even me.\n\nSo I am asking both sides of the aisle to stand down, to stay away from microphones and keyboards, to cool their frustration, and to think about what's truly best for the people who elected us.\n\nYou see, our country works best when there are two strong political parties.\n\nAnd our country can only work when lawmakers from both sides of the aisle know that deep down we are still a country of laws, of respect, of opportunity, and of peace.\n\nThe Republicans today are handicapped by a few in their party who are exploiting the rules to not just bring down the Affordable Care Act, but to impose the dire economic consequences of not raising our national debt limit.\n\nThe ACA is the law of the land. The debt limit must be raised so that we can meet our obligations to ourselves and to the people around the world who have lent us money. Arguing about this is like arguing about gravity; it does not change reality.\n\nIf Congress believes it is in the interest of the nation to spend less, let's have that debate. I welcome it. Let's have a budget that spends less.\n\nIf Congress believes that a law is job-killing, or anti-business, or unconstitutional, then let's have that debate too. Let's look at the facts, the numbers, and the decisions of the Supreme Court. And then make a decision and move on.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are not always going to agree on what's in the best interests of the nation. Even their internal views can change over time.\n\nFor example, just five decades ago Southern Democrats did not support the laws that made it possible for a black man to live free in his own country, or run for President of the United States. And history teaches that a century ago the only president who ever held a doctorate degree did not originally believe that women should even vote, never mind run for president.\n\nToday we look back on those fundamental social changes with deep appreciation for the strong leaders who made principled decisions about equality, justice, and opportunity for all of our people regardless of their gender, their skin color or religious beliefs.\n\nAnd we know that no party holds a monopoly on truth, aspiration, or commitment to our national cause.\n\nIn the election of 2008, my opponent instinctively deflected the opportunity to reduce our contest to something less than a difference on how we should solve our nation's problems. An honorable man with a lifetime of achievement and implacable courage, he will forever be remembered for that single moment when his innermost character shined.\n\nHe took the high road of integrity and not the dirt path of partisanship, demagoguery and hollow political gains. We need to remember what John McCain taught us that night in 2008.\n\nAnd we need to remember America needs both parties to be at their best.\n\nThe Republicans need some time and space to right their ship. It will not be an easy process. The shutdown is disrupting the lives of millions of Americans whose livelihoods depend on the business of governing, of teaching, of serving, and of protecting our great country.\n\nSo I encourage all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and Independents -- whether you were in favor of the Affordable Care Act or against it, whether you understand the debt limit or you don't, to seize this opportunity and to renew your commitment to our country.\n\nTake this time to understand why we have shut down and focus on the long view of our fundamental identity and character as a nation.\n\nA year from now nobody will remember what this quarter's GDP was. But a hundred years from now people will remember how we resolved this difference, how we used it to strengthen our system, and to bring both parties toward the center of our diverse interests.\n\nIf we solve this problem with a temporary measure we will be kicking yet another problem to our children.\n\nIf we exploit the wounds of loss born of principled stands we invite retribution, anger, and worse.\n\n\n\nBut if we use this crisis to strengthen the clear voices of reason and fairness, we can emerge as a more united country, a more competitive country, and a more prosperous and fair country.\n\nThis is what I want for my daughters, and this is my vision for the future.\n\nSo I ask you tonight, my fellow citizens: don't expect a quick solution, demand a good one.\n\nI have no illusion that one speech by one president is going to permanently change the harsh tone of our debate.\n\nBut in this time, in this place, it is a start. And it begins with me.\n\nIn the days that come, and in the generations that follow, there will be hard questions, questions of life and death, questions of justice and equality. The temptations of passion will rule and screaming ideology will reign supreme for a little while.\n\nBut we have a Constitution, a Congress, a Supreme Court, a president, and a free press.\n\nTogether we can extinguish the false fires of pride and prejudice, and expel the dark smoke that clouds our judgment.\n\nTogether we can rekindle the eternal flame that connects us to each other, to our guiding principles, and to our special and undeniably exceptional form of government.\n\nFollow Peter Levin on Twitter: www.twitter.com/@pllevin", "article_metadata": {"description": "My Fellow Americans,\n\nI want to speak to you about the crisis that faces our nation.  \n\nThe rhetoric between Republicans and Democrats has corroded t...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-16 09:37:08 -0400", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-levin/the-speech-i-wish-the-pre_b_4099319.html", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "My Fellow Americans,\n\nI want to speak to you about the crisis that faces our nation.  \n\nThe rhetoric between Republicans and Democrats has corroded t...", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "creator": "@pllevin", "description": "My Fellow Americans,\n\nI want to speak to you about the crisis that faces our nation.  \n\nThe rhetoric between Republicans and Democrats has corroded t...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-15 09:37:08 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4099319", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "obama speech,obamacare,Barack Obama,Government Shutdown", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "obama speech,obamacare,Barack Obama,Government Shutdown", "published_time": "2013-10-15 09:37:08 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-01-23 18:58:21 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1257\"", "article_summary": "In the days that come, and in the generations that follow, there will be hard questions, questions of life and death, questions of justice and equality.\nI have no illusion that one speech by one president is going to permanently change the harsh tone of our debate.\nBut we have a Constitution, a Congress, a Supreme Court, a president, and a free press.\nAnd history teaches that a century ago the only president who ever held a doctorate degree did not originally believe that women should even vote, never mind run for president.\nTogether we can extinguish the false fires of pride and prejudice, and expel the dark smoke that clouds our judgment."}
