Fransson of the School of Health Sciences at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, in email to Reuters Health.\n\nIn this new analysis, which pooled the results of 14 earlier studies from Europe, people with job strain had an increased risk of so-called ischemic stroke. Ischemic strokes happen when the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen \u2013 when, for example, the arteries are clogged.\n\nFransson, senior author Mika Kivim\u00e4ki of University College London, and their coauthors used data from 14 European studies between 1985 and 2008. Altogether, almost 200,000 adults filled out questionnaires about job strain. The studies lasted nine years on average.\n\nThose with a demanding job and little control over their work environments were categorized as having high \u2018job strain.\u2019 This accounted for 13 to 22 percent of people, depending on the original study.\n\nIn general, out of every 100,000 people in Europe, each year 115 men and 75 women have an ischemic stroke, earlier research has shown.\n\nIn the new study, the risk of ischemic stroke was about 24 percent higher for people in the job strain group than for the others.\n\nThere was no difference in risk of hemorrhagic stroke, another common type, in which a blood vessel ruptures and leaks blood into the brain.\n\nHigh blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and family history of stroke are all important risk factors, but this data was not available for most people in the new study.\n\nThe researchers accounted for basic socioeconomic status, which they used as a stand-in for other health risk factors, which lessened the increase in ischemic stroke risk for those with stressful jobs.\n\n\u201cThis present study is good contribution but of course the results present more questions,\u201d according to Susanna Toivanen, associate professor of sociology at the Center for Health Equity Studies in Stockholm, Sweden, who was not part of the new analysis.\n\nSome strokes may have a genetic component, which may be why the researchers did not find an association with hemorrhagic stroke, Toivanen told Reuters Health by phone.\n\n\u201cThe classification is not so exact and they don\u2019t discuss these different types of hemorrhagic stroke,\u201d she said.\n\nThis and other studies do not necessarily prove that stressful jobs cause strokes, Fransson noted.\n\n\u201cHowever, the association is plausible because stress might cause release of stress-related hormones, which in turn affect the metabolic, immunological and cardiovascular systems,\u201d she said. Ischemic stroke, like heart attack, is closely linked to atherosclerosis, the \u2018hardening of the arteries,\u2019 she said.\n\nIn any case, Fransson and Tovianen agreed that job strain is hard for an individual to change, even if it is increasing his risk for stroke.\n\n\u201cHere we have a very big issue because it\u2019s employers\u2019 responsibility to see that working conditions are healthy,\u201d Tovianen said. \u201cIndividuals can\u2019t control this.\u201d\n\nStress is only one of the potential factors at play with stroke risk, Fransson noted.\n\n\u201cThe recommendations are to keep track of your blood pressure, do not smoke, eat well, keep a healthy weight and exercise,\u201d Fransson said. \u201cAlong with that it may also be good to try to avoid long periods of stress, but we do not currently have evidence from interventions to prove this.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1yrpfw0 Stroke, online January 6, 2015.\n\n(By Kathryn Doyle)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stressful, jobs, may, increase, stroke, risk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who have demanding jobs and job strain are more likely to suffer one type of stroke, a review of previous studies suggests.", "title": "Stressful Jobs May Increase Stroke Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stressful-jobs-may-increase-stroke-risk-318374", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/18/stressful-jobs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who have demanding jobs and job strain are more likely to suffer one type of stroke, a review of previous studies suggests.", "title": "Stressful Jobs May Increase Stroke Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/stressful-jobs-may-increase-stroke-risk-318374", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/18/stressful-jobs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/18/stressful-jobs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-18T10:09:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-18T10:10:13-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who have demanding jobs and job strain are more likely to suffer one type of stroke, a review of previous studies suggests."}, "article_summary": "The researchers accounted for basic socioeconomic status, which they used as a stand-in for other health risk factors, which lessened the increase in ischemic stroke risk for those with stressful jobs.\n\u201cIndividuals can\u2019t control this.\u201dStress is only one of the potential factors at play with stroke risk, Fransson noted.\nJob strain has been linked to heart attack risk in the past, but not necessarily to stroke.\nIschemic stroke, like heart attack, is closely linked to atherosclerosis, the \u2018hardening of the arteries,\u2019 she said.\nIn this new analysis, which pooled the results of 14 earlier studies from Europe, people with job strain had an increased risk of so-called ischemic stroke."}
