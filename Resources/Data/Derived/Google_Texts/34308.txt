The hosts of a Chicago sports radio show took the opportunity to skewer their employers Thursday after learning on-air that the station is folding and they’re out of jobs.

Alex Quigley and Ben Finfer, of the radio show “Quigs and Finfer” on 87.7 The Game, learned mid-broadcast via Twitter that Tribune Media was getting rid of the station.

“We’re doing a live show here,” Mr. Finfer said on the air, Sporting News reported. “And to be told this way, it’s really a letdown. We’re getting screwed on this one. … We just found out on Twitter a half hour ago that the station is being taken off the air. We were not told about this ahead of time.”

Mr. Finfer learned from reporter Robert Feder who happened to tweet out the news during the show.

“We didn’t know anything about it,” Mr. Finfer said. “You would assume you tell the employees before the media. You assume they have the common courtesy to let some hosts on the air know that something might be coming so you don’t find out when you’re coming back from a commercial break. I’ve never heard of such a thing. I’ve heard of of some pretty crappy things in this business. You talk to radio people you’ll hear awful stories about the way they’ve been treated. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard anything like this.”

“I had respect for our bosses until about five minutes ago,” Mr. Finfer lamented. “They haven’t even come in the room yet to say anything … now we have to sit here and do a show for an hour and forty minutes? How are we supposed to do that? I never ever had management treat me this way.

“Are they even human?” he asked.
