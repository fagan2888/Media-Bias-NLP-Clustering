Tucson welcomed its first baby of 2016 at the Tucson Medical Center.

Baby Diana was born at 12:03 a.m. on New Year's Day, about 27 days before she was due.

Her mother, Sandra, said she began to feel contractions Thursday, Dec. 31, not expecting her daughter to arrive so soon.

"We were in preparations for New Year's Eve dinner and all of a sudden, the water breaks and she comes," Sandra, 24, said.

While Diana was born prematurely, both baby and mother are doing well. Diana weighs 5 pounds, 14 ounces and measures 18.5 inches long.

The birth did not come without its usual anxieties. Dianaâ€™s mother and father endured a two-hour drive from their home in Mexico to TMC. Several hours later, their newest daughter was born.

"We were very surprised, I don't know how to explain it, it's very exciting. We're still in shock about it." Sandra said.

Diana is the couple's fourth child. She has three other siblings - a 5-year-old sister, a 3-year-old brother and a 2-year-old sister.

The first six babies born in Tucson on Jan. 1, 2016 were delivered at TMC, according to TMC Communications Specialist Kimberly Romo.

Each year, about 5,500 to 6,000 babies are born at TMC.
