Political Party: Democrat\n\nRep. Jared Huffman faces three challengers in the June 7 primary election \u2014 one Republican, one Democrat and one independent.\n\nThe Republican in the race, Dale Mensing, a cashier at Shop Smart Foods in Redway, was Huffman\u2019s Republican opponent in 2014. In that election, Mensing, 57, garnered 54,400 votes to Huffman\u2019s 163,124 votes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for the purpose of defending the integrity of the Bill of Rights,\u201d Mensing said. \u201cAs soon as I did not win the election in 2014, I began my campaign for 2016. I continue to fight for the integrity of the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic challenger in the race is Erin Schrode of Mill Valley, who graduated three years ago with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social and cultural analysis from New York University. Schrode, 25, said she makes her living \u201cspeaking and consulting around environmental sustainability.\u201d She has carved out a niche for herself as a media spokeswoman for the Millennial generation. She also serves as an ecology correspondent with Fusion, a television cable and satellite channel featuring Hispanic news and satire.\n\nSchrode said she is running against Huffman even though she agrees with him on most of the issues.\n\n\u201cI believe that progressive female voices result in better policy and that young people are better equipped to lead the future of the state,\u201d Schrode said. \u201cThis is about representative democracy for me. We are in a country where 51 percent of our population is female and 35 percent is under age 30, and yet we\u2019ve never had a woman under 30 elected.\u201d\n\nThe third candidate challenging Huffman, Matthew Wookey of Petaluma, teaches history at San Jose Middle School in Novato. Wookey, 39, said he has never been a member of either the Democratic or the Republican party.\n\n\u201cAs a student and teacher of history, there are far too many transgressions by both of those parties to ever consider membership,\u201d Wookey said.\n\nWookey said this is the first time he has ever been a candidate for any office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my son\u2019s birth three years ago that made me decide that sitting on the sidelines as our Congress devolves is no longer an option,\u201d Wookey said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep hoping and waiting for effective leadership to sprout up on its own. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I didn\u2019t make the attempt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMensing sees the Bill of Rights under attack on a number of fronts. He said the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right of the people to keep and bear arms, is under constant attack.\n\n\u201cAlso the 10th Amendment makes it clear that if something isn\u2019t mentioned in the Constitution then it falls to the states. That certainly includes health care and education,\u201d Mensing said.\n\nAnd he believes the Affordable Care Act violates the First Amendment\u2019s protection of freedom of religion because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t allow a person to refrain from purchasing health care if it is against their religious faith.\u201d\n\nBut while Mensing is intent on preserving the traditions of the past, Schrode is advocating dramatic change. She said government needs to do more to prepare the populace for the 21st century workplace.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the sort of curriculums that we\u2019re putting into place for students,\u201d Schrode said. \u201cThis is a skilled economy towards which we are shifting, and we need to make that a priority of our education system.\u201d\n\nSchrode said, \u201cI have a unique perspective as a young voice, as a female voice, that better understands what is happening. My peer group is actively leading the shift in these industries for which we need to better prepare college graduates.\u201d\n\nPreparing the nation for the economy of the future is also one of Wookey\u2019s main issues.\n\n\u201cWe need to start working towards what an economy looks like in the United States when we could lose potentially half of all the jobs in this country to automation in the next 30 years,\u201d Wookey said. \u201cWhat does that economy look like? That is not even being discussed in Congress.\u201d\n\nAnd Wookey said, \u201cWe are running out of time to reduce the effects of climate change. We need to eliminate fossil fuel usage altogether. There is no reason we need to be continuing to use the fuels of the 19th century in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nWookey doesn\u2019t see anything getting done in Congress, however, until campaign finance limits are put in place, and he believes an amendment to the Constitution will be necessary for that to happen due to the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision.\n\nHuffman, who lives in San Rafael, represented the North Bay for six years in the California Assembly before being elected to Congress in 2012. Before going to Sacramento, Huffman served as a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Huffman, 52, serves on the Natural Resources and Budget Committees in the 113th Congress.\n\nAs of March 31, 2016, Huffman had received $622,335 in campaign contributions and had $523,320 in cash on hand. During the same period, Mensing received $3,405 in contributions and had $191 in cash on hand. Schrode received $2,251 in contributions and had $2,186 in cash on hand. Wookey raised no money.\n\nNevertheless, Huffman said, \u201cI take seriously every election, in part because I think elected officials benefit from contests, and because I\u2019m excited to tell my story to voters. I think we\u2019ve been doing a lot of great work in a very difficult political climate.\u201d\n\nHuffman said he attempts to combine idealism with pragmatism.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, I share the values of this district. My constituents see that in the things I fight for every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a 100 percent career pro-choice record, 100 percent pro-equality Civil Rights. I am one of the leaders in the Congress on protecting our environment and leading on climate change.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m also proud that I\u2019m not just drawing a bunch of partisan red lines and fighting and not getting anything done,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cI\u2019m continuously working to find common ground and get as much as I can in a difficult environment.\u201d\n\nAs examples, Huffman mentioned his work on legislation to allow Marin County to acquire surplus Coast Guard quarters in Point Reyes Station for affordable housing, a plan that addresses the future of ranches on National Park Service land in West Marin and a parking plan to address gridlock and parking adjacent to Muir Woods.\n\nAnd Huffman is excited about the possibility of Democrats regaining control of one or possibly both houses of Congress in November.\n\n\u201cI think the window of opportunity is here to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in a position of leadership in the next Congress to chair a major subcommittee on water, power and oceans. And to move forward a lot of legislation that wasn\u2019t able to get a hearing or vote under current management.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
