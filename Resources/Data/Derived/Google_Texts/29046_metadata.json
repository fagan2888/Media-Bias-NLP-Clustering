The problem was that even with half of the room cordoned off, it was still much too large. As a result, there were all sorts of issues.\n\nThe candidates sat at a table at the far end of the room in front of a decent crowd but even with cameras and press it only filled two-thirds of the area. This left plenty of room for people to filter in and out and cause a commotion which the moderator tried several times to quiet.\n\nIf it sounds like I\u2019m giving more style than substance it\u2019s because there wasn\u2019t much of the latter.\n\nThe Outsider\n\nThis point was epitomized by the presence of Joe Vodvarka. Vodvarka ran against Sen. Casey in the 2012 Democratic primary and Joe Sestak is currently trying to get him kicked off the ballot.\n\nVodvarka made it quite clear what kind of candidate he was from the jump when he called for the country to return to the Tariff Act of 1789. Apparently, he believes our trade policy should be based on legislation drafted before the invention of planes, trains or automobiles.\n\nClad in a brown leather jacket, Vodvarka mostly slumped in his chair when he wasn\u2019t speaking, as if he was as bored when he wasn\u2019t talking as the rest of the room was whenever he had the floor.\n\nThe small businessman was the most exhausting of candidates, one who worships the forefathers but doesn\u2019t actually know the history. For example, he brought out the well-worn anecdote that the Founders created the 2nd Amendment to protect the 1st Amendment. In fact, the Bill of Rights was solely compiled by James Madison and included two other proposed amendments at the top that didn\u2019t ultimately make the cut.\n\nThat fact likely won\u2019t affect a man whose opening statement asserted that \u201cfor the last six decades our country has been going down the drain.\u201d Almost all of his answers concerned his pledges to fight for \u201cfair trade\u201d and to represent the forgotten \u201cworking man\u201d (although he never mentioned the working women).\n\nThe Trio\n\nUnfortunately, there wasn\u2019t any interaction with the candidates and the questions were much broader than necessary. Instead of pointed questions, they were more like opportunities to recite their stump speech on the given issue.\n\nIt says a lot that even a candidate as unconventional as John Fetterman repeated many old lines. Nonetheless, not everyone is as big a political junkie as you or me, which means this may be the Senate hopefuls only chance to reach them before April 26th.\n\nTherefore, the trio all put forth their best efforts.\n\nKatie McGinty was the Happy Warrior, making an enthusiastic case for herself while hitting incumbent GOP Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\n\u201cWe need to insist that our Senator, Pat Toomey get to work,\u201d she said of the Senator\u2019s refusal to consider a Supreme Court Justice nominated by President Obama. \u201cDo your Constitutionally mandated job. When this President of the United States sends you a nominee, you are to advise, you are to consent and give that nominee a fair hearing.\u201d\n\nMcGinty, who has faced questions recently about her campaign, was unfazed by issues like single-payer healthcare and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\u201cBlack lives matter, period. I for the life of me don\u2019t understand why anyone feels dragged down by that recognition of the dignity of our neighbor,\u201d she explained. \u201cTo me we\u2019re all uplifted when any one of us is uplifted.\u201d\n\nFetterman, as is his wont, used some-deprecating humor.\n\n\u201cI am a giant fan of the Affordable Care Act, both literally as I\u2019m 6\u20198\u201d, and in reality too,\u201d he quipped at one point.\n\nThe Braddock Mayor embraced litmus tests for any Supreme Court nominee, specifically on campaign finance, abortion, climate change and LGBT rights.\n\nJoe Sestak, meanwhile, seemed a bit more intense than usual although that may have been a result of the audio distortion he caused by speaking too close to the mic (McGinty had the opposite problem which caused her voice to echo).\n\nIt was clearly evident that he is itching for a rematch with Toomey. For instance, the ex-Admiral recounted a visit then-Congressman Toomey made to his battleship then charged Toomey with repeatedly voting against veterans benefits.\n\nHe finished with an allusion to Lincoln in his closing statement, \u201cNever has a government of the people been so looked down upon by the people.\u201d\n\nWhile none of the candidates were pushed, they each got their fair chance to pitch themselves to Democratic voters who will decide in a month and a half which one they want as their party\u2019s nominee.\n\nMarch 7th, 2016 | Posted in Features, Front Page Stories, Senate, Top Stories | 5 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The event featured four, yes four, Democratic candidates.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-sen-candidates-deliver-their-pitch-at-winter-meeting-forum/73296/", "image": "http://www.politicspa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dem-Committee-Debate-300x224.png", "type": "article", "description": "The event featured four, yes four, Democratic candidates.", "title": "PA-Sen: Candidates Deliver Their Pitch at Winter Meeting Forum"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "pa-sen,senate,joe vodvarka,katie mcginty,john fetterman,joe sestak,committee meeting,democratic primary,2016 election", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PA-Sen: Candidates Deliver Their Pitch at Winter Meeting ForumWritten by Nick Field, Managing EditorThe four Democratic Senate candidates encountered a peculiar environment at the Democratic winter meeting on Friday.\nThe TrioUnfortunately, there wasn\u2019t any interaction with the candidates and the questions were much broader than necessary.\nThe small businessman was the most exhausting of candidates, one who worships the forefathers but doesn\u2019t actually know the history.\nIf it sounds like I\u2019m giving more style than substance it\u2019s because there wasn\u2019t much of the latter.\nFor instance, the ex-Admiral recounted a visit then-Congressman Toomey made to his battleship then charged Toomey with repeatedly voting against veterans benefits."}
