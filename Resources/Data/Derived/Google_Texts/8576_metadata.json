President Obama is back home in Chicago and heading to the polls early to vote for some old friends, Hillary Rodham Clinton joins Steven Spielberg for a Los Angeles fund-raiser, and opponents of the voter ID law in Texas have vowed to fight on.\n\nEbola may be contained so far in America, but the political impact of the virus is spreading \u200brapidly.\n\nDemocrats running in conservative states worry that the Obama administration\u2019s stumbling response to Ebola\u2019s arrival in the United States is generating anxiety among voters \u2014 and reinforcing the Republican message that the world is a frightening place and President Obama is not equipped to manage it.\n\n\u200bThat is why \u200bwe have seen Democratic candidates in \u200brecent days criticizing the administration\u2019s approach and forcefully urging the president to impose a ban on those traveling to the United States from West Africa.\n\n\u200bFederal health officials \u200bcontinue to \u200boppose the ban, saying it will do little to contain the disease\u200b, but the public overwhelmingly favors it, polls show\u200b.\n\nWith just two weeks to go before Election Day, \u200bsome Democrats are \u200bgrowing frustrated with what they see as the \u200badministration\u2019s mishandling of the crisis and \u200bwant to express their independence from Mr. Obama, who is deeply unpopular in states with pivotal Senate contests.\n\n\u201cArkansans have every right to be upset,\u201d said Senator Mark Pryor, who is among the most vulnerable of the Democratic incumbents. \u201cMistakes have been made where mistakes cannot be made.\u201d He appeared Friday with the head of Arkansas\u2019 health department at a news conference. Mr. Pryor and Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina called on Mr. Obama to institute the travel ban, as did Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate nominee in Georgia.\n\n\u200bIt was especially striking on Sunday to see so few Democrats, with the exception of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, vigorously defending the president\u2019s leadership on Ebola.\u200b\n\nDavid Axelrod, the former Obama adviser, \u200bvented on Twitter about the politicizing of the health crisis. \u201cCaustic mix: Public health issue, falling news ratings and pols in the final weeks of election = unconscionable hype and demagoguery.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Martin\n\nOne of the stranger theories about Ebola surfaced in the governor\u2019s debate on Sunday between the incumbent, Nathan Deal, and the Democratic challenger, Jason Carter.\n\nMr. Deal faced ridicule for days last week in offering what seems like an easy cure, readily available in every home.\n\n\u201cWater kills the Ebola virus,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nIt was a remark that quickly evolved into a punch line and which on Sunday he blamed on the state\u2019s public health commissioner.\n\nMr. Carter didn\u2019t let him off the hook, saying it \u201cwas inappropriate last week for the governor to say that water cures Ebola.\u201d\n\nThe Libertarian candidate in the debate, Andrew Hunt, a scientist and expert in nanotechnology, also did not spare his criticism of the governor. \u201cWe cannot have our leaders making such statements and then not retracting them ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is bad.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alan Blinder\n\nThere\u2019s more on the line for Democrats in the Senate race in Colorado than the re-election of Senator Mark Udall.\n\nA Udall victory is essential if the Democrats are going to keep control of the Senate map. But the party\u2019s reputation is at stake, too: Its members want to prove that the voter turnout model pioneered in Senator Michael Bennet\u2019s surprise victory in 2010 and in President Obama\u2019s ability to carry the state two years later still works in their favor.\n\nMr. Udall is falling behind his Republican opponent, Representative Cory Gardner. Two polls from last week show the senator trailing: CNN (four percentage points) and Quinnipiac (six points).\n\nThere was no let-up over the weekend for both men, with even an upbeat Mr. Gardner acknowledging, \u201cWe have a lot of hard work ahead of us.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Bennet has been reminding voters that he, too, was down in the polls in 2010 but managed to eke out a victory that he said amounted to a difference of about one vote per precinct statewide.\n\nDemocrats, after being outspent on television in recent days, say they will also have a significantly larger presence on television than Republican groups for the last two weeks of the campaign.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nPresident Obama will take advantage of early voting and cast his ballot in Illinois before attending a Democratic National Committee event.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton heads to Los Angeles for a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fund-raiser with a guest list that includes Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry is in Jakarta, Indonesia, for the inauguration of Joko Widodo, the president-elect.\n\nLabor Secretary Thomas E. Perez, a possible attorney general candidate, speaks about the economy at 1 p.m. at the National Press Club in Washington.\n\nGov. Chris Christie is on the trail, attending campaign events in New Jersey, Kansas and Colorado.\n\nBernard Sanders, the Vermont senator, is getting more national attention these days as he weighs a run for president.\n\nBut back at his old high school in Brooklyn, Mr. Sanders is not even the most famous political alumnus.\n\nOr the second-most.\u200b\n\nO\u200bther graduates of James Madison High School include Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom the school\u2019s mock courtroom is named and who graduated in 1950. New York\u2019s senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, got his diploma there in 1967, a year after Norm Coleman, the former Minnesota senator.\n\nIn 2008, Madison High placed Mr. Sanders on its crowded Wall of Distinction, alongside four Nobel Prize winners, famed historians, the radio personality \u201cCousin Brucie,\u201d and Judith Sheindlin, a.k.a. Judge Judy.\n\nThe socialist senator spent that day talking about his experience at Madison High and \u201chow it enabled him to get where he is today,\u201d said Jodie Cohen, the principal.\n\nShe called him a \u201cgentleman\u201d and \u201cdown-to-earth,\u201d but didn\u2019t recall thinking of him as a future presidential candidate. And even if he made it to the White House, Ms. Cohen didn\u2019t foresee the school\u2019s name being changed.\n\n\u201cBut I believe,\u201d she said, \u201cthat he would come back.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jason Horowitz\n\nThe Hill reports that no matter how hard they campaign, Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton don\u2019t seem to be helping the so-called Clinton Democrats facing re-election this year.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton understands the issues at stake this year far better than the candidates on the ballot, The Nation says.\n\nThe diminishing number of Southern evangelical voters is affecting this year\u2019s Senate races, The Atlantic reports.\n\nThe Texas Tribune provides the view from the ground after the Supreme Court\u2019s voter ID decision. The Austin Chronicle offers its own take.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that a Connecticut state Senate hopeful is learning what its like to run against a Kennedy.", "article_metadata": {"BN": "first-draft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2014/10/20", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "First Draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-10202014.jsonp", "robots": "noodp", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/20/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ebola may be contained so far in America, but the political impact of the virus is spreading \u200brapidly.\nBut back at his old high school in Brooklyn, Mr. Sanders is not even the most famous political alumnus.\nMr. Pryor and Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina called on Mr. Obama to institute the travel ban, as did Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate nominee in Georgia.\n\u201cArkansans have every right to be upset,\u201d said Senator Mark Pryor, who is among the most vulnerable of the Democratic incumbents.\nIt was a remark that quickly evolved into a punch line and which on Sunday he blamed on the state\u2019s public health commissioner."}
