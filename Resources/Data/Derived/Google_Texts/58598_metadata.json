(Sarah Rose/ Daily Record)\n\nTwenty teens answered Ca\u00f1on City Police Chief Paul Schultz's questions in unison.\n\nIt was followed by a round of applause.\n\nThe participants, ages 13-17, recited what they learned about the history of law enforcement during the Ca\u00f1on City Police Department Junior Law Enforcement Academy Graduation at Ca\u00f1on City High School auditorium.\n\nThe graduates received certificates Friday after the four-day event that included team building, a seat belt convincer, meeting the drug dog, learning about crime scene investigation, medical triage and other activities.\n\nLast year, Ca\u00f1on City Police Officer Robyn Vidmar started the event after reading about a Junior Law Enforcement Academy program in a school safety journal. She said she thought it would be a great way to build character in the community.\n\nShe said this year's Junior Law Enforcement Academy slogan is commitment through teamwork.\n\n\"I hope they learned that they can do anything they set their mind to and that they have a new found passion for teamwork \u2014 that you can do things together,\" she said. \"I think the generation now is a lot about me,me,me or I, I, I, and they don't understand that team is important.\"\n\nShe said one of the lessons she is teaching the teens is that it takes different types of people to make a team work.\n\n\"I enjoy watching kids encourage each other. ...Kids in the school system pick on kids for being different or just having different hobbies or different likes,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVidmar said the participants enjoy meeting new people at the academy.\n\n\"If you have a kid who isn't really able to make friends or really, really shy or new to the area, this is a good way to make a connection prior to the school year starting,\" she said.\n\nEighth-grade participant Joe Carochi said he enjoyed learning about law enforcement.\n\n\"I like how we know how policemen and women operate,\" he said.\n\nAlex Worley, a 10th grader, said his favorite part of the academy is the team building.\n\nCa\u00f1on City Police Chief Paul Schultz gives an award to eighth-grader Joe Carochi Friday for graduating Ca\u00f1on City Police Department's Junior Law Enforcement Academy program.

With a team, you're gonna do well,\" he said.\n\nVidmar said she is planning on another Junior Law Enforcement Academy next year.\n\n\"I'll run it each year if I can,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26176565/teens-participate-second-annual-canon-city-junior-law", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0718/20140718__19DRACADEMYw~4_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Roseroses@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Twenty teens answered Ca\u00f1on City Police Chief Paul Schultz's questions in unison.\n\n\nIt was followed by a round of applause.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:26176565:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-19T08:27:36-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26176565/teens-participate-second-annual-canon-city-junior-law", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0718/20140718__19DRACADEMYw~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Twenty teens answered Ca\u00f1on City Police Chief Paul Schultz's questions in unison.\n\n\nIt was followed by a round of applause.", "title": "Teens participate in the second annual Ca\u00f1on City Junior Law Enforcement Academy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Twenty teens answered Ca\u00f1on City Police Chief Paul Schultz's questions in unison.\n\n\nIt was followed by a round of applause.", "title": "Teens participate in the second annual Ca\u00f1on City Junior Law Enforcement Academy", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26176565/teens-participate-second-annual-canon-city-junior-law", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0718/20140718__19DRACADEMYw~2.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-19T08:27:36-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Teens participate in the second annual Ca\u00f1on City Junior Law Enforcement Academy", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0718/20140718__19DRACADEMYw~4.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "modificationDate": "2014-07-19T08:28:56-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-18T19:00:30-0600", "byline": "By Sarah Roseroses@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2014-07-19T08:30:34-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20d4\"", "article_summary": "Ca\u00f1on City Police Department Junior Law Enforcement Academy participants perform a team building exercise Wednesday at Ca\u00f1on City High School.\nThe participants, ages 13-17, recited what they learned about the history of law enforcement during the Ca\u00f1on City Police Department Junior Law Enforcement Academy Graduation at Ca\u00f1on City High School auditorium.\nCa\u00f1on City Police Chief Paul Schultz gives an award to eighth-grader Joe Carochi Friday for graduating Ca\u00f1on City Police Department's Junior Law Enforcement Academy program.\nVidmar said she is planning on another Junior Law Enforcement Academy next year.\nShe said this year's Junior Law Enforcement Academy slogan is commitment through teamwork."}
