But if the latest expos\u00e9 on Samuel Alito is any indicator, we can expect Samuel, Clarence, Antonin, John, and perhaps even Anthony to jump to the top of the list in the next few months.\n\nWhat gives with Alito? More like, \u201cWhere\u2019s Alito?\u201d In true fifth-grade fashion, the NYT\u2019s Linda Greenhouse reports that he\u2019s the least recognizable conservative of the Roberts bloc (\u201cI doubt if one American in a thousand could pick him out of a lineup.\u201d)\n\nWhat\u2019s Justice Alito thinking? Apparently he\u2019ll have to do better than letting down his (Philadelphia) sports-fan guard in an American Spectator profile. Justice Kagan allowed People Magazine to document her more human side, which included divulging SCOTUS\u2019s hazing of \u201cjunior\u201d justices. While not the stuff of Pulitzer Prizes, this was reporting at its best, a revealing look at how the youngest judge made friends on the court and learned to hunt with Justice Scalia. Justice Sotomayor perhaps did Alito and Kagan one better still when her budding friendship with J-Lo enabled Elle, US, and PopSugar to highlight the diva\u2019s shepherding of Justice Sotomayor\u2019s journey into the spotlight. Justice Scalia, however, may be the only justice with a voice that could give J-Lo the \u201cGoosies.\u201d\n\nAmerican Idol-status aside, the list of alarming charges Greenhouse emits later in her article includes Justice Alito\u2019s willingness to headline Federalist Society events; his consistent and reliable jurisprudence that has made him popular among conservatives; his willingness to hear legal challenges to public union coercion, but most dangerously of all, his predilection, in his own words, for paying deference to \u201cthe standards of the American people \u2014 not the standards of professional associations, which at best represent the views of a small professional elite.\u201d\n\nDoes anything of the sort amount to justices behaving badly?\n\nBut if judges are only partisans, as every mainstream media analysis of the Supreme Court today assumes, just how far should a free people be bound by their judgment? Progressives, despite their complaints, have dominated the Supreme Court for seventy-five years (since the \u201cswitch in time that saved nine\u201d), as the legal realism that early Progressive Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., pioneered went mainstream and then came to dominate the legal establishment. Offering a radical rejection of nature as the guiding source for legal judgment, Holmes left his readers (and, eventually, his nation) without any ultimate basis for resolving judicial questions: law was only the threats of the powerful reduced to technical language. That made judges mere partisans, for or against the ruling class judgment. When judges acted accordingly, the legal realists completed the circle by declaring that judges had always been partisans, but were now free from the obligation to pretend otherwise.\n\nBut if judges are only partisans, as every mainstream media analysis of the Supreme Court today assumes, just how far should a free people be bound by their judgment? Abraham Lincoln\u2019s response to the Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) decision provides a helpful answer. There are two parts to every court decision: the judgment and the reasoning. The rule of law demands, Lincoln argued, that the particular judgment of the case be respected by all. Dred Scott lost his case, much to Lincoln\u2019s regret, but that part of the matter had to stand, once the final appeal to the Supreme Court was exhausted. The reasoning of the Court majority, rife with historical and interpretive errors and partisan judgments, however, need not be regarded as conclusive by the president, the Congress, or the people at large.\n\nWhat was true of the reasoning in the grossly unjust Dred Scott ruling is true of every instance of Holmes-inspired, living Constitution jurisprudence since.\n\nFederalist 78, even more than Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s monumental Marbury v. Madison (1803) decision, establishes the moral and legal basis for judicial review, the power of the courts to declare legislative and executive acts unconstitutional.\n\nIn the context of justifying the \u201cgood behavior\u201d tenure of judges, Alexander Hamilton argues that judicial independence is especially critical under \u201ca limited Constitution.\u201d He explains:\n\nBy a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.\n\nHamilton defends this claim in the paragraphs that follow, demonstrating that the case for judicial review depends upon a series of essential premises denied by Progressivism.\n\nThe first objection he considers is one grounded in a mistaken understanding of the separation of powers. If the courts can declare laws unconstitutional, doesn\u2019t that make them superior to the Congress? No, answers Hamilton. It only means that both are subject to the Constitution\u2013which is to say that \u201cthe power of the people is superior to both.\u201d Why prefer the people\u2019s Constitution to the legislator\u2019s law: because of the \u201cnature and the reason of the thing,\u201d Hamilton argues\u2013the \u201cprior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority.\u201d\n\nWe are accustomed to hearing that the government is meant to serve the people\u2013that the people are the master of our system. We are accustomed to hearing that the government is meant to serve the people\u2013that the people are the master of our system. It is critical, however, to note where and how that mastery is expressed: in the Constitution, not the latest opinion polls or election results. There is no room in Hamilton\u2019s system for a Progressive-style \u201cliving Constitution,\u201d evolving with changes of elite or popular opinion to suit the prejudices of the day. The Constitution would cease to be a \u201cprior act\u201d if it were not fixed in meaning by those who established it, the people who participated in the ratification process in 1787 and 1788.\n\nBut it is the \u201cnature and reason of the thing,\u201d more than Hamilton\u2019s particular verbiage, that excludes a Progressive justification of judicial review. The Constitution itself is an instance of the natural right of a people, proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence, \u201cto institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness,\u201d through the preservation of their \u201cunalienable rights.\u201d Such a government, the Declaration further proclaims, derives \u201cits just powers from the consent of the governed.\u201d That\u2019s why the judiciary can\u2019t turn a blind eye to an unconstitutional act by the legislature or executive: to do so would make it a party to injustice and, in a self-defeating way, undermine its claim to its otherwise legitimate political authority.\n\nJudicial review, then, is a necessary part of a constitutional system built upon the self-evident truths of the Declaration of Independence. But Progressive legal philosophy has no place for those or any other such truths and can therefore find no justification for annulling state or federal laws in the founders\u2019 defense of judicial review. What then?\n\nMystic appeals to History or the \u201cmystery of human life\u201d might fill the rhetorical hole in the Progressive argument, but there is no substitute reasoning for judicial review within the bounds of republican principles. An appeal beyond the Constitution to Justice itself, defended, at least in part, by Hamilton in Federalist 78, still requires a natural order of things\u2013exactly what Holmes and his acolytes deny. Let the Progressive judges, then, truly be realists and tell us: we judge so, because we wish it so\u2013and we believe we have the power to make our wishes stick.\n\nHamilton anticipated such an abuse of judicial review, the exercise of \u201cwill\u201d in the place of \u201cjudgment,\u201d but considered it an unavoidable danger, short of abolishing judicial power, and politically improbable, given the weakness of the judiciary.\n\nProgressivism has made the improbable not just probable, but necessary, so long as it controls five Supreme Court votes and enough political power to vindicate them.\n\nWhat does that mean for the three most important cases of the upcoming term?\n\nA Progressive\u2019s dream scenario would amount to the Roberts Court:\n\nUpholding the Obama Administration\u2019s decision to provide health care subsidies to individuals in states that did not set up their own Obamacare \u201cexchange,\u201d contrary to the \u201cmanifest tenor\u201d of the law\u2013ruling, in essence, that the executive branch can spend money the legislative branch has not appropriated, contrary to the \u201cmanifest tenor\u201d of the Constitution.\n\nPositing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, which would thereby strike down bans still in effect in fourteen states and provide another victory for the assailants of the natural order of things.\n\nGetting back into the business of regulating political speech by upholding a Florida campaign finance law particular to judicial campaigns.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 07:20:32 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Let\u2019s hope the Roberts Court chooses constitutional judgment over Progressive will.", "title": "Progressivism or Judicial Review: Choose One", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/supremecourt.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-15T07:46:54+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/01/12/progressivism-or-judicial-review-choose-one/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Let\u2019s hope the Roberts Court chooses constitutional judgment over Progressive will.", "title": "Progressivism or Judicial Review: Choose One", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/supremecourt.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "The Federalist Today", "tag": "Alexander Hamilton,Constitution,Dred Scott,Linda Greenhouse,Marbury v.
