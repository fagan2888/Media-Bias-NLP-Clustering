A few weeks before, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by youth plaintiffs who also seek to protect the same planet from the same threat, also for the benefit of future generations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo one disputes that Obama has become spokesperson for climate action. However, his DOJ continues to defend the permitting of fossil fuel development, transport and export. All that permitting contributes to the pumping of additional carbon concentrations in our atmosphere. Meanwhile, our government subsidizes that same industry that is poisoning our planet. And now, Obama is even having the DOJ fight a lawsuit seeking a climate recovery plan.\n\nThe lawsuit that the DOJ wants dismissed was brought by twenty-one youth plaintiffs, and supported by Oregon non-profit Our Children\u2019s Trust. Retired NASA climate scientist James Hansen is also a co-plaintiff, listed as \u201cguardian for Future Generations.\u201d Hansen, who also serves as plaintiffs\u2019 expert, warned in a declaration that humanity faces \u201cnearly certainty of eventual sea level rise of at least . . . 5-9 m[eters] if fossil fuel emissions continue on a business-as-usual course.\u201d Hansen\u2019s declaration cites a paper he and sixteen other climate scientists published in July.\n\nThe reaction from the Obama administration may surprise you. For instance, in its motion to dismiss, the DOJ argued:\n\n\u201cThe Court should \u2026reject Plaintiffs\u2019 claim to a fundamental constitutional right to be free of CO2 emissions.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ explained that courts shouldn\u2019t have a say in climate change:\n\n\u201cMaking environmental policy always involves balancing competing social, political, and economic forces. The Constitution envisions that such balancing is distinctly the province of the Executive and Legislative branches of government, not that of federal courts.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ seemed appalled that the lawsuit sought:\n\n\"[A national climate policy] that would require wholesale changes to energy production and consumption in this country,\"\n\nFor many, Obama was elected for his promise to use the presidency to protect future generations from the climate change-induced rise of sea levels. He has talked and tweeted about it over seven years now.\n\nThings we know: Failing to act now on #climate change would betray our children and future generations. #ActOnClimate\n\n\u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 27, 2013\n\nIn May, in a statement declaring June \u201cGreat Outdoors Month,\" Obama affirmed his obligation to protect against climate change for future generations:\n\n\u201cWe must work to safeguard nature's splendor for generations to come. Climate change threatens our lands and waters, as well as the health and well-being of future generations.\u201d\n\nContrast Obama\u2019s mixed messages on climate change with congruent messages taken in a similar context in 2011. Following Obama\u2019s \u201cevolution\u201d on gay marriage, Attorney General Eric Holder Eric H. HolderEric Holder to headline fundraiser for Clinton The Hill's 12:30 Report The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE notified Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerHouse GOP faces dilemma on spending bills Overnight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return MORE (R-Ohio) that Obama had instructed the DOJ not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA. Holder explained how he and Obama had determined that DOMA violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s equal protection component, and noted how \u201crecent evolutions\u201d in \u201ccommunity practices and attitudes\u201d played roles. Post-Paris, it would be difficult to ignore the recent evolutions in attitudes when it comes to stopping global climate change.\n\nIf Obama sincerely wants to combat climate change, why hasn\u2019t he relieved his DOJ from defending against this lawsuit, as he did with DOMA? The worst that could happen would be the youth prevail, forcing him to prepare and implement a plan to phase out fossil fuel emissions, which wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s not like others aren\u2019t willing to step forward to fight the youth plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit. The fossil fuel industry has motioned to intervene, complaining the government may not be able to adequately represent its interest. The youth filed their opposition to that intervention on November 30.\n\nMorrison is a freelance journalist, former law clerk with Our Children\u2019s Trust and Whittier Law School J.D. candidate with Environmental Law Concentration (expected graduation May 2016).", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The lawsuit that the DOJ wants dismissed was brought by twenty-one youth plaintiffs.", "description": "The lawsuit that the DOJ wants dismissed was brought by twenty-one youth plaintiffs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The lawsuit that the DOJ wants dismissed was brought by twenty-one youth plaintiffs.", "title": "DOJ fights youth lawsuit seeking climate recovery plan", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/263952-doj-fights-youth-lawsuit-seeking-climate-recovery-plan", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/263952-doj-fights-youth-lawsuit-seeking-climate-recovery-plan", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-22T14:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Curtis Morrison", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-22T14:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Barack Obama, John Boehner, Eric Holder, Boehner,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/263952-doj-fights-youth-lawsuit-seeking-climate-recovery-plan", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The lawsuit that the DOJ wants dismissed was brought by twenty-one youth plaintiffs.", "card": "summary", "title": "DOJ fights youth lawsuit seeking climate recovery plan"}, "dcterms.title": "DOJ fights youth lawsuit seeking climate recovery plan"}, "article_summary": "Finally, it\u2019s not like others aren\u2019t willing to step forward to fight the youth plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit.\nAnd now, Obama is even having the DOJ fight a lawsuit seeking a climate recovery plan.\nPost-Paris, it would be difficult to ignore the recent evolutions in attitudes when it comes to stopping global climate change.\nThe lawsuit that the DOJ wants dismissed was brought by twenty-one youth plaintiffs, and supported by Oregon non-profit Our Children\u2019s Trust.\nThings we know: Failing to act now on #climate change would betray our children and future generations."}
