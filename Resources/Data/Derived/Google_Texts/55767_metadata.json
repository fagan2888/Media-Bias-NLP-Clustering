Therapeutic foster homes are specially trained to handle kids with special medical, emotional or behavioral needs.\n\nClick here: http://www.okdhs.org/programsandservices/foster/", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Oklahoma's child welfare system received the best report card since a class action lawsuit three years ago that required reform.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30273365/new-report-on-dhs-pinnacle-plan-shows-improvements", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9026321_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Oklahoma's child welfare system received the best report card since a class action lawsuit three years ago that required reform.", "title": "New Report On DHS' Pinnacle Plan Shows Improvements"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9026321_G.jpg", "description": "Oklahoma's child welfare system received the best report card since a class action lawsuit three years ago that required reform.", "card": "summary", "title": "New Report On DHS' Pinnacle Plan Shows Improvements"}, "wnreadableurl": "new-report-on-dhs-pinnacle-plan-shows-improvements", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/10/15", "KEYWORDS": "DHS, child, custody, foster home, report card, lawsuit, reform, pinnacle plan, system, welfare, abuse, okc, news 9, kwtv, tulsa", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS18", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "DHS, child, custody, foster home, report card, lawsuit, reform, pinnacle plan, system, welfare, abuse, okc, news 9, kwtv, tulsa"}, "article_summary": "DHS was also able to recruit 177 more foster homes over the last year, but it needs more, especially therapeutic foster homes.\nTherapeutic foster homes are specially trained to handle kids with special medical, emotional or behavioral needs.\nDHS had to make major changes since settling that case and a new report shows strides in two major areas.\nOklahoma's child welfare system received the best report card since a class action lawsuit three years ago that required reform.\nThe report showed the most good marks DHS has ever received from the experts who monitor the agency\u2019s progress, but the report also showed that children in state custody are still being abused at the same rate, or worse."}
