Once a user is marked as such, online acquaintances can rest assured without attempting to make contact in the midst of a tragedy.\n\nBut Facebook is taking heat for waiting until last week to use \u201cSafety Check\u201d in the event of a terrorist attack.\n\nFacebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg is acknowledging the concerns of users who questioned why it hadn\u2019t been made available after other attacks, including the bombing in Lebanon one day earlier.\n\n\u201cUntil [Friday], our policy was only to activate Safety Check for natural disasters. We just changed this and now plan to activate Safety Check for more human disasters going forward as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg explained.\n\n\u201cWe care about all people equally, and we will work hard to help people suffering in as many of these situations as we can,\u201d he said.\n\nIn downtown Paris and abroad, social media users reached out to friends and family in the wake of Friday\u2019s attacks in hopes of confirming their safety as terrorists conducted strikes at a half-dozen sites. Within 10 hours of the attacks, Twitter users posted more than one million messages with the hashtag #PorteOuverte and variations thereof to open their doors to those affected, CNN reported.\n\nFacebook started experimenting with its Safety Check feature in 2011, and within the last year had deployed it following earthquakes in locales including Afghanistan, Chile and Nepal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facebook rolled out its \"Safety Check\" feature amid Friday's terrorist attacks in Paris, France to users to access a service previously enabled exclusively following natural disasters -- criticism notwithstanding.", "Author": "Andrew Blake", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Facebook rolled out its \u201cSafety Check\u201d feature amid Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris, France to users to access a service previously enabled exclusively following natural disasters \u2014 criticism notwithstanding.", "title": "Facebook deploys \u2018Safety Check\u2019 during Paris attacks, plans for future \u2018human disasters\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/16/facebook-deploys-safety-check-during-paris-attacks/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/04/150c6a2f92d5bf31860f6a706700eae9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/04/150c6a2f92d5bf31860f6a706700eae9.jpg", "title": "Facebook deploys \u2018Safety Check\u2019 during Paris attacks, plan", "description": "Facebook rolled out its \"Safety Check\" feature amid Friday's terrorist attacks in Paris, France to users to access a service previously enabled exclusively following natural disasters -- criticism not", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Technology Internet, Disaster Accident, Facebook"}, "article_summary": "Facebook rolled out its \u201cSafety Check\u201d feature amid Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris \u2014 the first time the service was deployed outside of natural disasters.\nWe just changed this and now plan to activate Safety Check for more human disasters going forward as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg explained.\n\u201cUntil [Friday], our policy was only to activate Safety Check for natural disasters.\nFacebook started experimenting with its Safety Check feature in 2011, and within the last year had deployed it following earthquakes in locales including Afghanistan, Chile and Nepal.\nBut Facebook is taking heat for waiting until last week to use \u201cSafety Check\u201d in the event of a terrorist attack."}
