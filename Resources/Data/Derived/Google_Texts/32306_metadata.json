On the one hand, there was Rex Ryan, of all people, introducing Trump. Ryan, who some regard as a blowhard, a braggart of sorts, talked a lot, but delivered little. He vowed to have the No. 1 defense, get into the playoffs and build a \u201cbully.\u201d\n\nRyan was followed by Trump, who ironically has been characterized by many as a bully against women and immigrants and as someone who talks a lot about what he is going to do without offering any specifics or proof about how to do it. He is going to replace Obamacare with \u201csomething wonderful.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but when I saw all those folks applauding deliriously like a chorus of barking seals to every remark Trump made, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of how much it looked like some of Ryan\u2019s news conferences from last football season.\n\nMichael R.
