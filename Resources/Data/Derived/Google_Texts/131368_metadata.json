Remember the fear about \u201cdeath panels\u201d and the \u201cgovernment takeover of health care\u201d and the way Obamacare would sound the death knell for personal freedom and the American way of life?\n\nCharles Koch, the tea-party billionaire who helped finance it all, as good as admits in his new book that it was a load of crap.\n\nIn \u201cGood Profit,\u201d his new management guide and libertarian political manifesto, Koch laments the rise of collectivism and socialism and holds out New Zealand, Switzerland, Singapore and Hong Kong as the models of economic freedom that the rest of us should follow instead.\n\nWhat he somehow forgets to mention? All four of those libertarian paradises have universal health-care systems that are as \u201csocialized\u201d as Obamacare or more so.\n\nOops.\n\nThe real menace to our democracy is simple stupidity.\n\nIn other words, Koch \u2014 the so-called Wallet of the Tea Party and a devotee of extreme anarcho-capitalism \u2014 is saying that universal health care is compatible with economic and personal freedom after all.\n\nSo much for that \u201cgovernment takeover.\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t it just warm your heart to look back at all that Astroturf hysteria back in 2009, when ordinary John and Jane Does were warned that universal health care would lead to fascism and the elderly were terrified with talk that Nancy Pelosi and Barney Frank were plotting to have them put down?\n\nGood times.\n\nKoch is not a moderate figure like Mitt Romney, either. This is a man who idolizes novelist Ayn Rand and Austrian economists Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, the heroes of the libertarian right. He has been a powerful and influential figure in financing right-wing economic thinking since the 1970s.\n\nAlso read: A frustrated Koch brother decides it\u2019s time to \u2018spout off\u2019\n\n\u201cGood Profit\u201d is a very political book. In it, Koch makes the case for libertarianism again and again. \u201cFree societies, which are based on respect for what people value, enjoy the greatest prosperity,\u201d he writes. And he singles out the four overseas countries mentioned as his shining examples of how societies should be run.\n\n\u201cProsperous countries such as New Zealand and Switzerland, while not perfect, secure individual rights \u2014 including property rights \u2014 for all,\u201d he writes. Hong Kong and Singapore are even better when it comes to economic freedom. They \u201coffer people the greatest economic freedom compared to all the other countries in the world,\u201d he writes, though he adds that they are less good on social and political freedom.\n\nNowhere does he tell his readers that Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and New Zealand manage to combine all this freedom with universal health care through \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d\n\nNaturally the structures vary. Switzerland, for example, has a system that is basically a model for Obamacare. Everyone is required by law to take out private health insurance, which is regulated by the government and subsidized for those who can\u2019t easily afford it. In Singapore, the compulsory insurance system is public. Hong Kong and New Zealand provide universal coverage through public health-care systems. In all four countries, health-care costs and provisions are heavily regulated.\n\nYet, miraculously, freedom hasn\u2019t merely survived this assault in those four countries \u2014 it has prospered. Even according to one of the Koch brothers.\n\nThe depressing thing about this is that it is yet another illustration of the real menace to our democracy these days. It\u2019s neither the rich nor the poor, conservatives nor liberals nor communists, tycoons, unions or any form of \u201cism\u201d you care to mention.\n\nIt\u2019s simple stupidity. People who can\u2019t be bothered to think, ask questions or do their homework. People who are happy to let other people do their thinking for them, go along with the crowd, and get their half-baked ideas reinforced on Twitter and cable TV. That goes for right-wing stupidity, left-wing stupidity and every other kind of stupidity.\n\nThe stupid will be the patsies of the cynical. Always have, always will. But you don\u2019t always catch the cynical admitting it.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The Tea Party supporter praises countries with forms of socialized medicine, writes Brett Arends.", "creator": "@BrettArends", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BY193_koch_c_MG_20140403072855.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Brett Arends", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The Tea Party supporter praises countries with forms of socialized medicine, writes Brett Arends.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/charles-koch-oops-praises-obamacare-without-knowing-it-2015-10-28", "author": "Brett Arends", "parsely-title": "Charles Koch \u2014 oops! \u2014 praises Obamacare without knowing it", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-28T16:05:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The Tea Party supporter praises countries with forms of socialized medicine, writes Brett Arends.", "title": "Charles Koch \u2014 oops! \u2014 praises Obamacare without knowing it", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/charles-koch-oops-praises-obamacare-without-knowing-it-2015-10-28", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BY193_koch_c_MG_20140403072855.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BY193_koch_c_MG_20140403072855.jpg"}, "article.id": "CFE3FDC0-7CC0-11E5-86DE-F2349B929E2E", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Bloomberg Charles Koch fails to tell readers in \u2018Good Profit\u2019 that four countries he praises \u2014 Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and New Zealand \u2014 combine freedom with universal health care.\nCharles Koch, the tea-party billionaire who helped finance it all, as good as admits in his new book that it was a load of crap.\nAll four of those libertarian paradises have universal health-care systems that are as \u201csocialized\u201d as Obamacare or more so.\nHong Kong and New Zealand provide universal coverage through public health-care systems.\nHong Kong and Singapore are even better when it comes to economic freedom."}
