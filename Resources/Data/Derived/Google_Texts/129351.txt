The nation’s top Republican in Congress confided in a leftist comedienne this weekend, confessing to her, “I am Obama’s best friend.”

House Speaker John Boehner, 64, reportedly put Joy Behar, 71, former co-host of “The View,” into a headlock while visiting the Hamptons and campaigning for Lee Zeldin, a Republican member of the New York state Senate.

According to the New York Post, Behar “tackled” Boehner at the Almond restaurant in East Hampton and insisted that he “stop obstructing President Obama.”

“Liberal comedienne and talk show host Behar tackled Boehner – whom she dubbed ‘the Weeper of the House’ after his waterworks in his famous ’60 Minutes’ interview – at Almond Restaurant in East Hampton on Saturday,” the Post reported. “Boehner – who was out in the Hamptons to campaign against Long Island Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop and attended a fundraiser for Lee Zeldin at the home of developer Joe Farrell – then jokingly put Behar in a headlock. The moment was captured in a photo which appeared in Monday’s Page Six.”

Behar, who had been eating dinner with her husband, Steve Janowitz, and actor Ron Rifkin, told the Post, “Boehner was eating at Almond with four Secret Service agents in suits. Compared to everyone else in casual Hamptons attire, they really stood out. They looked like they were going to a wake.”

The Post stated that Behar “baited Boehner as he got up from his table to leave the restaurant.”

Behar said, “I couldn’t resist having some fun. I jumped up and told him to stop obstructing President Obama. I am sick of all this deadlock. Strangely, he replied, ‘I am Obama’s best friend.’ Then he put his arm around my neck and it looked like he was going to strangle me.”

The liberal comedienne added, “Boehner had quite a grip. For a guy who cries a lot, he’s physically quite strong.”
