Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton [official website] believes [press release] that the ACA's providers fee forces states to pay an unconstitutional tax and threatens to cut Medicaid for Texas citizens. Paxton stated in regards to his issues with the ACA fee, \"[t]his threat to cut Medicaid funding to Texans unless the state continues to pay hundreds of millions in taxes to Washington amounts to the very 'gun to the head' the Supreme Court warned about in earlier rulings on Obamacare.\" The state of Texas claims that the ACA has unconstitutionally taxed its citizens $84 million in 2013 and around $120 million to date. Paxton believes the tax is illegal citing that under the US Constitution state officials must \"clearly understand\" the conditions a State agrees to when receiving federal funds.\n\nComprehensive health care reform [JURIST backgrounder] was passed by Congress in March 2010, and recent legal challenges have reinvigorated debate.
