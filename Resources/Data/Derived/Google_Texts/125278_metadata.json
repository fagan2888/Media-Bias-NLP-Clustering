Our insufficient attention to detail. Our lazy search for shortcuts.\n\nOur defensive unwillingness to take ourselves seriously. And our consequent inability to appreciate the art and artists we're privileged to watch.\n\nThe opening-night audience initially responded to this cri de coeur with laughter. Iannone herself hams it up in the beginning, wryly alive to the comic irony inherent in the disconnect between Callas' expansive vision and all the ways life continually falls short.\n\nBut even as this Callas flirts with the diva stereotype and knowingly winks at us \u2014 repeatedly breaking the fourth wall while tacitly recognizing she can appear overbearing \u2014 it's clear that she isn't joking when she envisions performance as a battle.\n\nThe audience, she tells one of the three students we meet, is an \"enemy\" that needs to be brought to its knees, putting aside distractions like playbills and personal electronic devices so that it can pay proper homage to the alchemy taking place on stage.\n\nIn a collaboration involving Milwaukee Opera Theatre and Carroll University, co-directors Jill Anna Ponasik and James Zager work with very good singers \u2014 sopranos Melissa Cardamone and Alicia Berneche as well as tenor Edson Melendez \u2014 to stage three iterations of such magical transformation.\n\nUnder Callas' tough love all three singers grow before our eyes, escaping their overly imprisoning selves by surrendering to the music.\n\nIannone's Callas movingly sketches the same dramatic arc, taking us beyond lengthy digressions involving Callas and her love life \u2014 what's least interesting or convincing about this show \u2014 to the transcendence she achieved through her art.\n\nAccompanied by Callas' recorded voice, Iannone goes all out, passionately embodying Amina's final aria from Callas' legendary 1955 \"La Sonnambula\"; later, Iannone will relive the letter scene as Callas' Lady Macbeth.\n\nThe students who had been singing these roles fade into the background; Chris Guse's projections, abetted by Eric Appleton's lighting design, transport us to La Scala itself, alongside a singer who had actually quit the stage years earlier after losing her voice.\n\nIn such thrilling and sacred moments, Iannone does what this courageous, go-for-broke artist regularly does: She vanquishes time itself \u2014 much as Callas insisted on eliminating all obstacles standing between her and her music.\n\nThat music endures much as this show will live on in the mind \u2014 an intimation of immortality that validates all titanic struggles to make great art.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n\"Master Class\" continues through Aug. 24 at the Broadway Theatre Center, 158 N.
