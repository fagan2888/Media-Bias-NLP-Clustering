Chance, 53, of Lake Wales, was taken to the Columbia County Jail and will be brought back to face a Polk County judge in the next few days, authorities said.\n\nPolice had been looking for the suspect, since Tuesday, when surveillance cameras recorded a man beating, gagging and robbing Elonka\u2019s Fashions employee Carol Sheeth.\n\nThe attacker also stole Sheeth\u2019s 2009 white Chevrolet Impala.\n\nSheeth was severely injured, but is continuing to recover and improving, police said.\n\nHer son, Doug Sleeth, and daughter, Cindy Grondin, appeared with Winter Haven Police Chief Charles Bird on Saturday to discuss the case with the media.\n\nChance has family in the St. Petersburg area, and he was last spotted there at 66th Street North and 54th Avenue North early Friday afternoon, police said. Winter Haven police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began concentrating on the area.\n\nOn Saturday morning, investigators received a tip that Chance was at the Crystal Inn near the intersection. Authorities showed Chance\u2019s photo to motel managers, who confirmed that Chance checked into the motel the night before, police said.\n\nEntry was made into the room, but Chance had already left, police said. A receipt from a nearby McDonald\u2019s and alcohol was found inside the room, police said.\n\nAuthorities said they went to the McDonald\u2019s, where surveillance video of the drive-thru from Friday night showed Chance driving Sheeth\u2019s car.\n\n\u201cA close look at the car revealed Chance had placed a Sunoco sticker on the bumper in an obvious attempt to alter the original vehicle description and also placed a stolen tag on the vehicle,\u201d police spokeswoman Jamie Brown said.\n\nThe stolen tag was from a vehicle in St. Petersburg, police said.\n\nThe Florida Highway Patrol was alerted to look for the vehicle and stolen tag, Brown said. Troopers spotted Chance in the Impala on Interstate 75 just north of Gainesville and began following him, Brown said.\n\nChance exited at the truck stop, where he was taken into custody by troopers, officials said.\n\nWinter Haven detectives were headed to Columbia County to interview Chance.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 20 Sep 2014 13:14:53 -0400", "Description": "Percy Chance, the suspect in the attack of an 80-year-old store clerk, was arrested Saturday as he drove the victim\u2019s car into a truck stop near Lake City, Winter Haven police said.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Percy Chance, the suspect in the attack of an 80-year-old store clerk, was arrested Saturday as he drove the victim\u2019s car into a truck stop near Lake City, Winter Haven police said.", "title": "Suspect in attack on 80-year-old nabbed near Lake City", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/police-capture-suspect-in-beating-of-80-year-old-store-clerk-20140920/", "image": {"width": 616, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140920/ARTICLE/140929941/EP/1/2/EP-140929941.jpg", "height": 371}, "updated_time": "2014-09-20T16:37:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Percy Chance, the suspect in the attack of an 80-year-old store clerk, was arrested Saturday as he drove the victim\u2019s car into a truck stop near Lake City, Winter Haven police said.", "title": "Suspect in attack on 80-year-old nabbed near Lake City", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140920/ARTICLE/140929941/AR/0/AR-140929941.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-20T13:14:53Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-20T16:37:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02c1\"", "article_summary": "The suspect in the attack of an 80-year-old store clerk was arrested Saturday as he drove the victim\u2019s car into a truck stop near Lake City, Winter Haven police said.\nThe Florida Highway Patrol was alerted to look for the vehicle and stolen tag, Brown said.\nWinter Haven police and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began concentrating on the area.\nHer son, Doug Sleeth, and daughter, Cindy Grondin, appeared with Winter Haven Police Chief Charles Bird on Saturday to discuss the case with the media.\nWinter Haven detectives were headed to Columbia County to interview Chance."}
