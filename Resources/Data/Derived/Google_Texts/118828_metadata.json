A newly released survey by the Pew Research Center asked nearly 2,000 adults by telephone to weigh in on their beliefs, including the hot-button issue of physician-assisted suicide.\n\nThe results: 66 percent think a patient should be allowed to stop treatment and die under some circumstances, while 31 percent disagree, saying health professionals should do everything possible to save a patient\u2019s life. The \u201cdo everything\u201d group has increased 9 percent since 2005 and 16 percent since 1990.\n\nPew asked respondents about their general views on end-of-life treatment, especially if they saw themselves as the patient. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n57 percent would ask to stop treatment if they were in great pain with no hope of improvement.\n\n52 percent would say \u201cenough\u201d if they had an incurable disease and were totally dependent on others.\n\n35 percent would instruct their doctors to do everything to keep them alive even if they were in pain and weren\u2019t going to improve.\n\n62 percent believe people have a moral right to end their own lives if they\u2019re in pain and aren\u2019t going to get better; 56 percent agree if an incurable disease is involved, while 38 percent say suicide is acceptable when \u201cliving has become a burden\u201d\n\nRespondents were nearly equally divided on physician-assisted suicide, with 47 percent in favor and 49 percent disapproving of laws to allow a doctor to prescribe lethal drug doses to a terminally ill patient.\n\nWhat do experts think? I asked Dr. VJ Periyakoil, director of the Palliative Care Education and Training Program at Stanford University School of Medicine. Here\u2019s her take, not just from the Pew study findings but also from her daily experience working with very ill patients:\n\nThe position on end of life you take for yourself in a non-crisis situation may be different when you\u2019re the patient. Your position may also change as your condition changes or you take the opinions of your loved ones (spouse, children, dearest friends) into your treatment decisions. The conversation shouldn\u2019t just be focused on end of life but more on the quality of life. The family, not just the patient, should be part of the conversation from early on and they should be treated as a caregiving unit. That means end-of-life decisions need to be shared. As our country becomes more culturally diverse, with more people of different ethnicities aging and dying, there are rituals, taboos and cultural differences that have an impact on end-of-life decisions. Physicians must understand these and know what matters to patients and families.\n\nPhoto: aydinynr/istockphoto\n\nSally Abrahms writes about caregiving, housing and age 50+ work.
