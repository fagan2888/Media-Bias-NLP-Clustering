Her son Jack Tracy, 3, also shovels dirt at her left side. Tracy is credited with creating the heart of the artistic community at the Feed and Grain. ( Jenny Sparks )\n\nAnna Maddocks is in love with her dream home, even if it doesn't yet have a foundation or walls -- and even though the first ceremonial dirt to build it moved only Friday.\n\nBut as Maddocks, a visual artist, and her fianc\u00e9 Lander Hultin, watched a dozen colorful shovels break ground at the future Artspace Loveland Arts Campus, she couldn't imagine a better fit for their future than what will be an artist-focused affordable housing complex at the Feed and Grain.\n\n\"I'm really involved in the art communities in Fort Collins, Loveland and Denver, and Loveland is so supportive and positive,\" Maddocks said. \"I don't see anybody else who has a realistic view on what it takes to live as an artist.\"\n\nComing alive\n\nMore than 100 people gathered around the 120-year-old Feed and Grain building at 130 W. Third St. on Friday afternoon for the groundbreaking ceremony. Some, like Maddocks and Hultin, hope to live at the Artspace campus when construction is complete in about a year. Others were with the Minnesota-based nonprofit Artspace Projects Inc., elated, as senior vice president of consulting and strategic partnerships Wendy Holmes said, to see a project of many firsts join Artspace's 35 properties across the U.S.\n\nAlso in the crowd were those who saved the historic Feed and Grain from the wrecking ball almost a decade ago and those who have supported the vision ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's a culmination of dreams,\" said Priscilla FitzMaurice, one of the first board members of Novo Restoration, which fought to save the Feed and Grain.\n\nErin McLaughlin, founder of NoVo Restoration, said the mission in 2006 was to save the building and for it to be a symbol of redemption and rebirth in the community. There had been many ideas about how to do that and what to do on the property, and Artspace got involved in 2008.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to just seeing it alive and people gathering and using it and loving it,\" McLaughlin said.\n\nA home for artists\n\nAn $8.9 million project, Artspace Loveland will include the apartments, stabilization of the Feed and Grain building and landscaped outdoor community space to connect the two buildings together as one arts campus.\n\nThe Feed and Grain building, which is home to ongoing art exhibits led by artistic director Megan Tracy, still needs more than $600,000 for a full restoration project that aims to transform it into a site for artist studios and creative businesses. Artspace local liaison Felicia Harmon said that attention will turn toward the building now that construction on the artist complex is about to begin.\n\n\"I'm just excited for all the people who had the vision early on,\" Harmon said. \"They deserve the credit for having that clarity that our history is as important as\n\nour future.\"\n\nProject funding sources include the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, Loveland Housing Authority, the Erion Foundation, the Loveland Community Fund of the Community Foundation of Northern Colorado, the Bruce and Muriel Hatch Family Fund and more.\n\nThe Loveland Housing Authority will manage the apartments, and executive director Sam Betters said that the artist-focused project makes perfect sense for a city steeped in the arts.\n\n\"Sometimes we think that Artspace chooses a community, but I think it's the community that chose Artspace, because of what this community represents,\" he said.\n\nThe 30 residential units at the Artspace Loveland will be reserved for individuals or families with household income that's less than 60 percent of the area median income for Larimer County. A committee of local artists will then interview applicants to make sure the artist component is there too, which can include anything from musicians to writers to textile and graphic artists.\n\nIt's the kind of place that Mayor Cecil Gutierrez, a musician, and his wife Kay, a visual artist, would have liked to call home when they were first starting out in Loveland.\n\n\"Because we are artists, we know that especially early on in your career there may be some struggling in making ends meet,\" he said.\n\nJessica Maher can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 516, or maherj@reporter-herald.com.
