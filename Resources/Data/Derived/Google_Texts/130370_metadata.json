In 2012, after California providers won various court orders against the state for Medicaid cuts, the Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling and decided that subsequent federal approval of the rate reductions left the lawsuit no longer relevant.\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to rule on whether private parties could sue over the Medicaid rates \u2014 although Chief Justice John Roberts did hint of his opinion that the supremacy clause on its own isn\u2019t enough to empower providers with litigation rights.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/key-medicaid-case-moves-supreme-court", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/supreme%20court.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case brought by Idaho providers over an issue that has split many lower courts: whether Medicaid providers have a Constitutional right to sue states to enforce Medicaid funding regulations.", "title": "Key Medicaid case moves to Supreme Court"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/supreme%20court.jpg"}, "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case brought by Idaho providers over an issue that has split many lower courts: whether Medicaid providers have a Constitutional right to sue states to enforce Medicaid funding regulations.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Key Medicaid case moves to Supreme Court"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In the quest for sound Medicaid reimbursement, healthcare provider advocates may soon have another tool to compel state governments.&#13; The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case brought by Idaho providers over an issue that has split many lower courts: whether Medicaid providers have a Constitutional right to sue states to enforce Medicaid funding regulations.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "This will actually be the second time the Supreme Court hears a case concerning Medicaid reimbursement.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case brought by Idaho providers over an issue that has split many lower courts: whether Medicaid providers have a Constitutional right to sue states to enforce Medicaid funding regulations.\nIn the quest for sound Medicaid reimbursement, healthcare provider advocates may soon have another tool to compel state governments.\nIn 2012, after California providers won various court orders against the state for Medicaid cuts, the Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling and decided that subsequent federal approval of the rate reductions left the lawsuit no longer relevant.\nThe Idaho state government, under order from the appeals court, increased reimbursements by another $12 million in 2013."}
