Hamilton. The facility, which Reinarz said essentially serves as a family practice clinic, is now accepting patients.\n\n\"It's open to everybody,\" Reinarz said.\n\nHealth Delivery received a $1,083,333 New Access Point grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year, which has helped to fund the creation of the new health center. The grant was a part of an additional $169 million in Affordable Care Act funding used to support 266 new health center sites in 46 states across the country.\n\nWhile Health Delivery does have a focus on providing care to the underserved and uninsured, Reinarz said it is important for the public to understand their facilities are open to everyone, including those with private insurance.\n\nFor those currently without health insurance, Reinarz said Health Delivery is happy to help those individuals navigate the Affordable Care Act online marketplace.\n\n\"If you don't have insurance, we will help you get insurance or get Medicaid, if you qualify,\" he said.\n\nThose who do not want to obtain insurance also are welcome. Fees for those patients are paid on a sliding income scale available at the Health Delivery website.\n\nServices available directly at the Old Town clinic include primary care, lab work, acute care and well-child visits. Reinarz explained that patients in need of additional health services not provided at the new facility will receive referrals to other Health Delivery facilities in the region.\n\nBased in Saginaw, Health Delivery has more than 25 facilities throughout the Great Lakes Bay Region, in areas including Bay City, Owosso, Imlay City and West Branch.\n\n\"We like to say we are the best kept secret in the Great Lakes Bay Region and we don't want to be a secret anymore.\"\n\nOne of the healthcare provider's most well-known facilities, according to Reinarz, is Janes Street Academic Community Health Center, located at 1522 Janes in Saginaw. The new facility is similar, but on a smaller scale.\n\nNew patients can contact the clinic at 989-921-5372.\n\n\"Call the clinic or stop by and become a patient,\" Reinarz said. \"We go from there.\"\n\nAccording a statement from Reinarz, part of the mission of Health Delivery is to deal with poor health outcomes in the local population. Those outcomes can include high infant mortality, low levels of immunization compliance, untreated instances of mental health and high rates of death linked to preventable causes.\n\n\"We truly want quality healthcare for everyone,\" the statement reads.\n\nFor more information visit healthdelivery.org or the Health Delivery Facebook page.\n\n\u2014 Jessica Shepherd is a reporter with MLive/The Saginaw News.
