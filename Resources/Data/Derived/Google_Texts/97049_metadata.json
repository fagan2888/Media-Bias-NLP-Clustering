The reason? Granite Broadcasting, that owns WEEK, wants a better deal from Mediacom and the old contract expired at the end of May.\n\nInstead of continuing to negotiate, Granite took the blackout route, zapping WEEK along with stations in Fort Wayne, Ind. and Duluth, Minn.\n\nBlackouts \u2013 like the one executed by Granite Broadcasting to make Mediacom\u2019s cable customers aware of the dispute between the two parties \u2013 is becoming a frequently-used negotiating tool when it comes to settling differences between station owners and distributors.\n\n\u201cThe Granite spokesperson and contract negotiator wants to paint the picture that Mediacom is not being reasonable \u2013 but there are hundreds of these deals we\u2019ve successfully completed in past two years, and not one of those set a price as high as Granite\u2019s,\u201d said Mediacom spokeswoman Phyllis Peters, noting that Mediacom recently sent a letter to subscribers pointing out that it wasn\u2019t the cable company\u2019s decision to pull the plug on the station.\n\nThe blackout involving Granite and Mediacom is the seventh U.S. TV blackout caused by retransmission fee disputes this year. There have been 395 blackouts since 2010, according to the American Television Alliance.\n\n\u2022 107 blackouts in 2014\n\n\u2022 127 blackouts in 2013\n\n\u2022 91 blackouts in 2012\n\n\u2022 51 blackouts in 2011\n\n\u2022 12 blackouts in 2010\n\n\u201cBy setting a price that doubles the money Granite receives each month from our customers, WEEK will become the most expensive broadcast channels in all of the 1,500 communities across the 22 states that Mediacom serves. That means our customers in Metamora or Chillicothe would be paying more for that NBC channel than our customers anywhere else in the country \u2013 yet getting the same programming (other than the local news segments),\u201d said Peters.\n\nI asked Peters why doesn\u2019t Mediacom just substitute another NBC station for WEEK in this market so that viewers don\u2019t miss special network events like Stanley Cup finals or the running of the Belmont that might see the rare Triple Crown spectacle.\n\nThe answer is FCC regulations prevent it. \u201cWe are required to deliver the signals for the specific station within the boundary of the defined market area\u2013these boundaries follow county lines,\u201d she said.\n\nReminder: for those folks within antenna range of WEEK in central Illinois, you can go back to getting the station over the air if there are special programs on NBC (ice hockey, horse racing, etc.) but that may not be an option for Mediacom viewers in more far-flung locations.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417961115?at=1000lkC&ct=sb-pjstar", "og": {"site_name": "Minding Business", "description": "When June arrived last week, Mediacom cable viewers in central Illinois lost WEEK-TV Channel 25, the NBC affiliate in this market.
