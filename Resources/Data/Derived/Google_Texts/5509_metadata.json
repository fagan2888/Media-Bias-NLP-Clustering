Users post anonymously to the image board, which is split into categories, including Japanese culture, interests and adult.\n\nPoole intended 4chan to be a place for discussing Japanese comics and anime. However, over time, the site gained a reputation for online abuse, trolling and harassment, thanks to its strictly anonymous format. It devolved from mostly family-friendly memes, such as the popular Lolcats and Rickrolling, to more objectionable content involving racism, homophobia and action against women.\n\nYou Might Also Enjoy: Google Car Accident | Self-Drives into Bus\n\n4chan gained even more notoriety when hackers posted to the site private and nude photos and videos of more than 100 female celebrities, including Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence. Poole attempted to crack down on these illegal activities but got push back from 4chan loyalists. He finally left the site in early 2015.\n\nLast fall, 4chan was sold for an undisclosed amount to Hiroyuko Nishimura, a Japanese web entrepreneur who created 2channel, the inspiration for Poole\u2019s site.\n\nMany speculate that Poole\u2019s move to Google is intended to help the Internet giant tackle social media against its big rival Facebook. In November, Google pulled back on its multi-year effort to make Google+ the digital connection between all of Google\u2019s services, such as Gmail, YouTube and its web browser Chrome.\n\nWhile Google certainly was well aware of misgivings about 4chan, it also knows the site was successful in creating memes that broke into the mainstream of web users and the media. On his Google+ page, Bradley Horowitz, Google\u2019s vice president of streams, photos and sharing, said he is \u2018\u2018thrilled\u2019\u2019 Poole is joining the team.\n\nGet Free Updates!
