Stern decided to conduct his own investigation by separately interviewing each guest, and what he said he found was not that the guests were cheated by Obamacare, but rather that they had tried very little, if at all, to participate in the ACA.\n\nStern accused the Fox News host of using \"fake evidence\" to \"exploit people\u2019s ignorance and falsely point to imaginary boogeymen,\" deeming it all a part of the \"Fox News lie machine.\"\n\nPaul Cox and his wife Michelle, for example, appeared on the show claiming that their construction business has been hit hard because of Obamacare, giving them no choice but to significantly cut employee hours. Stern noted that Obamacare has no effect on any business with less than 50 employees.\n\n\"In our brief conversation on the phone, Paul revealed that he has only four employees. Why the cutback on his workforce? \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been forced to do so, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve chosen to do so. I have to deal with increased costs.\u201d What costs? And how, I asked him, is any of it due to Obamacare? There was a long pause, after which he said he\u2019d call me back. He never did.\"\n\nThe two other couples interviewed by Stern both claimed that the new policies offered by Obamacare would cost them considerably more than their previous insurance rates. After doing his own search on the Obamacare exchange website based on the couples' circumstances, Stern found that this was just not true.\n\n\n\n\"I don\u2019t doubt that these six individuals believe that Obamacare is a disaster; but none of them had even visited the insurance exchange,\" Stern wrote. \"Hannity is not entitled to point to Paul\u2019s behavior as an \u201cObamacare train wreck story\u201d and maintain any credibility that he might have as a journalist.\"\n\nTwitter, as usual, was up in arms over Stern's findings:\n\nWow.
