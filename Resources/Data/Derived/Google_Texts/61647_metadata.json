Paul Ryan questions Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on \"Affordable Care Act Implementation\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 29, 2013. (REUTERS/Yuri Gripas)\n\n4398458\n\nOpponents of the Export-Import Bank are increasingly confident its days are numbered.\n\nPaul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who will chair the House Ways and Means Committee in the next Congress, indicated on Tuesday that the GOP\u2019s new majority would be more likely to shut down the taxpayer-backed ank than the current Congress.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Ryan \u201csaid he backed fellow Republican Jeb Hensarling\u2019s push to close the export lender,\u201d once its current charter expires in June. Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, has been among Ex-Im\u2019s fiercest critics in recent months, along with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nFor most of the bank\u2019s history, Congress routinely passed multi-year re-authorizations with bipartisan support, but growing opposition among conservatives led to a contentious debate when Ex-Im\u2019s charter last came up for renewal in September, with many opponents labeling it a form of crony capitalism. (RELATED: Is the Export-Import Bank Crony Capitalism?)\n\nA compromise was ultimately forged by attaching a short-term extension of Ex-Im to a continuing resolution that both averted a government shutdown and authorized the use of force against ISIS.\n\nAlthough that deal kept the bank from closing, Hensarling and other have expressed confidence that Congress will allow its charter to expire once the issue is disentangled from other, more pressing concerns. (RELATED: Conservatives Split on Export-Import Bank)\n\nRyan seemed to share that outlook, saying, \u201cWe should reform welfare for businesses,\u201d and predicting that, \u201cWith the new majority coming in, I think we\u2019ll have more people\u2026subscribing to the view I just mentioned.\u201d\n\nHowever, other prominent politicians, including some Republicans, are pushing back by touting their own support for Ex-Im.

Kelly Ayotte, for instance, \u201cwill join Ex-Im Chairman Fred Hochberg on Friday\u2026to meet with New Hampshire exporters,\u201d and talk up the benefits of Ex-Im financing, PoliticalNews.me reported on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Export-Import Bank helps small and medium sized businesses in New Hampshire compete in the global marketplace and create jobs, while returning billions of dollars to the Treasury for deficit reduction,\u201d Ayotte said, pointing out that Ex-Im financing has enabled New Hampshire exporters \u201cto grow their businesses and create more jobs by exporting goods and services overseas.\u201d\n\nDuring a speech earlier this month, Hillary Clinton likewise revealed that she is \u201ca very strong supporter of Ex-Im,\u201d calling it \u201ca tool for us to be competitive in order to support our businesses exporting,\u201d according to Politico.\n\nClinton dismissed \u201cthose who wish to end the role of the Export-Import Bank,\u201d saying their opposition is \u201cnot based on evidence, it\u2019s based on ideology.\u201d\n\nFollow Peter Fricke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
