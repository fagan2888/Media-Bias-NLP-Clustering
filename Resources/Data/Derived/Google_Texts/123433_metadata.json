The L.A. health system expects to have doctors at Runway in specialties such as dermatology, cardiology, orthopedics and OB/GYN.\n\nCedars-Sinai, which will be an anchor tenant, is slated to open the new regional office by the end of next year. When finished, the mixed-use development on 11 acres off Jefferson Boulevard will include 420 residential units in addition to 220,000-square feet of retail space and the offices occupied by Cedars.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to deliver high-quality services for our current patients and welcoming new referrals when these offices open next year,\u201d said Cedars-Sinai Health System Chief Executive Thomas M. Priselac in a statement.\n\nPerched above a Whole Foods Market, Starbucks and CVS/Pharmacy, the health system\u2019s new office is the latest example of medical providers increasingly seeking space in retail centers, trying to situate themselves in locations their patients already frequent. While Cedars has taken a hybrid approach, setting up medical offices above retail shops, other providers have opened practices inside actual storefront.\n\nExamples include USC Keck Medicine\u2019s comprehensive primary care clinic at 830 S. Flower St. in downtown Los Angeles and UCLA Health System\u2019s new primary care practice that will launch at the new Village at Westfield Topanga in Woodland Hills next month. (Read more about the trend in this week\u2019s Business Journal.)\n\nRetail space became more of an option for medical providers after the recession freed up such real estate and Obamacare introduced a slew of newly insured patients into the marketplace. Commercial landlords have found large medical providers appealing partly for their good credit and the influx of daytime traffic their patients bring.\n\nIndeed, Lincoln Property Co. saw Cedars as an attractive tenant rounding out the variety of services available at Runway.\n\n\u201cThis addition will further strengthen Runway\u2019s reputation as a center for all of our community\u2019s needs, from best-in-class dining and entertainment to world-class healthcare services,\u201d said Lincoln Property Company Executive Vice President David Binswanger in a statement.\n\nTodd Doney and Chris Isola of CBRE Group Inc. represented Cedars-Sinai in the transaction. Kent Handleman and Robert Hook led the negotiations for Lincoln Property Company. Financial terms of the lease were not disclosed.\n\nRead the Business Journal\u2019s previous coverage of the Runway Playa Vista here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cedars-Sinai will be checking into three floors of medical office space above the new Runway retail center in Playa Vista."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05ba\"", "article_summary": "Monday, August 3, 2015Cedars-Sinai will be checking into three floors of medical office space above the new Runway retail center in Playa Vista.\nIndeed, Lincoln Property Co. saw Cedars as an attractive tenant rounding out the variety of services available at Runway.\nWhen finished, the mixed-use development on 11 acres off Jefferson Boulevard will include 420 residential units in addition to 220,000-square feet of retail space and the offices occupied by Cedars.\nKent Handleman and Robert Hook led the negotiations for Lincoln Property Company.\nCommercial landlords have found large medical providers appealing partly for their good credit and the influx of daytime traffic their patients bring."}
