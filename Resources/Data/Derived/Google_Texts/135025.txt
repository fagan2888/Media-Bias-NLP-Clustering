With a Supreme Court decision on Obamacare looming, concerned citizens trekked to the U.S. Capitol yesterday with flags and signs in hand to protest President Obama’s health care law.

The Alexandria (Va.) Tea Party teamed up with the group Virginians for Quality Healthcare to voice disapproval with congressional exemptions to the Affordable Care Act and government subsidies provided by Obamacare.

The Supreme Court could decide the King v. Burwell case as early as today. At stake are Affordable Care Act subsidies for individuals in the 34 states that didn’t set up a state insurance exchange.

According to Chris Wright, an executive with the Alexandria Tea Party, multiple tea party rallies occurred across the nation. Here is what a few of them had to say.

“They make is so incredibly expensive that nobody can afford it. Then they turn around and say, ‘Oh, but we’ll help you.’ That’s insidious. That’s a dependency machine, and it’s deliberate,” Wright said.
