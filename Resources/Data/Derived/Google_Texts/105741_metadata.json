Cancer patients are two and a half times more likely to file for bankruptcy than other Americans, according to a study by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\n\nThe study found that young people are particularly vulnerable to bankruptcy, especially if they're in the midst of paying off student, house and car loans.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is that we\u2019re now creating an economic disparity between who can afford treatment and who can\u2019t,\u201d says Scott Ramsey, a physician and health economist at Fred Hutchinson who led the study. Ramsey adds that sometimes patients have stopped therapy because they can\u2019t afford it \u2013 and that can be a fatal decision. Leukemia patients who stop taking Gleevec, for example, risk recurrence, which can lead to death.\n\nThe heart of the problem, Ramsey adds, is that cancer drugs in the U.S. come with a hefty price tag, with some costing about $10,000 a month, and copays that are 20 to 30 percent of that. So treating cancer costs about 20 percent more than other chronic diseases \u2013 and its costs are increasing the most, Ramsey says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge burden right now, especially if patients lose their ability to work. They can lose their insurance if they have to go on disability, and often family members have to take care of them. It\u2019s a pretty burdensome disease.\u201d\n\n[Read: How to be a Good Patient Wingman.]\n\nAdvanced Cancer Most Expensive\n\nWhile you cannot put a price tag on someone\u2019s life, it probably comes at little surprise that the most expensive drugs are those that treat the most advanced forms of cancer \u2013 precisely when people are closest to the risk of death. Provenge, a drug for advanced prostate cancer, costs $100,000 for one treatment, with a copay of 20 percent, says Joanne Lynn, director of the Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness at the Altarum Institute in the District of Columbia. Lynn adds that the drug has been shown to extend life an average of two months.\n\n\u201cI think a number of people would say that the gamble of two extra months is just not worth it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of question we should be willing to ask.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Lynn advises physicians to be \u201cbrutally honest\u201d with patients about what they are getting. \u201cVery often the treatment for advanced cancer is very expensive for a little bit of gain,\u201d she adds. \u201cA lot of patients would say that it really isn\u2019t worth it to have an extra month or two and leave [their] family in financial ruin.\u201d\n\nHowever, some treatments for advanced cancers are also mainly used for symptom control and are fairly inexpensive, Lynn adds. \u201cA patient could really press [their physician] for the less expensive drug.\u201d\n\nLynn adds that it\u2019s important to consider what life stage you're at when deciding how much you're willing to spend for your care. If you are younger and in your prime, then you might do everything to foot the bill. But, as Lynn points out, \u201cMore and more people are getting these illnesses later in life, so it really does depend on what else you are facing.\u201d If, for example, you also have dementia and a bad heart, then putting you through chemotherapy might not make sense.\n\n[Read: A Patient's Guide to Second Opinions.]\n\nKnow Your Options\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for patients to do is be their own advocate to minimize the costs of care,\u201d Ramsey says. \u201cMost patients don\u2019t realize they have choices.\u201d For example, it would cost lung cancer patients thousands of dollars less to take the standard therapy \u2013 Paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy \u2013 than taking newer, targeted drugs such as Tarceva or Crizotinib. While in certain patients the new therapies might be more effective, patients who follow that course \u201cshould be prepared for a very high bill. It\u2019s a decision that\u2019s going to cost thousands and thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nRamsey also suggests that patients get a financial counselor to help them manage their bills and other expenses when they're newly diagnosed. While such counselors might not be available at all cancer centers, they're at most large cancer centers \u2013 so take advantage of them. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people realize what type of burden they are going to face, so they don\u2019t make adjustments to their finances.\u201d\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act may improve the situation somewhat, simply by extending insurance to previously uninsured people, \u201cit\u2019s not going to make the problem go away, because some of the plans under the ACA are pretty bare bones,\u201d Ramsey says.\n\nAnd the ACA won\u2019t do anything to actually lower the rising costs of the drugs themselves, he adds. While most European countries have price checks \u2013 and health care agencies can negotiate with drug companies to lower prices \u2013 the U.S. lacks such a system. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a system that does not put the brakes on prices. Insurers are responding by turning the burden to patients,\" Ramsey says. \"Now the cost is getting so that the whole structure of insurance is breaking down.\u201d\n\n[Read: How to Help Teens Cope With a Parent's Cancer.]\n\nHelp Is Out There\n\nStill, patients should not despair. There are resources to help them, adds Kristen Reineke, chief marketing officer at CancerInsurance.com, which provides insurance policies to people who have not been diagnosed with cancer in the past decade \u2013 but who are at high risk of a diagnosis because of family history or genetic predisposition. People who sign onto the insurance end up paying a minimal monthly deductible \u2013 say $15 to $20 \u2013 which offsets costs incurred if illness does strike.\n\nReineke also outlines a number of other resources available for cancer patients, such as Angel Airline Samaritans, which offers free flights to cancer patients who need to travel for treatments, and cleaning services provided by the nonprofit organization Cleaning for a Reason.\n\nThe HealthWell Foundation, a nonprofit that provides assistance to insured patients, can also help people pay for their medications, since that\u2019s where many people fall through the cracks, Reineke says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people focus on their recovery and not have to worry about the financial burden,\u201d she adds. \u201cThese types of resources could help alleviate some of that stress.\u201d\n\n[Read: Free Services for Women With Breast Cancer.]\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"We all need a small amount of sodium to keep our bodies working properly \u2013 but too much is linked to heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "How to cope with the cost of your treatments on top of your diagnosis.", "zone": "patientadvice/articles", "author": "Kristine Crane", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "How to cope with the cost of your treatments on top of your diagnosis.", "title": "Can You Afford Your Cancer Care?", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2014/08/06/can-you-afford-your-cancer-care", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/40/26/ffb5e5394c058a4f16d59599dfe6/140529-doctorpatient-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Can You Afford Your Cancer Care? - US News", "description": "How to cope with the cost of your treatments on top of your diagnosis.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],patient advice,Affordable Care Act,patients,cancer,health,doctors,health care,patient-advice-include [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],healthandwellness [Consumer Advice],Kristine Crane", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z2l61m", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-08-06", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-08-06"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/ae191ff/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F40%2F26%2Fffb5e5394c058a4f16d59599dfe6%2Fresizes%2F500%2F140529-doctorpatient-stock.jpg", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "patients, patient advice, hospitals , physicians, cancer, lung cancer, insurance, ACA"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7c4\"", "article_summary": "Reineke also outlines a number of other resources available for cancer patients, such as Angel Airline Samaritans, which offers free flights to cancer patients who need to travel for treatments, and cleaning services provided by the nonprofit organization Cleaning for a Reason.\nCancer patients are two and a half times more likely to file for bankruptcy than other Americans, according to a study by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.\nRamsey adds that sometimes patients have stopped therapy because they can\u2019t afford it \u2013 and that can be a fatal decision.\nSo treating cancer costs about 20 percent more than other chronic diseases \u2013 and its costs are increasing the most, Ramsey says.\nWhile such counselors might not be available at all cancer centers, they're at most large cancer centers \u2013 so take advantage of them."}
