William M. Stanley Jr. (R-Franklin), passed the House of Delegates in a landslide 95-2 vote, after the Senate had approved the measure by 33-5. This despite the fact that PETA hired lobbyist Stephen Haner to try to kill the bill.\n\nAccording to the Virginia Department of Agriculture, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) took in 3,017 animals in 2014. Of these, a mere 162 were adopted, while 2455 were \u201ceuthanized.\u201d This rate of 81% was not exceptional, since in prior years the rate has risen above 90%. A website documenting PETA\u2019s killing record claims that the organization has euthanized more than 33,000 animals since 1998.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just impossible to consider that they are making an attempt to adopt out animals with that failure record,\u201d said Debra Griggs of the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies. She said that the new law codifies what \u201call shelters in Virginia are already doing \u2014 except for PETA.\u201d\n\nPETA\u2019s shelter, in fact, stands alone in its draconian policy, with a kill rate more than three times that of other shelters in the state. Combined, Virginia animal shelters took in 210,599 animals last year, of which only 49,302\u2014less than 25%\u2014were euthanized.\n\nEven some of PETA\u2019s would-be supporters find the figures troubling. Professor Paul Waldau of Canisius College, an animal rights scholar, justifies PETA\u2019s higher-than-average kill rate because they take in animals that no one else wants.\n\nStill, PETA\u2019s euthanasia rate \u201cis such an ugly number,\u201d Waldau said. \u201cWe should also be welcoming people who say, \u2018Can\u2019t we find a way to kill fewer?\u2019\u201d\n\nPETA is often its own worst enemy and has repeatedly shot itself in the foot, claiming in its own literature that the best thing for many animals is \u201ca peaceful release,\u201d while simultaneously complaining of \u201can overpopulation crisis\u201d among animals.\n\nSuch pronouncements have led many to wonder whether the organization really cares about animal welfare at all or just uses the platform for other agendas.\n\n\u201cThey make no effort to get them adopted, and they are wild now at the suggestion that maybe they should even try,\u201d Robin Starr of the Richmond SPCA wrote in a blog post. \u201cThey want no impediment to their killing. \u2026 PETA is a huge, rich, mean bully.\u201d\n\nPETA\u2019s Norfolk euthanasia clinic comprises a small room on the ground floor of its shelter, with a padded surgical table where the animals receive their lethal injections.\n\nA poster in the room reminds the staff what they are there for. It reads, \u201cThis room is Sacred Territory. Leave your stress and troubles at the door. In here, only the animals we serve matter. For them, your gentle touch and kind words are likely their first and their last.\u201d\n\nThe bill now sits on the desk of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who has until March 29 to sign or veto it \u2014 or send it back to be amended.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
