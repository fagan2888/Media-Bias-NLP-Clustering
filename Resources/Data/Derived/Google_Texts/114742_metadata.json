Green got into the huddle and told his teammates, \u201cWe got one play. Let\u2019s make this play.\u2019\u201d\n\nGreen did more than just talk. He caught a 77-yard touchdown pass from Andy Dalton with 4:58 left to provide Cincinnati with a feel-good 23-16 win over the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday.\n\nGreen got behind cornerback Chykie Brown, who was pressed into a starting role for the injured Lardarius Webb.\n\nBrown got a hand on the ball, which popped from Green\u2019s grasp before he gathered it in. After putting a fake on safety Darian Stewart, Green trotted into the end zone.\n\nThe subsequent 2-point conversion made it 23-16, and the Bengals held on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s big for the team, man,\u201d Green said. \u201cJust taking that next step to being a great team. I think these games right here prepare us for going into the postseason. When we\u2019re not scoring every play, when it comes down to making that play, I think that game will help us.\u201d\n\nDalton went 25 for 38 for 301 yards to help the Bengals end a four-game losing streak in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cWe did exactly what we set out to do there today,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cThere are a lot of tough places to play in this league and this is certainly one of the toughest. It was the only place I had not won since joining the Bengals.\u201d\n\nThe go-ahead score came just 48 seconds after Baltimore newcomer Steve Smith caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Joe Flacco, who overcame a slow start to finish 35 for 62 for 345 yards and an interception.\n\nIt was the longest touchdown throw of Flacco\u2019s career, but the offense as a whole sputtered in its first outing under coordinator Gary Kubiak.\n\n\u201cWe played just about as bad as you can in terms of just simple fundamental things,\u201d Flacco said.\n\nFollowing Green\u2019s score, Flacco took the Ravens to the Cincinnati 16 before he was sacked on third and fourth down, the last with 55 seconds left.\n\n\u201cI knew I had to make a play to make the first down, and I just couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Flacco said.\n\nMike Nugent kicked five field goals to give the Bengals a 15-0 halftime lead.\n\nBaltimore cut it to 15-10 before Smith broke his pattern to go deep as Flacco scrambled out of the pocket. Smith hauled in a pass along the left sideline and shook off Adam \u201cPacman\u201d Jones with his right arm before stepping into the end zone.\n\n\u201cWe had a little scramble drill. Joe told me to go so I went,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe threw a great ball.\u201d\n\nSmith, who played 13 seasons with Carolina before signing as a free agent, finished with seven catches for 118 yards in his Ravens debut.\n\nPlaying without starting running back Ray Rice, who began a two-game suspension for domestic violence, the Ravens mustered only 91 yards rushing.\n\nStarter Bernard Pierce, who gained 14 yards on six carries and lost a fumble, was overshadowed by Justin Forsett, who ran for 70 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBoth teams were affected by injuries. Baltimore placed Webb on the inactive list with a back injury, and Dalton repeatedly picked on Brown.\n\nThe Bengals lost Pro Bowl linebacker Vontaze Burfict to a concussion late in the second quarter, and tight end Tyler Eifert left in the first half with a right elbow injury.\n\nFlacco was booed by many in the sellout crowd after throwing an interception to end a promising third-quarter possession. On Baltimore\u2019s next series, however, Flacco finally put together his first scoring drive of the season.\n\nCompleting six of seven passes for 63 yards, he moved the Ravens 82 yards for a touchdown \u2014 a 13-yard run by Forsett.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s defense then produced its first three-and-out, and Flacco followed with a 14-play drive that produced a 38-yard field goal to make it 15-10 with 10:28 remaining.\n\nNugent connected on field goals of 49, 22, 28, 46 and 38 yards before halftime, and Baltimore\u2019s lone sustained drive ended horribly on the final play of the half.\n\nDown 15-0, the Ravens moved to the Cincinnati 15 with 8 seconds left. Flacco bounced around in the pocket, cut right as time expired and was sacked, ending Baltimore\u2019s chance to at least get a field goal.\n\nNOTES: Jeromy Miles got Baltimore\u2019s first blocked field goal since Kelly Gregg against Cincinnati on October 11, 2009. \u2026 Dalton is 31-18 as a starter, the best in Bengals history for a QB with 10 or more starts. \u2026 The loss stops Baltimore\u2019s eight-game home opener winning streak, dating back to 2006.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Green caught a 77-yard touchdown pass from Andy Dalton with 4:58 left, and the Cincinnati Bengals blew a 15-point lead before bouncing back to beat the Baltimore Ravens 23-16 Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Green caught a 77-yard touchdown pass from Andy Dalton with 4:58 left, and the Cincinnati Bengals blew a 15-point lead before bouncing back to beat the Baltimore Ravens 23-16 Sunday.", "title": "A.J.
