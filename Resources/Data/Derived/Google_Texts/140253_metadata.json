I was celebrating my 24th birthday, which was not until Oct. 2.\n\nOf course, I became aware that there was a show called \u201cThe X-Files\u201d that was something of a to-do, because this was an era when it was harder to avoid a pop phenomenon, an album or a film once it moved to the cultural fore, but I could not have been less interested in it. I was too young and having too much fun. The only X that I cared about was something that we Brooklyn hipsters all called \u201cE\u201d (only cops and housewives on TV called it \u201cX\u201d) and the only file that mattered was the one I used to carve out lines on the top of a hand-drying blower in the bathroom of some graffiti\u2019d Lower East Side bar.\n\nIf I happened to catch an episode, and I did watch a few, it was either because I was in the hospital or waiting in a taxi station in Williamsburg (where I lived in a $300-a-month loft on Grand Street \u2026 talk about the supernatural). Maybe I was still in some woman\u2019s apartment after going home with her \u2014 on a Thursday. Some Fridays it was on while I was talking about religion or why Jon Spencer Blues Explosion sucked (or were great) in a strange, cramped kitchen with several other young men and women since the Thursday before that. Cocaine, a \u2014 not the \u2014 drug of choice at the time, did not make me paranoid; in fact, it accomplished the opposite effect. Blow made me 100 percent certain that I was right about everything: politics, sports, music, my own talent. The only truth that was out there was the guy with more coke. I wouldn\u2019t be able to spot a UFO because we had no sky in New York in the \u201890s, anyway, just a banner of filmy, starless blue black tarpaulin (perfect for the flying of black helicopters but fly away, just don\u2019t blow away the pile with your rotors, por favor). A freakin\u2019 werewolf could have been sitting next to me on a stool at the Library Bar on Avenue A, but that too would require looking left or right instead of straight at the cute, blond art student/bartender.\n\nCut to nine seasons, 202 episodes, and a few dramatized Chupacabra sightings later, and I was no longer in my carefree 20s. Mulder and Scully were gone and so was my youthful bravado: disappeared in an instant like Mulder\u2019s poor sister. My once-flourishing writing career was about as successful as that of the Smoking Man\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don't call it a conspiracy, but it's no accident that the show that popularized paranoia is reuniting now", "title": "I\u2019m ready for \u201cThe X-Files\u201d now: How Mulder and Scully won me over, with a little help from terror and time", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Don't call it a conspiracy, but it's no accident that the show that popularized paranoia is reuniting now", "title": "I\u2019m ready for \u201cThe X-Files\u201d now: How Mulder and Scully won me over, with a little help from terror and time", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/17/im_ready_for_the_x_files_now_how_mulder_and_scully_won_me_over_with_a_little_help_from_terror_and_time/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/x_files.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Don't call it a conspiracy, but it's no accident that the show that popularized paranoia is reuniting now", "title": "I\u2019m ready for \u201cThe X-Files\u201d now: How Mulder and Scully won me over, with a little help from terror and time", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/x_files.jpg", "creator": "@marcspitz", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Marc Spitz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, david duchovny, Editor's Picks, gillian anderson, the x-files, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Mulder and Scully were gone and so was my youthful bravado: disappeared in an instant like Mulder\u2019s poor sister.\nBlow made me 100 percent certain that I was right about everything: politics, sports, music, my own talent.\nCocaine, a \u2014 not the \u2014 drug of choice at the time, did not make me paranoid; in fact, it accomplished the opposite effect.\nCut to nine seasons, 202 episodes, and a few dramatized Chupacabra sightings later, and I was no longer in my carefree 20s.\nMaybe I was still in some woman\u2019s apartment after going home with her \u2014 on a Thursday."}
