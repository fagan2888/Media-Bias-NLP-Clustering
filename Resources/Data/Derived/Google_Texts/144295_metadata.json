If I\u2019m unemployed at the beginning of the year and sign up for health insurance through my state\u2019s health insurance exchange, I\u2019d probably get a subsidy because my income would be low. But what happens if I get a job later in the year and start earning a good salary? Will I have to pay the money back?\n\nA. You may have to repay some of the money, but the amount you\u2019d owe would likely be capped. Every individual\u2019s circumstances are different, but here\u2019s how it might work in a typical situation.\n\nWhen you apply for health insurance on your state\u2019s marketplace, you\u2019ll be asked about your income. If you\u2019re collecting a typical unemployment check of about $300 a week and you live in the District of Columbia or one of the 25 states expanding Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level ($15,856 for an individual in 2013), you\u2019ll probably qualify for coverage under that program and won\u2019t have to buy a plan on the exchange.\n\nIf you live in a state that\u2019s not expanding Medicaid, however, you can shop for subsidized coverage on your state\u2019s marketplace. Premium tax credits are available to individuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level ($11,490 to $45,960 for an individual in 2013).\n\nIf you\u2019re collecting $300 a week in unemployment benefits, you\u2019d probably qualify for a premium credit. If you choose to receive the credit up front rather than at tax time next year, your insurance premium would be reduced by the amount of your tax credit, and the government would send that amount to the insurer.\n\nLet\u2019s say you land a job in July with a $60,000 annual salary, but it doesn\u2019t offer health insurance. At that point, you\u2019d need to inform the marketplace about your change in circumstance.\n\n\u201cThe key is to reach out immediately when things change,\u201d says Brian Haile, senior vice president for tax policy at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "What Happens If My Income Changes After I Receive An Insurance Subsidy?", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "What Happens If My Income Changes After I Receive An Insurance Subsidy?", "title": "Higher Income Affects Obamacare Subsidy", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20131205/what-happens-if-my-income-changes-after-i-receive-an-insurance-subsidy", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "What Happens If My Income Changes After I Receive An Insurance Subsidy?", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "If I\u2019m unemployed at the beginning of the year and sign up for health insurance through my state\u2019s health insurance exchange, I\u2019d probably get a subsidy because my income would be low.\nWhen you apply for health insurance on your state\u2019s marketplace, you\u2019ll be asked about your income.\nLet\u2019s say you land a job in July with a $60,000 annual salary, but it doesn\u2019t offer health insurance.\nIf you live in a state that\u2019s not expanding Medicaid, however, you can shop for subsidized coverage on your state\u2019s marketplace.\nIf you\u2019re collecting $300 a week in unemployment benefits, you\u2019d probably qualify for a premium credit."}
