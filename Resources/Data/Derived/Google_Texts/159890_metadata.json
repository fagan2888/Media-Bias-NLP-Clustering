Bowe Bergdahl did not include information about the note Bergdahl left on his bed in his tent before he abandoned his unit and was captured by the Taliban five years ago.\n\nAppearing on Fox News Channel\u2019s Kelly File on Tuesday, Chambliss said, \u201cThis article in The New York Times shocked me. This note that he supposedly left that indicated that he was sympathetic to the Taliban and unsympathetic to the American interest in this conflict was not included in that file, and I\u2019m very surprised by that. Normally those classified files are pretty informative, but\u2013I don\u2019t know\u2013Iwas pretty shocked by it.\u201d\n\nChambliss added that the file also did not include any interviews with any of Bergdahl\u2019s platoon members. \u201cThere was nothing in that file in regards to statements from those individuals as to what they saw that night, and there\u2019s just a lot of unanswered questions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Tuesday that Bergdahl left an e-mail before slipping away from his post, saying he had become \u201cdisillusioned\u201d with life in the army, did not support the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, and was leaving to begin a new life.\n\nMembers of Bergdahl\u2019s platoon describe Bergdahl now as either a \u201cdeserter\u201d or \u201ctraitor.\u201d The Times also notes that his platoon mates said that Bergdahl would stare at the mountains around them and wonder if he could get to China from there. Others said that Bergdahl wrote \u201cJason Bourne-type novels,\u201d in which he inserted himself as the main character.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Saxby Chambliss: Classified File Didn't Mention Bowe Bergdahl's Desertion Note", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Saxby Chambliss: Classified File Didn't Mention Bowe Bergdahl's Desertion Note", "title": "Saxby Chambliss: Classified File Didn't Mention Bowe Bergdahl's Desertion Note - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/06/03/Bowe-Berndahl-Afghan-Guy-AP.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/06/03/chambliss-bergdahl-classified-file-didn-t-include-desertion-note-ny-times-reported-about/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Saxby Chambliss: Classified File Didn't Mention Bowe Bergdahl's Desertion Note", "creator": "@kerrypicket", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/06/03/Bowe-Berndahl-Afghan-Guy-AP.png", "title": "Saxby Chambliss: Classified File Didn't Mention Bowe Bergdahl's Desertion Note - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "New York Times, Saxby Chambliss, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-06-03T20:49:48-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Appearing on Fox News Channel\u2019s Kelly File on Tuesday, Chambliss said, \u201cThis article in The New York Times shocked me.\nBowe Bergdahl did not include information about the note Bergdahl left on his bed in his tent before he abandoned his unit and was captured by the Taliban five years ago.\nNormally those classified files are pretty informative, but\u2013I don\u2019t know\u2013Iwas pretty shocked by it.\u201dChambliss added that the file also did not include any interviews with any of Bergdahl\u2019s platoon members.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSenator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said that the classified file he read today on Army Sgt.\nOthers said that Bergdahl wrote \u201cJason Bourne-type novels,\u201d in which he inserted himself as the main character."}
