Country music singer and Hendersonville resident Kelly Lang recently announced she is partnering with the Humane Society of Sumner County as an honorary board member and celebrity spokeswoman.

As a “no kill shelter,” the Sumner County Humane Society is celebrating its 40th year as a 501c3 nonprofit organization.

Lang and her husband, TG Sheppard, adopted a Maltipoo from the humane society last year.

“When I adopted our dog, Sandy, I thought I was the one saving her life, but as it turned out, she ended up saving and adding so much to mine,” Lang said.

Lang is also well-known for her oil paintings of celebrity pets, which are hanging in the homes of such stars as Oprah Winfrey, Barry Gibb and Olivia Newton-John.

The country singer will film a public service announcement in support of the shelter and is slated to give a headlining performance at the humane society’s annual Puttin’ on the Dog/Cat Holiday Gala Nov. 1 at Bluegrass Country Club in Hendersonville.
