Some raised questions about the absentees.\n\n\n\nBy Matt Schickling\n\nWire Staff Reporter\n\nFour candidates from both parties campaigning for the 13th Congressional District seat currently occupied by Democrat Allyson Schwartz met in an evening forum hosted by the Willow Grove NAACP on March 17 at First Baptist Church of Crestmont.\n\nPresent were Democratic candidates state Sen. Daylin Leach, Dr. Valerie Arkoosh and state Rep. Brendan Boyle, and Republican candidate Dee Adcock. Former congresswoman Marjorie Margolies was conspicuous by her absence as she is largely considered to be the Democratic favorite, bolstered by the support of former President Bill Clinton.\n\nRepublican candidate Beverly Plosa-Bowser was also not in attendance, but was given a pass by the other candidates. Margolies was not so lucky.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to debate, if you\u2019re not willing to mix it up, if there\u2019s no issue you\u2019re passionately arguing for, you shouldn\u2019t be in Congress,\u201d said Leach in his closing. \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote for me, I hope you vote for one of my colleagues here tonight, because we are not yet that cynical as a people.\u201d\n\nLeach was not-so-subtly expressing his distaste for Margolies\u2019 decision to skip the forum, a notion that the other candidates avoided, but appeared to agree with.\n\n\u201cWhy should we waste time debating Republicans in a Democratic primary?\u201d said Ken Smukler, a senior adviser to the Margolies campaign. \u201cShe has no problem with debates and looks forward to them.\u201d\n\nMargolies has plans to attend a Democratic forum organized by Philadelphia Democratic ward leader John Sabatina tentatively scheduled for early April. She also agreed to attend a forum sponsored by the Upper Moreland Democrats in May.\n\nGenerally, the audience questions from the March 17 forum strayed from divisive or abrasive issues, which allowed the candidates to focus on their backgrounds as support for their campaigns moving forward.\n\nAnd agreement seemed to be a theme of the night, most notably among the Democratic candidates, but even across party lines as Adcock conjured similar answers to the mostly Democratically-tinged questions from the audience. But the candidates certainly made their general political divisions known.\n\nArkoosh stressed the importance of her career as a physician and her prominent role in shaping the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d to advocate herself as not just the best-suited to handle the issue of healthcare reform, but a candidate who can bring about economic and political well-being.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been labeled by many as the \u2018healthcare candidate,\u2019 and frankly, I\u2019m pretty proud of that label,\u201d said Arkoosh. \u201cBut I would describe myself as the \u2018health candidate,\u2019 as someone who understands what our communities need to grow and thrive.\u201d\n\nHer antidotes include a strong public education system, higher wages, public safety, advocacy for women\u2019s issues and, of course, affordable, efficient healthcare.\n\nBoyle also focused on the need for increased minimum wage and improved public education, but shifted focus to fundamental tax reform and affordable higher education. He cited his family\u2019s blue-collar background to relate his history with the priority of his campaign: to more evenly distribute wealth in America.\n\n\u201cThe gap between the wealthiest (1) percent and the other 99 percent of us is greater today than at any time in American history,\u201d said Boyle.\n\nRaising minimum wage would \u201clift 4.9 million Americans, working Americans, out of poverty\u201d and \u201clift everyone else on the pay scale,\u201d he said.\n\nAdcock, the lone Republican at the event, alluded to his role in the community as the owner of a small swimming pool business and former member of the United Service Organizations (USO) board of directors, to promote his vision of \u201cthe American Dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to unleash the American economy, free it from excessive regulation, taxation and government intrusion,\u201d said Adcock.\n\nLeach spoke from a more progressive platform, citing his own childhood experiences in foster homes as evidence of the need for a \u201csocial safety net\u201d to combat poverty and inequality. Apart from this, he advocated increased minimum wage, including the national tip minimum wage, marriage equality and the legalization of marijuana.\n\nHe pointed to his record in introducing and supporting bills relating to these issues as evidence for his willingness to advocate progressive causes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in this to advance my career and to make sure I perpetuate my existence in politics forever,\u201d said Leach. \u201cI\u2019m in here to make a difference on issues.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Midweek Wire", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Present and accounted for | The Midweek Wire on WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Midweek Wire", "description": "Almost every 13th Congressional candidate was present at a forum last Monday.
