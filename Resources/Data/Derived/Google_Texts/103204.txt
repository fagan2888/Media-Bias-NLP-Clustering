Interstate 25 reopened late Friday afternoon after being closed for nearly two hours in Westminster because of police activity.

Police were called after 2 p.m. to the 136th Avenue overpass, over I-25, on a report of a suicidal person, said Kate Kazell, a Westminster Police Department spokeswoman.

The highway opened at about 4:30 p.m., police said on Twitter.

Westminster Police, at 2:47 p.m., posted on Twitter that I-25 was closed northbound at 120th Avenue and southbound at 144th Avenue until further notice.

Westminster officers arrived on scene and talked to a man who was on the bridge.

Driver were told to avoid the area, if possible, and take an alternate route.

RTD said Friday that bus service would be delayed in its northern corridor because of the incident. Routes affected include: 120X, 122X, LSX/LNX and 39L.
