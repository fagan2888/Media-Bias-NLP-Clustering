And if you didn\u2019t, you could face a penalty.\n\nAlso, if you got advance payments of the premium tax credit under the Affordable Care Act, even for only part of the year, there\u2019s a new form to file. You\u2019ll have to file it even if you got tax credits for only part of the year. And tax filers accustomed to using a 1040EZ will no longer be able to do that if they got a tax credit.\n\nThere\u2019s more. If you had life changes \u2014 a new job with a higher salary, for example \u2014 from the time those tax credits were approved, you could end up having to pay some or all of the money back. Conversely, if you lost your job and faced a long period of unemployment, you might now be eligible for the credit.\n\n\u201cI see deer-in-the-headlights looks,\u201d said Dave Duval, TaxAudit.com\u2019s vice president of consumer advocacy. \u201cThese are new items. ACA has been on the books since 2010. We\u2019ve ignored it, not looked at it, not paid attention to it. It\u2019s on the tax return that we\u2019re going to be doing for 2014.\u201d\n\nInsurance required\n\nThe law requires individuals to have what the government calls minimum essential coverage unless they qualify for one of more than 30 exemptions. For those without insurance \u2014 or an exemption \u2014 there\u2019s a penalty stemming from the law\u2019s premise that health care coverage is a shared responsibility among federal and state governments, insurers, employers and individuals.\n\nFor 2014, the penalty is the greater of 1 percent of your household income above the threshold for filing taxes or what the Internal Revenue Service calls \u201cyour family\u2019s flat-dollar amount\u201d \u2014 $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, with a family maximum of $285 in 2014.\n\nHowever, the average penalty for the 2014 tax year is expected to be higher \u2014 $301, according to Sacha Adam, health care team leader at Intuit, maker of TurboTax. Under the law, those fines will go up for people who remain uninsured in 2015, to about $590 on average.\n\n\u201cGetting health insurance is a big decision for some folks,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWhen it comes to reporting your health insurance on your taxes, it\u2019s going to be very straightforward.\u201d\n\nChecking a box\n\nReporting your health insurance coverage begins on line 61 of Form 1040.\n\n\u201cFor the vast majority of Americans, tax filing under the Affordable Care Act will be as simple as checking a box to show they had health coverage all year,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services estimated that more than three-quarters of taxpayers will need to do no more than that.\n\n\u201cIf you have it and you have the ability to demonstrate you had it, that should be it, and you\u2019re not going to be subject to having the additional penalty assessed,\u201d said Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst & Young.\n\nPeople insured through the exchanges will get Form 1095-A in the mail attesting to their coverage and how much of an advance premium tax credit they received. Employers are not required to provide proof of coverage for 2014.\n\nNew forms to file\n\n\u201cA fraction of taxpayers will take different steps, like claiming an exemption if they could not afford insurance or ensuring they received the correct amount of financial assistance,\u201d Lew said. \u201cA smaller fraction of taxpayers will pay a fee if they made a choice to not obtain coverage they could afford.\u201d\n\nIf you received a premium tax credit or might be entitled to one, file Form 8962. That will determine whether you got too much of an advance credit payment and have to repay some of it, or if you didn\u2019t apply and might be eligible for the premium tax credit on your return.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t have health insurance, there\u2019s yet another form \u2014 Form 8965 \u2014 which lists the possible exemptions and lets you claim the one that might apply. It\u2019s also where you figure out your penalty if you didn\u2019t have coverage for all or part of 2014.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to look for. It is kind of complicated,\u201d said Barbara Weltman, contributing editor to the tax guide J.K. Lasser\u2019s Your Income Tax 2015.\n\nThe good news, she said, is most people use a paid preparer or software to do their taxes, and they\u2019ll be walked through the questions that have to be answered for the health insurance section of the tax return.\n\n\u201cIn the tax-preparation process, they\u2019re not really exposed to forms until the very last moment,\u201d Adam said. \u201cAt TurboTax, we\u2019ll figure out what forms need to be provided.\u201d\n\nCarole Feldman,\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nAT A GLANCE: Help with your taxes\n\nTax Hotline: Confused by changes in federal tax law?
