James Inhofe and Tom Coburn, many political observers believe this fledgling campaign is far-fetched and could take the GOP down a ruinous political road again as it did after the GOP-controlled House impeached former Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nRelated: Power Struggle Rekindles Risky Talk of Impeachment\n\nBut in the politically poisonous atmosphere of the bitterly gridlocked Congress, almost nothing is totally out of the realm of possibility. And as liberal Harvard legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe noted in an interview this week with The Fiscal Times, House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s threat to sue Obama for executive overreach could well be \u201ca precursor to an impeachment effort if they [the Republicans] win the Senate, which it looks like to me.\u201d\n\nLate last month, Boehner told reporters he would file a lawsuit against Obama on behalf of the House over the president\u2019s frequent use of executive orders and other actions that Republicans contend far exceed his legal authority. Although the speaker has yet to itemize those complaints, many Republicans have expressed outrage over his go-it-alone immigration policies, unilateral changes in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation deadline, and his decision to swap five Taliban prisoners for U.S. Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl \u2013 a suspected deserter \u2013 without first informing Congress.\n\nTribe, one of the foremost constitutional experts in the country, said it would be difficult to evaluate Boehner\u2019s prospects for prevailing in court without seeing the complaint. But he said that it is \u201ccertainly not unimaginable\u201d that the House would have standing to bring a law suit charging the president with circumventing his authority.\n\nRelated: Obama Practically Dares Boehner to Sue Him\n\nBoehner and his lawyers would have to develop very specific complaints against the president that far exceed a \u201cgeneralized complaint\u201d that Obama has been issuing too many \u201csigning statements\u201d putting his spin on new law, or that the president has insulted the integrity of the House by \u201ctaking too aggressive a view of executive authority.\u201d\n\nYet Tribe \u2013 who taught constitutional law to Obama and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts at Harvard Law School years ago, said there is ample reason to think that Boehner\u2019s threatened court case \u201cis a dress rehearsal for something more dramatic and more politically explosive if the Senate changes hands in November\u201d and the Republicans retain control of the House, as many assume.\n\nThe Fiscal Times reported last week that while the Speaker insisted impeachment was not on the table, many Republican and Tea Party activists believe there are ample grounds for the House to impeach the president.\n\nRelated: Why Obamacare As We Know It May Not Survive\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake points out that Palin \u2013 the former Alaska governor, the GOP\u2019s vice presidential candidate in 2008 and a best-selling author \u2013 is \u201cthe first Republican of any significant national stature to make this call\u201d for Obama\u2019s impeachment.\n\nMoreover, he writes, Palin is \u201cthe kind of figure who could potentially recruit others to the cause \u2014 people who will want to be heard,\u201d although Palin doesn\u2019t wield as much influence in her party as she once did.\n\n\u201cWithout borders, there is no nation,\u201d Palin wrote this week in calling for impeachment. \u201cObama knows this. Opening our borders to a flood of illegal immigrants is deliberate. This is his fundamental transformation of America. It\u2019s the only promise he has kept.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sarah Palin on Tuesday became the latest conservative Republican voice to call for President Obama\u2019s impeachment, arguing that the flood of young illegal immigrants from Central America crossing into the U.S. is \u201cthe last straw.\u201d Liberal Harvard legal scholar Laurence H.
