Who could have imagined that?\n\nJust before the 2012 elections, we wrote in this space that, should President Obama get re-elected, repealing ObamaCare would be virtually impossible because the law \u201cwill have fundamentally reshaped the insurance market.\u201d\n\nA few months later, we alerted readers again that after insurers \u201cconformed their businesses to the many market distortions it will create,\u201d even those that once opposed ObamaCare \u201ccould end up lobbying for it.\u201d\n\nIn January this year, we pointed to a set of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association talking points, in which its CEO warned about \u201cmomentum that is quickly building among some leading conservatives\u201d for a bill to defund the law\u2019s huge industry bailout programs.\n\nWell, now The New York Times has discovered that, lo and behold, \u201cthe relationship between the Obama administration and insurers has evolved into a powerful, mutually beneficial partnership.\u201d\n\nMutually beneficial is right. In fact, the industry is positively glowing about the opportunities big government provides. \u201cOur government business is growing along multiple fronts,\u201d WellPoint CEO Joseph Swedish boasted. The company called Medicaid \u201chighly profitable.\u201d\n\nWellPoint now relies on government programs for 45% of its operating revenues.\n\nAetna, which depends on taxpayer money for 40% of its premiums, said \u201cexcellent performance in our government business\u201d contributed to \u201ca very good year.\u201d\n\nSo what does Obama get out of the deal? He gets industry protection for his pet reform.\n\nAs the Times explains, insurers that \u201chave built their business plans around the law\u2026 will strenuously resist Republican efforts to dismantle it.\u201d Sound familiar?\n\nThey\u2019re already helping out. A division of UnitedHealth Group chipped in to rebuild HealthCare.gov after its disastrous opening, the Times notes, while insurers have backed Obama in court fights over the law.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, rather than focus on ObamaCare\u2019s flaws, insurers have attacked the drug industry for its \u201carbitrary\u201d prices on new specialty drugs \u2014 all but begging the government to impose price controls.\n\nIt turns out that ObamaCare\u2019s biggest victory for liberals may not be a brand new middle-class entitlement, but that it enlisted one of the largest industries in the country to lobby endlessly for more government.\n\nIf Republicans ever hope to overturn ObamaCare, they\u2019ll have to fight a two-front war \u2014 with liberals on one side and the insurance industry on the other.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll have to decide whether they are defenders of a free, open and competitive insurance market, or defenders of a corrupt and costly form of crony capitalism.", "article_metadata": {"date": "2014-11-18 15:31:00:-08:00", "description": "Crony Capitalism: The New York Times this week reports that ObamaCare has made strange bedfellows between the insurance industry and the federal government.
