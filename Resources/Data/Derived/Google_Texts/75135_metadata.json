Today, a mere 15 percent of frequent abusers say they buy from drug dealers or other strangers. One in four users doctor-shop for prescriptions \u2014 but just as many get them for free from friends or relatives.\n\n\"At this point, virtually everyone recognizes that this is a serious problem that has been getting much worse,\" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. \"What we now are figuring out is what\u2019s going to work to reverse it.\"\n\nThe agency\u2019s new study, which is published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, focused on opioids \u2014 a family of painkillers that include OxyContin and Vicodin. \"These results underscore the need for interventions targeting prescribing behaviors, in addition to those targeting medication sharing, selling and diversion,\u201d the researchers said in a press release. \u201cThe essential steps health care providers can take to curb this serious health problem include more judicious prescribing, use of prescription drug-monitoring programs and screening patients for abuse risk before prescribing opioids.\"\n\nThe CDC\u2019s new review goes to the core of an issue that has kept public health officials sleepless for years. Since 1999, overdose deaths involving prescription painkillers have tripled, with more than 16,000 fatalities in 2010. The problem is not limited to analgesics: psychiatric medication, for example, currently account for more emergency room deaths than street drugs.\n\nAnd like painkillers, psychiatric medication frequently follows less than ideal routes. Dr. Allen Frances, a psychiatrist and former chairman at the American Psychiatric Association, says that 80 percent of psychiatric pills are now prescribed by primary care physicians rather than psychiatrists. This ultimately contributes to an influx of pills that can have serious side effects and high addiction potential.\n\nFrieden believes that the situation can be turned around \u2014 but in order to make that happen, authorities must devote more energy to prescriptions drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) that help physicians spot abusers. \"There is a coalescing recognition of what\u2019s going to be important,\" he told reporters. \"One is clearly going to be PDMPs \u2014 and PDMPs that are mandatory, real-time and actively monitored so that the folks running them identify problem patients and problem doctors.\"\n\nSource: Jones CM, Paulozzi LJ, Mack KA.
