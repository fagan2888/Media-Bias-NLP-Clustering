Others go without eyeglasses and live with toothache because they don\u2019t have coverage at all. This week, Seattle has a temporary clinic in an unlikely place to help solve some of those problems.\n\nFor four days, the floor of Seattle\u2019s KeyArena is plumbed like a dental office. The luxury suites are crammed with high-tech diagnostic equipment, X-ray and ultrasound machines. There\u2019s a 3-D printer cranking out new crowns for aching teeth, and an optical lab grinding lenses to fit brand new frames.\n\nThere are hundreds of volunteer health workers present to make it happen. And there\u2019s one man who got the idea when he was a cowboy \u2014 a \u201cvaquero\u201d \u2014 in the Upper Amazon in the 1950s.\n\n\u201cI had a very serious accident shortly after I arrived there with a wild horse, and one of the other vaqueros there said, \u2018Well the nearest doctor is 26 days on foot,\u2019\u201d said Stan Brock, founder of Remote Area Medical, a roving, free health clinic.\n\nBrock ditched the idea of hiking, injured, through the rainforest and survived. Brock had visions of parachuting doctors into remote locales, but found there was a big need here, especially for vision and dental care. And that\u2019s exactly what he sees today when he asks for a show of hands at KeyArena.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018How many people are here to see the medical doctors?\u2019 of which we\u2019ve got a large number in all kinds of specialties. And I think only three hands went up out of the 600,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, is that they all really needed to see the medical doctor, but they were so preoccupied with the pain from problems with their teeth.\u201d\n\nPatient Reina Rosales came to have her cavity filled. She was in line by midnight. She hadn't seen a dentist in three years.\n\n\u201cYeah, a long time, but now I\u2019m so happy for that [free care],\u201d she said.\n\nRosales\u2019 problem is solved, but for others, say someone who comes for a new pair of glasses, this might only be the beginning.\n\n\u201cIf we find that they\u2019ve got glaucoma, those are the people that we have to try and find a way to get the follow up care done for them,\u201d Brock said.\n\nThe clinic runs through Sunday with a goal of reaching 4,000 people.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Other News", "description": "Even with the Affordable Care Act, adults in Washington are not getting the medical care they need often because they cannot afford deductibles or get into", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://www.kplu.org/post/roving-free-health-clinic-sets-shop-keyarena-four-day-stay", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kplu/files/styles/medium/public/201410/photo_2_%2811%29.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Even with the Affordable Care Act, adults in Washington are not getting the medical care they need often because they cannot afford deductibles or get into", "title": "Roving, Free Health Clinic Sets Up Shop At KeyArena For Four-Day Stay"}, "story_id": 358387103, "twitter": {"site": "@KPLU", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KPLU"}, "author": "Monica Spain", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Roving, Free Health Clinic Sets Up Shop At KeyArena For Four-Day Stay"}, "nid": 19262, "datePublished": "2014-10-23", "wordCount": 516, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dbe\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYeah, a long time, but now I\u2019m so happy for that [free care],\u201d she said.\nEven with the Affordable Care Act, adults in Washington are not getting the medical care they need often because they cannot afford deductibles or get into a Medicaid provider.\nThis week, Seattle has a temporary clinic in an unlikely place to help solve some of those problems.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what he sees today when he asks for a show of hands at KeyArena.\nFor four days, the floor of Seattle\u2019s KeyArena is plumbed like a dental office."}
