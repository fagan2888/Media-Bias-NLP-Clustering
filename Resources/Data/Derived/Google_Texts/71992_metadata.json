But Paul G. Harch, who operates the clinic there on the outskirts of New Orleans, offers it as a concussion treatment.\n\nOne patient, Rashada Parks, said that she had struggled with neck pain, mood swings and concentration problems ever since she fell and hit her head more than three years ago. Narcotic painkillers hadn\u2019t helped her, nor had antidepressants. But after 40 hour-long treatments, or dives, in a hyperbaric chamber, her symptoms have subsided.\n\n\u201cI have hope now,\u201d Parks said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nThree studies run at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million have all come to a far different conclusion. They found that the benefits of hyperbaric oxygen reported by patients like Parks may have resulted from a placebo-like effect, not the therapy\u2019s supposed ability to repair and regenerate brain cells.\n\nBut undeterred, advocates of the treatment recently persuaded lawmakers to spend even more public money investigating whether the three studies were flawed.\n\nA money magnet\n\nA growing industry has developed around concussions, with entrepreneurs, academic institutions and doctors scrambling to find ways to prevent, detect and treat head injuries. An estimated 1.7 million Americans are treated every year after suffering concussions from falls, car accidents, sports injuries and other causes.\n\nWhile the vast majority quickly recover with rest, a small percentage of patients experience lingering effects a year or longer afterward. Along with memory issues, symptoms can include headaches, dizziness and vision and balance problems.\n\nOver the past decade, the Defense Department has spent more than $800 million on brain injury research, with organizations and companies like the National Football League and General Electric spending tens of millions more. And as people become more aware of the debilitating long-term consequences of repeated concussions, businesses have been chasing salable solutions.\n\nThe search for ways to prevent and treat concussions has spawned screening tools, helmet sensors, electronic mouthpieces, diagnostic blood tests and brain imaging devices. Startups are marketing their products to the military, schools, hospitals, sports teams and parents, and controversial therapies like hyperbaric oxygen are being promoted to patients.\n\nBut as the industry booms, medical experts are raising concerns that it is a business where much of the science is sketchy, belief frequently outruns fact, and claims of technological breakthroughs evaporate soon after they are made.\n\nMichael Singer, chief executive of BrainScope, a company that makes a hand-held brain-wave measuring device cleared by the Food and Drug Administration to help assess injuries, says that while some companies are studying their products before selling them, others are selling untested products or marketing them without seeking regulatory approval.\n\n\u201cIt is a Wild West out there,\u201d he said.\n\nA research boom\n\nNot long ago, the field of brain injury research was small. Numerous attempts to develop drugs to treat patients with significant head injuries failed as researchers struggled to understand the brain\u2019s complexity. Little attention was paid to concussion, which is also called mild traumatic brain injury.\n\n\u201cThe number of neurologists interested in traumatic brain injury could have held a convention in a phone booth,\u201d said Ramon Diaz-Arrastia, an expert at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. That changed a decade ago after reports showed that hundreds of thousands of service members were returning from Iraq and Afghanistan impaired by concussions caused by battlefield blasts and accidents. In 2007, Congress, facing criticism that the military had ignored the psychological and physical toll of the conflicts, allocated $600 million for research and treatment, splitting the funds between traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.\n\nThe Defense Department went on a spending spree. It funded dozens of studies to find a concussion treatment. Some studies examined supplements, others looked at drugs like Lipitor, the cholesterol medication, and still more trials tested medical devices. Research was also underwritten to develop blood tests to better identify soldiers with concussions and to create improved imaging tools to map a concussion\u2019s impact on the brain.\n\nDavid X. Cifu, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond who also works for the Veterans Affairs Department, said that the hundreds of millions of dollars in government funds spawned a research feeding frenzy that led to dubious claims.\n\n\u201cIt was a small field that got amazingly large because a lot of people were making stuff up and claiming things,\u201d Cifu said.\n\nSome specialists said they believed the military\u2019s approach to concussions suffered from a basic problem. While agreement exists on the symptoms that define a concussion at the time when one occurs, a similar definition did not \u2014 and still does not \u2014 exist to describe what happens after a concussion, including how the injury\u2019s symptoms change over time.\n\nIn addition, many soldiers who are diagnosed with a mild brain injury also have PTSD, a defined condition with symptoms similar to those associated with a concussion. Some critics within the military argued it was overestimating the concussion problem and channeling patients into the wrong type of treatment.\n\n\u201cThey would get the message they had a serious brain injury,\u201d said one of these critics, Charles Hoge, a psychiatrist at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.\n\nWhatever the case, the inability to separate PTSD from concussion turned the government\u2019s research program into a scientific hodgepodge. A 2013 Veterans Affairs review of studies of mild traumatic brain injury, or MTBI, in soldiers and veterans found that the studies\u2019 overall quality was poor and that it was impossible to separate longterm impacts unique to concussion from those attributable to PTSD.\n\nCol. Dallas Hack, a doctor who oversees the Army\u2019s research program, said officials realized several years ago that the military\u2019s efforts had gone off course and that a lot of money had been spent on studies that produced little in the way of tangible results. Since then, the Defense Department has refocused its efforts on basic questions, such as developing a better definition of concussion.\n\n\u201cWe were naive\u201d at the start, Hack said.\n\nThe oxygen lobby\n\nHarch, the New Orleans-area physician, is a true believer in the benefits of hyperbaric oxygen. In his book, \u201cThe Oxygen Revolution,\u201d he claims the treatment helps treat not only post-concussion syndrome but also autism and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nOne major professional medical group, the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, has said there is no evidence showing the technique is effective in resolving concussion symptoms.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t offer this treatment in my facility for mild traumatic brain injury because I\u2019m not convinced it works,\u201d said Enoch T. Huang, an official at the society and a specialist at the Adventist Medical Center in Portland, Oregon.\n\nHarch acknowledges that he is in the minority. \u201cMy generation of doctors thinks this is a fraudulent theory,\u201d he said.\n\nMany years ago, he and other advocates formed a competing professional group, the International Hyperbaric Medical Association, which has lobbied to get coverage for the treatment.\n\nThe military has also been skeptical and for a time refused to fund hyperbaric oxygen research. But facing intense lobbying from lawmakers and veterans groups, the military agreed to start several trials. Those trials found that patients who had a real treatment or a sham treatment reported similar benefits, pointing to a placebo effect. But if Defense Department officials hoped the results would end the debate, they were wrong.\n\nLawmakers put language in the most recent congressional budget bill requiring the Government Accountability Office to review whether the military trials had been run properly. Many of those lawmakers were the same ones who had lobbied the military to run the trials in the first place.\n\nRep. Walter B. Jones Jr., R-N.C., said he supported the accountability office review. He has introduced a bill that would require Veterans Affairs to pay for the treatment if prescribed by a doctor and said he believed that hyperbaric oxygen, even if it just made patients feel better, should be used instead of dangerous psychotropic drugs that veterans are often given.\n\n\u201cNo one has committed suicide from being treated with oxygen,\u201d Jones said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/07/1003240272-FL_SAR_hfcover21.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "But Paul G.
