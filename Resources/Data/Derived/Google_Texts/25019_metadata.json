It is the best thing that you can teach a kid,\" Light said.\n\nLight says all new guns sold in the United States of America come with cable locks, that when used properly, prevent a gun from being fired. He says many, larger law enforcement offices will give cable locks for free to anyone that needs one.\n\nThere are also safes, vaults and lockers that can be purchased for as little as $30 that can keep a loaded gun ready to be used.\n\nParents can ask if someone they invited into their home is armed with a gun.\n\n\"You have to just ask yourself, why would you even want to not know that that gun is there with your kid in the house, with your kid being accessible to that room,\" Light said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A Wichita gun expert says one part of responsible gun ownership is securing the firearm when not in use.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "A Wichita gun expert says one part of responsible gun ownership is securing the firearm when not in use.", "title": "Teaching children about guns", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Teaching-children-about-guns-361679031.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B6C/CBC/B6CCBC97C2094CF5BEF3EFB311E95ADB", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3FD/544/3FD544FB83FB431E88D8C8B610F57490.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A Wichita gun expert says one part of responsible gun ownership is securing the firearm when not in use.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Teaching-children-about-guns-361679031.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Thunderbird+Firearms+Academy+Gun.jpg", "title": "Teaching children about guns", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Teaching children about guns", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Brandon Light works for Thunderbird Firearms Academy and wants parents to teach children what to do if they see a gun.\nHe says many, larger law enforcement offices will give cable locks for free to anyone that needs one.\nLight says all new guns sold in the United States of America come with cable locks, that when used properly, prevent a gun from being fired.\nIt is the best thing that you can teach a kid,\" Light said.\nA Wichita gun expert says one part of responsible gun ownership is securing the firearm when not in use."}
