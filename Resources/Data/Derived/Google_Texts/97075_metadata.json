The story also linked to an article about SeaWorld saying that they would be cutting employee hours most likely to avoid offering employees medical insurance under ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s terrible. To many thought to convey in 140 characters. Shameful comes to mind though,\u201d Richter told BuzzFeed via Twitter.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Richter again said the use of the film for partisan political gain was \u201cshameful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe film holds a special place for a lot of people. To use the iconic poster image to further a political agenda is shameful.\u201d\n\nCongressman Tim Griffin responded on Twitter: \u201cAny word yet on whether @JasonRichter_ also thinks it\u2019s terrible that SeaWorld\u2019s employees and their families are being hurt by #Obamacare?\u201d\n\nRichter replied to Griffin \u201creally congressman? Don\u2019t you have better things to do? Go do your job, sir.\u201d\n\nThe image of the Republican graphic and the theme song to Free Willy have been embedded below:\n\nThis headline has been updated to reflect the latest developments", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2601714, "userid": 227410}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "\"Shameful comes to mind...\"..", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
