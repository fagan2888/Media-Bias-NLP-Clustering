Incidents ranged from fence jumpers taking shortcuts and intoxicated drivers crashing through barriers to mentally ill intruders looking to hop flights. None was terrorism-related.\n\nAirports say breaches are relatively rare. Security measures typically include fences, cameras and patrols, but there are gaps. Not all of the miles of fences are routinely patrolled or covered by video surveillance.\n\nDIA spokeswoman Laura Coale noted that the airport is twice the size of Manhattan.\n\n\u201cWe believe many folks do not realize they are even on airport property \u2014 it looks like farmland and a breach may be miles and miles away from a runway or the terminal,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nThe incidents DIA reported based on AP\u2019s inquiry were:\n\n\u2014 Nov. 27, 2014: An intoxicated 28-year-old man drove through a perimeter gate.\n\n\u2014 July 16, 2011: A man who said he was trying to get home climbed a security fence after failing to get off at the right bus stop.\n\n\u2014 Feb. 10, 2010: A man said he walked to the airport and climbed the security fence to get to a terminal.\n\n\u2014 April 23, 2009: A man who climbed the security fence said he was walking to work nearby.\n\n\u2014 Aug. 27, 2008: The impaired driver of a truck towing a horse trailer drove through a gate.\n\n\u2014 Oct. 27, 2006: A driver whose vehicle broke down climbed a security fence to seek assistance.\n\n\u2014 Oct. 21, 2006: A 54-year-old man said he hitchhiked to the airport and was dropped off on the wrong side of the airfield, so he jumped the security fence to get where he wanted to go.\n\n\u2014 March 15, 2004: A 41-year-old man climbed over a security fence. He told authorities he was walking in the desert after riding a bus from California to Denver.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "AP investigation details 8 Denver airport perimeter breaches", "title": "AP investigation details 8 Denver airport perimeter breaches", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/09/ap-investigation-details-8-denver-airport-perimeter-breaches/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130627__Denver-International-Airport-DIAp1.jpg", "height": 397}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130627__Denver-International-Airport-DIAp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-09T13:38:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T11:02:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver Jail"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca367\"", "article_summary": "The AP found there have been at least 268 perimeter security breaches at 31 major U.S. airports from January 2004 through January 2015.\n\u2014 March 15, 2004: A 41-year-old man climbed over a security fence.\n\u2014 Feb. 10, 2010: A man said he walked to the airport and climbed the security fence to get to a terminal.\n\u2014 April 23, 2009: A man who climbed the security fence said he was walking to work nearby.\n\u2014 Oct. 27, 2006: A driver whose vehicle broke down climbed a security fence to seek assistance."}
