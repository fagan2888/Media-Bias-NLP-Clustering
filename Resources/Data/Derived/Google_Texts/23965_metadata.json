Sarah Palin (R-AK), the 2008 GOP vice-presidential nominee.\n\nAccording to Limbaugh, what he deemed to be the \u201cTrump Coalition\u201d predated the Trump\u2019s presidential bid and its roots lie in the Tea Party movement that was inspired by President Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus and later by his so-called health care reform legislation, later to be known as ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cGuess where they are now? They\u2019re with Donald Trump,\u201d Limbaugh said.\n\nTranscript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh.com):\n\nYou know, this business of the glue. That\u2019s what I refer to. The glue that is holding Trump coalition together. This actually predates the Trump campaign. This goes back to who the Tea Party is, if you want to know the truth about it, folks. Everybody made the mistake of thinking when the Tea Party erupted out of nowhere \u2014 and let\u2019s not forget \u2014 by the way, by the way, welcome back. Rush Limbaugh. Great to have you here at the EIB Network at 800-282-2882.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget, the Tea Party was not the result of some strategic plan launched by somebody out of nowhere. It was a spontaneous eruption of mostly people that had never been professionally, formally involved in politics before. It dates to the Obama stimulus deal in 2009 but really began to coalesce with Obamacare. Those two things sent the big message to the Tea Party people, what would become known as the Tea Party people. That is, there was no longer any concern for what this government was spending. There was no longer any concern for the danger that that was going to cause. There was no longer any pretense of responsible budgeting, keeping public taxpayer money in check, used responsibly, none, it was all out the window.\n\nAnd people erupted in a combination of fear and outrage and anger over it. It was a betrayal. It was irresponsible. It was unresponsive to what people had voted for, what they thought they were going to get, and it was destructive. It was going to take the financial futures away from millions of people\u2019s children and grandchildren. And so the Tea Party was born. And the mistake was made right off the bat by the Drive-By Media and many inside the Beltway that the Tea Party was all conservatives.\n\nThey wanted it to be all conservatives because they already then had their built-in mechanisms to impugn it. The left, the Democrat Party, and many in the Republican Party had already developed ways to mock, make fun of, impugn conservatives and conservatism for years. So here comes this new group of people. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll just call \u2019em conservatives, made of angry white men, racists, sexists, a bunch of bigots,\u201d and that\u2019s who they became, that\u2019s what they \u2014 well, that\u2019s not who they were. That\u2019s what the effort to define them became.\n\nAt the same time, the Democrats, \u201cYou know what, we need our own group. We can\u2019t let this stand.\u201d So they created Occupy Wall Street. That was a totally artificial, manufactured, bought and paid for rent-a-mob put together by the left and the Democrat Party made to look like it erupted spontaneously in response to the Tea Party, and it was made out to be much bigger and much more refined and organized and all that. And it was not. It was fake from beginning to end.\n\nOccupy Wall Street, I mean, they did real things, but their existence was entirely fake. There was nothing spontaneous about it. There was nothing natural about it. So from the get-go, the Republican establishment as well, mystifying me from day one, started making fun of and ragging on the Tea Party, right along with the Democrats. The Democrats led the charge on it along with the media. A bunch of hayseeds, bunch of hicks, you know, the usual ad hominem attacks.\n\nAnd all this is happening while Obama\u2019s getting health care up and running. Not a single Republican vote. There was a built-in majority coalition for the Republican Party to link to and join up with. The Tea Party consisted of not just Republicans, and it wasn\u2019t just conservatives. The Tea Party was made up of people who were apolitical. They had not been involved in politics one way or the other, other than voting, ever. They\u2019d never been to town hall meetings, none of it. They were scared, they were fed up, and they wanted somebody to know about it. They didn\u2019t feel like they were being listened to or heard or taken into account.\n\nSo they started getting involved. And then when the years went by, the public perception was the Tea Party disbanded. Where\u2019s the Tea Party? Nobody talked about it anymore. The Tea Party had a bunch of groups that were organized back in the day, and they were out raising money and doing conventions and none of that seemed to be happening anymore, so the assumption was made that the Tea Party just kind of faded away, as it was going to \u2019cause it was never real in the first place, they said. It was never gonna have any staying power \u2019cause it\u2019s just average citizens, they were just anger on a lark, but they\u2019re over it now, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nNot a chance any of that was right. As Obama kept being Obama, the people in the Tea Party kept getting angrier. Remember, they tried to organize into tax-exempt foundations, fundraising. Hello IRS, not permitting it, shutting them down. That\u2019s another thing that led to people thinking the Tea Party was fading away and disbanding.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party had this built-in majority coalition to join up, and they never did, because they thought it was a bunch of conservatives. And they didn\u2019t want any part of \u2019em. They have continually overestimated who their base is. The Tea Party had a lot of Democrats in it. The Tea Party had a lot of minorities. The Tea Party had a bunch of people from a cross section, a demographic cross section. But you don\u2019t know that because you were told it was nothing but a malcontent conservatives and disaffected Republicans and what have you, because it was easier to criticize \u2019em that way.\n\nIt was easier to make fun of \u2019em. It was easier to ridicule them and mock them. Because they\u2019d had years of experience doing it. \u201cWe\u2019ll just call \u2019em bunch of conservatives and nobody will take \u2019em seriously.\u201d Well, guess where they are now? They\u2019re with Donald Trump, is where they are now. And if you have any doubt about that, if you\u2019re wondering why would Sarah Palin, just like our last call, Sarah Palin didn\u2019t endorse Trump to advance conservatism. That\u2019s not what this is about.\n\nThere\u2019s so many missed opportunities for the Republican Party here. It\u2019s actually frightening to make a list of \u2019em all. The Republican Party could be owning the show. The Republican Party could have won the White House in 2012. The Republican Party could be a governing majority party except they don\u2019t want anything to do with conservatism. Not really. If they did, the political landscape would be an entirely different looking landscape today.\n\nI know the Republican Party mocked the Tea Party. They worked with the Democrats and the media to smear them, just like is happening now with the Trump coalition. The key point here is who they are. As I have been trying to say, the majority of Trump\u2019s support base are not Republican conservatives. There are a lot of them, but it\u2019s not the majority.\n\nRemember last week we learned 20% of Trump\u2019s supporters are disaffected blue-collar Democrats? Twenty percent who are admitting it. There\u2019s probably many more. Trump\u2019s got his share of Hispanics, his share of African-Americans, females. That\u2019s bad news for Hillary. Hillary, I mean, let\u2019s call a spade a spade. The vast majority of American men don\u2019t want any part of Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s why she has to get as much support from women as she can. She can\u2019t survive without it, because the men of America aren\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t want \u2014 it isn\u2019t gonna happen.
