He was named president and CEO of the Institute For Diversity in Health Management of the American Hospital Association on April 22. Previously, Le\u00f3n served as president and CEO of the People of Color Network Inc. in Phoenix. A different kind of melting pot:\n\nTom\u00e1s is an amateur gourmet chef, with a particular interest in all foods Asian. He is \u201cdrawn to the creativity of melding flavors together and the fellowship that breaking bread with others brings,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also a way for me to have work\u2013life balance.\u201d\n\n\n\nFun fact:\n\nTom\u00e1s was an aspiring major league baseball player, starting as an all-star American Legion player and continuing at the University of Arizona.\n\nTom\u00e1s Le\u00f3n has been leading the Institute for Diversity in Health Management for less than a year, but he has a deep understanding of the challenges facing America\u2019s many different minority communities. | Interviewed by Jon Asplund\n\nHow did your upbringing teach you about diversity and that all people have an equal chance to succeed?\n\nLe\u00f3n: I grew up pretty poor in a barrio of Tucson, Ariz. Tough neighborhood, humble beginnings; there were eight of us in a two-bedroom house. I was youngest and my bedroom was the living room floor, I graduated to the couch and then eventually I got my own room when I got to high school after everybody moved out. We didn\u2019t realize how tough it was because we had all the basics. My parents were very loving and supportive and we had food and a roof over our heads. We just learned how to be resilient with very little and to make the most of what we had.\n\nI have four children, the oldest is 27. I am 47 so, if you do the math, I was a young teenage parent. It was one of my earlier challenges of overcoming labels and discrimination and having people look at me as just a statistic. I have a son who is 20, and two daughters, 16 and 8. So it\u2019s almost like my wife and I raised four generations! They keep you young, they keep your feet on the ground and they keep you aspiring to do more.\n\nI call my story, \u201cFrom the Barrio to the Boardroom.\u201d It\u2019s been my path, my journey.\n\nHow did you make it out of the barrio in the first place?\n\nLe\u00f3n: One of the things that was instrumental in helping me make my way out of the barrio was athletics. I was a baseball player. It took me all around the state, the region and the world. It paid for my education. It introduced me to coaches who were mentors to me and helped me to stay away from bad influences in the barrio. It helped me learn how to work with a team, set goals, how to come back from adversity \u2014 all of the leadership skills that are essential for success. I led our American Legion team to the championship as a teenager and we went to regionals in California where I met kids from all over America. I was recruited by a team to play in the Goodwill Games in Australia.\n\nSo, at age 16, here I am flying halfway around the world to go live with Australian host families for a month. It exposed me to traveling, to other cultures, to living with other families, and it gave me a sense of independence as well as a connectedness to the larger world around me.\n\nOne of the most memorable experiences was not on the baseball diamond. It was when my friend from Hawaii and I walked in to the Sydney Opera House to hear a youth choir perform. Here are two kids who grew up in different parts of America in tough conditions and poverty standing in this world landmark, listening to other kids our age performing in a symphony and chorus. It made me realize that anything was possible for us. It really is key to where I am today.\n\nHow will you help health care increase minority representation in its highest ranks?\n\nLe\u00f3n: I\u2019m working on prioritizing in this new position in the ways I\u2019ve learned to set priorities over the years. You need to be resilient and to work with the changes going on and to see them through. It\u2019s not for the weak in the knees. You have to be creative and develop strategies that will be innovative and will respond to what\u2019s going on around you.\n\nMy priorities are, one, focus on assessing the organization, streamlining operations and scale up our programs so we can have greater impact and scale across the health care system.\n\nThe second priority is the 123forEquity Pledge to Act campaign. It\u2019s a national call to action for hospital and health care leaders to accelerate progress in several goal areas: (1) increase the collection and use of real data about race, ethnicity and language to improve quality, safety and patient experience, and satisfaction; (2) increase cultural competency training at all levels to improve the mindset and skillset of the workforce to deliver more culturally competent care; and (3) increase diversity in leadership and governance structures.\n\nThe Institute and the American Hospital Association can\u2019t do this alone. My third priority is strengthening and diversifying our partnerships across the country. We\u2019re all trying to change the way the health care system works. Payment models are changing, how we deliver care is evolving, and we\u2019re all trying to achieve the Triple Aim.\n\nWe can\u2019t achieve the Triple Aim if we don\u2019t eliminate health disparities. If you have overall great survey results, but you dig deeper and your data tell you that some patients still experience disparities, you haven\u2019t transformed the health system. It\u2019s a coalition; we can only do that through partnerships.\n\nIs the challenge to show how disparities hurt the health care system, or to make changes to eliminate them?\n\nLe\u00f3n: There\u2019s no more debate, it is an imperative. We need a more equitable health system that delivers culturally competent care \u2014 because the population is diversifying. [People of color] are going to become a majority population by 2044, according to the Census Bureau. We\u2019re already at 37 percent minority. So we\u2019re no longer debating the rationale. When you adjust for economic status, age and other factors, there\u2019s still tremendous disparity. So the debate is: What strategies are going to be most successful in eliminating the disparities?\n\nHow does a health care system go about changing the makeup of its leadership?\n\nLe\u00f3n: It all starts with what\u2019s the priority of that hospital or health system. They need to understand how they are defining diversity and how they make sure they are reflecting the community they serve. Leadership needs to be intentional about saying, \u2018Hey, it really is important for us to reflect the community, because we want to relate and connect and understand what community needs are so we can better deliver culturally competent care.\u2019\n\nAnd the makeup of the board is very important to reflect the community. So, the board needs to first be very intentional about setting this as a priority, then it needs to set some metrics for diversity and evaluate the way it recruits board members and who it partners with to find board members. It is all about changing the mindset and the way board members are recruited.\n\nWe would like to see, through the national call to action, a marked improvement by 2020 when we do the benchmark survey. We would like to see, at minimum, 20 percent representation at the governance level and 20 percent representation at the leadership level.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried to make the pledge and the goals real clear, simple and actionable. And by the time we survey, it\u2019s an easily remembered 20/20 for the year 2020.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tomas Leon discusses his priorities as president of the Institute for Diversity", "csrf-token": "x99znYrcJgwex6HBBxNiDONCac6ilXivjvR4x0ELuH8=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/September/Interview_sept15_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "description": "Tom&aacute;s Le&oacute;n explains his priorities for the Institute for Diversity in Health Management", "card": "summary", "title": "Diversity in Health Management Leader Gives Insight on Leading Minority Communities"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/September/Interview_sept15_190x127.jpg?1448315759", "type": "Article", "description": "Tom&aacute;s Le&oacute;n explains his priorities for the Institute for Diversity in Health Management", "title": "Diversity in Health Management Leader Gives Insight on Leading Minority Communities"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "Tomas Leon, IFD, Institute for Diversity, health care diversity, workforce diversity, leadership diversity, health care disparities, minorities, ethnic", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffd1\"", "article_summary": "Is the challenge to show how disparities hurt the health care system, or to make changes to eliminate them?\nHow does a health care system go about changing the makeup of its leadership?\nIt is all about changing the mindset and the way board members are recruited.\nWe\u2019re all trying to change the way the health care system works.\nMy priorities are, one, focus on assessing the organization, streamlining operations and scale up our programs so we can have greater impact and scale across the health care system."}
