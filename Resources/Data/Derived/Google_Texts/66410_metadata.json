Except for opposition to President Obama, what do these people have in common?\n\nThe latest GOP fight is over how to express meaningless, ineffectual rejection of the president\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. The House leadership was ready to offer a simple resolution of disapproval, which the big Republican majority could easily pass. It might not clear the Senate\u2019s 60-vote margin \u2014 and if it did, Obama would exercise his veto. Still, the House\u2019s view would be on record.\n\nBut no, that would be too easy. Rebellious far-right members balked, favoring instead a set of three related bills meant to voice, I suppose, extra-special triple disapproval. One measure would accuse the president, absurdly, of making some kind of secret side-deal with Iran. Another would block Obama from lifting sanctions. The third would ask the House to approve the deal rather than disapprove it \u2014 a way of forcing Democrats to vote affirmatively for a controversial policy.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how such an overstuffed package would be received in the Senate. But it\u2019s crystal clear that even if some or all of it passed both chambers, Obama would use his veto and that would be that. With 42 senators on record as supporting the deal, the president could not be overridden.\n\nPlus, the three-headed approach is illogical. The whole point is to give Republicans in Congress a chance to show their rejection of the agreement. Passing a resolution saying \u201cwe don\u2019t like the deal\u201d would at least accomplish that symbolic goal. Voting down a resolution that says \u201cwe like it just fine\u201d is not quite the same thing.\n\nWhy did Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and his team agree to even consider taking this roundabout route to nowhere? Perhaps because two presidential candidates \u2014 billionaire Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) \u2014 headlined a rally Wednesday at the Capitol to rail against the Iran pact and charge that the GOP establishment is not fighting hard enough to thwart the president. Mentions of Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) drew boos from the passionate crowd.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new for House Republicans to tilt at windmills; they\u2019ve passed more than 50 bills repealing all or part of the Affordable Care Act, not one of which had the slightest effect. But this long-standing disagreement over legislative tactics is hardly the only schism dividing the GOP these days.\n\nNow, thanks largely to front-runner Trump, there is also an increasingly sharp divide over economic policy. Plutocrats, free-traders and supply-siders are on the defensive \u2014 and rapidly losing ground.\n\nTrump, of course, is an unabashed plutocrat. But his ideas about the economy are pure heresy, as far as the party establishment is concerned. He believes the rich should pay more in taxes. He complains that free-trade agreements have been disastrous for American workers. He defends entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security. He charges that his opponents for the nomination are bought and paid for by powerful corporate interests.\n\nThe keepers of Republican orthodoxy, such as the Club for Growth, and the party\u2019s donor class are aghast. But Trump\u2019s message is definitely connecting with GOP voters.\n\nHow can I be so sure? Because the most establishment-friendly candidate of them all, Jeb Bush, issued a tax-reform plan this week that would eliminate the \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole. That\u2019s the sweet gimmick that allows wealthy hedge-fund managers and some other investors to pay taxes at a lower rate than their limousine drivers.\n\n\u201cThe new normal is a comfortable ride for the affluent people that live off their portfolios,\u201d Bush said at a factory in North Carolina. \u201cMy plan will help those who live on their paychecks, who haven\u2019t seen a raise in a while.\u201d\n\nI repeat: That\u2019s not socialist Bernie Sanders talking. It\u2019s Jeb, the patrician-born presidential scion.\n\nMeanwhile, the intra-party fight over immigration continues. Trump, again, threw the first haymaker with his proposal to deport 11 million undocumented men, women and children. The idea is cruel, completely unworkable, probably fatal in the general election \u2014 and quite popular with the Republican base.\n\nEstablishment-backed candidates have been forced to denounce reasonable solutions on immigration and come out in favor of border walls that will never be built. But many GOP voters have deeper questions about the impact of large-scale immigration.\n\nIt\u2019s healthy for a party to have robust internal debate \u2014 but not to devolve into a giant political fight club.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
