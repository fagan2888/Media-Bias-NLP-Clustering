The average tax credit in Virginia for those purchasing through the marketplace in 2014 was $263 per person per month, for an average premium of $93, according to the government's report.\n\nThis year, more than half of the sign-ups were new customers. Meanwhile, of re-enrollees, 1.2 million took an active role in updating and selecting plans, according to Griffis. As yet, it's unknown how many of the millions who were automatically re-enrolled intend to continue with their current coverage. \"That will become apparent later in the spring,\" said Meena Seshamani of the Office of Health Reform.\n\n(Kaitlin McKeown/Daily Press)\n\nMeanwhile, as people file their taxes, they're learning if they owe a penalty or not, either for not purchasing coverage in 2014, or for earning more than they estimated. \"We tell them what the penalties will be in the future \u2014 in the $1,800-$1,900 range \u2014 we tell them the consequences,\" said Steuart Kimmeth of H&R Block tax service.\n\nThough most clients have insurance through their employers, he said, he has counseled some seeking exemptions. There are many in Virginia who are exempt from the requirement to purchase insurance and from the associated penalty, including the hundreds of thousands who fall into the coverage gap created by the General Assembly's refusal to expand Medicaid.\n\nAt the Hampton office of Enroll Virginia!, the government's outreach program, navigator Jamila Allen is delighted with the extended enrollment period. \"The government has opened up a window. It's awesome,\" she said, citing several clients who had filed taxes recently and just realized they'd be penalized. To take advantage, people have to certify that they didn't know, she said.\n\nTo enroll, go to http://www.healthcare.gov.\n\nSalasky can be reached by phone at 757-247-4784.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Feds extend deadline for Affordable Care Act sign-ups", "Description": "Still time to sign up for health insurance to avoid 2015 penalty", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Daily Press", "author": "Daily Press", "og": {"site_name": "dailypress.com", "description": "Almost 11.7 million Americans nationwide have enrolled in family or individual health insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces, federal officials announced Tuesday.", "title": "Feds extend deadline for Affordable Care Act sign-ups", "url": "http://www.dailypress.com/health/dp-nws-aca-extended-signup-20150310-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54ff8e86/turbine/dp-nws-aca-extended-signup-20150310", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.15", "twitter": {"site": "@daily_press", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=397500600, app-argument=http://www.dailypress.com/deeplinkid/83025581", "fb": {"page_id": 140388628320, "app_id": 515474311837346}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-10", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "Almost 11.7 million Americans nationwide have enrolled in family or individual health insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces, federal officials announced Tuesday.\nFor most Virginians shopping through the federally facilitated marketplace, those options include paying less than $100 a month in premiums.\nAs yet, it's unknown how many of the millions who were automatically re-enrolled intend to continue with their current coverage.\n\"We'll do everything we can to let people know about affordable options.\"\nAt the Hampton office of Enroll Virginia!, the government's outreach program, navigator Jamila Allen is delighted with the extended enrollment period."}
