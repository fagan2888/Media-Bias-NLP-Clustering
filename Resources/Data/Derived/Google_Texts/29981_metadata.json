Forty-two percent (42%) are opposed to a state lawsuit of this kind. Thirteen percent (13%) are undecided.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these 20 states also have some of the largest illegal immigrant populations and are slated to be among those most affected by the measure.\n\nTexas and Florida have the two densest populations of illegal aliens after California. According to the Pew Research Center, Idaho will also take a heavy hit:\n\nIdaho, where 46% of the state\u2019s unauthorized immigrant population is eligible for deportation relief, tops all other states on this measure. Other states with at least four-in-ten eligible immigrants include Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nIt seems that it did not take very long for Americans to realize that Obama's new \"common-sense, middle-ground approach\" on immigration was, in fact, just another leftist power play.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Twenty states have now joined Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (R) in a federal lawsuit to challenge President Obama's executive immigration overhaul..05/26/2016 4:08:01AM EST.", "author": "Sarah Jean Seman", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Twenty states have now joined Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (R) in a federal lawsuit to challenge President Obama's executive immigration overhaul.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Poll: Americans Favor Suing Obama For Immigration Overhaul", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/12/08/americans-lean-in-favor-of-nixing-obama-immigration-plan-n1928982", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/330/2014-11-26T152328Z_1_LYNXNPEAAP0S4_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Twenty states have now joined Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott (R) in a federal lawsuit to challenge President Obama's executive immigration overhaul.", "title": "Sarah Jean Seman - Poll: Americans Favor Suing Obama For Immigration Overhaul", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/sarahjeanseman/2014/12/08/americans-lean-in-favor-of-nixing-obama-immigration-plan-n1928982", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/330/2014-11-26T152328Z_1_LYNXNPEAAP0S4_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: Americans Favor Suing Obama For Immigration Overhaul, Sarah Jean Seman, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7d8\"", "article_summary": "Voters favor their state suing the administration over this new immigration policy, according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey.\nIn the eyes of the American people, the scales are tipped slightly in favor of the lawsuit, according to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll:Forty-five percent (45%) of Likely U.S.\nTwenty states have now joined Attorney General Greg Abbott (R-TX) in a federal lawsuit to challenge President Obama\u2019s executive immigration overhaul.\nOther states with at least four-in-ten eligible immigrants include Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\nForty-two percent (42%) are opposed to a state lawsuit of this kind."}
