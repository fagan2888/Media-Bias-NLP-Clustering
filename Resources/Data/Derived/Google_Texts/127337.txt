Tyson Foods says it will permanently close its pepperoni plant in Jefferson in July.



Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson announced last November it's closing the Wisconsin plant along with one in Chicago.



Tyson has notified the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development that the Jefferson plant will close its doors on July 9.



The plant makes sliced pepperoni and ham for pizza toppings, as well as sliced pepperoni and salami for deli and food service applications.



Tyson said the decision to close the plant was based on changing product needs, the age of the plant and prohibitive costs to renovate it.



The closure affects 248 salaried and hourly workers.
