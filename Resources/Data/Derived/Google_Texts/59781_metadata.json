The Broncos\u2019 star quarterback was hoping to play in this year\u2019s Pro Bowl, too, but a late-season quad injury wouldn\u2019t allow him.\n\nManning notified the NFL office Sunday morning that he will not be able to participate in the Pro Bowl next Sunday in Glendale, Ariz. because of the quad that bothered him through the final month of the season and clearly affected his performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to be selected to the Pro Bowl, and I\u2019ve always taken the obligation to play in it very seriously,\u201d Manning told the Denver Post. \u201cI\u2019ve believed that, if healthy, it\u2019s a player\u2019s responsibility to play in the game because of what it means to be voted in by your peers and the fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that I\u2019m just not healthy enough this year to be part of it. It\u2019s going to be tough not being down there with the other guys, but it hasn\u2019t had enough time to heal.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos had a league-most 10 players named to the Pro Bowl this season, although that number is dwindling. Besides Manning, star receiver Demaryius Thomas has also opted out. Thomas is eligible for free agency which makes the Pro Bowl a dangerous proposition, but he also played through ankle and finger injuries in the final weeks of the regular season.\n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if Broncos tight end Julius Thomas, another free agent who hobbled through an ankle injury in the second half of the season, had second thoughts about playing in his second consecutive Pro Bowl.\n\nManning has proven that if he is able, he will play. He has been named to 14 Pro Bowls, two more than the second-most honored quarterback, Brett Favre, and tied with center Bruce Matthews and tight end Tony Gonzalez for the most among players at any position.\n\nManning had played in 11 previous games, missing only the Pro Bowls in 2010 and 2014 when he was in conflict with the following week\u2019s Super Bowl.\n\nManning sustained his quad injury late in the first half of the Broncos\u2019 22-10 win at San Diego on Dec. 14. Despite the injury, Manning missed only the last four snaps of the half, returned for the second half and didn\u2019t miss a play in the final 3 \u00bd games of the season due to the quad (backup Brock Osweiler played the final series in a blowout win against Oakland in the season finale).\n\nManning earned his latest Pro Bowl nomination after he finished second in the NFL this season with 39 touchdown passes, fourth with 4,727 passing yards and fourth with a 101.5 passer rating.\n\nNow that he\u2019s dealt with the Pro Bowl, Manning must now decide whether to return for his fourth season with the Broncos, 18th overall in the league. He is expected to make his decision before the 2015 free-agent market opens March 10, which is two weeks before his 39th birthday.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning, Demaryius Thomas to miss Pro Bowl with injuries", "title": "Peyton Manning, Demaryius Thomas to miss Pro Bowl with injuries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/18/peyton-manning-demaryius-thomas-to-miss-pro-bowl-with-injuries/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-18T07:15:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-18T07:15:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3d6\"", "article_summary": "Yet, the last game Manning played in 2011 was the NFL Pro Bowl in late January.\nEven with more Pro Bowl berths than any quarterback in NFL history, Manning has never taken the honor for granted.\nThe Broncos\u2019 star quarterback was hoping to play in this year\u2019s Pro Bowl, too, but a late-season quad injury wouldn\u2019t allow him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to be selected to the Pro Bowl, and I\u2019ve always taken the obligation to play in it very seriously,\u201d Manning told the Denver Post.\nNow that he\u2019s dealt with the Pro Bowl, Manning must now decide whether to return for his fourth season with the Broncos, 18th overall in the league."}
