Cars fared the same fate. Some drivers found themselves in too deep.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had cars stall in the water and having to be dug out. If it gets much higher, it will be in the apartments,\u201d said Schreiner.\n\nIn Fort Myers, a viewer sent in video of a very wet drive down College Parkway near US-41.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a rainy season at this time, and people\u2019s homes are in danger of being flooded,\u201d said Matthew Burton of Fort Myers Beach.\n\nBesides those out for a casual canoe or bike ride, many from Fort Myers to Naples are becoming concerned with the amount of rain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a little bit of trouble,\u201d said Schreiner. \u201cWe\u2019re worried that we can\u2019t get rid of this water because people live here and have to drive through it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Parts of Southwest Florida are seeing a lot of rain. \u00a0The rain has been steady in Bonita Springs, Estero, Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral and Naples.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/29631172/flooding-in-parts-of-southwest-florida", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Parts of Southwest Florida are seeing a lot of rain. \u00a0The rain has been steady in Bonita Springs, Estero, Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral and Naples.", "title": "Flooding in parts of Southwest Florida"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/8402966_G.jpg", "description": "Parts of Southwest Florida are seeing a lot of rain. \u00a0The rain has been steady in Bonita Springs, Estero, Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral and Naples.", "card": "summary", "title": "Flooding in parts of Southwest Florida"}, "wnreadableurl": "flooding-in-parts-of-southwest-florida", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WZVN", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "date": "2015/07/25", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS07"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6d5\"", "article_summary": "The rain has been steady in Bonita Springs, Estero, Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral and Naples.\nIn Fort Myers, a viewer sent in video of a very wet drive down College Parkway near US-41.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a rainy season at this time, and people\u2019s homes are in danger of being flooded,\u201d said Matthew Burton of Fort Myers Beach.\nBesides those out for a casual canoe or bike ride, many from Fort Myers to Naples are becoming concerned with the amount of rain.\nAs rain continues to fall in Southwest Florida, many are dealing with the soggy conditions."}
