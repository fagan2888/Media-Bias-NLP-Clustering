He dubbed her a dishonest tax-and-spend liberal, while she dubbed him someone known for \u201cbreaking the rules to benefit himself.\u201d\n\nIn one of the most notable exchanges, Poliquin ducked questions from moderator Pat Callaghan about a controversy that dogged him in office.\n\nIn 2012, he was criticized for putting 10 acres of his coastal estate in Georgetown in a state tax-break program meant to encourage commercial logging, which a deed largely restricted. In 2010, he paid $21 in taxes on that plot.\n\nHe was never found to have violated any rules and he later moved it out of the program, but criticism has followed. Callaghan asked twice if he acted ethically. He never directly answered.\n\n\u201cI have always paid my taxes, all the time, Pat, in full,\u201d he replied, in a variation of a line he repeated often in the debate.\n\nHe pivoted back to Cain as much as possible, going particularly after perceived inconsistencies in Cain\u2019s claims about taxes.\n\nAs she has in ads, Cain took partial credit for negotiating a budget with legislative Republicans that passed in 2011. It contained an income tax cut that most Democrats opposed at the time. In a meeting with the Portland Press Herald\u2019s editorial board in 2011, Cain said that her Democratic caucus \u201chates these tax cuts.\u201d\n\nPoliquin also criticized her for voting for a package of tax changes in 2009 that would have lowered income taxes and applied Maine\u2019s sales tax to scores of services if it hadn\u2019t been repealed by Maine voters in 2010.\n\nHe said instead of attacks on his background, her record should be the main issue in the race.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about your record, which is a record of higher taxes, more debt, more welfare and less jobs, and then let\u2019s let the viewers decide who they\u2019d like?\u201d he asked her.\n\nBut Cain stood by her record, hitting back at him by criticizing his past reticence to raise Maine\u2019s minimum wage and his support of raising retirement ages for future Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t that you\u2019ve been successful in business. The problem is that you now want to make it harder for other people in our state,\u201d she said.\n\nThursday\u2019s hard-charging debate wasn\u2019t supposed to be the last in the race to replace U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud, a Democrat running for governor.\n\nBut on Thursday, WMTW, a Portland-area ABC affiliate, canceled its Tuesday debate after Cain told the network she wouldn\u2019t come because Richardson wasn\u2019t invited, sticking to a promise she made at a joint news conference with the independent in July.\n\nA Critical Insights poll of nearly 300 voters released last week put Poliquin five points ahead of Cain with 16 percent of voters undecided.\n\nSo Thursday\u2019s closing statements were the candidates\u2019 last appeals on the same stage to try to win that share of the electorate. Cain touted her bipartisan work in the Legislature as an antidote to a divided Congress.\n\n\u201cYou can make that choice or a choice of someone who\u2019s just known for breaking the rules to benefit himself,\u201d she said.\n\nPoliquin countered by highlighting his business experience, saying Cain would champion \u201cextreme\u201d policies that would hurt the district.\n\n\u201cBut if you want someone to go to Washington and help fix the mess and create jobs, I\u2019m a much better choice,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Thursday night debate in the close race for Maine's 2nd Congressional District put claims about the candidates' backgrounds on full display in a frenetic half-hour.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "A Thursday night debate in the close race for Maine's 2nd Congressional District put claims about the candidates' backgrounds on full display in a frenetic half-hour.", "title": "Final TV debate between Poliquin, Cain gets nasty - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poliquin-cain-richardson.jpg", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-10-24T09:27:00-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/10/23/final-tv-debate-between-poliquin-cain-gets-nasty/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poliquin-cain-richardson.jpg", "description": "A Thursday night debate in the close race for Maine's 2nd Congressional District put claims about the candidates' backgrounds on full display in a frenetic half-hour.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Final TV debate between Poliquin, Cain gets nasty - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Congressional District 2 race", "published_time": "2014-10-23T21:13:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T09:27:00-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a01\"", "article_summary": "The claims exchanged between Cain, an Orono state senator, and Poliquin, a former state treasurer from Oakland, weren\u2019t new.\nPORTLAND \u2014 A half-hour debate between Republican Bruce Poliquin and Democrat Emily Cain, the candidates running a close race in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, got nasty quickly Thursday night.\nPoliquin countered by highlighting his business experience, saying Cain would champion \u201cextreme\u201d policies that would hurt the district.\nA Critical Insights poll of nearly 300 voters released last week put Poliquin five points ahead of Cain with 16 percent of voters undecided.\nHe pivoted back to Cain as much as possible, going particularly after perceived inconsistencies in Cain\u2019s claims about taxes."}
