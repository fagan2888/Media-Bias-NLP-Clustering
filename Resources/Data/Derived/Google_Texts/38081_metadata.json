Shares rose 3.9 percent in after-hours trade to $85.75.\n\nThe China unit is Yum's top profit-driver. Its spinoff has garnered intense interest, attracting high-profile potential suitors and sparking speculation that the deal will fetch a rich valuation.\n\n\"Yum China will get a better valuation as same-store sales accelerate,\" said Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\n\nSales at China restaurants open at least one year rose 6 percent in the first quarter, Yum said on Wednesday.\n\nChina KFC restaurants, the majority of the 7,205 stores in the division, posted a 12 percent rise in same-store sales while the smaller Pizza Hut Casual Dining posted a 12 percent decline. Analysts had expected a 5.5 percent gain in KFC China and a 3.7 percent drop at Pizza Hut China.\n\nSales at China restaurants open at least one year had risen 2 percent for both the third and fourth quarters of last year, and analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected Yum to report a 2.1 percent gain for the China region, where it is the biggest Western restaurant operator.\n\nYum also said that the separation of the China business was on track for completion by year-end.\n\nTotal revenue was steady at $2.6 billion. Net income rose to $391 million or 93 cents per diluted share from $362 million or 81 cents per share a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share of 95 cents topped the 83-cent Wall Street consensus as calculated by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nShares of Yum have gained 13 percent so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 as well as the stocks of both Starbucks Corp and McDonald's Corp.\n\nYum representatives declined to comment on the spinoff. Company executives will host a conference call with analysts and investors on Thursday morning.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Peter Henderson in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc's China sales accelerated faster than Wall Street expected", "title": "Yum sales jump in China in first quarter, boosted by KFC", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Yum-sales-China-restaurants-rise-6-percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/yum-brands-results_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Yum-sales-China-restaurants-rise-6-percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/yum-brands-results_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc's China sales accelerated faster than Wall Street expected", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Analysts had expected a 5.5 percent gain in KFC China and a 3.7 percent drop at Pizza Hut China.\nSales at China restaurants open at least one year rose 6 percent in the first quarter, Yum said on Wednesday.\n\"Yum China will get a better valuation as same-store sales accelerate,\" said Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\nChina KFC restaurants, the majority of the 7,205 stores in the division, posted a 12 percent rise in same-store sales while the smaller Pizza Hut Casual Dining posted a 12 percent decline.\n(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc's China sales accelerated faster than Wall Street expected in the first quarter, helped by Chinese New Year KFC chicken bucket promotions, marking an auspicious start to a year in which the company plans to spin off its China unit."}
