The website Real Clear Politics keeps a running average of various polls, and its average of questions asking what Americans think of the country\u2019s direction shows some 62 percent believe we\u2019re headed in the wrong direction.\n\nThat\u2019s not an all-time high \u2013 the figure was up in the 80s in the weeks before the 2008 election, and stood at 76.5 percent in October 2011 \u2013 but it suggests that the electorate is in a wary mood.\n\nThere is a sense that America is adrift, that we don\u2019t quite know how to deal with the forces of globalization, technological change, economic uncertainty, or terrorism. Americans are looking for a leader who can restore confidence.\n\nThe economy in particular weighs on ordinary Americans\u2019 minds. There\u2019s widespread agreement that the growing economy has done very little to help people of ordinary income \u2013 not just in recent years, but really for the past generation.\n\nAmericans may feel better about the economy now than they did a few years ago, but that hasn\u2019t lessened their long-term anxiety that it\u2019s harder than ever to get ahead, and certainly harder than it was in their parents\u2019 generation.\n\nStill, the improving economy may be responsible for one interesting aspect of the campaign: Republicans thus far have made national security a centerpiece issue \u2013 perhaps responding to polling that shows that Republican voters consider it a key factor in deciding among the plethora of GOP candidates.\n\nThis emphasis could change with world events, but right now, candidates are pressing the argument that President Obama is not tough enough when it comes to foreign policy; they don\u2019t think highly of his leadership in the world, and in particular want to see more of a military buildup.\n\nIt\u2019s a little less clear what they want to do with that military power.\n\nOf course, national security and terrorism aren\u2019t the only issues that figure prominently in the Republicans\u2019 array of issues. So do the budget deficit, cutting taxes, and, as always, pulling back on the reach of government.\n\nThey want to eliminate Obamacare as well as to cut Medicaid, move Medicare to a voucher system, repeal the estate tax, cut domestic programs, roll back financial reform and efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and eliminate further consumer protections.\n\nFor the Democrats, meanwhile, addressing income inequality, maintaining Social Security and other entitlements, improving the country\u2019s decaying infrastructure, job creation, college costs, immigration and energy reform, and climate change all loom large.\n\nThey want to preserve Obamacare, move forward on climate change, retain taxes on high-income earners, and preserve the financial reforms of the past decade.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 SaukValley.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.saukvalley.com/2015/07/09/2016-campaign-promises-to-be-interesting/aknkrdm/", "image": "http://www.saukvalley.com/_internal/cimg!0/6ihgd852de7lu30ybxm1bj05d7poze5", "site_name": "SaukValley.com", "title": "2016 campaign promises to be interesting"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "tout": {"article": {"id": "807d4e31-c970-4cf8-8079-86e698a0649c"}}, "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Of course, national security and terrorism aren\u2019t the only issues that figure prominently in the Republicans\u2019 array of issues.\nThey want to preserve Obamacare, move forward on climate change, retain taxes on high-income earners, and preserve the financial reforms of the past decade.\nThe website Real Clear Politics keeps a running average of various polls, and its average of questions asking what Americans think of the country\u2019s direction shows some 62 percent believe we\u2019re headed in the wrong direction.\nSo do the budget deficit, cutting taxes, and, as always, pulling back on the reach of government.\nThere is a sense that America is adrift, that we don\u2019t quite know how to deal with the forces of globalization, technological change, economic uncertainty, or terrorism."}
