DJ Chuck Buckle was showing me the ropes. The studio was dim-lit, VU meters and console lights, the TriCity color weather radar glowing from a corner screen. Buckle cued up \u201cBreakdown.\u201d A simple kick drum and snare paired with a laid back electric piano slipped out slow and easy over the airwaves.\n\n\u201cHear that?\u201d Buckle asked, pulling at his mangy beard. Chuck looked sort of like a homeless Mick Fleetwood, if you shot Mick out of a cannon into a liquor store.\n\n\u201cHear what?\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he said as the guitars slid into the groove low and tight. \u201cIt\u2019s sparse. That crap music they make these days don\u2019t give you no space to think. Petty, he always gives you space.\u201d\n\nChuck held up one finger for quiet and opened the mic. \u201c11:49 under grey skies and overnight threats of rain.\u201d He leaned over and took a long drag off his Marlboro Gold. \u201cCold tonight,\u201d Buckle said, his voice an octave deeper. \u201cCold tomorrow. Warm inside right here with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. I\u2019m Chuck Buckle leaving you now, handing it over to . . . \u201d He nodded for me to speak.\n\n\u201cHeartbreak Kid,\u201d I said, quick, high-pitched and grinning. Buckle rolled his eyes. \u201cDJ Jamie James, riding with you, taking you through the long night\u2026.\u201d\n\nHe switched off the mic just as Petty began to sing about fear and pretending, letting go to hold on, how sometimes you need a stranger to get you through the night.\n\n\u201cKid, listen,\u201d Buckle said. \u201cDon\u2019t try so hard. Just be yourself.\u201d\n\nYou make a great musical statement: \u201cTrouble is where bands begin.\u201d How did Tom Petty go from Mudcrutch to a solo artist with the Heartbreakers?\n\nWhen Tom went from Mudcrutch to being a solo artist in that period before the Heartbreakers formed, it wasn\u2019t by choice. He was young, unknown, and hoping for a career. He had a record contract, but that\u2019s not a whole lot to have. It\u2019s a common misconception that securing a record deal means you\u2019ve arrived, that a career is underway. But, really, a record contract is nothing more than a lottery ticket: you need it to win, but your chances at winning are slim. Denny Cordell had lost his faith in Mudcrutch\u2019s ability to become a recording band, which is different from being a live band. But he hadn\u2019t lost his faith in Tom Petty. So, for the first time in his life, Petty became a solo artist\u2014because that\u2019s the direction in which life had kicked him. It was not by design. But that, too, didn\u2019t last long. He ultimately wanted a hybrid: to be a bandleader but also to be in a band. And that\u2019s what he created with the Heartbreakers.\n\nHow would the legacy be different if they had stayed a band instead of Tom turning into a frontman?\n\nI don\u2019t think it would have panned out. And the answer to your question hinges both on issues of creativity and issues of ambition and leadership. As Mike Campbell says, \u201cNo one is as ambitious as Tom Petty.\u201d Without Petty\u2019s drive, things would have slowed. The band recognized it, I think, and most were grateful that it was there. But Petty also built enough confidence, enough awareness that he had something, a voice and vision, that was all his own. When you listen to a Tom Petty recording, you know who it is. He\u2019s got a band with a sound, and he\u2019s got a presence as a frontman and a writer. Very few acts get that far. If it was easy to do, we\u2019d have more examples of it to show. But being bandleader is a crap job in many respects. My friend Chuck Prophet recently shared with me Jim Dickinson\u2019s take on the subject: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish the job of bandleader on my worst enemy.\u201d\n\nReclusive, ambitious, mysterious, meticulous, focused, businessman, coolest guy in the room \u2013 your book describes Tom as all of these things. \u201cTinted windows on his soul\u201d was my favorite. One always got the feeling that Tom Petty was a hard guy to get a handle on. How did you approach that as a writer?\n\nI simply responded to the situation Tom gave me. He opened the door and invited me in. We talked, for many hours, over a few years. But I saw, sitting next to him, that he could be all the things you describe. Without contradiction. Rock and roll has the remarkable, beautiful capacity to change people\u2019s lives. Glen Campbell, Elvis Presley, Joe Strummer, Carl Perkins, Tom Petty. But in changing those lives, rock and roll also demands a lot of the person undergoing such changes. They need to be several people, they need to find ways to protect themselves, they need to figure out how to trust and when not to. When pressed, I would have to say that I hope my own sons don\u2019t get such a formidable task presented them. I hope rock and roll gives them its gift without taxing them so heavily. They probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do it as well as Tom Petty has. Here\u2019s a guy that\u2019s kept the band together for forty years. Holy shit, right? And he\u2019s still making records, great records. Still cutting those records live. He had to be all those things you mention. He\u2019s pulled off a miracle.\n\nI talked to Rickey Medlocke recently and he mentioned Dub\u2019s nightclub and how those miniskirt contest gigs were so important in the evolution of Blackfoot \u2013 what was it about Dub\u2019s?\n\nDub\u2019s nightclub was to bands like Mudcrutch what the Kaiserkeller in Hamburg was to the Beatles. These venues were places where bands could become, places of incubation, of self-creation, of informal apprenticeship. In them bands would play multiple sets each night, would play primarily cover material (learning what good song construction felt like from the inside), and would live close to a world in which sex was being sold, whether in the form of the topless dancers at Dub\u2019s or the Reeperbahn\u2019s various possibilities for afterhours pleasure. If there ever will be a true \u201cschool of rock,\u201d it will probably need to look something like one of those places. So, really, there will likely never be a true school of rock. Not like that. For better or for worse.\n\nWhat was the single most important event in shaping Tom Petty\u2019s career?\n\nI hate to boil it down to this, but those individuals who have to process childhood abuse are shaped by that experience in ways others will never fully comprehend. At five, Petty saw his father, his protector, turn into something awful. Earl Petty wasn\u2019t always abusive, but the young Tom Petty didn\u2019t know when it was going to happen. That brings about a constant uncertainty. The world goes dark. I think music, songwriting in particular, would become for Petty a place in which things made more sense. So he went there often. And he created something of abundance and character. Art saved his ass. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to fully emancipate oneself from that kind of background. When childhood abuse begins, the world stops making sense. It\u2019s up to the individual to create sense. That\u2019s where songs came in.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Author Warren Zanes on the rocker's legacy -- and why he'll still be making great music into his 70s", "title": "Runnin\u2019 down a dream with Tom Petty: His childhood abuse, his relationship with Stevie Nicks and his short, wacky run with Gary Busey", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Author Warren Zanes on the rocker's legacy -- and why he'll still be making great music into his 70s", "title": "Runnin\u2019 down a dream with Tom Petty: His childhood abuse, his relationship with Stevie Nicks and his short, wacky run with Gary Busey", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/13/being_a_band_leader_is_a_crap_job_in_conversation_with_tom_pettys_biographer_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/AP_794937155231-e1449923437131-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Author Warren Zanes on the rocker's legacy -- and why he'll still be making great music into his 70s", "title": "Runnin\u2019 down a dream with Tom Petty: His childhood abuse, his relationship with Stevie Nicks and his short, wacky run with Gary Busey", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/AP_794937155231-e1449923437131-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jamie Blaine", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, gary busey, stevie nicks, The Weeklings, Tom Petty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Earl Petty wasn\u2019t always abusive, but the young Tom Petty didn\u2019t know when it was going to happen.\nOne always got the feeling that Tom Petty was a hard guy to get a handle on.\nWarm inside right here with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\nThey probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do it as well as Tom Petty has.\nJust be yourself.\u201dYou make a great musical statement: \u201cTrouble is where bands begin.\u201d How did Tom Petty go from Mudcrutch to a solo artist with the Heartbreakers?"}
