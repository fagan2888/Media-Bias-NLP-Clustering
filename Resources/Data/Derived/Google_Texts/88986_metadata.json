They paid and received insurance, but were then sent an email saying they had no insurance at all.\n\nAfter questions from 8 On Your Side, federal authorities jumped in to help. The Elsons received a call from a Washington, D.C. insurance marketplace office.\n\n\u201cThey said they read the article from somebody and they were going to take care of things,\u201d Elson said.\n\nHow things got out of hand\n\nThe ordeal started in September. First, they bought a Florida Blue plan. But their doctors\u2019 claims were denied because of computer errors. And then, the Elsons were told they owed thousands. They faced threats from collectors.\n\n\u201cNumber one, they listed my husband\u2019s gender as female and they had my date of birth incorrect,\u201d Jane Elson said.\n\nNo one at Florida Blue or the insurance marketplace would help.\n\nThen it got worse. Still fighting with Florida Blue, the couple decided to go with a different carrier for the new year. They paid nearly $500 for a plan with United Health Care. They received insurance cards. However, they soon received an email stating they have \u201cno medical coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Elsons turned to 8 On Your Side for answers. We went straight to the state regulators, the watchdogs for insurance companies.\n\nAnd now, the Elsons can finally get their prescriptions filled and their doctors\u2019 bills are being paid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barry and Jane Elson are finally out of their insurance nightmare.
