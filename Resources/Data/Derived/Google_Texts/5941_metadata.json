The latest anti-Hitch outburst comes from Sean McElwee, a writer and researcher of public policy who describes himself as \u201ca poorly practicing Christian who reads enough science to be functional at dinner parties.\u201d McElwee calls for a \u201ctruce\u201d between believers and nonbelievers. But he stands on the losing side of both public opinion trends and history. According to a Pew poll conducted in 2012, a record number of young Americans \u2013 a quarter of those between the ages of 18 and 29 \u2014 see themselves as unaffiliated with any religion. Atheists\u2019 ranks are swelling, and believers are finding it increasingly difficult to justify their faith.\n\nMcElwee begins by calling the New Atheist movement \u201ca rather disturbing trend\u201d in a country \u201cwhose greatest reformer\u201d \u2013 Martin Luther King, Jr. \u2013 \u201cwas a Reverend.\u201d Dr. King won fame as a civil rights leader, not as a religious figure. McElwee would do well to recall the words of Founding Father John Adams: \u201cthe Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.\u201d McElwee goes on to attribute to New Atheists an unsound premise of his own concoction:\n\n1. The cause of all human suffering is irrationality 2. Religion is irrational 3. Religion is the cause of all human suffering\n\nHitchens\u2019 most notorious atheistic tome is entitled \u201cGod Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.\u201d But no serious reader could conclude from this book (or from the writings of the other New Atheists \u2014 Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett \u2014 whom McElwee also hopes to debunk) that he considers religion the sole wellspring of humankind\u2019s woes. Though he derided religion long before and after he published \u201cGod Is Not Great,\u201d Hitchens never said any such thing, and no reasonable person would believe it. Are cancer and flesh-eating bacteria manifestations of irrationality? What about about wars over territory or natural resources? Poverty and inequality? Bullying and bulimia? The \u201cclassical logical error of post hoc ergo propter hoc\u201d McElwee ascribes to New Atheists simply does not exist.\n\nMcElwee then jumps to Hitchens\u2019 (misbegotten) support of the second Iraq war and attempts to press it into service to discredit him in matters of faith. Hitchens, as McElwee correctly notes, opposed the 1991 invasion of Iraq, but when George W. Bush was in office, according to McElwee, Hitchens \u201cdecided that, in fact, bombing children was no longer so abhorrent\u201d because the 2003-2011 conflict was to be a \u201cfinal Armageddon between the forces of rationality and the forces of religion.\u201d No, this was not how Hitchens viewed the second Iraq war. He advocated invading Iraq to overthrow Saddam, who was, he contended, guilty of crimes against humanity, and he (mistakenly) assumed a stable democracy would result from the dictator\u2019s ouster.\n\nHitchens understood the secular nature of Saddam\u2019s Ba\u2019ath Party, which made all the more puzzling and problematic his stubborn insistence that Saddam was colluding with Al Qaeda. But McElwee then asserts that \u201cthe force of rationality and civilization was led by a cabal of religious extremists\u201d \u2013 in the Bush administration \u2014 which \u201cwas of no concern for Hitchens.\u201d George W. Bush was a convert to Evangelical Christianity, which does not necessarily make him a \u201creligious extremist,\u201d and the (mixed) faiths of the Iraq War\u2019s other architects (Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, et al.) did not fuel their zeal for deposing Saddam.\n\nMcElwee proceeds to mischaracterize Hitchens\u2019 post-9/11 worldview as a \u201cwar between the good Christian West and the evil Muslim Middle East.\u201d How McElwee can expect us to believe this of Hitchens, who authored a book (\u201cThe Missionary Position\u201d) denouncing Mother Theresa as a fraud and relentlessly attacked Christianity, baffles me, as does McElwee\u2019s blindness to his own blunder. Is Hitchens now, according to him, pro-Christian?\n\nMcElwee also falsely attributes obscurantist motives to New Atheists. \u201cMight it be better to see jihad as a response to Western colonialism and the upending of Islamic society, rather than the product of religious extremism? The goal of the \u2018New Atheists\u2019 is to eliminate centuries of history that Europeans are happy to erase, and render the current conflict as one of reason versus faith rather than what is, exploiter and exploited.\u201d\n\nStripping jihad of its religious grounds invites nothing but confusion. Jihad in Arabic means \u201cstruggle,\u201d but, with respect to Islam, denotes \u201ca struggle in the name of faith,\u201d which includes holy war against infidels waged as a matter of religious duty. Such jihad is, ipso facto, religious. Informed readers also know that jihadists, in their addresses to the Muslim umma, rail against Western occupation of Islamic lands, \u201cinfidel\u201d Western-backed dictators in Muslim countries, and so on \u2014 all the while citing passages from the Quran. Hitchens and Dawkins, both Europe-born and versed in their continent\u2019s past \u2013 a past replete with religious and political conflicts of all kinds \u2014 have never sought to \u201cerase\u201d its history or present \u201cthe current conflict\u201d as solely one of \u201creason versus faith.\u201d\n\nMcElwee then tendentiously defines religion so as to paper over its often decisive role in precipitating conflicts. Though he allows that it might \u201cmotivate acts of social justice and injustice,\u201d \u201c[r]eligion is both a personal search for truth as well as a communal attempt to discern where we fit in the order of things.\u201d Religion first and foremost consists of unsubstantiated, dogmatically advanced explanations for the cosmos and our place in it, with resulting universally applicable rules of conduct. A good many of these rules \u2013 especially those regarding women\u2019s behavior and their (subservient) status vis-\u00e0-vis men, and prescriptions for less-than-merciful treatment of gays \u2013 are repugnant, retrograde, and arbitrary, based on \u201csacred texts\u201d espousing \u201crevealed truths\u201d dating back to what the British atheist philosopher Bertrand Russell justly called the \u201csavage ages.\u201d (Islam by no means has a monopoly on such rules \u2013 check Leviticus for its catalogue of \u201ccrimes\u201d: working on the Sabbath, cursing one\u2019s parents, being the victim of rape \u2013 that merit the death penalty.) Just how such \u201choly\u201d compendia of ahistorical, often macabre fables are supposed to help anyone in a \u201cpersonal search for truth\u201d mystifies me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hitchens didn't think rejecting religion would solve everything.
