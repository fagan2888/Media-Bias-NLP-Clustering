The book tells the story of a half-American, half-Chinese woman who becomes a celebrated courtesan in Shanghai in the early 20th century. Tan\u2019s tale also explores multigenerational portraits of mother-daughter relationships inspired by the author\u2019s own mother and grandmother.\n\nRead part one of the excerpt from the first chapter of \u201cThe Valley of Amazement,\u201d titled \u201cHidden Jade Path.\u201d Below is part two:\n\nI worried for two days, until logic and deduction enabled me to reclaim my race. First of all, I reasoned, Mother was American. Although my father was dead, it was obvious he had been an American, since I had fair skin, brown hair, and green eyes. I wore Western clothing and regular shoes. I had not had my feet crushed and wedged like dumpling dough into a tiny shoe. I was educated, too, and in difficult subjects, such as history and science\u2014\u201cand for no greater purpose than Knowledge Alone,\u201d my tutor had said. Most Chinese girls learned only how to behave.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, I did not think like a Chinese person\u2014no kowtowing to statues, no smoky incense, and no ghosts. Mother told me: \u201cGhosts are superstitions, conjured up by a Chinese person\u2019s own fears. The Chinese are a fearful lot and thus they have many superstitions.\u201d I was not fearful. And I did not do everything a certain way just because that was how it had been done for a thousand years. I had Yankee ingenuity and an independent mind; Mother told me that. It was my idea, for example, to give the servants modern forks to useinstead of ancient chopsticks. Mother, however, ordered the servants to return the silverware. She said that each tine was more valuable than what a servant might earn in a year, and thus, the servants might be tempted to sell the forks. The Chinese did not hold the same opinion about honesty as we Americans. I agreed. Now if I were Chinese, would I have said that about myself?\n\nAfter I left Miss Jewell\u2019s Academy, I forbade the courtesans fromcalling me Vyau-la. They also could no longer use Chinese endearments like \u201clittle sister.\u201d They had to call me Vivi, I told them. The only people who could call me \u201cViolet\u201d were those who could say my name precisely, and they were my mother, Golden Dove, and my tutor.\n\nAfter I changed my name, I realized I could do so whenever I pleased to suit my mood or purpose. And soon after, I adopted my first nickname as the result of an accident. I had been racing through the main salon and bumped into a servant carrying a tray of tea and snacks, which clattered to the floor. He exclaimed that I was a biaozi, a \u201clittle whirlwind.\u201d A delightful word. I was the Whirlwind who blew through the famed house of Hidden Jade Path with my nimbus of fluffy dark hair and my cat chasing the ribbon that had once held my hair in place. From then on, the servants had to call me Whirlwind in English, which they pronounced, \u201cwoo-woo.\u201d\n\nI loved my golden fox cat. She belonged to me, and I to her, and that was a feeling I had with no other\u2014not even my mother. When I held my kitty, she kneaded her paws on my bodice, snagging the lace and turning it into fishing nets. Her eyes were green like mine, and she had a beautiful golden sheen over her brown and black-splotched body. She glowed under moonlight. Mother gave her to me when I told her I wanted a friend. The cat had once belonged to a pirate, she said, who named her Carlotta after the Portuguese king\u2019s daughter he had kidnapped. No one else had a pirate\u2019s cat, whereas anyone could have a friend. A cat would always be loyal, unlike a friend. She said she knew that for a fact.\n\nThe following excerpt was reprinted with permission from \u201cThe Valley of Amazement.\u201d For more on Amy Tan, click here.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Part two of the excerpt from Amy Tan's new novel, \"The Valley of Amazement.\"", "title": "An Excerpt From Amy Tan\u2019s \u2018The Valley of Amazement\u2019 (Part 2)", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/11/02/an-excerpt-from-amy-tans-the-valley-of-amazement-part-2/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AG100_amytan_G_20131101204038.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "An Excerpt From Amy Tan\u2019s \u2018The Valley of Amazement\u2019 (Part 2)", "description": "Part two of the excerpt from Amy Tan's new novel, \"The Valley of Amazement.\"", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Amy Tan", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Part two of the excerpt from Amy Tan's new novel, \"The Valley of Amazement.\"", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-02T14:00:52-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/11/02/an-excerpt-from-amy-tans-the-valley-of-amazement-part-2/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-78016", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Part two of the excerpt from Amy Tan's new novel, \"The Valley of Amazement.\"", "title": "An Excerpt From Amy Tan\u2019s \u2018The Valley of Amazement\u2019 (Part 2)", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/11/02/an-excerpt-from-amy-tans-the-valley-of-amazement-part-2/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AG100_amytan_G_20131101204038.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-78016", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-02T00:44:04-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefae\"", "article_summary": "Amy Tan\u2019s mother, part of the inspiration for the author\u2019s new novel, \u2018The Valley of Amazement\u2019 Amy TanThe following is part two of an excerpt from Amy Tan\u2019s new novel, \u201cThe Valley of Amazement,\u201d which will be published by Ecco on Nov. 5.\nThe following excerpt was reprinted with permission from \u201cThe Valley of Amazement.\u201d For more on Amy Tan, click here.\nI had Yankee ingenuity and an independent mind; Mother told me that.\nRead part one of the excerpt from the first chapter of \u201cThe Valley of Amazement,\u201d titled \u201cHidden Jade Path.\u201d Below is part two:I worried for two days, until logic and deduction enabled me to reclaim my race.\nMother told me: \u201cGhosts are superstitions, conjured up by a Chinese person\u2019s own fears."}
