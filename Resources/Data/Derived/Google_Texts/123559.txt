Bain Capital has agreed to sell software company Applied Systems Inc., to fellow buyout shop Hellman & Friedman in a deal worth nearly triple what the Boston-based firm paid for the company roughly seven years ago.

JMI Equity is teaming up with Hellman & Friedman to purchase Applied Systems, a provider of software that helps insurance agencies automate their operations, in a deal valued at roughly $1.8 billion. Bain acquired the University Park, Ill., company from Vista Equity Partners in 2006 for $675 million.
