The overland route was safer and less heavily policed than the Straits of Florida, he said.\n\nAs of September, 12,166 Cuban migrants had been identified this year by Costa Rican authorities, more than double the figure for last year and over five times the 2013 total.\n\nAccording to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data requested by the Pew Research Center, 27,296 Cubans entered the United States in the first nine months of the 2015 fiscal year, a 78 percent increase from 2014.\n\n(Editing by Dave Graham, Bernard Orr)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "PASO CANOAS, Costa Rica (Reuters) - To cheers from a large crowd of Cuban migrants, Co", "title": "Costa Rica re-opens border, issuing visas to Cuban migrants", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/14/Costa-Rica-re-opens-border-issuing-visas-Cuban-migrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/costa-rica-cubans_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/14/Costa-Rica-re-opens-border-issuing-visas-Cuban-migrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/costa-rica-cubans_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "PASO CANOAS, Costa Rica (Reuters) - To cheers from a large crowd of Cuban migrants, Co", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "PASO CANOAS, Costa Rica (Reuters) - To cheers from a large crowd of Cuban migrants, Costa Rica on Saturday re-opened its border with Panama after a sudden tightening in its immigration policy had left more than 1,200 of them stranded there.\nPent\u00f3n said he left Cuba on a route taken by many: flying legally to Ecuador, then crossing illegally into Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica.\nCosta Rica surprised the migrants on Friday by detaining them at the border, prompting some Cubans to block the Inter-American Highway for a few hours in protest until the government began issuing them with seven-day transit visas.\nCuban migrants receive special treatment in the United States from Cold War-era arrangements, and have long traveled through Mexico and Central America to reach the U.S. border.\nHowever, it is unclear how the migrants will fare in neighboring Nicaragua, which refused 100 Cubans deported from a holding center in Costa Rica on Friday."}
