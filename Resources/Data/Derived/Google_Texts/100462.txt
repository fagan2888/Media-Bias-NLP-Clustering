FARIBAULT, mn

An 83-year-old man imprisoned for killing a Minnesota teacher in 2011 has died.



The Minnesota Department of Corrections confirms Delbert Huber died Wednesday night. Huber was being held in the Faribault state prison.



A department spokeswoman would not say where Huber died, but says foul play is not suspected.



Huber was serving 30 years for fatally shooting 43-year-old Timothy Larson of Albertville. The shooting happened after Larson ordered Huber and his son, Timothy Huber, to remove their farm equipment from his father's farm near Belgrade.



Stearns County Sheriff John Sanner says Delbert Huber was one of a number of people his department spoke with recently about the 1989 Jacob Wetterling abduction. Investigators began taking a closer look at stranger assaults that happened in Paynesville around the time of Jacob's abduction.
