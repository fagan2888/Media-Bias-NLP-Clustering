The panel also will examine the legal theory behind the subsidy cases: that the I.R.S., and by extension, Mr. Obama, ignored the will of Congress, which explicitly allowed tax credits and subsidies only for those buying coverage through state exchanges.\n\n\u201cWe have agencies under this administration having an attitude that they can fix a statute, that they can improve upon a statute, that they can look at a statute\u2019s clear language and disregard it,\u201d Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, who is bringing one of the cases, said in an interview Monday. \u201cThe president himself has said on more than one occasion, \u2018I can\u2019t wait on Congress.\u2019 In our system of government, he has to.\u201d\n\nThe subsidy lawsuits grow out of three years of work by conservative and libertarian theorists at Washington-based research organizations like the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The cases are part of a continuing, multifaceted legal assault on the Affordable Care Act that began with the Supreme Court challenge to the law and shows no signs of abating.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAfter the A.C.A. was enacted and after the president signed it, a lot of people \u2014 me included \u2014 decided that we weren\u2019t going to take this lying down, and we were going to try to block it and ultimately either get the Supreme Court to overturn it or Congress to repeal it,\u201d said Michael F. Cannon, a health policy scholar at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, who helped develop the legal theory for the subsidy cases and will testify in the House on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge brought by Liberty University, a Christian college in Virginia, to the \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d which requires companies with more than 50 employees to offer coverage. In another challenge, the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative group, has filed suit claiming that the law is unconstitutional because it was introduced in the Senate, not the House, where tax bills must originate.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131202214936, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative critics, joined by their Republican allies on Capitol Hill, are trying to
