Congress has until Wednesday to strike a deal or pass another extension to avoid a shutdown, and House Speaker Paul Ryan has not ruled out another short-term bill to allow more negotiations. No one knows yet whether NIH will get the big present to match the high hopes of research advocates or how FDA or AHRQ will fare \u2014 so a big reveal in the first half of the week would be most welcome! Also TBD: whether a deal includes a two-year suspension of Obamacare's medical device tax after years of flirtation with full repeal. The stars looked to be aligning last week but it's still far from certain.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHELP AIMS FOR JANUARY VOTE ON CALIFF \u2014 FDA Commissioner nominee Robert Califf won\u2019t get through the HELP Committee this year, but committee aides say the panel is aiming for a vote next month. He still appears to have support both in the committee and in the chamber, despite continuing questions from critics on the left about his industry ties. But two GOP Senators \u2014 Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski and Nebraska\u2019s Ben Sasse \u2014 have placed holds on the nomination, and working that through for a floor vote would likely have chewed up the Senate clock amid the crowded year-end legislative calendar.\n\nHappy Monday and welcome to Prescription PULSE, where we note that this week in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality as a mental illness in approving the second edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. \"This American Life\" has an episode on that development, if you're interested: http://bit.ly/1J1xi6e\n\nCDC HITS BRAKES ON PAINKILLER GUIDANCE \u2014 Under pressure, the agency backed off plans to finalize its opioid guidelines next month, choosing instead to release a draft copy today for a 30-day public comment period. That means a months-long delay, at least. Expect some significant changes from the initial draft that circulated this fall. The move was announced Friday and puts off a key piece of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to combat the opioid abuse and overdose epidemic. It follows criticism from the pain community and some within HHS that the draft guidelines developed behind closed doors lacked public input and perhaps had the wrong mix of expertise. The decision disappointed advocates for more cautious opioid prescribing. \"This is an enormous win for the opioid lobby,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, a founder of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and the chief medical officer at Phoenix House.\n\n\u2026 CDC had planned to publish the document in January without publicly releasing a draft, but faced sharp criticism from HHS\u2019s own Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee at a meeting earlier this month. CDC will task a working group from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control\u2019s Board of Scientific Counselors to review the guidelines and comments, make revisions and publish a document sometime next year. \u201cThe guideline is a priority for our agency,\u201d CDC said in a statement. \u201cGiven the lives lost and impacted every day, we have an acute sense of urgency to issue guidance quickly.\u201d The guidelines are voluntary for physicians but the hope is that they will change prescribing patterns.

The state punished the company\u2019s Janssen Pharmaceuticals subsidiary for the content of its speech without showing that the speech contained \u201ca knowing or reckless falsehood,\u201d J&J\u2019s petition for cert says. South Carolina sued the company, arguing a letter it sent to health care providers about its antipsychotic Risperdal did not include adequate warnings about certain side effects. J&J argues that the state overstepped its bounds in the case, encroaching on regulatory authority given solely to the FDA and that the civil penalty imposed upon the company violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause.

It\u2019s mostly recap, but he returned to the \u2018transparency\u2019 issues he highlighted at the forum. CMS has released \u201cmillions of lines of data each year \u2026 across a number of health care services,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne important principle is that if taxpayers are paying the bill, the information on what we pay for should be in the public domain and made available to consumers, researchers, innovators, and care providers.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Suggestive words, but Prescription PULSE has yet to talk to anyone, including CMS, who can explain how the agency could do anything similar with drugs to what it\u2019s done with hospital and doctor payments, given the very intentional restrictions on the government\u2019s involvement in Part D. Perhaps there\u2019s more room for action on drugs paid for through Part B, but in any case, we\u2019d like to hear your theories of the case. Please send to bnorman@politico.com and skarlin@politico.com.\n\nFDA, NOT INDUSTRY, UP NEXT IN SENATE DRUG PRICE INVESTIGATION \u2014 The Martin Shkreli show isn't coming to the Hill just yet. Sen. Susan Collins said the next hearing in the Senate Special Committee on Aging\u2019s bipartisan investigation into the price hikes of off-patent medicines will likely focus on FDA\u2019s role. The generic drug lobby and the FDA give vastly different reasons for the generic drug application backlog at the agency, and Collins hopes to get to the bottom of the matter.\n\nThat doesn't mean the panel won't drag CEOs in front of cameras at some point as it addresses the exponential price hikes of older drugs by companies like Shkreli\u2019s Turing and Valeant. But as far as legislation goes, Collins wants to insert measures in the Senate HELP Committee\u2019s version of the House-passed 21st Century Cures Act \u2014 which of course is well behind schedule. HELP can legislate and Aging cannot. As far as solutions, Collins seemed most interested in a proposal to mandate faster FDA reviews of generic drugs when one product has a monopoly. The full hearing roundup is here.\n\n\u2026 The first hearing as part of Collins and Democratic counterpart Claire McCaskill\u2019s investigation last week went as well as it could for the drug industry as many lawmakers in attendance made clear their focus was on a few select bad actors, not on the prices charged by companies who invest in research and development. But not everyone in the industry was thrilled with the solutions suggested at the meeting. The generic drug lobby said encouraging mass compounding or importing foreign drugs would create major safety risks. It favors other approaches, like legislation that would address brand drug companies abuse of safety programs to keep generics off the market. GPhA\u2019s statement: http://bit.ly/1lQcbOT\n\n... Pew\u2019s Allan Coukell also pushed back on the idea of relying more on compounding in a letter to Collins and McCaskill saying, \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize the long-term importance of ensuring that manufacturers continue to take their products through the FDA approval process.\u201d The letter also reminds the lawmakers of a 2012 compounding crisis that caused multiple deaths from fungal meningitis and resulted in Congress passing new legislation on the practice: http://politico.pro/1Z3Wy57\n\nIMPRIMIS SEES MORE COMPOUNDING OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH-PRICED DRUGS \u2014 Speaking of compounding, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals plans to further capitalize on price hikes of older medicines by offering cheaper compounded formulations. The company recently made headlines by offering a $1 per pill version of Turing\u2019s Daraprim after Turing hiked the price from $13.50 per pill to $750 this fall. CEO Mark Baum tells POLITICO that his company is looking at other high-priced off-patent medicines that Imprimis could formulate by compounding and he\u2019s been talking to the top payers.. Imprimis struck a deal with Express Scripts to get its compounded version of Daraprim on the formulary and it' working with others to do the same. Baum\u2019s also been working lawmakers on the Hill who are looking or ways to address the tactics of Turing and other drug companies. We\u2019re still waiting to see how FDA will view such compounded formulations. More details for Pros.\n\nSHKRELI MAY CAUSE NEW WAVE OF OUTRAGE \u2014 De ja vu? Martin Shkreli recently took over another drug company, KalosBios, and one of his first moves is causing new drug price concerns. He bought an old drug that treats Chagas disease and indicated plans to raises its price. The disease mostly affects people in South and Central America and the drug, a version of benznidazole, is not yet approved in the U.S. To add insult to injury, Shkreli hopes to take advantage of a U.S. program to encourage development of neglected diseases treatments. If he wins FDA approval of the old drug, he could get a voucher for a faster FDA review for another product. Such vouchers have sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. Such a move is likely to upset public health advocates because the voucher program is supposed to incentive new drugs for diseases that largely affect poorer countries.

Ted Cruz has introduced legislation that would require FDA to quickly approve drugs or medical devices that are available in other developed countries. And if FDA chooes not to, Congress could overturn the decision with a simple majority vote. How bout that? The GOP presidential contender argues the legislation would put downward pressure on the prices of drugs and devices and mitigate drug shortages, although his emphasis is on getting government out of the way. \u201cWe need to tear down the barriers blocking a new era of medical innovation, and the primary inhibitor is the government itself,\" Cruz said in a statement Friday.

More here: http://wapo.st/1Y6yMD7\n\n\u2026 In other TPP news, House Ways and Means Democrats released a paper on how the agreement will impact global access to medicines, comparing it to earlier trade accords. http://bit.ly/1HZ3tZ5 .

The budget is estimated to be $130 million next year, $230 million in 2017, and should climb to $330 million in 2018 before leveling off, according to Josephine Briggs, director of the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. \"That will mean we will have to continually make the case each year that it is important,\" Collins said. \"That is going to require a lot of focus. ... We have to be sure we don't have unrealistic expectations about the benefits of this study in the short run.\" NIH's PMI update: http://1.usa.gov/1TDWxkG\n\n\u2026 NEW NIH GROUP TO LOOK AT CLINICAL CENTER PRACTICES \u2014 A new working group chaired by former Lockheed Martin CEO Norm Augustine will convene in January and plans to report next spring on the failures in oversight at the clinical research facility. It will also recommend changes to reduce risks for its research activities in general. The effort stems from anNIH review that found the Clinical Center's drug-making facility had a long and \"troubling\" history of quality control problems that went unaddressed before it was shuttered last June after an FDA inspection. That review, presented at the advisory committee meeting, found no evidence that any patients were harmed despite at least four confirmed contamination events in 2014 and 2015. The report included an estimate that NIH would have to spend $70 million and take 16 to 18 months to bring its facility up to standards, although NIH has not yet concluded that is the path it will pursue. \"In my 6\u00bd years ... this has been the most difficult circumstance we have encountered,\" Collins told the advisory committee.\n\n... Both the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate HELP Committee opened investigations after an FDA inspection last May uncovered numerous problems, including inadequate equipment and sterility monitoring and poor employee training. The NIH review: http://bit.ly/1Q7VHyY\n\nUSER FEE UPDATES \u2014 FDA released notes from a private November meeting where the agency and industry laid out their initial proposal packages for the next Medical Device User Fee Act agreement. http://1.usa.gov/1Q8tM1D\n\nNew notes are also available from FDA\u2019s Prescription Drug User Fee Act reauthorization meetings with industry.

The board rejected a coalition attempt to invalidate a patent tied to an arthritis drug. For those keeping score, the board has now rejected eight of the coalition's 15 attempts to invalidate life science patents through the PTO's new post-grant review process. PTO is still mulling whether to take up 17 more pending challenges from the Bass group. We're tracking.\u201d\n\nFOUL PLAY OR LAWMAKING DUE DILIGENCE ? \u2014 FDA and AdvaMed met to develop the device-related language of 21st Century Cures, according to documents received by Inside Health Policy through the Freedom of Information Act and published Friday, our eHealth colleague Darius Tahir writes. The documents summarize an August meeting between the agency and the trade association in which they strategize on advancing the Senate counterpart to the House's medical innovation effort. It isn't unusual for the agency to discuss language in regulations and bills with AdvaMed. A GOP aide quoted by Inside Health Policy states that it would be \"legislative malpractice\" not to do so. In contrast, consumer group Public Citizen said FDA's partiicpate \"violates the most elementary ethical standards.\"\n\nCATCHING OUR ATTENTION: FDA EXPLAINS WHY IT OK'D 'FEMALE VIAGRA' \u2014 The agency took to the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine to justify its summer approval of Addyi (flibanersin), better known as the \u201cfemale Viagra,\u201d for the treatment of low sexual desire in premenopausal women after multiple rejections. Many have questioned whether this decision reflected FDA caving to political pressure generated by a savvy PR campaign partially funded by the drug\u2019s developer that accused the agency of sexism trumping science. For those who followed the drug\u2019s history, there\u2019s not a lot of new information in the NEJM piece \u2014 the op-ed's significance is largely that the agency felt the need to justify its approval in such a public manner. It also acknowledges that not all members on the FDA review team recommended approval. http://bit.ly/1RJ2yOm\n\n\n\n** A message from The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association: PBMs are projected to save employers, unions, government programs, and consumers $654 billion - up to 30 percent - on drug benefit costs over the next decade.
