The judge who ordered the change immediately approved the plan.\n\nRight now, if a mentally ill inmate refuses to follow orders or attacks another inmate or guards, the prison sends him to a segregation unit. In segregation, prisoners spend more time confined to their cells and must submit to routine strip searches for weapons and drugs. Advocates for inmates have long insisted the conditions only worsen mental illness. Earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton unequivocally backed them up.\n\nIn an April ruling, the judge wrote, \u201cplacement of seriously mentally ill inmates in California\u2019s segregation housing unit can and does cause serious psychological harm\u201d by worsening symptoms, inducing psychosis and increasing suicidal urges.\n\nIn a statement, Dana Simas, spokesperson with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said that CDCR was continuing to make \u201clasting cultural changes to how the Department responds to and treats mentally ill inmates.\u201d Simas also said that CDCR would \u201ccontinue to work with all parties to improve mental health care for inmates and to ensure that there is strong collaboration between custody and mental health staff.\u201d\n\nIn the response sent to Judge Karlton, CDCR said it would no longer send mentally ill inmates to segregation units.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ll create new housing designed for them that offers twice as much out-of-cell time and more psychiatric care. Corrections staff on those units will take \u201ca collaborative approach\u201d with mental health staff \u201cto ensure the well-being of the inmates housed in these new units,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big change,\u201d said Michael Bien, an attorney for inmates who asked the judge to intervene. Bien said the state\u2019s plan steers these prisoners away from the harshest conditions of punishment and into treatment that could help.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be in one of the new units,\u201d Bien said, \u201cwhere they\u2019ll get much more treatment, much more out-of-cell time, and hopefully experience less stress.\u201d\n\nMore than 3,000 inmates in segregation have been diagnosed with serious mental disorders.\n\nCorrections will conduct a case-by-case review of those prisoners \u2014 starting with those who have the longest segregation terms \u2014 to decide whether to keep them in the new units or release them back into the general prison population, if they are stable.\n\nFriday\u2019s plan is the final piece of a massive overhaul of California\u2019s treatment of mentally ill prisoners. Corrections official have also agreed to new restrictions on pepper-spraying and strip-searching the inmates, and to more training and oversight of prison staff who interact with them.\n\nCalifornia Prisons Adopts Plan to Restrict Segregation for Mentally-Ill Inmates by KQED News", "article_metadata": {"description": "The judge who ordered the changes immediately accepted the plan.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Prisons Adopt Plan to Restrict Segregation for Mentally Ill Inmates\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/08\\/29\\/california-prisons-adopts-plan-to-restrict-segregation-for-mentally-ill-inmates\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-29 17:02:08\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-02 15:57:23\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":21092,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\",\"Prison Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/08\\/RS11514_IMG_0176-hpf.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The judge who ordered the changes immediately accepted the plan.", "title": "California Prisons Adopt Plan to Restrict Segregation for Mentally Ill Inmates", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/08/29/california-prisons-adopts-plan-to-restrict-segregation-for-mentally-ill-inmates/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/08/RS11514_IMG_0176-hpf.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health,prison health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Friday\u2019s plan is the final piece of a massive overhaul of California\u2019s treatment of mentally ill prisoners.\nIn segregation, prisoners spend more time confined to their cells and must submit to routine strip searches for weapons and drugs.\nBy Julie SmallIn response to a court order, California prison officials proposed a new approach Friday to how they treat mentally ill inmates who break rules or commit new crimes.\nCalifornia Prisons Adopts Plan to Restrict Segregation for Mentally-Ill Inmates by KQED News\nRight now, if a mentally ill inmate refuses to follow orders or attacks another inmate or guards, the prison sends him to a segregation unit."}
