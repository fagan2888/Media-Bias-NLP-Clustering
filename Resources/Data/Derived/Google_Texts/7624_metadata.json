He criticized the pro-ethanol renewable fuel standard, and called for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\n\nKasich says the Republican Party is his vehicle, not his master.\n\n\u201cThey can't tell me what to do,\u201d Kasich says. \u201cOn the issue of immigration we need to get things moving on this and get it going soon.\u201d\n\nKasich has also parted ways with some Republicans by supporting President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nKasich ran for his party\u2019s nomination for president in 1999, but dropped out before the Iowa Straw Poll when fundraising lagged. He says voters in Iowa considered him to be too young when he campaigned here 16 years ago.\n\n\u201cAnd so I never really kind of thought I would be back, but it's possible,\u201d Kasich says. \u201cWe'll let you know.\u201d\n\nCalling himself a change agent, Kasich says he\u2019ll decide soon whether to run for president, and he says if he does it will be to win.\n\nKasich served in Congress , then worked in the private sector before returning to public life.\n\nKasich touted balancing the federal budget as chair of the House Budget committee in Congress, and reducing unemployment in Ohio. He has been popular as governor in the important battleground state, winning 86 of 88 counties in the last election.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Elections", "description": "Ohio Governor John Kasich, the latest Republican to say he\u2019s interested in running for his party\u2019s nomination for president, attracted a crowd of about 200", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://iowapublicradio.org/post/kasich-deporting-immigrants-inhumane", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/ipr/files/styles/medium/public/201506/IMG_1257.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Ohio Governor John Kasich, the latest Republican to say he\u2019s interested in running for his party\u2019s nomination for president, attracted a crowd of about 200", "title": "Kasich:   Deporting Immigrants \"Inhumane\""}, "story_id": 417229138, "twitter": {"site": "@IowaPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@IowaPublicRadio"}, "author": "Joyce Russell", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kasich:   Deporting Immigrants &quot;Inhumane&quot;"}, "nid": 59718, "datePublished": "2015-06-24", "keywords": "news, 2016 Caucuses, John Kasich", "wordCount": 359, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "During a forum at the Greater Des Moines Partnership, Kasich distinguished himself from the rest of the field.\nKasich ran for his party\u2019s nomination for president in 1999, but dropped out before the Iowa Straw Poll when fundraising lagged.\nOhio Governor John Kasich, the latest Republican to say he\u2019s interested in running for his party\u2019s nomination for president, attracted a crowd of about 200 people in Des Moines today.\nKasich touted balancing the federal budget as chair of the House Budget committee in Congress, and reducing unemployment in Ohio.\nHe criticized the pro-ethanol renewable fuel standard, and called for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants."}
