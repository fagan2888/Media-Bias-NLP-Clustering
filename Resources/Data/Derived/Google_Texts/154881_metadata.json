One part of the facility is the daycare while another part contains a private Christian school. The restriction states that the daycare children must stay on the daycare side of the facility, Sharlot said.\n\nCircle Y has had a good record in the past, Sharlot noted.\n\nSheriff Ben Caldwell said the decision to close Circle Y Child Care and to reopen it was made by the Mississippi State Department of Health and not his office.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office still has an ongoing investigation, Caldwell said.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s been arrested or charged at this time,\u201d the sheriff said.\n\nCircle Y is located on County Road 512, which is off of Highway 45, south of Corinth.\n\nCircle Y officials could not be reached for comment by telephone.\n\njosh.mitchell@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Josh Mitchell Corinth Today CORINTH \u2013 An Alcorn County child care facility that was issued an emergency license suspension in mid-March has been given permission to reopen by the Mississippi State Department of Health.
