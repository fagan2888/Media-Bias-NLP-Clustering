Carson said nothing of the sort.\n\nThe meme that has been circulating around the Internet attributes this quote to Carson: \u201cActually slavery was the best thing that could have happened to us. Because of slavery blacks were brought to America. We met the Christian faith. We met Jesus Christ. If it were not for slavery, we would all be in Africa hanging from trees and worshipping Allah. God always gets it right!\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 29, according to Snopes.com, the Facebook page \u201cFox News the FB Page\u201d published a photograph of Carson, a former neurosurgeon seeking the Republican presidential nomination, with the purported quote.\n\nSnopes.com points out that the quote bore a scintilla of resemblance to earlier comments made by Carson (such as a 2013 comment that Obamacare was \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d and an op-ed piece by Carson in which he criticized Black Lives Matter protesters), but the words attributed to Carson were never spoken by him.\n\n\u201cFox News the FB Page\u201d is a parody website that is not affiliated with Fox News Channel and primarily publishes altered versions of current news stories or entirely fabricated content. Prior posts by that group include a claim that NASCAR was replacing its flag with a rainbow gay pride version and a fake news atory headlined: \u201cKim Davis Announces Engagement to Phil Robertson.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A meme (photo and text, usually a quote) states that Ben Carson said slavery was the \u201cbest thing that could have happened\u201d to blacks.The facts: Absolutely not true.
