Two radical Muslim shooters, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, took the lives of 14 people and wounded more than 20 in what is increasingly looking like a terrorist attack. The media\u2019s reaction to the shooting was equally horrendous. On the day of the attack, the LA Times editorial board said our infatuation with guns borders on suicidal impulses. This is before we knew anything.\n\nYet, the media\u2019s reaction to those offering prayers to the victims and their families bordered on perversion; for heaven\u2019s sake those who survived the attack gathered outside the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino and prayed. A daughter who worked inside the building texted her father and asked him to say a prayer for her and her co-workers.\n\nIn an intense new video from NRA News, The Blaze\u2019s Dana Loesch ripped into the \u201cgodless left\u201d for their mockery of prayer, their penchant to \u201cpurge the facts\u201d when it doesn\u2019t meet their narrative, and their unconstitutional assault on the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cThis was a coordinated assault on the two freedoms they hate the most; our right to believe and our right to survive,\u201d says Loesch. Speaking of the elites in the media, politics, and on college campuses, \u201cthey openly attack sacred American values and the people who cherish them with ruthlessness, and contempt, and downright hatred.\u201d Loesch then described their one agenda as one fueled by \u201cunholy arrogance.\u201d\n\nAs Guy and Mary Katharine wrote in End of Discussion, Loesch noted that the far left \u201cadvances its power by any means necessary, namely shaming and silencing any dissent.\u201d Why? If we don\u2019t have these discussions and debates, they\u2019re not at risk of losing them. By default, they win if we stifle honest debate about the threats posed by radical Islam and the endless political window dressing called gun control. Case in point: Last week, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest couldn\u2019t name one mass shooting that would have been prevented by Obama\u2019s gun control proposals to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Byron Tau.\n\nDuring the campaign against prayer, the major news networks were of course praising the NY Daily News headline saying, \u201cGod isn\u2019t fixing this,\u201d concerning the San Bernardino shooting. The Media Research Center\u2019s Newsbusters division was on the case, noting that CBS\u2019 Gayle King said, \u201c I think the headline\u2019s very powerful.\u201d Weatherman Al Roker chimed in saying, \u201cwhile that\u2019s good intentions [offering prayers], thoughts and prayers aren\u2019t getting \u2013 this isn't fixing this problem.\u201d The only network not to get in on marginalizing prayer was ABC News\u2019 Robin Roberts, who said offering prayers helps the families of the victims:\n\nI talked to some family members that we'll share in the next hour and they \u2013 when we say we're thinking of them, the thoughts and prayers, it really helps them. They really feel the nation, the country, the world sympathizing with them and that we haven't and we can't become desensitized. We can't become and say this is a new normal.\n\nNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell was no different than her colleagues, touting gun control talking points and going after the National Rifle Association.\n\nAs Ben Shapiro has said often, the left thinks institutionally, the right thinks individually, which often places conservatives at a disadvantage regarding combating media narratives. Loesch illustrates this organization by noting how the liberal media have circled the wagons around Clinton who tried to blame the Benghazi attack on a video, instead of on a coordinated attack by terrorists; how they pervasively ignore current gun laws when reporting on the issue; and how they bury the monumental problems plaguing Obamacare. When the weatherman is in on prayer marginalization, you know you\u2019re dealing with a determined opponent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This was a coordinated assault on the two freedoms they hate the most; our right to believe and our right to survive .05/27/2016 8:46:01AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"This was a coordinated assault on the two freedoms they hate the most; our right to believe and our right to survive", "title": "The Blaze's Dana Loesch Torches The 'Godless Left's' 'Coordinated Assault' On Constitutional Rights", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/14/the-blazes-dana-loesch-torches-the-godless-lefts-coordinated-assault-on-constitutional-rights-n2093538", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/12/14/10.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"This was a coordinated assault on the two freedoms they hate the most; our right to believe and our right to survive", "title": "The Blaze's Dana Loesch Torches The 'Godless Left's' 'Coordinated Assault' On Constitutional Rights", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/14/the-blazes-dana-loesch-torches-the-godless-lefts-coordinated-assault-on-constitutional-rights-n2093538", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/12/14/10.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Blaze's Dana Loesch Torches The 'Godless Left's' 'Coordinated Assault' On Constitutional Rights, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis was a coordinated assault on the two freedoms they hate the most; our right to believe and our right to survive,\u201d says Loesch.\nA daughter who worked inside the building texted her father and asked him to say a prayer for her and her co-workers.\nOn the day of the attack, the LA Times editorial board said our infatuation with guns borders on suicidal impulses.\nThe San Bernardino shooting that occurred earlier this month was horrific.\nNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell was no different than her colleagues, touting gun control talking points and going after the National Rifle Association."}
