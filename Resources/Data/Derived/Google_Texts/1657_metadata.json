Speaking with Times columnist Patt Morrison, Kleiman stated, \u201cI keep saying we don\u2019t know nearly as much about cannabis as Pillsbury knows about brownie mix.\u201d\n\nKleiman\u2019s allegation\u2014that the marijuana plant and its effects on society still remains largely a mystery\u2014is a fairly common refrain. But it is far from accurate.\n\nDespite the US government\u2019s nearly century-long prohibition of the plant, cannabis is nonetheless one of the most investigated therapeutically active substances in history. To date, there are over 20,000 published studies or reviews in the scientific literature referencing the cannabis plant and its cannabinoids, nearly half of which were published within the last five years according to a keyword search on PubMed Central, the US government repository for peer-reviewed scientific research. Over 1,450 peer-reviewed papers were published in 2013 alone. (By contrast, a keyword search of \u201chydrocodone,\u201d a commonly prescribed painkiller, yields just over 600 total references in the entire body of available scientific literature.)\n\nWhat information do these thousands of studies about cannabis provide us? For starters, they reveal that marijuana and its active constituents, known as cannabinoids, are relatively safe and effective therapeutic and/or recreational compounds. Unlike alcohol and most prescription or over-the-counter medications, cannabinoids are virtually nontoxic to health cells or organs, and they are incapable of causing the user to experience a fatal overdose. Unlike opiates or ethanol, cannabinoids are not classified as central nervous depressants and cannot cause respiratory failure. In fact, a 2008 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the Canadian Medical Association reported that cannabis-based drugs were associated with virtually no elevated incidences of serious adverse side-effects in over 30 years of investigative use.\n\nStudies further reveal that the marijuana plant contains in excess of 60 active compounds that likely possess distinctive therapeutic properties. One recent review identified some 30 separate therapeutic properties\u2014including anti-cancer properties, anti-diabetic properties, neuroprotection, and anti-stroke properties\u2014influenced by cannabinoids other than THC. While not all of these effects have been replicated in clinical trials, many have.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drug warriors insist we still don't know enough about its possible therapeutic properties.
