John Kasich charmed pundits as he traded points on policy with his colleagues. He also defended his stances on Medicaid expansion and the Common Core educational standards.\n\n1. Ohio Gov. John Kasich potential presidential candidate\n\nHis spunky performance at a Republican Governors Association conference in Florida and his big win on Election Day has vaulted Ohio Gov. John Kasich into the long-shot category of potential Republican presidential candidates.\n\nMr. Kasich brushes off any suggestion he\u2019ll run for president in 2016 and has not done the early things that potential candidates do \u2014 such as hiring a national political consultant, frequently visiting Iowa, or creating an exploratory committee.\n\nBut on the campaign trail, he talked much about the nation as a whole learning from Ohio, and he shifted from calling the U.S. Affordable Care Act \u201cObamacare\u201d to \u201cHillarycare.\u201d\n\nAs a gubernatorial candidate, it would have been political suicide for Mr. Kasich to have been seen as launching a presidential campaign.\n\nBut in part because of his record in Congress of negotiating a balanced budget with Democratic President Bill Clinton, Mr. Kasich\u2019s name keeps coming up. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 2001.

Toys, deadly weapons difficult to distinguish\n\nThe barrels of most airsoft and pellet guns that filled a few shelves at Gander Mountain have a bright orange tip to indicate that the firearm is not lethal.\n\nNot all toy and recreational guns have an orange tip, and many are manufactured to look and feel exactly like their lethal counterpart.\n\n\u201cThe guns are the same size as the real thing, they\u2019re weighted like a real gun, and it can be very difficult to distinguish between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not,\u201d said Toledo police Sgt. Joe Heffernan.\n\nIn Cleveland, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed by an officer who apparently believed that the boy had a handgun. After the boy was fatally shot officers learned the gun was an airsoft gun. It did not have an orange tip.\n\nSince the Nov. 22 shooting, there\u2019s been a renewed interest in defining regulations on such guns. Currently, there is none. READ MORE\n\n\n\nTHE BLADE/AMY E.

Frank Viviano, owner of Bartz Viviano Flowers & Gifts, said his delivery drivers put about 1,000 miles a week on each vehicle in his fleet.\n\n3. Lower gas prices fueling slightly better bottom line\n\nThe lowest fuel prices in years are helping to boost the bottom line of businesses that drive a lot of miles, but not as much as you might think.\n\n\u201cGenerally it\u2019s a good thing, but it\u2019s not like Christmas came early,\u201d said Gary Whitacre, the chief executive officer of of Whitacre Logistics, a 220-rig trucking outfit based in rural Wood County.\n\nInstead it\u2019s consumers \u2014 and by extension retailers \u2014 that stand to gain the most.\n\nEarlier this month, the average U.S. price for a gallon of regular gas fell to less than $3 for the first time in almost four years. Since peaking in June, prices have fallen nearly 24 percent to an average of $2.82 per gallon last week, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
