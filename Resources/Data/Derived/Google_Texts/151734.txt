Any CoOportunity broker and agent commission claims are due Dec. 15, 2015.

A state court in Iowa has issued a final order of liquidation for CoOportunity Health.

CoOportunity was one of the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) insurers created with Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) startup loans. Last fall, when news of the company's financial problems surfaced, it was covering about 100,000 people in Iowa and Nebraska.
