Burwell have triggered a debate about the propriety of the President commenting on a pending case before the Justices. Professors Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha and Paul M. Collins, Jr. conducted a study that analyzed Presidents\u2013from Eisenhower to Obama\u2013who made comments about Supreme Court cases. According to their research, Presidents have mentioned 850 Supreme Court cases in their public remarks. However, only on 47 occasions have the remarks concerned pending cases, 13 of which were made after arguments when the case was submitted. The authors concluded that while it is \u201cnot unheard of for presidents to take positions on cases before they are decided . . . what makes Obama\u2019s remarks stand out is that they are bolder and more extensive than what most presidents have said in the past.\u201d\n\nTo place President Obama\u2019s recent comments into context\u2013based on information kindly provided by the authors\u2013I calculated how close in time the statements were to the oral arguments and decision day. By far, President Obama has set himself apart by opining on the merits of the case after oral arguments have been submitted, and pre-emptively faulting the Justices if they were to rule against the government.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson\n\nThree days after oral arguments in Hearts of Atlanta Motel v. United States, a challenge to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, President Johnson commented on the difficulty of implementing the law, noting \u201cit is now in the Supreme Court.\u201d There was no commentary about the case itself.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford\n\nForty-one days after the Supreme Court held argument in Runyon v. McCrary, which considered whether private schools could exclude students on the basis of race, a reporter asked President Ford whether \u201che would leave . . the private, white academies . . . founded in parts of the South . . . as being perfectly legal.\u201d Ford replies, \u201cThat case is now before the Supreme Court. I think that the individual ought to have a right to send his daughter or his son to a private school if he is willing to pay, whatever the cost might be.\u201d That was the extent of Fordi\u2019s comments.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter\n\nFour months after arguments in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the landmark affirmative action decision that invalidated racial quotas, citing the \u201cseparation of powers,\u201c President Jimmy Carter explained that \u201cI would say that now that it\u2019s in the hands of the Supreme Court and we have filed our position, that there\u2019s nothing additionally that we would do until after the Supreme Court rules.\u201d\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan\n\nIn Bowsher v. Synar, the Supreme Court would invalidate part of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (the \u201cGramm-Rudman-Hollings Act\u201d) finding that Congress improperly assigned the executive power to the Comptroller General. This was a landmark separation of powers decision. Two months before the case was argued to the Supreme Court, President Reagan mentioned the case in three press conferences, only to stress that \u201cWe await a final Supreme Court decision, but nothing the Court says should or will remove our obligation to bring overspending under control.\u201d\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush\n\nThe closest competitor to President Obama is President George H.W. Bush, who commented several times that he favored that Roe v. Wade should be overturned, although he insisted that he would not comment on the merits of a case until after the Supreme Court ruled. In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the Supreme Court upheld an Ohio law limiting the use of public employees for performing abortions. On the day the case was argued, at a joint-press conference with former-President Reagan and current-President Bush, a reporter asked \u201cthe Supreme Court today will be considering an abortion case. Would you like to see that be the first step in a move to ban abortion in this country?\u201d Bush replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Reagan answered more diplomatically, \u201cI think we\u2019ve been agreed on that. You know my position on abortion.\u201d\n\nSix days before the case was decided, a reporter asked President Bush about it: \u201cWe may get that decision this week. As I understand your position, you\u2019re for a constitutional amendment regardless of which way the Supreme Court rules. Is that right?\u201d The President replied, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d The reporter pushed back and asked, \u201cNow, if the Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade and sends this back to the States, would it not be less divisive to let the States decide this rather than go through the whole long, tortuous process of constitutional amendment?\u201d President Bush avoided the question: \u201cI hate to not respond to your question. But the Court is probably going to make a decision very soon, and I would prefer to address myself to the question after the Court has decided.\u201d\n\nThree years later, President George H.W. Bush would re-enter the abortion fray leading up to the Court\u2019s landmark decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Fourteen days after the case was argued, the President said he supported the \u201csanctity of life,\u201d but \u201cthe matter is in the courts, and then we\u2019ll see what happens. I don\u2019t know how broad the Supreme Court decision will be, but at some point it will go back out to the States again.\u201d Two weeks later, and a month before the case was decided, the President repeated that he is committed to the \u201cside of life,\u201d but \u201cthat matter is being adjudicated in the courts right now.\u201d\n\nPresident Bill Clinton\n\nPresident Clinton weighed in on two significant federalism decisions involving guns. First, United States v. Lopez considered whether Congress had the power to regulate the possession of guns in school zones. Less than three weeks before the case was decided, President Clinton briefly addressed the case in remarks at the National Education Association School Safety Summit, stressing that \u201cadministration is supporting that law all the way to the Supreme Court.\u201d There were no substantive comments about the case.\n\nSecond, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Printz v. United States, which involved the constitutionality of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, on June 17, 1996. Three days later, President Clinton staunchly defended the law: \u201cNow the Supreme Court has agreed to review a case over the constitutionality of requiring local law enforcement officials to help make sure that a person buying a handgun is legally entitled to do so. Well, I just want to make clear I am going to do everything in my power to keep the Brady bill the law of the land. It\u2019s keeping people alive. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d President Clinton stressed the real-world implications of the decision: \u201cwe dare not walk away from [the law]. It is keeping people alive.\u201d Six month later, on the eve of oral arguments in Printz, a reporter asked President Clinton about the case. He replied, \u201cWell, I believe it\u2019s constitutional, and I believe that we have clearly preserved the right to keep and bear arms, consistent with the Constitution in this country. But we have also made America a safer place.\u201d\n\nOn December 11, 2000, the day Bush v. Gore was argued, President Clinton was asked if he had \u201cany comment on the Supreme Court today and what they might do?\u201d The President answered concisely: \u201cNo, I think we ought to just wait and see what they do. One way or the other, it will be an historic decision that we\u2019ll live with forever.\u201d\n\nPresident George W. Bush\n\nOn January 15, 2013, two months before oral arguments in the University of Michigan Affirmative Action cases, President George W. Bush noted that \u201cThe Supreme Court will soon hear arguments in a case about admissions policies and student diversity in public universities.\u201d Echoing the position taken by the Solicitor General\u2019s brief\u2013which would be filed the very next day\u2013he explained that the methods used by the school \u201cto achieve this important goal [of diversity] is fundamentally flawed.\u201d\n\nPresident Bush also made a series of comments after oral arguments in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which would invalidate the President\u2019s attempts to use military commissions for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. One month after arguments, the President explained that \u201cWe\u2019re at war with an enemy, and we\u2019ve got to protect ourselves,\u201d but stressed that \u201cwe\u2019re waiting for our Supreme Court to give us a decision as to whether the people need to have a fair trial in a civilian court or in a military court.\u201d Two months after arguments, and three weeks before the decision would be issued, the President explained that his administration would \u201cfile such court claims once the Supreme Court makes its decision as to . . . the proper venue for these trials\u201d for certain detainees. He added, \u201cwe\u2019re waiting on our Supreme Court to act.\u201d Five days later, the President reiterated that the \u201cbest way to handle\u201d certain dangerous detainees is \u201cthrough our military courts. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re waiting on the Supreme Court to make a decision.\u201d Finally, on June 21, eight days before the decision, the President explained once again that \u201cthere ought to be a way forward in a court of law, and I\u2019m waiting for the Supreme Court of the United States to determine the proper venue in which these people can be tried.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama\n\nThat brings us to President Obama. NFIB v. Sebelius considered the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. The landmark case was argued on March 26, 27, and 28, which stretched Monday through Wednesday. The Justices held their conference on Friday, March 30, to vote on the outcome. The following Monday on April 2, during a press conference, President Obama explained the high stakes of the case. He began by assuring us that he is \u201cconfident that the Supreme Court will uphold the law\u201d because \u201cin accordance with precedent out there, it\u2019s constitutional.\u201d His initial sentiment is consistent with how Presidents Bush, Clinton, and others addressed questions about submitted cases. But he went further: \u201cI think it\u2019s important\u2014because I watched some of the commentary last week\u2014to remind people that this is not an abstract argument.\u201d Putting a face on the argument, so it is not viewed as abstract, the President added, \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are affected by the lack of availability of health care . . . The law that\u2019s already in place has already given 2.5 million young people health care that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have it.\u201d He stressed that the \u201cJustices should understand that in the absence of an individual mandate, you cannot have a mechanism to ensure that people with preexisting conditions can actually get health care.\u201d This comment echoes President Clinton\u2019s comment that the Brady Bill \u201cis keeping people alive.\u201d\n\nHe went even further than his predecessors, and said it would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d for the Court to invalidate the law: \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress.\u201d The President charged with hypocrisy \u201cconservative commentators that for years\u201d argued that \u201cbiggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint.\u201d The President hoped that \u201cthis Court will recognize that and not take that step.\u201d\n\nThe very next day, on Tuesday, April 3, the President offered extensive comments in response to a question about whether it \u201cwould be unprecedented for a Supreme Court to overturn laws passed by an elected Congress.\u201d He began with what is the normal trope concerning judicial review: \u201cthe Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our laws, and all of us have to respect it.\u201d Then came the but. \u201c[B]ut it\u2019s precisely because of that extraordinary power that the Court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature, our Congress.\u201d To drive the point home, President Obama invoked the jurisprudential bogeyman of Lochner: \u201cWe have not seen a Court overturn a law that was passed by Congress on a[n] economic issue . . . at least since Lochner. Right? So we\u2019re going back to the thirties, pre-New Deal.\u201d\n\nNext, the President issued a series of admonitions to the Court. He \u201cexpect[s] the Supreme Court actually to recognize that and to abide by well-established precedents out there.\u201d Further, he has \u201cenormous confidence\u201d that \u201cthat the Court is going to exercise its jurisprudence carefully because of the profound power that our Supreme Court has.\u201d He added, \u201cSo I don\u2019t anticipate the Court striking this down. I think they take their responsibilities very seriously.\u201d Towards the end\u2013in a preview of his remarks in 2015\u2013President Obama explained that \u201cAs a consequence\u201d of his prediction of the outcome of the case, \u201cwe\u2019re not spending a whole bunch of time planning for contingencies.\u201d In another foresight of his 2015 comments, the President said that \u201cthere is a human element to this that everybody has to remember. This is not an abstract exercise.\u201d These are the most pointed and provocative comments identified in the study.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and the soon-to-be-decided case of King v. Burwell. This case concerns the validity of an IRS Rule that pays subsidies to consumers in states that failed to establish an exchange under the Affordable Care Act. (Full disclosure: I join an amicus brief supporting the challengers). On June 8\u201396 days after oral arguments in King v. Burwell, and roughly three weeks before the end of the term\u2013the President offered over 600 words about the pending case. These remarks are longer than any statements identified by Eshbaugh-Soha and Collins.\n\nMirroring his comments three years earlier, the President said \u201cthat under well-established precedent, there is no reason why the existing exchanges should be overturned through a court case.\u201d Once again, then came the but. \u201cFrankly, it probably shouldn\u2019t even have been taken up.\u201d In other words, the President\u2019s faults the Court\u2013or at least 4 Justices\u2013for voting to grant certiorari. He then turned to the real-world consequences of\u201d basing the decision on \u201ca contorted reading of the statute . . . . It means that millions of people who are obtaining insurance currently with subsidies suddenly aren\u2019t getting those subsidies; many of them can\u2019t afford it; they pull out.\u201d Making the point clearly, he said invalidating the IRS Rule is \u201ca bad idea. It\u2019s not something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four words\u201d in a 2,000 page statute. Driving the point home after a question of what his \u201cPlan B\u201d is if he loses, the President said, \u201cif somebody does something that doesn\u2019t make any sense, then it\u2019s hard to fix.\u201d At this point, the \u201csomebody\u201d could only refer to the Justices voting to invalidate the rule. He concluded that he was \u201coptimistic that the Supreme Court will play it straight when it comes to the interpretation.\u201d Presumably, a ruling invalidating the IRS would not be straight, but crooked.\n\nThe very next day the President spoke at length about the Affordable Care Act, in a speech before the Catholic Health Association Conference. Although he did not discuss King v. Burwell directly, he alluded to the pending decision: \u201cIt seems so cynical to want to take coverage away from millions of people; to take care away from people who need it the most; to punish millions with higher costs of care and unravel what\u2019s now been woven into the fabric of America. And that kind of cynicism flies in the face of our history.\u201d These comments, though perhaps can be aimed at Congress, are consistent with his previous remarks about the Justices.\n\nAfter \u201cfive years in, what we are talking about it is no longer just a law. It\u2019s no longer just a theory. This isn\u2019t even just about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare . . . This is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another.\u201d Arguably, his comments suggest that not even the Supreme Court should mess with the ACA, as it is \u201cno longer just a law\u201d but something greater.\n\nFinally, on June 11, the President added one more message to the Justices: \u201cOne of the things I try to remind people of \u2014 what we do here, what the Supreme Court does, what Congress does \u2014 these aren\u2019t just abstractions. These are things that really matter in people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nConclusions\n\nVery few Presidents have spoken about pending Supreme Court cases after arguments were submitted. Even fewer discussed the merits of the cases. Only a handful could be seen as pre-emptively faulting the Justices for ruling against the government. President Obama, however, stands alone in his pointed and directed arguments to the Supreme Court. He has compared the Court invalidating the individual mandate to Lochnerism. He has chastised the Justices for only being able to invalidate the IRS rule based on a \u201ccontorted reading of the statute.\u201d To the President, the Court \u201cshouldn\u2019t even have\u201d granted certiorari. Striking down the mandate would have been \u201cunprecedented\u201d and invalidating the IRS Rule would \u201cunravel what\u2019s now been woven into the fabric of America.\u201d While we can debate the propriety of these comments, and ponder whether or not they have an effect on the Court, the 44th President has set a new precedent for ex parte arguments.\n\nJosh Blackman is a constitutional-law professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, and the author of Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare (2013) and Unraveled: Obamacare, Religious Liberty, and Executive Power (Forthcoming 2016).
