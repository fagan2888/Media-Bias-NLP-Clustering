And they would take a lot of credit for what we are seeing right now in debt reduction.\u201d\n\nSo we decided to look into the data and see what it says.\n\nThe Facts\n\nFirst of all, a caveat: The information that follows is based mostly on estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, some of which are long-range estimates subject to many variables. Reasonable people might disagree on whether these estimates are correct \u2014 skeptics might argue that the long-term cost of \u201cObamacare\u201d is undercounted\u2013but it\u2019s the best that we have at the moment.\n\nAlthough Furman did not directly address Jansing\u2019s comment, we were curious to see if the impact of the sequester and the Affordable Care Act on the deficit could be measured for fiscal year 2013. The deficit fell by $409 billion, so how much can be attributed to either the health care law or the sequester?\n\nIn Table 1-7, the CBO\u2019s 2013 Budget and Economic Outlook shows that the sequester accounts for roughly $42 billion in deficit reduction in the 2014 fiscal year. (Sequester, a 10-year straight line reduction in discretionary spending, did not start until almost half of the fiscal year was over, so the savings really become apparent in 2014.)\n\nMeanwhile, CBO in 2010 estimated that the Affordable Care Act would reduce the deficit by $41 billion in 2013. (The original $56 billion estimate included savings from a provision that has been dropped and also from unrelated changes in student loans, so we have removed those items to arrive that this figure.) Reductions in Medicare spending were responsible for a large part of the deficit reduction in 2013; the law will not be fully implemented until 2014.\n\nIn other words, both the health-care law and sequester each accounted for about 10 percent of the deficit reduction in 2013. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, but it\u2019s worth noting that a one-time $50 billion payment from Fannie Mae had an even bigger impact.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Furman\u2019s comment. His claim was that the Affordable Care Act will have a greater impact in reducing the deficit in the \u201cmedium and long run\u201d than the sequester. On one level, this makes sense, as the sequester is scheduled to end after 10 years, whereas the Affordable Care Act is deemed to be permanent.\n\nIn the near term, the data show, the sequester shrinks the deficit more. Each year, it reduces the deficit by about $100 billion, or about 0.5 percent of the overall economy (gross domestic product) in that period. (Since the economy keeps growing, and the annual size of the sequester is about the same, by the end of the sequester its impact amounts to about 0.35 percent of GDP.)\n\nMeanwhile, the health care law adds to the deficit in its early years of implementation\u2014total deficit reduction in its first five years is just $7 billion\u2014but then, according to CBO\u2019s numbers, it starts to reduce the deficit. (We are relying on a 2012 letter from the CBO to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), regarding a GOP bill to repeal the health-care law, and so every number has to be flipped, such as from negative to positive, to measure deficit reduction.)\n\nTo Furman\u2019s key point, after the first 10 years, CBO predicts in the letter to Boehner that (after flipping the numbers) the health care law would reduce the deficit by 0.5 percent of GDP between 2023 and 2032.\n\nOf course, CBO\u2019s prediction is laden with caveats, including noting that some provisions of the law (such as reductions to Medicare providers) may not be possible to sustain over time. If those elements of the law are changed, the reduction in the deficit would shrink. But it does show that over the next 20 years, the overall impact of the health-care law on the deficit would be larger and more sustained than the sequester.\n\n\u201cThe deficit came down by over $400 billion last year and only about one-tenth of that deficit reduction was due to the sequester,\u201d Furman told The Fact Checker. \u201cMore importantly, the sequester does not have any structural reforms and ends after 2021 so it contains no long-run deficit reduction. In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Affordable Care Act would have significant long-run deficit reduction and thus over the medium- and long-run makes a much more important contribution to addressing our fiscal challenge while contributing to lower health cost growth.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nIn the immediate future, the sequester will reduce deficit more, but after the next eight or so years, the Affordable Care Act is deemed to have a greater long-term impact, according to the CBO. Furman\u2019s quote referenced the \u201cmiddle and long run,\u201d which we read as a single period of time.\n\nAny massive piece of legislation affecting such a large part of the economy will have many unknown consequences, both good and bad, that are impossible to predict. (As one reader put it, \u201cyou are trying to compare how fast a swimming pool drains from a constant hole to how fast it will fill up from future rains.\u201d) It would be interesting to revisit this claim in 20 years. But from what we know now, Furman\u2019s statement stands up to scrutiny. He earns a rare Geppetto Checkmark.\n\nGeppetto Checkmark\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nCheck out our candidate Pinocchio Tracker\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House says, long-term, that 'Obamacare' will reduce the deficit more than the sequester.
