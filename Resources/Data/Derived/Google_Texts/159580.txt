SAN DIEGO (AP) — Jessica Alba told the crowd at Comic-Con that she got in touch with the dark side for her return to “Sin City.”

The “Fantastic Four” and “Dark Angel” star is reprising her role as exotic dancer and revenge seeker Nancy Callahan in “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,” a prequel to the 2005 graphic novel adaptation “Sin City.”

“I just really connected with the dark side of Nancy,” Alba told fans Saturday at the pop-culture convention. “It was hard to detach from that until the movie was over.”

Frank Miller, the film’s co-director and graphic novel creator, didn’t initially understand the effect that returning to the role had on Alba’s personality.
