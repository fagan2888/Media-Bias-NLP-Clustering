There is a spectrum of possible responses to any crisis: On one end is George Costanza from \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d who smells smoke at a birthday party and shoves aside children and grandmothers as he flees the room. On the other is Dan Aykroyd playing Julia Child, who treats a severed artery like a casual teaching moment, enthusiastically dispensing first-aid tips and cooking instructions \u2014 \u201cSave the liver!\u201d \u2014 until she gracefully passes out.\n\nObamacare is in crisis, but as the blood flows and the patient becomes ever more lightheaded, the president desperately pretends it\u2019s all intentional. As with Aykroyd\u2019s grisly \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch, we know it won\u2019t end well, but it\u2019s impossible to look away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as the president haplessly tries to reassure everyone that things will work out just fine, Democrats in Congress look more like George Costanza every day. Their problem is: Where\u2019s the door?\n\nIn early October, as things went sour, the White House tried to pass it all off as a simple computer glitch. Two months on, it is hard to overstate the magnitude of the failure. Three years and $600 million were spent creating a nonfunctional system that was never fully tested and has deep security flaws. With the Nov. 30 deadline for system repairs approaching, the Democrats\u2019 hope for a quick fix is fading as fast as their poll numbers. Last week Obamacare\u2019s technology chief admitted that up to 40 percent of the software still remained to be developed.\n\nBut a working website was never the real problem; it\u2019s the law itself \u2014 which, tragically, performs as designed. By setting unrealistically high coverage standards, Obamacare renders millions of insurance policies illegal. Since Oct. 1, about 100,000 have signed up for new coverage under the law, while nearly 5 million families have had their current plans canceled.\n\nSimple economics tells us that nearly everyone dropped by their current insurer will see rate increases; if the law demands new features, those features will cost money. We also know that prices will increase for the younger, healthier purchasers who are expected to subsidize the older and less healthy. At Maryland\u2019s Bowie State College, 5,500 students lost coverage when their premiums rose more than 1,500 percent.\n\nThen there\u2019s the example of Jessica Sanford, a single mother cited by President Obama in an October speech touting the laws\u2019 benefits. Unfortunately, those supposed benefits were as real as the commitment that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d Last week, Sanford told the press that she wouldn\u2019t enroll after all. The plans are too expensive, and she feels stuck in a \u201cbig treadmill of bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Capitol Hill, this dramatic, widespread rate shock is causing real political panic, as the realization sinks in that a few lines of new computer code won\u2019t solve these problems. Our health care system is coming apart at the seams.\n\nConfronted with millions losing coverage and facing price increases at the same time, the White House casually announced that it would now be just fine for insurers to sell those discontinued plans. Either Obama has no business sense, or he\u2019s being cynical. Insurers can\u2019t simply create, price, and market a product on a few weeks\u2019 notice. Far from resolving anything, the announcement was a concession of failure.\n\nTrying to shift the blame to insurers may be worth rolling the dice to Obama, but it\u2019s high-stakes poker for his congressional allies. Democrats rammed the monstrous bill through on a straight party-line vote and subsequently have refused to consider a single legislative change. Now, with less than a year to go in the election cycle, they\u2019re on the hook politically \u2014 which is why vulnerable Democrats are now frantically introducing \u201cfix Obamacare\u201d bills.\n\nSome, like a 90-day extension of the enrollment period, are meaningless. Others, like a permanent grandfathering of all current plans, are substantial. Yet grandfathering every plan is an admission that the standards never should have been enacted in the first place. Anyway, all these proposals are just political cover. If and when Harry Reid allows real votes to occur on the Senate floor, the stampede will begin \u2014 away from the mandates, away from the taxes, and away from Obamacare.\n\nBut where to? No one knows, but neither did George Costanza. As he ran for the door, the last person he shoved out of the way was a clown. When Democrats begin to bolt, the president may want to be out of town.\n\n\u25a0 For the record: My last column misidentified the winery whose advertisements featured Orson Welles.
