The committee no doubt hopes to get to the bottom of this mess and set some heads to rolling in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). So, in the finest tradition of the Senate, the committee got a bunch of people from the VA and veteran\u2019s organizations to wear suits, sit in a row, and talk.\n\nAnd one of the things they talked about a lot was how awesome the VA is.\n\nTrue, it's no surprise that VA officials told Senators how awesome the VA is. But everyone else had wonderful things to say about the VA too \u2014 including Dan Dellinger, the commander of the American Legion who is calling louder than anyone for the head of the head of the VA, Eric Shinseki. As Dellinger said in his testimony, \u201cOverwhelmingly, our task force finds that veterans are extremely satisfied with their healthcare team and medical providers.\u201d\n\nVA accused of cover-up as veterans die waiting to see a doctor. Read more here.\n\nThis actually isn\u2019t a new development in ass-covering technology. Healthcare policy experts have been praising the VA as a model of efficient, centrally managed healthcare for years. This spate of praise for the VA started in the mid-2000s and continued right through the middle of the debate on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2014 a.k.a. Obamacare \u2014 when health policy wonks were looking to the VA to see what could be done to improve everyone else\u2019s healthcare.\n\nAmid all the praise, pretty much everyone in the hearing also made a point of saying that the VA has some major problems\u2026 and is screwing things up in a lot of critical ways\u2026 and is generally a total mess. In particular, people pointed out issues with veterans gaining access to health care, the long wait lists they must endure, and the lying VA officials have done about the wait lists \u2014 which, by the way, has been a known and documented issue for years.\n\nThe VA appears to be a system that provides really good care that doesn't cost a great deal of money \u2014 but it\u2019s never going to be particularly speedy.\n\nEveryone \u2014 critics and supporters of the VA alike \u2014 agreed that the problem wasn\u2019t the health care, it was the wait to get it. Apparently the VA can treat all of the veterans some of the time or some of the veterans all of the time, but treating all the veterans all of the time is a real doozy. According to Carl Blake, who testified on behalf of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \u201cMany of the problems that the media continues to report are really access problems, not quality-of-care problems. While there are many detractors of the VA who would like to convince veterans and the public at large that the VA is providing poor quality care, that is simply not true.\u201d\n\nThe problem stems from a lack of doctors, nurse practitioners, and other clinical care givers. Normally, this is the kind of thing that most people would solve by getting a bigger budget and hiring more doctors. But, according to the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), money isn\u2019t the issue. In his testimony, VVA representative Richard Weidman said:\n\nAs we did for the 112th Congress, VVA stressed again in our annual statements for the 113th Congress to the Committees on Veterans Affairs that we again wanted to make it clear: \u201cFunding is not the primary issue\u201d when it comes to timely adjudication of claims and of appeals at VA. Similarly, VVA stressed that funding is not the primary issue when it comes to the delivery of timely, quality medical care to veterans at the Veterans Health Administration facilities.\n\nApparently, the VA is too bureaucratic \u2014 shocking! \u2014 and hires too many paper-pushers at the expense of people doing actual healthcare. If the VA spent less time on paperwork \u2014 including the paperwork bureaucrats had to do to lie about patient wait-time lists \u2014 it would have more resources to devote to things like treating patients.\n\nBut that\u2019s the rub. What kinds of paperwork are people spending their time processing? A lot of it grows out of things any taxpayer expects out of any government-funded agency: oversight, accountability, and some basic competency. Representing the Disabled American Veterans organization, Joseph Volante said:\n\nUnlike private providers and healthcare systems, VA is required by its own policy to admit and publicly report all medical errors and fully investigate all untimely deaths. VA uses the information from these investigations for self-improvement and to strengthen prevention protocols system wide. To be effective, VA must have sufficient internal monitoring and reporting systems that detect and report problems rapidly through the chain of command in order to correct them and develop prevention strategies nationwide. These recent revelations indicate that there are troubling gaps in this reporting system that need to be addressed.\n\nIn other words, because it\u2019s a public agency, there should be more oversight and accountability. Which means more bureaucrats and more paperwork. Which, in turn, will result in studies, policies, guidelines, and all manner of corrective measures that very large government organizations use to try to change themselves. All of this puts the squeeze on care providers, exacerbating the problems that lead to the wait-time cover-ups to begin with.\n\nIn his testimony, healthcare researcher Phillip Longman \u2014 he wrote Best Care Anywhere, a book about how wonderful VA healthcare is \u2014 pointed out that private hospitals don\u2019t have waiting list requirements or an Inspector General\u2019s office. To be sure, that cuts down on staffing costs dramatically. So what? Just privatize the VA and be done with it?\n\nWell, the Veterans of Foreign Wars \u2014 represented in today\u2019s hearing by Ryan Galluci \u2014 would strongly disagree. \u201cWe must resist any suggestion that Veterans Health Administration (VHA) [the VA's network of care facilities] is a fundamental failure which should be dismantled in favor of an alternative model,\" he said. \"Such suggestions not only serve to relieve VA of its responsibilities, but fail to take into account the contributions that VHA makes to veterans, their families, and the medical community as a whole.\u201d\n\nWhen solving an engineering problem, a designer must generally choose to ignore one parameter: performance, cost, or speed. Something can be solved quickly and cheaply, but it will be a lousy solution. Or a design can solve a problem very elegantly and be implemented quickly, but it will cost a fortune. The VA appears to be a system that provides really good care that doesn't cost a great deal of money \u2014 but it\u2019s never going to be particularly speedy.\n\nThe American public wants a way to provide high-quality, cost-effective health care to its veterans. But that comes with bureaucratic overhead, which is going to exact its toll in the form of things like wait times. Speeding up those times, however, may very well lead to lower-quality care and/or higher costs. So while the VA has horrible problems with the speed of its care, the public \u2014 whether they realize it or not \u2014 may not want it any other way.\n\nFollow Ryan Faith on Twitter: @Operation_Ryan", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "https://news.vice.com/article/veterans-wait-too-long-for-healthcare-and-maybe-we-should-keep-it-that-way", "sailthru.author": "Ryan Faith", "twitter": {"account_id": 4503599628027146, "title": "Veterans Wait Too Long For Healthcare \u2014 and Maybe We Should Keep It That Way | VICE News", "url": "https://news.vice.com/article/veterans-wait-too-long-for-healthcare-and-maybe-we-should-keep-it-that-way", "image": {"src": "https://news-images.vice.com/images/articles/meta/2014/05/16/hero-original-1400205003.jpg?crop=0.6736111111111112xw:1xh;0.2951388888888889xw,0xh"}, "site": "@vicenews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Everyone would agree that veterans shouldn't have to be wait-listed to see doctors.
