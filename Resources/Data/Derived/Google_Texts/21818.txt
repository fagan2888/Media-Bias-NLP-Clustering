Clay Aiken, the 2003 “American Idol” runner-up who in now running as a Democrat in North Carolina, seems to think that the celebrity women targeted in recent nude photo leaks were asking for it.

“Anybody who takes inappropriate pictures of themselves deserves exactly what they get,” the congressional hopeful told The Washington Post.

Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Kaley Cuoco are among the victims who had their personal pictures stolen and posted on the Internet back in August. Kim Kardashian, Hope Solo and Hayden Panettiere, among others, were reportedly targeted in a second attack over the weekend.

“Of course whoever [stole and released the photos] should be hog-tied,” Mr. Aiken added. “And it’s unfortunate that we don’t have Internet security right now or the laws in place to protect people from pirating that stuff.”

The Democrat is set to face two-term Republican incumbent Renee L. Ellmers this November.
