Dannel Malloy (D) signed what the Hartford Courant called \u201cthe toughest assault weapons legislation in the nation\u201d last year. It required owners of semi-automatic firearms to register all firearms designated as \u201cassault weapons\u201d with the state government, along with any \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines they may own, by December 31, 2013.\n\nThe Malloy regime expected Connecticut residents to register somewhere between 372,000-400,000 firearms, and roughly 2 million firearm magazines that held more than 10 rounds before January 1.\n\nWhat they got instead was defiance.\n\nJust 50,000 of the estimated 372,000 so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d in the state were registered by the deadline, or less than 15 percent. That\u2019s still far better than the anemic 38,000 \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines that were reported to authorities, out of 2 million.\n\nWhy is compliance so low? We can\u2019t know for sure. After all, the owners of these firearms and magazines refused to register, so we can\u2019t easily interview them. But the theory we\u2019ve heard bandied about most frequently is that the owners of these firearms felt that registration was a forerunner of confiscation, and that they would rather become felons under the eyes of a vengeful state than become disarmed subjects.\n\nThe development has left the government stunned and unsure of how to respond, and has driven the editors of the anti-gun Courant into a sputtering rage.\n\nThe newspaper released an unsigned editorial on Valentine\u2019s Day titled \u201cState Can\u2019t Let Gun Scofflaws Off Hook,\u201d and argued that the state should use the background check database to hunt down non-compliant owners, presumably targeting them for police raids and arrests.\n\nWe can only assume that the Courant\u2019s newsroom staff skipped American history in school, or they would know what happened the last time a group of government forces attempted a series of dramatic gun control raids in a neighboring state. As I recall, that day, April 19, 1775, went rather poorly for the British Regulars under Lt. Col. Smith.\n\nMalloy\u2019s staff seems to grasp their terrible predicament a bit better than the hotheads of the Courant. Sending 1,120 Connecticut State Troopers on SWAT-style raids against more than 80,000 suspect \u201cassault weapon\u201d owners could not possibly end well.\n\nTo date, Malloy and his allies in the legislature who rammed through these strict gun control laws largely remain silent on the fact that the citizenry has simply ignored them. What else can they do?\n\nThe government of Connecticut can\u2019t threaten the citizenry with criminal charges. They\u2019ve already willingly decided to become felons en masse. The government can\u2019t threaten the citizenry with force. They\u2019re both grossly outnumbered and outgunned. The government can\u2019t offer an amnesty. It would only reinforce how little power the government has over a rebellious citizenry.\n\nThe only realistic option is for the government of Connecticut to pretend that their assault weapon ban never existed. To admit it exists, and that they can do nothing to enforce it, would reveal that the emperor and his court have no clothes.\n\nA nearly identical problem is brewing next door in the much larger, more populous state of New York, thanks to Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s hastily-passed NY SAFE Act. That law demands that New Yorkers register their semi-automatic \u201cassault rifles\u201d with the government by April 15.\n\nWhile Connecticut is thought to have something less than 400,000 firearms classified as \u201cassault weapons\u201d under their law, New York is thought to have as many as 1 million firearms meeting New York\u2019s revised criteria.\n\nCuomo faces an even bigger registration problem in New York than Malloy did in Connecticut because many of New York\u2019s sheriffs are in near open revolt against the SAFE Act, and have stated publicly that they will not enforce it. While they have been less publicly vocal, New York State Troopers have quietly indicated that they, too, will do as little as possible to enforce the law.\n\nNew York Assemblyman Bill Nojay, a Republican from suburban Rochester, summed up Cuomo\u2019s problem succinctly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the troopers and you don\u2019t have the sheriffs, who have you got? You\u2019ve got Andrew Cuomo pounding on the table in Albany.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the common revolt by New York gun owners and law enforcement against the SAFE Act, it is quite likely that the law\u2019s April 15 deadline will reveal an even more spectacular refusal of citizens to register their arms, well exceeding 90 percent.\n\nWhat will Cuomo do then? He has the option of following Malloy\u2019s lead and just remaining silent.\n\nUnfortunately for Cuomo, he\u2019s never shown the ability. \u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "What would happen if a liberal government passed a new gun law but nobody obeyed it?.05/25/2016 15:24:10PM EST.", "author": "Townhall Magazine", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "What would happen if a liberal government passed a new gun law but nobody obeyed it?", "title": "Townhall Magazine - The \u201cAssault Weapon\u201d Rebellion", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/townhallmagazine/2014/04/12/the-assault-weapon-rebellion-n1822409", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/55/484fefdf-5466-447c-a1d1-78f422523d4f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "What would happen if a liberal government passed a new gun law but nobody obeyed it?", "title": "Townhall Magazine - The \u201cAssault Weapon\u201d Rebellion", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/townhallmagazine/2014/04/12/the-assault-weapon-rebellion-n1822409", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/55/484fefdf-5466-447c-a1d1-78f422523d4f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The \u201cAssault Weapon\u201d Rebellion, Townhall Magazine, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde168\"", "article_summary": "Sending 1,120 Connecticut State Troopers on SWAT-style raids against more than 80,000 suspect \u201cassault weapon\u201d owners could not possibly end well.\nDannel Malloy (D) signed what the Hartford Courant called \u201cthe toughest assault weapons legislation in the nation\u201d last year.\nJust 50,000 of the estimated 372,000 so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d in the state were registered by the deadline, or less than 15 percent.\nThe only realistic option is for the government of Connecticut to pretend that their assault weapon ban never existed.\nIt required owners of semi-automatic firearms to register all firearms designated as \u201cassault weapons\u201d with the state government, along with any \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazines they may own, by December 31, 2013."}
