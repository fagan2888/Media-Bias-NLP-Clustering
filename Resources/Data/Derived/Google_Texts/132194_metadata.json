Lou Dasilva said.\n\nOfficers also charged a 20-year-old Everett man with being intoxicated in public when he decided to urinate on a road, where police were conducting spotchecks.\n\nOfficers pulled over 355 vehicles in Innisfil Friday, giving roadside tests to 23 drivers suspected of drinking. Four drivers were in the warning range. They had their vehicles impounded and lost their licences for three days.\n\nDasilva said officers have been setting up RIDE checks on back roads recently instead of on high-profile main roads.\n\nPolice are finding more violations even though fewer vehicles are being checked.\n\n\u201cThis tells me drivers are still using back roads to avoid detection from police. Most are very surprised to see us on those back roads,\u201d Dasilva said. \u201cAlso the trend to see more drugs on board seems to be increasing.\u201d\n\nPolice have charged three people with possession of marijuana since RIDE checks started this week.\n\nSo far, one person has been charged with impaired and five have seen their licenses suspended for registering a warning. Two drivers were driving under suspension. Police also laid 10 Highway Traffic Act charges in RIDE checks.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "INNISFIL \u2014 Officers charged a 20-year-old Everett man with being intoxicated in public when he decided to urinate on a...", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
