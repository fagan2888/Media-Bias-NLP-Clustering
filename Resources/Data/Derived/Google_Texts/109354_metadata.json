Ryan of Wisconsin when he was chairman of the Budget Committee. But this plan may fare better than Mr. Ryan\u2019s since Senate Republicans will be under pressure to reach an accord.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA budget is a moral document; it talks about where your values are,\u201d said Representative Rob Woodall, Republican of Georgia and a member of the Budget Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had the opportunity to partner with the Senate to provide real certainty.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, saw it differently: \u201cThis takes budget quackery to a new level.\u201d\n\nWithout relying on tax increases, budget writers were forced into contortions to bring the budget into balance while placating defense hawks clamoring for increased military spending. They added nearly $40 billion in \u201cemergency\u201d war funding to the defense budget for next year, raising military spending without technically breaking strict caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act.\n\nThe plan contains more than $1 trillion in savings from unspecified cuts to programs like food stamps and welfare. To make matters more complicated, the budget demands the full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, including the tax increases that finance the health care law. But the plan assumes the same level of federal revenue over the next 10 years that the Congressional Budget Office foresees with those tax increases in place \u2014 essentially counting $1 trillion of taxes that the same budget swears to forgo.\n\nAnd still, it achieves balance only by counting $147 billion in \u201cdynamic\u201d economic growth spurred by the policies of the budget itself. In 2024, the budget would produce a $13 billion surplus, thanks in part to $53 billion in a projected \u201cmacroeconomic impact\u201d generated by Republican policies. That surplus would grow to $33 billion in 2025, and so would the macroeconomic impact, to $83 billion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who believes we\u2019re going to balance the budget in 10 years,\u201d said Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s all hooey.\u201d\n\nThe prescribed cuts would be deep, but Republicans cast them as positive. The budget does not cut popular Pell Grants for higher education; it \u201cmakes the Pell Grant program permanently sustainable,\u201d the document says. Spending on Medicaid may fall $913 billion over a decade once the health program is turned to block grants to the states, but House Republicans preferred to say in the plan, \u201cOur budget realigns the relationship the federal government has with states and local communities by respecting and restoring the principle of federalism.\u201d\n\nThe plan would cut billions of dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, but that was not exactly how the budget phrased the reductions.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis budget converts SNAP to a State Flexibility Fund so state governments have the power to administer the program in ways that best fit the needs of their communities with greater incentives to achieve better results,\u201d the document says.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDomestic programs would be cut $519 billion below the already restrictive caps set in 2011. White House officials estimated that between the Affordable Care Act repeal and the cuts to Medicaid, 37 million people would lose health insurance, more than doubling the ranks of the uninsured.\n\nRepresentative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, called it \u201clong on rhetoric and short on solution.\u201d\n\nAnd President Obama blasted it after a meeting with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is a failure to invest in education, infrastructure, research and national defense. All the things that we need to grow, need to create jobs, to stay at the forefront of innovation and to keep our country safe,\u201d Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House.\n\nThe House Budget Committee will formally draft the budget on Wednesday, as Senate Republicans unveil their counteroffer. Like the House version, the Senate\u2019s will balance in 10 years, aides to Republicans senators said. Like the House, the Senate will include language to help lawmakers repeal or reshape the Affordable Care Act this year. How the two chambers resolve their differences could be a central drama in Washington throughout the spring.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be tough,\u201d said Representative Bruce Poliquin, Republican of Maine, \u201cbut we can do this. We must do this.\u201d\n\nThe most contentious area remains military spending. By increasing the so-called overseas contingency operations account, the House budget would bring total military spending higher than Mr. Obama\u2019s request, a critical demand by some Republicans in both the House and the Senate. That war funding is not supposed to go to baseline operations of the Defense Department.\n\n\u201cMy main concern is getting the numbers up, whatever it takes,\u201d said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who had been clamoring to break the cap on military spending.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, remained skeptical.\n\n\u201cIf that House wants to act that way,\u201d it can, Mr. McCain said, but he criticized its version as \u201cnot legitimate budgeting.\u201d\n\nModerate Republicans \u2014 and Republican senators running for re-election next year in heavily Democratic states \u2014 are likely to have their own problems with the House approach.\n\n\u201cI voted against the Ryan budget in years past,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.\n\nBut in the end, even senior Democrats said Republicans were likely to paper over their differences for a House-Senate compromise that would set spending levels for the fiscal year that begins in October. House Republicans hope that a deal would also secure parliamentary language \u2014 called reconciliation \u2014 to ease passage this year of an overhaul of the tax code and a repeal of the health care law. Such language would prevent Senate Democrats from filibustering those bills, but if the bills are to become law, Republicans will have to either overcome a presidential veto or reach a compromise with the president.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150317093125, "twitter": {"description": "The Republicans\u2019 proposed budget partly privatizes Medicare, turns Medicaid into block
