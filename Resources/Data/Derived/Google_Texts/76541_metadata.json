Scott Tipton decides to challenge U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet in November\u2019s election.\n\nRoberts, who last June officially pulled her name off the long list of Bennet\u2019s possible GOP challengers, told The Colorado Statesman she\u2019s heard Tipton will not challenge Bennet, adding she\u2019s fully focused on the 2016 state legislative session and not a possible run for Tipton\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, which includes part of Eagle County.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard any close-to-the-source indication that Scott would make that move,\u201d Roberts said of the Cortez Republican currently serving his third term in Congress. \u201cIn fact, I keep hearing the reverse \u2013 that he\u2019s not going to do it.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Roberts is urging her fellow state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to focus on solving Colorado\u2019s pressing policy problems rather than running bills aimed at making political statements during an election year.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that election cycle 2016 is going to consume our 120 days at the Legislature, and I truly hope that we exercise some self-discipline individually as well as our political parties to actually get work done,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nHowever, partisan rancor is already rearing its head on the healthcare front, with Republicans, including Roberts, strongly indicating they\u2019ll try to torpedo Democratic plans to pull the state\u2019s hospital provider fee out of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights revenue cap during budget negotiations.\n\nAnd the primary legislative focus for Roberts, who chairs the Colorado Health Insurance Exchange Oversight Committee, will be running a bill to obtain a Section 1332 waiver under the federal Affordable Care Act that would allow Coloradans seeking health insurance through the Colorado Health Insurance Marketplace to avoid enrolling in Medicaid.\n\nRoberts argues that the ever-expanding rolls of Medicaid recipients are increasing the costs of healthcare in her rural, eight-county district in Southwest Colorado and throughout the state because there aren\u2019t enough providers accepting Medicaid because of low reimbursement rates.\n\n\u201cColorado really needs to take the bull by the horns and come up with a better solution, and it\u2019s sure not Sen. [Irene] Aguilar\u2019s $25 billion solution, because that\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Roberts said, referring to Aguilar\u2019s Colorado Care single-payer ballot initiative proposal.\n\nAguilar, a Democrat and a Denver internal medicine doctor, agrees with Roberts that healthcare costs need to come down in rural areas and Medicaid reimbursement rates need to go up, but she counters that Roberts\u2019 Medicaid opt-out plan is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d because one of the requirements of a 1332 waiver is that it\u2019s budget neutral for the federal government over the next 10 years.\n\nAguilar, who\u2019s one of only two Democrats on the Health Insurance Exchange Oversight Committee, told The Statesman there are two ways to keep healthcare costs down on Colorado\u2019s rural Western Slope, and one of them involves a budget battle to keep the governor from cutting a nearly $150 million primary care bump that keeps Medicaid reimbursement rates close to federal Medicare rates.\n\nAguilar says studies show that keeping people with their primary care docs lowers costs and reduces emergency room visitation rates and hospital stays. The other way to keep costs down is to better coordinate care in rural areas for higher-cost patients with medically complex problems.\n\nRoberts says private insurance companies have dramatically increased premiums, co-pays and deductibles in her district in order to compensate for enrollees lost to Medicaid, which she argues is simply passing the costs from the private sector to a government program.\n\n\u201cA lot of the policy decisions that have been made, frankly under Democratic control whether at the federal or state level, are driving away a lot of our working-class and middle-class Coloradans, or at least making them question whether they can stay in Colorado,\u201d said Roberts, who worked as a chairlift operator and park ranger when she first moved to Colorado.\n\nAguilar and other Senate Democrats wouldn\u2019t speculate on whether Roberts is taking her anti-Medicaid, anti-ACA stance for political reasons and a possible congressional run. Sen. Matt Jones, D-Louisville, says he assumes Roberts is acting from her experience chairing the committee, but he disagrees with her approach.\n\n\u201cWe expanded Medicaid, which was more service than people had before, even if there weren\u2019t doctors available,\u201d Jones told The Statesman. \u201cI know there\u2019s a shortage in rural Colorado, but that\u2019s another issue.\n\n\u201cThere are lot more people being insured these days, and our level of uninsured is at an all-time low. The state sets the level of Medicaid reimbursement; sounds like that\u2019s a budget problem.\u201d\n\nOther than calling Roberts\u2019 bill a non-starter, Aguilar wouldn\u2019t speculate on her motivations.\n\n\u201cThis is my third election year in the Legislature, and I really was a politically na\u00efve person before I came here, but my sense is that there are a certain number of bills that people put out there just to say, \u2018This is what I support,\u2019 and they know it\u2019s not going to pass.\u201d\n\nAfter that she says it\u2019s really just a matter of whether those statement bills die quietly in committee or catch fire because they\u2019re a hot topic nationally.\n\n\u201cReally, the question is what kind of attitude do people come in with with their bills that they know are making statements and do they die quickly, or do they die after a lot of pain,\u201d Aguilar said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Durango's Ellen Roberts concerned about election-year politics during legislative session", "og": {"site_name": "Real Vail", "description": "Durango's Ellen Roberts concerned about election-year politics during legislative session", "title": "Durango's Ellen Roberts concerned about election-year politics during legislative session - Real Vail", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/colorado-capitol.jpeg", "height": 550}, "updated_time": "2016-01-11T08:27:01-06:00", "url": "http://www.realvail.com/durangos-ellen-roberts-concerned-about-election-year-politics-during-legislative-session/a2526", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Durango's Ellen Roberts concerned about election-year politics during legislative session", "creator": "@davidowilliams", "image": "http://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/colorado-capitol.jpeg", "title": "Durango's Ellen Roberts concerned about election-year politics during legislative session - Real Vail", "site": "@realvail", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "news, information, vail, colorado, vail valley, beaver creek, eagle, gypsum, edwards", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/realvail", "section": "News", "tag": "state legislature", "published_time": "2016-01-11T08:21:15-06:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-11T08:27:01-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI know there\u2019s a shortage in rural Colorado, but that\u2019s another issue.\nThe other way to keep costs down is to better coordinate care in rural areas for higher-cost patients with medically complex problems.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard any close-to-the-source indication that Scott would make that move,\u201d Roberts said of the Cortez Republican currently serving his third term in Congress.\nThe state sets the level of Medicaid reimbursement; sounds like that\u2019s a budget problem.\u201dOther than calling Roberts\u2019 bill a non-starter, Aguilar wouldn\u2019t speculate on her motivations.\nSen.
