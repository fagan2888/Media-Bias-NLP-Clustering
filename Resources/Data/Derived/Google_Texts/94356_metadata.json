As a result, he said, costs have increased and jail staff has undergone greater training.\n\nDart said the Cook County Jail is now the largest mental health provider in the state and perhaps the largest in the country. He said he is traveling next month to accept an award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness for trying to cope with the problem. But \"it\u2019s not a good thing, not a good thing at all. And this is truly a national issue, a national problem,\u201d Dart said.\n\nHe said the closure of community-based mental health facilities has led to a criminalization of the illness, with incarceration costs far in excess of what medical treatment would cost.\n\nThrough the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as the president\u2019s signature health care coverage law is known, Dart said enrollees now \u201chave the ability to at least have care paid for -- if they can find it someplace that\u2019s still open. But that\u2019s the big problem, to find a place that\u2019s still open.\u201d\n\nYou can find the full interview here.\n\nrap30@aol.com\n\n\n\nTwitter @rap30", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Inmates signing up for Obamacare: Dart", "date": "2014-08-04", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, attempting to cope with what he says is a growing mental health crisis among inmates at the county jail, said up to 9,000 people who have been incarcerated have signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act in an attempt to get the care they need.", "title": "Inmates signing up for Obamacare: Dart", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/chi-dart-up-to-9000-inmates-signed-up-for-obamacare-to-help-with-mental-health-treatment-20140803-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53df6167/turbine/chi-dart-up-to-9000-inmates-signed-up-for-obamacare-to-help-with-mental-health-treatment-20140803", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp02.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/80990312", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Obamacare, mental health, Cook County Jail, Tom Dart, Affordable Care Act", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, mental health, Cook County Jail, Tom Dart, Affordable Care Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said up to 9,000 people who have been incarcerated have signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act in an attempt to get the care they need."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e2e\"", "article_summary": "And this is truly a national issue, a national problem,\u201d Dart said.\nDart said the Cook County Jail is now the largest mental health provider in the state and perhaps the largest in the country.\nCook County Sheriff Tom Dart, attempting to cope with what he says is a growing mental health crisis among inmates at the county jail, said up to 9,000 people who have been incarcerated have signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act in an attempt to get the care they need.\nThe sheriff said that the process of closing mental health institutions under the goal of putting the mentally ill into community-based treatment has led to 3,000 of the jail\u2019s 10,000 inmates requiring treatment.\nBut that\u2019s the big problem, to find a place that\u2019s still open.\u201dYou can find the full interview here."}
