The process supposedly requires three weeks at most.\n\nNo coverage materialized for nearly three months, despite Daniels\u2019s numerous calls to D.C. Health Link trying to sort things out.\n\nDaniels was told in mid-July that her application had been \u201cescalated.\u201d Still, nothing happened. The bureaucrats just kept saying that neither they nor anybody else could help.\n\n\u201cI was very patient, in my view, and I couldn\u2019t get beyond the people who answer the phone bank,\u201d said Daniels, who is insured separately.\n\nAfter I inquired about Daniels\u2019s case this week, I was told Wednesday that the glitch had been resolved at the end of last week. CareFirst, the insurance company issuing the policy, phoned Daniels on Wednesday to say the coverage had finally come through.\n\nThe timing is suspicious, obviously. But I can\u2019t prove the media interest triggered the sudden solution.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, anyway. There\u2019s no excuse for the delay, which even the exchange\u2019s executive director admitted was \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBecause of the lag, Daniels was forced to buy a university health policy for her older daughter, Dana, 19. She needed coverage to be permitted to enroll this month for her sophomore year at Cornell.\n\nMoreover, Diana Daniels is hardly the kind of person likely to have trouble handling a computer or navigating a bureaucracy.\n\nDaniels, a Harvard-educated lawyer, was general counsel for 19 years of what was then this newspaper\u2019s parent corporation, and she is used to pressing her case in complex negotiations. Currently, she\u2019s a part-time trustee of mutual funds for the blue-chip Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs.\n\nSo you have to ask: If Diana Daniels can\u2019t get the District\u2019s health Web site to work, then how is an average person supposed to do so?\n\n\u201cI cannot be the only one in this health-care limbo,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cOne wonders how others are coping with this bureaucratic nightmare.\u201d\n\nIn fact, she\u2019s not alone. Although the District has had a better experience than the embarrassment in Maryland, the city\u2019s exchange has had its share of delays.\n\nCritics of the Affordable Care Act point to such problems as evidence that President Obama\u2019s health-care reforms are sure to fail. I have a different view.\n\nThe correct lesson to draw is that government needs to place a higher priority on efficiency and customer service. Otherwise, a jaded public will give up on extending benefits that people need, such as universal health care, but that the private sector can\u2019t or won\u2019t provide.\n\nTo her credit, Mila Kofman, executive director of the District\u2019s Health Benefit Exchange Authority, seems to understand.\n\n\u201cNo consumer should have to experience what Diana did,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cWhen I saw this, I was just horrified.\u201d\n\nWhile insisting that Daniels\u2019s case was \u201cvery unusual\u201d and just \u201cslipped through the cracks,\u201d Kofman promised a thorough investigation.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates to me that our process is not 100 percent foolproof,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cThis type of information helps us on an ongoing basis to reassess everything we do and find ways to improve.\u201d\n\nSeveral people who work regularly with the District\u2019s Web site said it has fixed many technical glitches this year and is usually quick to respond to complaints.\n\nNot everyone is enthusiastic, however. An \u201cenrollment assister\u201d at a District nonprofit, who works with the health exchange to sign up customers, said it often takes two months or more to procure coverage.\n\n\u201cAlmost every application we submit, it\u2019s just become a reality that there\u2019s going to be a problem here, a problem there, and you have to make calls,\u201d the assister said.\n\nThe employee was barred by the health exchange from speaking to the media, and thus asked not to be identified.\n\nAccording to Daniels, the CareFirst employee who called her Wednesday said the health exchange had been painfully slow to help. Daniels said the employee told her that CareFirst had been asking the exchange for her file in conference calls every other day since July 28, but to no avail.\n\n\u201cI think the people who manage these systems would have a lot better reception if they put themselves in the shoes of people who are having to deal with them,\u201d Daniels said.\n\nIt\u2019s a message that the many bureaucrats in our region should take to heart.\n\nI discuss local issues Friday at 8:50 a.m. on WAMU (88.5 FM).
