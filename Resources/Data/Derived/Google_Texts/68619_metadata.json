He wasn\u2019t like the others, like two of his baseball buddies.\n\nOne of them, Ian, is in a hotel, Dalton said. The other, J-Reece, is with a relative, but his family is split up. Neither will likely live in their own home again for most of the new year.\n\n\u201cFor me, I feel blessed that everything is all right as it is,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cAs for Ian and them, it\u2019s starting to hit them a little harder. As more time goes on, they\u2019re starting to realize the gravity of the situation.\u201d\n\nWhile New Year\u2019s Day brought optimism for some of those in the tornadoes\u2019 path, others like faced uncertainty and questions. Are their homes a total loss, or can they be salvaged? How will their kids get to school? What will they do about the barbecue grill at the bottom of the swimming pool?\n\nSchool\u2019s back in\n\nThe end of the holiday season means school is back in on Tuesday for Rowlett and Garland students. Somehow, the tornadoes completely missed all the school buildings. Some still served Friday as American Red Cross shelters.\n\nGarland ISD Superintendent Bob Morrison and his cabinet met Friday with unanswered questions of their own. Up to 3,500 of the district\u2019s 58,000 students were in the affected areas, district officials said Friday. But the actual number of displaced will likely be lower, officials said.\n\nMorrison used to live in Moore, Okla., which has been hit hard by tornadoes in recent years. He said Friday that he had called up Moore\u2019s superintendent, a friend of his, for advice.\n\n\u201cI just asked him, \u2018What am I not thinking about?\u2019\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAnd the nice thing is, the list he went through, we were already right on it.\u201d\n\nMorrison and his staff spent the morning trying to sort out where the school buses will stop since neighborhood streets still aren\u2019t passable with a bus. The data on the affected is limited. School choice in the district adds an extra wrinkle to the transportation plans. As do the dozens of special needs children who need to be picked up close to home.\n\nThe district will have volunteers to stand at the temporary stops to make sure students get on the right bus. They also hope to have \u201ctemporary bus stop\u201d signs to mark the new stops. But they fear the company they use won\u2019t be able to produce enough signs for all the stops by Tuesday morning.\n\nAdministrators also have to send SUVs to pick up students in other cities, such as Addison and Wylie and Royse City.\n\nThe cost of the operations in the storm\u2019s aftermath \u201chasn\u2019t even been a thought,\u201d Morrison said. He said he knows some things won\u2019t go as planned, but said his staff is working hard for Tuesday morning to go as smoothly as possible.\n\nThe schools chief said he is also impressed by the outpouring of community support and volunteerism in the area. He said he will volunteer at one of the bus stops from 5:45 a.m. until 8 a.m. this week.\n\nMorrison\u2019s staff also hopes to offer paper and pencils to anyone who needs it and will have counselors at the 18 schools with affected students. He said the children won\u2019t be able to just move on and act like things are normal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the memories, the feeling of being displaced that\u2019s difficult,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nTaking stock\n\nRowlett High School student Nicholas Reyes, 17, said he expects to be out of his home for at least six months. A pile of junked furniture, televisions and other debris filled his front yard Friday.\n\nHis family is staying in a Richardson hotel for now. Reyes lost his school supplies, but he said his world history teacher told him he\u2019d give him some stuff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just grateful to have friends who still pray for me,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cThey\u2019re always telling me if I ever need anything to come to them.\u201d\n\nDozens of volunteers \u2014 some of them children from other school districts \u2014 went house to house Friday to help clean up and give away hundreds of hot meals.\n\nJulie Truex, a barista and mother of three, said she started volunteering with the Saturn Road Church of Christ during the week. The work left Truex, 42, too exhausted to make it to midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nShe said the work feels physically rewarding.\n\n\u201cThis is a great time for fresh starts, for do-over,\u201d Truex said.\n\nSharon and Jerry Curtis, who are still waiting to hear whether their Garland home of 26 years is a total loss, had a similar sentiment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve turned a corner somehow,\u201d Sharon Curtis said. \u201cWe\u2019re being positive and thankful we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nTheir home took a bizarre beating. A bedroom door had flown off and smacked Jerry Curtis, 68, in the face. Somehow, their granddaughter\u2019s sweatpants were tied around a ceiling beam. The fake Christmas tree somehow stood strong over even though the roof was ripped off and windows blew out. The bathroom doesn\u2019t have a roof over it. And the backyard grill is in the pool.\n\nSharon Curtis, 64, managed to laugh at all of it with her husband and sons, 40-year-old son Jerel of Flower Mound and Jarrod, 46, of Tyler.\n\nThe tornadoes left a man on life support and 11 others dead. The family of Timothy Harris of Greenville started the new year with a funeral. Jerel Curtis said the lost property doesn\u2019t matter in light of that.\n\n\u201cThere are 11 families are without people,\u201d Jerel Curtis said as he kicked a ball across a pile of collapsed insulation and roofing. \u201cThis is nothing. This is just material.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @TristanHallman", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAxL3Rvcm5hZG8tc3RyaWNrZW4tZ2FybGFuZC1yb3dsZXR0LWVudGVyLW5ldy15ZWFyLXdpdGgtaG9wZXMtdW5jZXJ0YWludHktc2Nob29sLXF1ZXN0aW9ucy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tristan Hallman", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "GARLAND \u2014 Lakeview Centennial High School junior Dalton Allen was one of the lucky ones.
