Karen Bleier/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nIVAN MARTEN: While today\u2019s oil-price environment continues to pose sizable challenges for upstream (that is, exploration and production) oil activities, it presents significant opportunities in asset-backed oil trading. Driving these opportunities is the market\u2019s relatively high oil-price volatility, which has led to an increase in temporary pricing imperfections across markets and hence greater opportunities for arbitrage.\n\nToday\u2019s arbitrage opportunities fall into three main categories: time, geography and quality. Time-based arbitrage opportunities include so-called contango situations, in which prices for future delivery are higher than those for immediate delivery. Geography-based arbitrage opportunities are based on price differentials between and among locations. Propane prices in the U.S., for example, have been significantly lower recently than in non-U.S. markets, reflecting surging production spawned by the U.S. shale revolution.\n\nBLOOMBERG/THE BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP\n\nQuality-based arbitrage opportunities have arisen due to changes in price differentials between different qualities of crude oil, such as heavy and light grades. Companies that can recognize and exploit these different types of opportunity stand to reap a windfall.\n\nMany industry players recognize the benefits of a greater focus on trading in today\u2019s environment and are acting accordingly. Many European and U.S. major oil companies, for example, have already invested to increase the professionalism of their trading divisions.\n\nBut not all companies are acting.\n\nOne group of businesses that would benefit in particular from doing so, we think, is complex refineries operating in Asia. These companies can process many different types of crude oil and should be quick to take advantage of significant price differentials between different grades. Few of these refineries are doing so, however. Large oil producers and producing countries, including ones operating in the Middle East, are another segment that could benefit significantly by reconsidering the role that trading plays in their business.\n\nIv\u00e1n Mart\u00e9n is a senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group, and the global leader of its energy practice.\n\nRead the latest Energy Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "IVAN MARTEN: While today's oil-price environment continues to pose sizable challenges for upstream (that is, exploration and production) oil activities, it presents significant opportunities in asset-backed oil trading.", "title": "The Time Is Right for Oil Trading", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/09/18/the-time-is-right-for-oil-trading/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KG491_0911cm_P_20150911153216.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "The Time Is Right for Oil Trading", "description": "IVAN MARTEN: While today's oil-price environment continues to pose sizable challenges for upstream (that is, exploration and production) oil activities, it presents significant opportunities in asset-backed oil trading.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "IVAN MARTEN: While today's oil-price environment continues to pose sizable challenges for upstream (that is, exploration and production) oil activities, it presents significant opportunities in asset-backed oil trading.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-09-18T09:52:01-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/09/18/the-time-is-right-for-oil-trading/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-6148", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "IVAN MARTEN: While today's oil-price environment continues to pose sizable challenges for upstream (that is, exploration and production) oil activities, it presents significant opportunities in asset-backed oil trading.", "title": "The Time Is Right for Oil Trading", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2015/09/18/the-time-is-right-for-oil-trading/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KG491_0911cm_P_20150911153216.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-6148", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-09-18T12:00:19-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ebd\"", "article_summary": "Karen Bleier/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesIVAN MARTEN: While today\u2019s oil-price environment continues to pose sizable challenges for upstream (that is, exploration and production) oil activities, it presents significant opportunities in asset-backed oil trading.\nMany European and U.S. major oil companies, for example, have already invested to increase the professionalism of their trading divisions.\nTime-based arbitrage opportunities include so-called contango situations, in which prices for future delivery are higher than those for immediate delivery.\nThese companies can process many different types of crude oil and should be quick to take advantage of significant price differentials between different grades.\nBLOOMBERG/THE BOSTON CONSULTING GROUPQuality-based arbitrage opportunities have arisen due to changes in price differentials between different qualities of crude oil, such as heavy and light grades."}
