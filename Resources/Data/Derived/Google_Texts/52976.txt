You probably carry your laptop in a padded backpack mainly for protection and convenience. But what happens when you are strolling across town en route to a meeting, and it unexpectedly starts to pour? If you’re toting STM’s Drifter laptop backpack, all you have to do is unzip the pouch on the bottom of the backpack, pull out its prepacked “raincoat” and slip it over the bag. Designed with an assortment of pockets and compartments, the bag can hold a variety of items. It costs about $140.

Small speaker, big sound

Business travelers can lead divided lives: Many like to chill out in their hotel rooms by listening to music via a Bluetooth-enabled speaker before jumping on a conference call. If they have packed the slender, square-shaped Esquire from Harman Kardon, they can do both. Slim enough to tuck into a bag, yet powerful enough to fill a room with big sound, the Bluetooth wireless speaker can easily move from home to the office to an impromptu party. Crafted with a leather panel and an aluminum finish, the two-way speaker includes a built-in phone conference system, noise-canceling technology, dual drivers and a bass port. Its built-in lithium-ion battery delivers about 10 hours of audio on a full charge. Priced at about $225, it ships with a zip-up pouch, a USB cable and a three-port USB adapter.

Charging made easy

Maybe you don’t think of yourself as power hungry, but you are. Consider Ventev’s Powercell 6000+, a portable 6,000 mAh Li-ion battery and wall charger that can charge two devices at the same time. It costs about $75. On the go? Ventev’s Dashport r2240 dual-port rapid car charger also can do double duty. Equipped with two universal USB ports, it can charge two items, such as a tablet and smartphone, simultaneously. It costs about $30.
