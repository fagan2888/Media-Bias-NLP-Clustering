Mike Huckabee in the lead with 16 percent of the likely voting electorate. Following closely behind are former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 14 percent and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 13 percent. Rounding out the rest of the ballot are Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul at 11 percent; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan at 8 percent each; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 6 percent; and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal at 5 percent.\n\nHuckabee and Bush were the two big winners over the past month, each gaining 3-4 points during that time. Bush, for one, benefited greatly from the so-called \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal that has tainted Christie\u2019s reputation over the past few weeks, as the two are primarily fighting for the same voters. While the governor has denied having any role in the cover-up surrounding the politically motivated closures of the George Washington Bridge \u2013 which connects Fort Lee, N.J. with Manhattan \u2013 several of his senior staffers have either been fired or forced out in the wake of the scandal.\n\nThe other big \u201closer\u201d in January\u2019s poll was Cruz, whose star continues to drop as his marathon 21-hour speech in support of defunding Obamacare becomes but a distant memory.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s surprise lead in the polls follows his recent \u201clibido\u201d controversy, where the 2008 presidential candidate accused Democrats of believing that women are helpless when it comes to \u201ccontrolling their libido\u201d without government help during the Republican National Committee\u2019s Winter Meeting last week. PPP began the study the day of his comments.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government, then so be it,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cLet us take that discussion all across America, because women are far more than the Democrats have played them to be and women across America need to stand up and say, \u2018Enough of that nonsense.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMike Huckabee\u2019s comments last week didn\u2019t hurt him with the GOP base,\u201d Dean Debnam, the President of Public Policy Polling, said in a press release. \u201cIf anything they might have helped him in combination with Chris Christie\u2019s explosion.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remains the clear frontrunner in the race, with 67 percent of Democratic primary voters supporting her candidacy. Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren both netted 7 percent in the study; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 2 percent; and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner each collected 1 percent of the vote.\n\nShould the former first lady not make a second bid for the presidency, however, Biden becomes the leader of the pack with 32 percent of the vote. Warren remains in second place with 16 percent and Booker and Cuomo trail behind with 6 percent.\n\nPublic Policy Polling conducted a nationwide telephone and Internet study of 845 registered voters \u2013 including 457 Republican primary voters and 334 Democratic primary voters \u2013 from January 23-25, 2014. The margin of error for the full study is +/- 3.4 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence, for the GOP primary sample it is +/- 4.6 percent, and for the Democratic primary sample it is +/- 5.4 percent.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Call it a January surprise!
