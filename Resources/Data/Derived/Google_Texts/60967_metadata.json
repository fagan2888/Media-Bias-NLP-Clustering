According to The Scribe, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs\u2019 student newspaper, school officials there are receiving little guidance from the federal government regarding how to treat such workers, ones who under the law are classified as full-time.\n\n\u201cIt will have a change definitely on how we calculate time worked,\u201d Lisa Landis, assistant vice president for Employee Services for the University of Colorado system, told The Scribe. \u201cWe are getting very little guidance from federal regulations.\u201d\n\nAccording to the employer mandate, a company must define a full-time employee as anyone who works at least 30 hours per week. And many students working at the university fit the bill. The law requires businesses with more than 50 employees to provide such full-time workers health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe limitation is very unfair, especially for students who are financially independent like myself,\u201d Kristen Robards, a junior at UCCS who works at the Copy Center, told The Scribe. \u201cFor them to limit that I don\u2019t think is morally right.\u201d\n\nUniversity officials have been asking for clarification on how to treat student-employees for months, but much to no avail, Susan Szpyrka, vice chancellor of administration and finance for UCCS, told The Scribe.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t saying that someone can\u2019t work 35 hours in one week or 39 hours in one week,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s saying that we\u2019re still trying to figure this out. I\u2019ve been asking for advice on this now since probably July.\u201d\n\nSzpyrka noted that the university has not decided if they will limit students\u2019 hours to less than 30 per week, as many businesses have done in preparation for the employer mandate. But such a decision hinges on if the 30-hour-per-week threshold will be enforced as a weekly limit or as a yearly cap of 1,560 hours.\n\nThe University of Colorado system conducted a review on how a 1,560-hour-per-year limit would affect student employees. When examining student employees who worked between Oct. 2012 and Sept. 2013, officials found that no students crossed such a threshold. However, between May 2012 and April 2013, 42 undergraduate students at UCCS worked more than 1,560 during that 12-month span.\n\nStudents working 40 hours a week \u2014 which would deem them a full-time employee under the employer mandate \u2014 may have to work both on-campus and in conjunction with employers off-campus, Szpyrka said.\n\nUncertainty surrounding the employer mandate and working young Americans has begun to arise despite the provision\u2019s 2015 implementation. The Obama administration has yet to give guidance to employers on whether paid interns working more than 30 hours a week would be required to receive coverage, and many institutions, including universities, are lessening hours for adjunct professors as the mandate\u2019s start date inches closer and closer.\n\nh/t The Washington Examiner", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The employer mandate's far-reaching regulations are likely to not only affect working adults, but also students employed by the very universities they attend.", "title": "Colorado university examines eliminating full-time student jobs...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/12/University-of-Colorado-Colorado-Springs-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/12/18/obamacares-employer-mandate-could-eliminate-full-time-student-jobs-at-colorado-university/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "university-of-colorado-system", "published_time": "2013-12-18T16:21:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-18T16:46:22+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcef4\"", "article_summary": "The University of Colorado system conducted a review on how a 1,560-hour-per-year limit would affect student employees.\nUncertainty surrounding the employer mandate and working young Americans has begun to arise despite the provision\u2019s 2015 implementation.\nAccording to The Scribe, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs\u2019 student newspaper, school officials there are receiving little guidance from the federal government regarding how to treat such workers, ones who under the law are classified as full-time.\nAnd many students working at the university fit the bill.\nStudents at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and at schools across the University of Colorado system worry the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate could have negative affects on how student employees are defined if they work more than 30 hours each week."}
