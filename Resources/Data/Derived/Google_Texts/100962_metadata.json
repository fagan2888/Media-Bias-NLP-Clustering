Bobby Jindal filed a suit against the Obama administration Wednesday, joining a conservative-led effort to challenge controversial national education standards knows as the Common Core, which Jindal says violate states' sovereignty.\n\n\u201cCommon Core is the latest effort by big government disciples to strip away state rights and put Washington, D.C., in control of everything,\u201d Jindal said in a statement.\n\nJindal names the U.S. Department of Education and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan in the suit, which argues that states are forced to cede their \u201csovereign authority over education policy to the federal government\u201d to receive federal grants and police waivers linked to adoption of the standards.\n\nThe Common Core outlines skills and knowledge that public school students should acquire in each grade from kindergarten through high school and promote a deeper focus on critical thinking over rote memorization.\n\nJindal, who was once a proponent of the Common Core, has battled educators in his own state over the issue in recent weeks. He withdrew the state from the standards in June, but education advocacy groups sued and a state judge ruled last week that the Common Core would stand in Louisiana.\n\nJindal\u2019s lawsuit comes as part of a campaign by conservatives to question the standards.\n\nLast month, television personality Glenn Beck, who has recently published \u201cConform: Exposing the Truth About Common Core and Public Education,\u201d held a two-hour simulcast in movie theaters across the country to criticize the standards. Indiana\u2019s State Board of Education voted earlier this year to drop the Common Core. In June, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley signed a bill requiring her state to drop the Common Core for the 2015-16 school year. Soon after, Oklahoma also dropped the standards.\n\nThe Common Core has also become an significant issue among potential GOP presidential contenders, including Jindal. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker last month called on his state Legislature to repeal the Common Core, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie created a task force to study the standards.\n\nDuncan criticized Jindal for his shift of opinion on this issue in an appearance last month on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\n\"Gov. Jindal was a passionate supporter before he was against it,\" Duncan said about Common Core. \"That situation is about politics, it's not about education.\"\n\nCommon Core was implemented in states including California and Louisiana in 2010. States could choose whether to use the standards and give the tests affiliated with them. States that adopted Common Core were awarded extra points on their applications for Race to the Top funding. A handful of states, including Texas and Virginia, did not adopt the standards.\n\nIt is the promise of extra funding that Jindal says in the lawsuit coerces states into adopting the Common Core standards and \u201cconstitutes unlawful coercion that exceeds federal authority and violates the 10th Amendment,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe suit also objects to waivers given out by the federal government that Jindal says allows states to waive certain requirements if they adopt the Common Core.\n\n\u201cWhat started as good state intentions has materialized into the federalization of education policy through federal economic incentives and duress,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThis type of lawsuit is not uncommon, said Ruthann Robson, a constitutional law professor at the City University of New York. Many were filed in the days after the Affordable Care Act was passed, arguing that the federal government forces states to adhere to its policies by taking away funding if they don\u2019t. But these cases are hard to win, she said.\n\n\u201cSome justices, including [Antonin] Scalia, have written that it's no different than being paid,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone says, \u2018Here, you can have this money if you do it my way, within these requirements,\u2019 and you will, then take the money. If you don\u2019t want to do it that way, then don\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nalana.semuels@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @AlanaSemuels", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Louisiana Gov.
