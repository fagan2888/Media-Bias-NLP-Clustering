You don’t have to go far this weekend to discover where the buffalo roam in Central Jersey.

The Readington River Buffalo Farm, 937 Route 523, will hold its 17th annual Buffalo Watch from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday to benefit the Whitehouse Rescue Squad.

Erick Doyle, who runs the farm, has been nominated for the state Board of Agriculture by Gov. Chris Christie.

In addition to giving wagon tours of the 200-plus acre farm and allowing people to get a close-up and personal view of bison and their newborn calves, the day will also feature an antiques show and craft fair with more than 50 tables. American Indian crafts will also be available for sale.

The farm’s butcher shop, which has items such as buffalo steaks, buffalo burgers and buffalo ravioli, will be open.

There will be a Civil War encampment and demonstrations by The Jackson Hole Gang and a blacksmith.

The rescue squad will be serving buffalo burgers, pizza, barbecue dishes and other food. The squad will also be giving free blood pressure screenings.

Pony rides and face painting will be available for children.

Guests are advised to wear sturdy shoes and to bring binoculars. The Buffalo Watch will be held rain or shine.

Parking is $5 per vehicle.
