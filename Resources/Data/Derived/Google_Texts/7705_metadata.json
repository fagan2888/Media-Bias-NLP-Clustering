(Photo by Philip Rucker/The Washington Post)\n\nNot so long ago the federal deficit was projected to destroy the country, our children\u2019s future and just about everything else. The politicians and media regularly fretted about what to do. Budget battles shut down the entire government for a couple weeks.\n\nGOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney famously traveled about the country with his campaign-made \u201cgiant, green, glowing debt clock,\u201d our colleague Philip Rucker reported. Romney gestured at it, he bragged about it. A Romney aide told the Wall Street Journal in May 2012 that the clock focused people on \u201cthe most pressing issue right now.\u201d\n\nHow times change.\n\nA count by our colleague Alice Crites illustrates how the issue gained media traction \u2013 \u2013 especially after the Bush/Obama stimulus packages to mitigate Bush\u2019s Great Recession \u2014 and how much it\u2019s faded from the front pages. (We\u2019re hearing that reporters who\u2019ve had a great run covering this issue are quite glum these days.)\n\nSo what happened? Simple answer, of course, is that the deficit is way down and, for now, no longer a big problem.\n\nThis week\u2019s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate for the fiscal 2014 deficit is $492 billion, or 2.8 percent of gross domestic product, which is pretty much where it was back in the early part of the Bush II administration \u2013though it\u2019s expected to rise sharply in coming years.\n\nNo one is really working the issue very hard on the stump, patting themselves on the back, talking about the wonderful Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. (Okay, maybe that wasn\u2019t a big deal and only passed because neither party cared all that much any more.)\n\nWhile President Obama has talked about the dramatic reduction in the deficit, \u201cmost Democrats never thought the deficit was the right issue on which to focus,\u201d said Brookings Institution senior fellow and Clinton administration policy adviser Bill Galston. \u201cThey were very critical of the attention Obama gave it during 2011,\u201d he told the Loop, so they\u2019re not that interested in bragging about the progress.\n\nTea Party Republicans, Galston noted, have \u201can enormous investment in the proposition that \u2018spending\u2019 remains out of control and fear that acknowledging the lower deficit would reduce the power of their narrative.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe the GOP base has plenty of other things to rally around: a most unpopular president, Benghazi or House Speaker John Boehner\u2018s lawsuit against Obama for failing to enforce parts of Obamacare.\n\nThe real problem, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former CBO director and top economic policy adviser to Sen. John McCain\u2018s 2008 presidential campaign, tells us, is that: \u201cCongratulations are due to American workers, entrepreneurs and families for their work toward economy recovery that has reduced the deficit. Collectively, Washington has done essentially nothing, unless you count stopping making it worse.\u201d\n\nWell, we don\u2019t miss the deficit. But we sure miss that clock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The budget deficit was of great moment just a few years ago. Now?
