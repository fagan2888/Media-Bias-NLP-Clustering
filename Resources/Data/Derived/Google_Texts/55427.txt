Should parents insist that their kids work in college to help pay for their education?

SHERYL GARRETT: In virtually every case, I think it’s smart for the student to have some “skin in the game.” Let’s face it, college is very expensive and it would be great if our children valued this expense. Sharing in it brings that reality to life. Plus, many of us need to be focusing on our retirement savings and we can’t afford to pay for 100% of the cost of our children’s college expense, no matter whether we want to or not.

We want our young scholars to get the most out of their college experience, and develop a love for learning. Part of this education can, and should be in my opinion, learning how to balance the demands of college and a wage-earning job. Most people that I’ve met over age 40 either paid all or part of their college and/or living expenses by working and taking out loans, which they repaid after graduation. I worked 30-40 hours a week through college and was involved in sports and other activities. My jobs were part time to accommodate my classes and activities schedule.

However, it seems that parents of my generation often do not intend for their student to work, even though they typically did. The parents say the child’s job is to focus on their studies and enjoy their college experience. I don’t disagree. However, I’d also give them another job or two, which earns an income. My parents paid for my tuition and books; however, I had to pay for my living expenses. Their rationale was that I could live at home while attending our local college. I choose to move out, so was then responsible for my own room and board and spending money. I think it was a very good education.
