Throughout his career as a political commentary writer, his work has been featured on the cover of Townhall Magazine and published in the Piedmont Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, and Human Events. Larry Kelley regularly presents his political perspectives on various talk show radio programs and publishes a column entitled, \"News From the Front.\"( See www.larrykelley.com )\n\nIn the mid fifth century A.D., in the waning days of the Roman Empire, the corrupt ruling elite in Rome turned the once revered legions against their citizen provincials in order to exact what had become a crushing tax burden.\n\nIn my book, \u201cLessons from Fallen Civilizations,\u201d I observe that one of the most recurring features of failing civilizations is that a corrupt ruling class will inevitably impoverish and ultimately destroy its own middle class, in the case of the Romans, the small farmer and merchant.\n\nJanet Yellin Eschews Capitalism\n\nRecently, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, when testifying before congress, was asked by the avowed socialist senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, \u201cAre we still a capitalist democracy or have we gone over to an oligarchic form of society run by the billionaire class?\u201d\n\nYellen disturbingly responded:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to call our system\u2014I prefer not to give labels, but there\u2019s no question we\u2019ve had the trend toward growing inequality, and I personally find it a very worrisome trend that deserves the attention of policy makers.\u201d\n\nIf President Barack Obama\u2019s newly appointed Federal Reserve Chairman is confused about her role in protecting American capitalism, aren\u2019t we headed toward a form of Marxism which cannot help but destroy the middle class?\n\nAfter all, inspired by Marx, Vladimir Lenin created a new system of governance for the Soviet Union which was based on class warfare, which targeted and destroyed the \u201cbourgeoisie\u201d: the small farmer, merchant, and factory owner for its crimes against the workers.\n\nWhile America\u2019s middle class is somewhat difficult to define, the American Democrat party cannot abide a thriving middle class precisely because its prime movers know that most Americans who, through their own industriousness, begin to acquire even modest degrees of wealth soon cease to vote Democrat.\n\nObama\u2019s America is Shutting Down Entry to the Middle Class\n\nPresident Obama has recently headed up the Democrats\u2019 new campaign to resolve the problem of income inequality and stated that it is the \u201cdefining challenge of our time.\u201d\n\nLike so much of what passes for Democrat economic policy, this is a misdirection play, that is designed to distract their voters and, in particular the impressionable, from focusing on the real issue\u2014why Americans, especially the young, can\u2019t find work.\n\n\u201cThe scope of the situation is shocking,\u201d said Keith Hall, a former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor statistics. The Brookings Institute found that the share of teens that held any paid job at any point in the year fell from 55 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2011 and that only half of high school graduates not enrolled in college worked at all.\n\nA young dental student and an expert on the plight of millennials (Americans age 18-30) Salvator Lamastra writes, \u201cMy generation is losing hope, and fast. In fact, the economy is so debilitating that some 22.6 percent of us live with our parents.\u201d\n\nAnd the situation is even worse for many new college graduates, those who, in previous generations, expected to enter the American Middle Class. Lamastra puts it this way:\n\n\u201cObama has let down the millennials economically in every way possible: high unemployment, sickening health care reform, skyrocketing living and energy costs, staggering high student loan debt and a national debt of $52,948 per capita.\u201d\n\nThe Entire Middle Class is Shrinking\n\nAs a result of policies put in place by this administration over the past five years, statistics abound which demonstrate that not only is America making it more difficult to enter the middle class but those who were recently counted among its members are increasingly falling into poverty. Examples are:\n\nOne out of seven Americans are on food stamps. The number has grown from 31 million recipients in 2008 to nearly 50 million today, a shocking increase of nearly 50 percent.\n\nThe country has 91 million men and women over the age of 16 not working and perennially unemployed. This is 10 million above the 80.5 million when Obama took office.\n\nJobs are scarce. For the first time since the Jimmy Carter years, businesses are dying faster than they are being created. Entrepreneurs have greatly pulled back on their plans to expand their businesses or start new ones, citing the huge costs associated with Obamacare, Dodd Frank and the general uncertainty of the crushing regulatory climate.\n\n49 million now live below what the Bureau of Labor Statistics refers to as the poverty level.\n\nThe value of the American dollar and its commensurate buying power continues to plummet. The price of gold has skyrocketed from $300 an ounce in 2000 to almost $1,900 in 2014.\n\nWhy are Liberal Policies So Destructive?\n\nIf Yellin exposed her ambivalence about capitalism in her recent statements, Obama was famously exposed during a 2008 debate against Hillary Clinton.\n\nCharles Gibson asked candidate Obama why he wanted to raise the capital gains tax to 28 percent, (the rate that President Bill Clinton inherited) despite the fact that Clinton lowered the rate to 20 percent and President George W. Bush further reduced it to 15 percent, and in both cases, revenues from capital gains tax greatly increased.\n\nHe responded:\n\n\u201cWe saw an article today which showed that the top 50 hedge fund managers made $29 billion last year \u2014 $29 billion for 50 individuals. And part of what has happened is that those who are able to work the stock market and amass huge fortunes on capital gains are paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama\u2019s facts are highly suspect, his logic is even more specious. If he truly wants to be able fund more government programs to aid the poor and middle class, why would he enact a higher tax and lower revenues to the treasury just to punish 50 people?\n\nThe answer lies in the fact that for a true Marxist/progressive, there\u2019s no benefit in raising living standards. That\u2019s not his real game. Rather he benefits by having as many as possible dependent on government and or resentful of others, hence the word the word \u201cfairness.\u201d\n\nHis income inequality campaign is a thinly veiled class warfare tactic, designed to manipulate. It is at the core of Marxist dogma and based on one the most ignoble of human emotions\u2014envy.\n\nNow, six years later, despite this administration\u2019s attempt to manipulate and misdirect regarding their appalling economic record, one senses that Obama along with the liberal establishment is now experiencing a crisis of confidence given that they\u2019ve tried nearly everything from their redistributionist playbook\u2014bailouts, vast stimulus spending, $5 trillion in deficit spending, Obamacare, green energy failed investments and tax increases.\n\nYet, based on Census Bureau Data median household income is $4,000 lower than it was in 2008. Adjusted for inflation, this, is a catastrophe for the middle class.\n\nWith the recent publication of Thomas Piketty\u2019s New York Times best-seller and ode to redistribution, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d American liberals can also celebrate the near 150 year anniversary of Karl Marx\u2019s \u201cDas Kapital.\u201d They can also celebrate the 50th anniversary of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty. After his landslide victory in the 1964 election he brought about the largest expansion of government in U.S. history. He pushed through 200 new laws which created 40 new federal programs designed to lift people out of poverty.\n\nWith nearly 100 million Americans receiving some form of government assistance, his great society has created the great dependency. The size of government in real terms is now five times larger than it was in 1964.\n\nIts cost will be unbearable for those attempting to join or remain in the middle class.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
