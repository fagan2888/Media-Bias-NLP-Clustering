Even the most knee-jerk, far-right ideologue has very little to complain about.\n\nBut that won\u2019t stop them from trying.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), for example, called the ACA a \u201c monstrosity \u201d the other day, insisting , \u201c[T]he greatest job suppressor in the so-called recovery that we\u2019ve gone through is Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn reality, there is literally no evidence to suggest the reform law is suppressing job growth. On the contrary, 2014 was the first full year for ACA implementation and it was the best year for U.S. job creation since the 1990s. Or put another way, after \u201cObamacare\u201d took effect, America created more jobs than any year in which Bush\u2019s brother or father was president.\n\nBut Jeb\u2019s argument was almost coherent compared to Sen. John Barrasso\u2019s (R-Wyo.) latest ACA criticisms\n\nBarrasso, the 4th ranking Senate Republican, mocked the Obama administration for holding an event at the White House this week to cheer new healthcare enrollment figures at a time when the law remains mostly unpopular nationally. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the White House to stop celebrating and start thinking about the people,\u201d Barrasso said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.\n\nI generally find Barrasso\u2019s health care arguments odd, but if The Hill quoted him properly, this latest offensive is genuinely bizarre. When the White House \u201ccelebrates\u201d millions of Americans gaining access to affordable medical care, they are, in reality, \u201cthinking about the people.\u201d That\u2019s the point. They\u2019re cheering good news for actual people.\n\nThe far-right senator reportedly added, \u201cThe Obama administration and every Democrat who voted for it should be embarrassed for it.\u201d\n\nEmbarrassed by success?\n\nBarrasso\u2019s rhetoric on the ACA has been strange for quite a while. After learning about lower premiums , the Wyoming Republican complained about the ACA increasing premiums. After learning about great enrollment totals, Barrasso, without proof, accused the administration of fraud\n\nBut what\u2019s striking about this latest broadside is Barrasso\u2019s reluctance to deal with the facts as they exist. Instead of refuting the ACA\u2019s recent successes , the Senate Republican leader simply ignores them, as if the good news didn\u2019t happen at all.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s report concluded, \u201cBarrasso is leading the Senate\u2019s working group to create an ObamaCare alternative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Sen.
