Both are essential to understanding what just happened.\n\nIn the hours leading up to and following Tuesday\u2019s government shutdown, conventional spin (wisdom is on permanent leave) was that the tea party crazies popularly known as the Insanity Caucus were driving the Republican House, compliments of lead wacko-bird Sen. Ted Cruz, so named by John McCain and subsequently embraced by Cruz.\n\nThis is partly true.\n\nCruz did lead the 21-hour faux filibuster opposing Obamacare. And, sure, Obamacare is central to the moment but not necessarily the driving force behind the shutdown, appearances to the contrary. File this thought for a few paragraphs: The shutdown was leverage for the coming debt-ceiling fight, the purpose of which is not necessarily to delay Obamacare but to achieve other reforms \u2014 tax and entitlement \u2014 that are the defining purposes of the Republican Party.\n\nOther recent spin has gone as follows: House Speaker John Boehner has been led by the Insanity Caucus rather than the reverse, directed by fear that he would be unseated as speaker.\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nBoehner obviously made a decision to lead his caucus where it wanted to go, ultimately submitting a budget that proposed delaying Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. But this doesn\u2019t mean he feared for his spot, which is secure, nor that he suddenly lost the courage to lead. It\u2019s more complicated.\n\nIn any case, postponing the individual mandate, though a challenge to the success of Obamacare, was both defensibly sound in light of delays given to other special groups (big business and unions) as well as, it must be noted, potentially unnecessary.\n\nIn fact, the individual mandate is delayed for one year if individuals choose not to purchase insurance for the nominal penalty/tax of $95. Given human beings\u2019 natural attraction to the path of least resistance, it makes as much sense not to buy insurance as it does to participate in the exchanges, especially given Obamacare\u2019s guarantee of coverage for pre-existing conditions. Why not wait and sign up when/if you get sick?\n\nFinally, conventional spin goes that Republicans would rather shut down government than fund health care, roughly translated to mean they hate women and children. Not to be outdone in the nonsense department, Republicans risibly claim that Democrats would rather shut down government than negotiate about a law that is in place, already funded, adjudicated and, as of Oct. 1, rolled out.\n\nThis sublimely abbreviated summation is essentially what The American People \u2014 that sacred monolith about which Washington knows so little \u2014 have been informed concerning the recent madness in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nBut taking a closer look, one sees that all of the above lacks context and ignores the nuances of how policy and politics play out. The shutdown, which I predict will be resolved relatively quickly to permit bragging rights for all, was really a prelude to the fight over the debt ceiling, which has to be raised by Oct. 17 or the U.S. government reneges on its debts. (Simple solution to the shutdown: The Senate repeals the medical device tax in Obamacare; the House funds lost revenue in a separate bill, not the continuing resolution; the president signs a clean resolution, federal employees return to work, and everybody says \u201cyay.\u201d)\n\nMeanwhile, leading up to the debt-ceiling deadline, we\u2019ll witness much rending of garments and gnashing of teeth \u2014 and that\u2019s just the media.\n\nThe American People will hear that Republicans are willing to savage the nation\u2019s full faith and credit for political points and that the president, being presidential, will refuse to be held hostage and, therefore, won\u2019t negotiate.\n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s context and leverage. Suppose you are John Boehner. Faced with a Democratic Senate and president, he has only two points of leverage \u2014 appropriations and raising the debt limit \u2014 which were set in place by greater minds than all these present.\n\nWhat Republicans hope to accomplish by tying demands to the debt ceiling is a grand bargain to include a package of entitlement and tax reform. Sound familiar? The president can refuse to negotiate, but at 3 a.m. when the phone rings and it\u2019s Angela Merkel inquiring just what the hell is going on, it won\u2019t be John Boehner\u2019s phone ringing. It will be President Obama\u2019s. That\u2019s leverage. During the last debt ceiling battle, Boehner managed to secure more than $2 trillion in cuts and no taxes.\n\nThat\u2019s context.\n\nKathleen Parker\u2019s email address is kathleenparker@washpost\n\n.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Weekly Opinion Columnist, Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "In life, context is everything; in Washington, leverage is everything else.
