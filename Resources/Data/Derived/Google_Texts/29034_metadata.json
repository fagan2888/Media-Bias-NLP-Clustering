Creative Commons\n\nA study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research found that poor oral health could be a risk factor for developing oral HPV, or human papilloma virus. Once contracting HPV, a person's risk for developing cancer may be higher, the study reports.\n\nThe study, conducted by the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, examined some 3,400 people over the age of 30. People who had poor oral health and hygiene had a 56 percent higher rate of being infected with HPV compared to those in good oral health. Gum disease made the risk of contracting HPV even higher.\n\nHPV is most often associated with sexually-transmitted diseases, and its link to cancer has only become clear in the past few years. But \u201cthe most dangerous aspect of the human papilloma virus is its potential to cause cancer,\u201d the Oral Cancer Foundation states on its website.\n\n\"In the U.S., there is an active shift going on,\" Dr. Maura Gillison, a professor at the Ohio State University, told TIME. \"Fortunately thanks to tobacco policy and public-health awareness, the incidence rate for the classical head and neck cancer caused by smoking is declining. But unfortunately, the rate of oropharynx cancer is still going up and it's because of the HPV component.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that HPV is linked to several types of cancers, including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and oral cancer. The CDC also states that when HPV remains for a period of years, it is more likely to cause cancer. About 20,000 HPV-associated cancers occur in women, and 12,000 in men.\n\nOther studies will need to be completed before oral health can be linked to cancer with certainty.\n\n\u201cWhat we think might be happening is if you have poor oral health \u2014 ulcers, gum inflammation, sores or lesions, any openings in the mouth \u2014 that might provide entry for HPV,\u201d Christine Markham, an author of the paper, told the New York Times. \u201cWe don\u2019t have sufficiently strong evidence to demonstrate that conclusively in the study, but that\u2019s our thinking.\u201d\n\nAim\u00e9e R. Kreimer called the finding a \u201cmodest association,\u201d the New York Timesreported. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if poor oral health causes HPV infection and would go on to cancer,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "oral health, hpv, cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A study finds that people in good oral health are less likely to develop HPV, which can be linked to cancer.", "title": "Does Brushing Your Teeth Fight Cancer?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/does-brushing-your-teeth-reduce-your-cancer-risk-oral-hygiene-linked-oral-cancer-255926", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/toothbrush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A study finds that people in good oral health are less likely to develop HPV, which can be linked to cancer.", "title": "Does Brushing Your Teeth Fight Cancer?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/does-brushing-your-teeth-reduce-your-cancer-risk-oral-hygiene-linked-oral-cancer-255926", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/toothbrush.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/toothbrush.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-06T20:20:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-06T20:21:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A study finds that people in good oral health are less likely to develop HPV, which can be linked to cancer."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb674\"", "article_summary": "But \u201cthe most dangerous aspect of the human papilloma virus is its potential to cause cancer,\u201d the Oral Cancer Foundation states on its website.\nPeople who had poor oral health and hygiene had a 56 percent higher rate of being infected with HPV compared to those in good oral health.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if poor oral health causes HPV infection and would go on to cancer,\u201d she said.\nCreative CommonsA study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research found that poor oral health could be a risk factor for developing oral HPV, or human papilloma virus.\nOther studies will need to be completed before oral health can be linked to cancer with certainty."}
