Singer Beyoncé, actress and comedian Jane Lynch and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg are just a few of the stars in Lifetime’s PSA who want to ban the use of the word “bossy” when it comes to describing women.

Joined by actress Jennifer Garner, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, designer Diane Von Furstenberg, Nascar champion Jimmie Johnson, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Anna Maria Chavez, the leaders explain that, “by middle school, girls are less interested in leadership than boys, and that’s because they worry about being called ‘bossy.'”

“We need to tell them it’s OK to be ambitious,” explains Duncan, as the PSA emphasizes that “words matter.”

I’m not bossy,” says Queen Bey. “I’m the boss.”
