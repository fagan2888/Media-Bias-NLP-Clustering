GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Nov. 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Annual tax reporting changes are inevitable; however, this year brings a major new series of filing responsibilities for employers and businesses due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Along with the yearly adjustments mandated by the Internal Revenue Service related to W-2 and 1099 forms, brand new 1095 forms have been added to the list of required forms for filers this year.

To accurately navigate all of the important changes this reporting season, Greatland Corporation, one of the country's leading providers of W-2 and 1099 products for businesses and an expert resource for ACA information, has compiled a list of what businesses need to be aware of when filing this year.

2015 Affordable Care Act Forms Required for 2015 Reporting

Under ACA, or Obamacare, all providers of healthcare, including employers that provide self-insured coverage, must file returns with the IRS that include information about the coverage and each covered individual.

Employers should report this information on Forms 1095-B or 1095-C, depending on the size of the employer. Providing 1095 forms became mandatory starting in the 2015 tax year and filers must send the forms not only to their eligible recipients but also to the IRS in order to remain in compliance with ACA reporting requirements. Filers with 250 or more forms must file them electronically. Incorrect filings will not be penalized for calendar year 2015 filing (reported in 2016) if employers/insurers file on time and make a good faith effort to comply. Below is a summary of each new form related to the Affordable Care Act:

Form 1095-B— Health Coverage

Insurers and self-insured employers that provide health plans are required to report data on all covered individuals.





Insurers and self-insured employers that provide health plans are required to report data on all covered individuals. Form 1094-B— Transmittal of Health Coverage Information Returns

Form 1094-B is the transmittal for Form 1095-B.





Form 1094-B is the transmittal for Form 1095-B. Form 1095-C— Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage

Employers with 50 or more full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees) are required to report (whether or not they offered coverage to their employees) by providing each full-time employee with Form 1095-C. This form requires information such as whether the employee was offered coverage, for which months, and the employee's share of the lowest-cost monthly premium for self-only minimum value coverage. A large employer with a self-insured plan will only be required to submit Form 1095-C, as the information on Form 1095-B can be included on Form 1095-C.

Third-party Sick Pay Recap Reporting

For wages paid in 2015, Form 8922, Third-Party Sick Pay Recap, will be used to report total third-party sick pay wages paid to employees when liability for the employer and the employee portions of Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes on the wages is split between the employer for whom services are normally rendered and the third-party payer.
