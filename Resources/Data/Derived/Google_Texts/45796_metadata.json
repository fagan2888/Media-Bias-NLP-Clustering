The looming increase is the result of a quirk in the law that drives up premiums for wealthier Americans and poor people with chronic medical problems in years when the Social Security Administration doesn\u2019t approve a cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries.\n\nRelated: Millions Face a 50 % Medicare Premium Hike If Obama and Congress Don\u2019t Act\n\nWhile both parties are interested in doing something to reduce or avert the premium hikes, Republicans are demanding that the cost of any bailout be offset by cuts in other areas of the Medicare program, while Democrats are resisting that approach. Moreover, there is a division between House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) \u2013 a major champion of a bailout \u2013 and some Senate Democratic leaders who are less enthusiastic about the effort and how to pay for it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big mess,\u201d said one Washington health care expert who is following the negotiations closely.\n\nNegotiations may pick up later this month once the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services formally releases its official 2016 premium rates, according to a report on Thursday by the Morning Consult. Lawmakers in both parties are under intense pressure from AARP, other seniors\u2019 groups and labor organizations to find a way to prevent the hike. \u201cIf Congress fails to reach a compromise before the increase takes effect next year, it will not be hard for Democrats to place the blame on Republicans,\u201d the Morning Consult report concludes.\n\nIndeed, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (D-CA) and other Democrats active on this issue have scheduled a press conference for later today to put added pressure on House Speaker John Boehner and the Republicans to address the problem, and to promote the Democrats\u2019 bill to block the premium increase \u2013 but without explaining precisely how it would be paid for.\n\nRelated: Millions Facing a Hefty Increase in Medicare Premiums in 2016\n\n\u201cFifty-five dollars [of a Medicare Part B premium increase] may not sound like a lot to some Republicans, especially when you consider that over the last several months they passed legislation that provided tax breaks to the tune of one trillion dollars, mostly to Wall Street and very large corporations and very wealthy Americans,\u201d Becerra said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop and get to work. Because for most seniors, Medicare is not a luxury; it\u2019s indispensable.\u201d\n\nThe stakes for many Americans are high. Unless Congress and the White House ultimately intervene, Medicare Part B premiums for doctors and outpatients will increase by 52 percent for about 30 percent of people with Part B coverage \u2013 or 16.5 million people nationwide, according to a new state-by-state analysis by AARP.\n\nAbout 7.5 million of the 16.5 million people affected by the sharp premium increase will be wealthier Americans who are in better position to absorb the hike. But about 9 million low-income enrollees with complicated medical problems who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid will also see their premiums go up \u2013 although state Medicaid programs would have to pick up much of that added cost.\n\nNot surprisingly, big states with large numbers of seniors will feel the brunt of the rate increase, according to AARP. That includes California, with 1.93 million beneficiaries, Florida (1.23 million), New York (1.06 million) and Texas (1.09 million).\n\nRelated: Congress\u2019 Medicare \u2018Fix\u2019 Could Leave Seniors Paying More\n\nThe potential Medicare premium increases are prompted by a strange twist in the law that effectively penalizes wealthier beneficiaries and others any time the Social Security Administration fails to approve an annual cost of living adjustment. This will be only the third time since 1975 that Social Security will not increase under the cost of living adjustment, largely because the Consumer Price Index used by the government has remained relatively flat.\n\nMedicare Part B and the Social Security trust fund are intertwined, and most seniors on Medicare have their monthly premiums deducted from their Social Security checks. Because the federal law for various reasons \u201cholds harmless\u201d about 70 percent of Medicare recipients from premium increases to cover unexpected rising healthcare costs, the remaining 30 percent of Medicare Part B beneficiaries suffer the consequences by being made to pay higher premiums.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hopes are dimming that Congress will intervene to block a huge Medicare premium", "title": "As Congress Fails to Act, 1 in 3 Seniors Facing Big Hike in Medicare Premiums", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/Congress-Fails-Act-1-3-Seniors-Facing-Big-Hike-Medicare-Premiums", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Washington_DC_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/Congress-Fails-Act-1-3-Seniors-Facing-Big-Hike-Medicare-Premiums", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Washington_DC_Capitol.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Hopes are dimming that Congress will intervene to block a huge Medicare premium", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb845\"", "article_summary": "Medicare Part B and the Social Security trust fund are intertwined, and most seniors on Medicare have their monthly premiums deducted from their Social Security checks.\nBecause for most seniors, Medicare is not a luxury; it\u2019s indispensable.\u201dThe stakes for many Americans are high.\nAbout 7.5 million of the 16.5 million people affected by the sharp premium increase will be wealthier Americans who are in better position to absorb the hike.\nThat includes California, with 1.93 million beneficiaries, Florida (1.23 million), New York (1.06 million) and Texas (1.09 million).\nNot surprisingly, big states with large numbers of seniors will feel the brunt of the rate increase, according to AARP."}
