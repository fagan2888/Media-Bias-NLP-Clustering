ZURICH--LafargeHolcim Ltd. (LHN.EB) is confident it will complete its program to sell off 3.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.62 billion) in plants and other assets during 2016, the cement giant's chief executive Eric Olsen said on Thursday.

The company has already clinched deals to sell its operations in Saudi Arabia and South Korea and an arrangement to expand its joint-venture in Morocco.

Jona, Switzerland-based LafargeHolcim had also received "tremendous interest" for the cement plants it has to sell in India to meet requirements by the country's competition authorities, Mr. Olsen said.

"We made this commitment in December, and we have already achieved one third by the middle of March," said Mr. Olsen, referring to the sell-off plan. "We have got many deal processes going on around the world and I am very confident," he added. "This is a 2016 project."

Money raised from the sales would be used to pay down debt, with excess cash returned to shareholders, Mr. Olsen said.

Other building materials companies as well as financial investors have expressed interest in the firm's assets, and deals could lead to LafargeHolcim leaving entire countries, he said.

"We are in 90 countries around the world," he said. "We are going to play and compete in attractive markets and in places where we have a competitive position where we can win over time," said Mr. Olsen.

He added that the merger between France's Lafarge and Switzerland's Holcim, which created LafargeHolcim last year, was on track, and the company was on target achieve its operating profit target of CHF8 billion by 2018.

Action plans which would yield savings of "at least" another CHF450 million during 2016 were also underway, Mr. Olsen said. Projects included improving plant efficiency, as well as reducing the CHF16 billion the company pays annually for raw materials, equipment and energy.
