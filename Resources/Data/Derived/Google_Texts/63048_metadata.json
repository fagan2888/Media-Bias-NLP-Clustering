And just as the 43rd president made a late-in-life change, from politics to painting, so has Mr. Heymann, to a point.\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin professor of architecture has channeled some of his energy into fiction. His first book, \u201cMy Beautiful City Austin,\u201d published last month, is a bildungsroman about a young architect in Austin.\n\nOver coffee at a table overlooking Barton Springs, Mr. Heymann, still a practicing architect, discussed the stories in his collection, each of which is organized around a different commission and the disparate motivations driving it.\n\nQUESTION: Why did you decide to write a book?\n\nANSWER: It started as an academic essay about how my generation of architects, who got out of school in the early \u201980s, screwed things up. We were desperate for work, so just did what clients wanted. But trying to prove that would be so tedious, so I decided to write it as fiction instead.\n\nQ. Your protagonist bristles against pretentious design \u2014 a Shaker-style bedroom, for instance, because Shakers did not have sex. Do you share his views?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA. There are places where architectures of pretenses make sense. But early on, potential clients would describe houses in terms of style. It just struck me that in Austin you could make an architecture that wasn\u2019t that way, that was about how you wanted to live your life, or how you could live your life, and you didn\u2019t have to bind it to any set idea of propriety.\n\nQ. What is it like to practice architecture here?\n\nA. I love Austin, but it\u2019s the most provincial town on the planet. I\u2019ve had far more interesting clients in Houston who are more experimental with their lives. Maybe in response to living in Houston. I designed a house for a lady there who wanted to live in the middle of the city, absolutely in touch with nature. Her house is floor-to-ceiling windows, entirely hidden by this garden. It\u2019s like a treehouse. Houston\u2019s a great place to practice because its residents actually want their city to be a city. Dallas is the same way. Far more ambitious.\n\nExpanded coverage of Texas is produced by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news organization. To join the conversation about this article, go to texastribune.org.

We always teach students that there are different mediums \u2014 pencil, ink, models \u2014 but describing things in words is as important. Buildings are really expensive. Did your family ever build a building? We ask the architecture students, and almost none of them have ever been involved in building. Architects build something like 30 percent of the buildings in the United States, either the ones required to be built by architects by law or the ones where the model doesn\u2019t yet exist. So, especially with houses, you have to articulate what people want and why. In the book, I talk about this elderly couple building this giant house...\n\nQ: A pleasure palace for their grandchildren.\n\nA. It makes all the sense in the world. There was an M.I.T. study about how when you\u2019re in a room with your own grandchildren your body is flooded with all the chemistry of happiness, hormonally. Far more than any other thing. More than sex or money or success. So that\u2019s worth spending money on.\n\nWith the Bushes we had a very short period of design, so we had an intense discussion about what they wanted, and it was clear that they wanted a place where their experience was concrete. They live in a world where everyone who approaches you wants something and you\u2019ll never be able to know what. The only people you can trust are your very old friends \u2014 or this is key at that house \u2014 nature. So that house works from that study point.\n\nQ. How so?\n\nA. It\u2019s pushed into the ground. It\u2019s one room wide \u2014 very, very long \u2014 and to go from one room to the next, you have to go outside. If you\u2019re in the dining room and you want to go to your bedroom, you have to go outside. You go through a breezeway space where you walk along a porch. It\u2019s kind of goofy, but it\u2019s a very simple idea: Outside is cold or warm, you\u2019re in the sun or the shade or the wind, or you\u2019re not, but that\u2019s something you trust. The sensation is real. And direct. They loved that idea. It became the grounding idea of the house, and it creates all sorts of odd details. If there\u2019s a sink, there\u2019s not a mirror above the sink, there\u2019s a window so that you don\u2019t have to look at yourself. Every window is also a door you can walk out of.\n\nQ. You write that \u201ceveryone wants to connect to the built heritage of the landscape.\u201d How are we to interpret that?\n\nA. Is it possible to build something \u201cold\u201d? There\u2019s a line later in the book about how that\u2019s like being married to someone with breast implants. I think, who are these people? But the impulse is really powerful: wanting to belong somewhere at a time when anywhereness is the norm.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about agrarian landscapes like this one is that most of the old buildings were just built directly to answer some sort of a need. They didn\u2019t assume the structure answering the need would devolve into something like an icon or a style.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nQ. Do you plan to write more fiction?\n\nA. Definitely.
