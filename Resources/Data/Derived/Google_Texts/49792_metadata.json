When terror strikes at the heart of a people, the immediate tendency is to talk tough and demand action. It feels good at first, but as often as not, the commitment leads to unnecessary expenditures and unsatisfactory results, not to mention an uptick in racist stereotyping. We\u2019re not just talking about 9/11, Iraq, and Afghanistan. In reaction to Pearl Harbor, the U.S. established internment camps for Japanese-Americans. When legal instruments are invoked in this manner, we\u2019re not merely talking about a \u201cbacklash\u201d; we\u2019re legalizing racism.\n\nIn fact, there was a time, long gone by now, when the radical threat to American peace and social order and national religious life came from France itself. But as recently as 2003, France became something of a symbol of the sort of Western nation that was soft on terror: its government refused to jump on the bandwagon when the Bush-Cheney administration invaded Iraq. Remember freedom fries?\n\nThere is more than a little historical irony to report. So, let\u2019s first recall what we owe France. The American War for Independence would have been dead in its tracks had it not received substantial military and economic support from the French, when they could scarcely afford it. Yet barely a decade after the Treaty of Paris secured British recognition of American nationhood, the bloody course of the French Revolution \u2014 though it was initially conceived on American principles \u2014 drove the U.S. government to turn on its most reliable friend. After 1793, when the deposed King Louis XVI was guillotined, the French were generalized as \u201ccannibals\u201d; radical French ideas were believed so dangerous to America that words on the page would be enough to foment unrest and upset the social order.\n\nWhen Thomas Paine, the spirited propagandist of 1776, defended the French Revolution in his pamphlet \u201cThe Rights of Man\u201d (1791), the emerging Federalist Party in America saw the tract as a defense of \u201cmob justice\u201d or \u201cmobocracy.\u201d Paine\u2019s next, \u201cThe Age of Reason\u201d (1794) questioned biblical authority and in the starkest terms demeaned organized Christianity. By the mid-1790s, the adjective \u201cFrench\u201d became virtually synonymous with \u201canarchist.\u201d The pro-French political party that would shortly be known as Democratic-Republican, led by Madison and Jefferson, were dubbed \u201cJacobins\u201d by their Federalist opponents, after the short-lived party in France that had brought on \u201cthe Terror.\u201d The Federalists talked tough, in large part as a means to label Democratic-Republicans as soft on French extremism. You can see where this is going, right?\n\nThe most militant critic of Revolutionary France was Alexander Hamilton.\n\nFor him, honor was everything. Personal honor, national honor \u2014 he sometimes conflated the two. During John Adams\u2019s presidency, representatives of the French Foreign Ministry snubbed three American envoys, and hardcore Federalists were convinced that the French government would shortly invade the United States. Hamilton regarded the issue as a matter of honor \u2014 the loss of national honor would be, in his precise words, \u201cpolitical suicide.\u201d So, he proposed adding 50,000 men to the U.S. Army (with himself at the head, of course), and the U.S. and France engaged in what became known as the \u201cQuasi-War.\u201d It was a case of extreme overreaction. No French troops ever set foot on American soil; no acts of violence against a passive citizenry occurred because of the alleged French menace. But the Quasi-War raised Hamilton\u2019s profile, which had been sagging somewhat.\n\nNevertheless, French emigr\u00e9s to America continued to be targeted in 1798-99 by those who feared their influence, those who spread fear, while the power of the military in national life increased. Hamilton wanted non-citizens of French origin to be deported. More tough talk ensued, and Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which made it a crime, punishable by fine and imprisonment, for an American citizen to write critically of the president or insult an officer of the federal government. Newspaper editors and others were tried, found guilty, and jailed for their \u201cFrench principles.\u201d\n\nNational honor was twisted in other ways. The War of 1812 was declared over ostensible British insults to American honor, when merchant vessels were boarded by the Royal Navy and U.S. commerce disrupted. Congress\u2019s reaction was to invade Canada, where British agents sat poised to incite western Indians to launch renewed attacks within the United States. A defensive war to redress grievances and buttress a sense of national pride quickly turned into a war to acquire millions more acres of North America. Though government borrowed heavily, the war was fought to a standstill: no territory was exchanged, and the White House and U.S. Capitol were torched in the process of reclaiming a few grams of lost honor.\n\nOkay, that was then, and not every lesson of history is entirely translatable to the present. Orchestrated terror is truly horrific. The French are attacking ISIS from the air in revenge for last week\u2019s tragedy, and because we feel so deeply the Parisians\u2019 pain, we understand and approve \u2014 without as yet knowing whether enough of the right bad guys are being blown up to justify the deaths of any innocents who might be caught in the crossfire. Perhaps such compromises of principle are to be expected when a center of civilization is terrorized. Who rightfully gets to pass judgment? But in the U.S., the reaction seems to be the same as it was at the time of the Ebola outbreak: some Syrian refugee, somewhere in the bunch, may be a Manchurian candidate, just ten years away from blowing up the federal building in Oklahoma City. Oh, wait. That was a citizen, a Persian Gulf War veteran, who did that. Anyway, Paris may actually give some greater justification, in fearful minds, to candidate Trump\u2019s ridiculous wall and the related deportation mania.\n\nThe GOP candidates who fan the flames of intolerance whenever something like Paris occurs are doing nothing more than amplifying the hatred that naturally arises at such moments. Some who listen to these voices will be convinced that shutting down mosques or closing our borders will stop terror. But it won\u2019t, of course, any more than duct-taped windows would have saved anyone from the chemical attack that didn\u2019t happen after 9/11. No one wants to feel unsafe; but that doesn\u2019t mean that the initial impulse at a time of crisis is going to be the optimal solution to a complex, long-term problem.\n\nPresident Obama may be criticized for his penchant for diplomacy and his lack of tough talk, but he proceeds always with eyes open. He may be remembered as an imperfect president, but also a prudent one. General Colin Powell had seen enough of war to want to avoid it in 2003, and was the voice of reason who, as secretary of state, was overruled \u2014 and remained loyal to the administration. We forget the rhetoric of democracy\u2019s infectious virtue that drove \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d as practiced by President Polk during the war with Mexico; Jeb Bush would prefer that we forget how it was re-engaged by Bush-Cheney in underestimating the scope of an Iraq invasion. But we haven\u2019t yet forgotten General Powell\u2019s prudence either.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When terror strikes, it's politically profitable to talk tough.
