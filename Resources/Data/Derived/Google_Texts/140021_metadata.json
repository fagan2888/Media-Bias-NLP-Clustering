Guy had the latest on President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, where approval for the new law has surged\u2026to 26 percent. Premiums for the plans offered under the Affordable Care Act are projected to skyrocket, which is prompting Americans to pay the penalty to remain uninsured. Concerning the health care industry, those premiums don\u2019t seem to be able to keep them afloat, with some insurance companies, facing massive losses, considering opting out of the Obamacare market by 2017. In North Carolina, Blue Cross and Blue Shield offers Obamacare plans to all of the state\u2019s 100 counties. In the first year alone, five percent of their ACA customers consumed $830 million in health care costs; they only collected $75 million in premiums. That\u2019s with the subsidy. On top of that, virtually every remaining Obamacare exchange is teetering on total catastrophe (via WFB):\n\nAn official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told lawmakers last week that eight of the 11 remaining Obamacare co-ops have been selected for \u201ccorrective action plans\u201d and \u201cenhanced oversight.\u201d Twenty-three co-ops were created under the president\u2019s health care overhaul, and so far more than half have collapsed and are no longer selling plans in the marketplace. The 12 co-ops that went out of business operated in Arizona, Michigan, Utah, Kentucky, New York, Nevada, Louisiana, Oregon, Colorado, Tennessee, South Carolina and a co-op serving Iowa and Nebraska. The agency\u2019s chief operating officer, Dr. Mandy Cohen, told the House Oversight and Government Reform committee that the 11 co-ops that remain are \u201cbeing monitored closely,\u201d and that eight have a corrective action plan in place and are under enhanced oversight.\n\nFolks, it\u2019s not working.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not working....05/26/2016 20:20:56PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It's not working...", "title": "Catastrophe: Last Remaining Obamacare Exchanges Teetering On Total Collapse", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/02/catastrophe-last-remaining-obamacare-exchanges-teetering-on-total-collapse-n2127081", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/208/2014-06-19T151723Z_1_LYNXMPEA5I0OE_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It's not working...", "title": "Catastrophe: Last Remaining Obamacare Exchanges Teetering On Total Collapse", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/02/catastrophe-last-remaining-obamacare-exchanges-teetering-on-total-collapse-n2127081", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/208/2014-06-19T151723Z_1_LYNXMPEA5I0OE_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Catastrophe: Last Remaining Obamacare Exchanges Teetering On Total Collapse , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In North Carolina, Blue Cross and Blue Shield offers Obamacare plans to all of the state\u2019s 100 counties.\nIn the first year alone, five percent of their ACA customers consumed $830 million in health care costs; they only collected $75 million in premiums.\nGuy had the latest on President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, where approval for the new law has surged\u2026to 26 percent.\nConcerning the health care industry, those premiums don\u2019t seem to be able to keep them afloat, with some insurance companies, facing massive losses, considering opting out of the Obamacare market by 2017.\nPremiums for the plans offered under the Affordable Care Act are projected to skyrocket, which is prompting Americans to pay the penalty to remain uninsured."}
