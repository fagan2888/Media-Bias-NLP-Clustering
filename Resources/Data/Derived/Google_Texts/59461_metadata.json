But Enroll America\u2014a nonprofit involving a coalition of groups supportive of the Affordable Care Act\u2014has given Adweek an interesting, results-based look at how marketers in this sector are leveraging digital to find specific groups of interested consumers.\n\nEnroll America ran a mobile ad campaign while working with Qriously from February 25 to May 31. The promos ran within Qriously\u2019s network of apps and in other mobile ad networks\u2014including MoPub, Nexage and Rubicon\u2014that Qriously is plugged into. The mobile ad tech player claims to reach 150 million people in the United States.\n\nCreative on banner ads asked, \"Why do you not have health insurance?\" Consumers could then answer the question by clicking on \"cost,\" \"complicated\" or \"lack info\" buttons. Out of the campaign\u2019s 53,327 consumers who answered, 35 percent picked \"cost,\" 32.4 percent chose \"complicated\" and 32.6 percent clicked on a \"lack info\" button. And, 40 percent of the consumers who answered the question clicked through to Enroll America\u2019s website to learn more about health care options.\n\n\"They\u2019re delivering ads only to people who don\u2019t have health insurance, and one of advertising\u2019s biggest challenges is making sure that you\u2019re presenting your message to the right people,\" said Joe Zahtila, North American general manager at Qriously.\n\nThis information was then used to serve the interested consumers one targeted ad for Enroll America per day for the remaining length of the campaign. The idea was that the initial clicks on the ads represented qualified leads for Enroll America because, theoretically, only people without health insurance would answer the questions. Over three months, 2,827,920 impressions were served to this group. The re-targeted ads had a 1.47 percent click-through rate, generating 41,554 more clicks.\n\n\"We knew the people we were getting were absolutely interested in the campaign,\" said Enroll America\u2019s Martine Apodaca, director of marketing and corporate partnerships.\n\nEnroll America declined to share the number of healthcare sign-ups from the campaign. But, the company did run a survey with 351 of the consumers who saw the ads to measure its effectiveness. Twenty-six percent of the consumers surveyed said that they would apply for health insurance after seeing the ad compared to 18 percent of a control group that said the same.\n\nThe best part of Enroll America\u2019s campaign? It was pro bono. Enroll America worked with The Ad Council and Mindshare on the campaign to create a media plan to raise awareness around health insurance. The Ad Council works with agencies and media companies to secure inventory donations for nonprofit organizations. The Ad Council brought in more than $1.5 billion in donated media during 2013.\n\nMobile, in particular, was singled out as a tactic during the media-planning process to help Enroll America hit a specific target, according to Beth Ellard, executive vice president of media at The Ad Council.\n\n\"One of the reasons why mobile was so important was because the target audience for the campaign were low-income women aged 18-34 years old, both general audience and Hispanic,\" Ellard said. \"In particular, these two audience segments live on their phones.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nonprofits and health insurance companies rarely reveal their marketing strategies.", "og": {"url": "http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/how-mobile-ads-found-53000-uninsured-leads-healthcare-provider-158785", "site_name": "AdWeek", "image": {"width": 150, "identifier": "http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/general-thumbnail/news_article/enroll_america.jpeg", "height": 84}, "type": "article", "title": "How Mobile Ads Found 53,000 Uninsured Leads for Healthcare Provider"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@LaurenJohnson", "site": "@Adweek", "card": "summary", "title": "How Mobile Ads Found 53,000 Uninsured Leads for Healthcare Provider"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-08 03:48:29", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=570229326", "fb": {"admins": 507972634, "pages": 126756847074, "app_id": 329778260413541}, "sailthru.tags": "Technology,Affordable Care Act,Banner Ads,Enroll America,Mobile,Mobile advertising,Qriously,The Ad Council", "keywords": "Technology,Mobile", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Adweek", "section": "Technology"}, "viewport": "width=1028"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce364\"", "article_summary": "Enroll America ran a mobile ad campaign while working with Qriously from February 25 to May 31.\nThe idea was that the initial clicks on the ads represented qualified leads for Enroll America because, theoretically, only people without health insurance would answer the questions.\nThe promos ran within Qriously\u2019s network of apps and in other mobile ad networks\u2014including MoPub, Nexage and Rubicon\u2014that Qriously is plugged into.\nThe mobile ad tech player claims to reach 150 million people in the United States.\nEnroll America worked with The Ad Council and Mindshare on the campaign to create a media plan to raise awareness around health insurance."}
