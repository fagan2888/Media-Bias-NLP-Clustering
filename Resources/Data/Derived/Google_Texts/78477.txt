The coffee business is not one lacking in innovation these days: Starbucks does about 40% of its U.S. sales through its own pre-loaded payment cards and mobile app, and you can now make a cup of Campbell soup in your home Keurig coffee brewer.

And it’s not just the giants who are coming up with bright new ideas. As the WSJ’s Joel Millman reports today, entrepreneurs have figured out a new feature that can make a drive-through coffee bar stand out from the crowd:

“Bikini” or “lingerie” coffee stands have caused a stir across the Northwest, a region already crowded with drive-through coffee outlets operated by mainstream companies such as Starbucks and Dutch Brothers. According to a consumer website that functions as a guide to kiosks, more than 130 such adult-themed businesses operate now in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. The phenomenon has been seen elsewhere, notably in California and a few East Coast locations, though in much smaller numbers and usually not in small towns, as has been the case in the Northwest.

But all great innovations come with their risks, and adult-themed coffee joints have hit the occasional legal obstacle:

An affidavit for a search warrant filed last June with the Superior Court of Washington for Snohomish County describes instances of baristas allegedly asking undercover detectives if they “wanted a show” after a $20 bill was proffered for a $7 cup of coffee—apparently a signal customers had devised to solicit lewd behavior. The “show,” detectives wrote, was a quick exposure of body parts. After Federal Bureau of Investigation agents installed surveillance equipment, Everett police say they witnessed explicit acts of prostitution. Detectives wrote they observed one 23-year-old barista leave to meet a motorist in a pickup truck that had just left the kiosk. When the barista exited from the truck, they said, “The driver gave [her] what appeared to be cash.”
