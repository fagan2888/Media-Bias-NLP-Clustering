Some departments are getting rid of assigned workspaces, tapping Cisco\u2019s own networking technology that enables employees to become more mobile. Elsewhere on the campus, some of the 56 buildings at the company\u2019s San Jose headquarters are at various stages of a remodel, with new features including lounge areas with comfy couches, pool tables and cocoon-shaped chairs.\n\n\u201cWe want people to come out for a minute, think outside the box,\u201d said Allan McGinty, director of workplace design and development. As this newspaper toured Cisco\u2019s San Jose campus recently, McGinty spoke from Raleigh, N.C., using WebEx, the company\u2019s videoconferencing system.\n\nShowing that its efforts are apparently paying off with young workers, Cisco\u2019s interns praise its culture.\n\nEric Pomeroy, a 21-year-old from the University of Michigan, recently finished his second straight summer internship at the company.\n\n\u201cThe managers respect our input and ideas,\u201d he said. The mobile app he worked on last summer is now used by employees who need help navigating around Cisco\u2019s huge campus.\n\nSierra Parker, a University of Pennsylvania student who at the ripe old age of 20 has already interned at the White House, said she wanted to leave her internship there early because she worked alone and without adequate supervision.\n\nThis summer was different because she wanted to stay longer at Cisco, where as an IT intern she had a chance to work with people constantly. Telecommuting is another Cisco selling point, but Parker says \u201ceveryone likes to come into the office.\u201d And yes, she loved the free popcorn in the breakroom.\n\nBut even as the more established companies try to make their workspaces and culture more inviting, they\u2019re still grappling with challenges that can\u2019t help but affect morale. Cisco announced recently that it is laying off 4,000 people, about 5 percent of its global workforce. Intel, too, is trying to expand its horizons amid a slump in its bread-and-butter PC business\n\nWhile companies like Cisco and Intel are trying to catch up to newer firms like Google, there\u2019s a whole new wave of companies that are taking workplace culture in new directions.\n\nAs a startup, it\u2019s probably no surprise that Square, the San Francisco payments company founded in 2009, has \u201cnever had cubicles or offices,\u201d according to spokeswoman Lindsay Wiese. Square executives often work at stand-up tables, she said.\n\nSo even though the company\u2019s office is in an old-school building that houses an old-school product (the San Francisco Chronicle, although Square is moving a few blocks away into its new headquarters in the fall), its workplace was conceived in the age of \u201copen\u201d and \u201ccollaborative\u201d offices.\n\nAnd some tech workers are looking for newer companies than even Facebook or Google. And smaller.\n\n\u201cSome people get tired of the large-company feel,\u201d said Domingo Guerra, co-founder of startup Appthority. The 2-year-old provider of app security management has about 20 staffers, with half coming from larger companies. Guerra himself worked at Brocade and Applied Materials.\n\nHow did Guerra and his team attract workers? They\u2019re well aware of the allure of San Francisco, so they put their headquarters there. Appthority also offers catered meals a couple of times a week. And the office doesn\u2019t have cubicles.\n\n\u201cWe all hated it at the big companies,\u201d Guerra said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have offices, either. We all sit together.\u201d\n\nNot only do they sit together at the office, some of them also sit together at baseball games. The company bought a few Giants season tickets that its workers share.\n\nBut not only new companies are flocking to San Francisco. Having an office there is also a plus for Adobe Systems (ADBE), the San Jose software company that in December celebrated its 30th anniversary.\n\nBut don\u2019t call the company old. \u201cWe may be an established company,\u201d said Donna Morris, senior vice president, \u201cbut we\u2019re in an emerging area in terms of products and solutions,\u201d such as Adobe\u2019s new push to sell its software as a service.\n\nThe transformation in its products is seeping into the culture. Earlier this year, executives moved to one open floor in San Jose. It has no offices, not even for CEO Shantanu Narayen. Adobe\u2019s 11,500 employees around the world enjoy perks such as gyms, oil changes on site, game rooms. There\u2019s a rock-climbing wall at its Utah offices.\n\n\u201cOur culture is very different today,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe continue to change.\u201d\n\nFRINGE BENEFITS IN THE VALLEY\n\nOlder tech companies are competing with Google, Facebook and young startups for talent.
