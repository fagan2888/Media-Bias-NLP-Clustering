The request shows that Honda understood the safety risks posed by the inflators long before it started expanding recalls by the millions in 2014, the attorneys and law professors said.\n\nU.S. law requires automakers to disclose safety risks and actions to prevent them to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But Honda spokesman Chris Martin said the redesign did not require notice to regulators because the safety risk involved Takata manufacturing errors rather than a specific design defect.\n\nHonda requested the redesign to \u201cprotect against the possibility of future manufacturing errors \u2013 it was not an acknowledgement of a larger design flaw in the inflators,\u201d Martin wrote.\n\nHonda started installing the modified inflators in some, but not all, vehicles in 2011 and continues to do so today, Martin said. Honda expanded recalls as it became aware of more defects, he said.\n\nThe fail-safe modification - outlined in Takata technical documents and internal presentations between 2009 and 2011 and confirmed by Honda - added vents in the inflator to channel pressure from an explosion away from a driver\u2019s neck and torso.\n\nFor a graphic depicting the \"fail-safe\" fix, see http://tmsnrt.rs/1Rog3lH\n\nNHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas declined to comment on the design change or whether Honda had a legal obligation to notify the agency.\n\nTakata confirmed in a statement that it \u201ctested and deployed\u201d several versions of the redesigned inflator \u201cat the request of an automotive customer.\u201d The supplier declined to answer more detailed questions and declined to respond to Honda\u2019s explanation of the reasons for the change.\n\nTakata has previously acknowledged that some of the ruptures were connected to manufacturing errors at its factories.\n\nHonda is Takata\u2019s biggest customer, and the automaker owns a small stake in the airbag supplier.\n\nLEGAL PERIL\n\nPeter Henning, a corporate law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, called Honda\u2019s distinction between manufacturing and design problems a \u201ctechnical argument\u201d that is at odds with the law and regulatory practice.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018It\u2019s a supplier problem, not ours, so we don\u2019t have to talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are responsible for every part on their car and also responsible to report a problem with any part on that car.\u201d\n\nJohn Kristensen - a Los Angeles product liability plaintiff's lawyer who has worked on major product defect lawsuits against Toyota and other manufacturers - agreed that the cause or type of a safety risk is irrelevant to legal notification requirements.\n\nHonda officials \u201cmade a determination of a defect when they asked for the fail-safe design,\u201d said Kristensen. \u201cThey had an obligation to tell the government back in 2009. Good luck defending that.\u201d\n\nIn many states, plaintiffs alleging design defects are required to prove that companies could have used a safer design, said Rob Ammons, a Houston lawyer who has represented clients suing Honda and Takata in three cases alleging that inflator defects caused death or injury.\n\n\u201cObviously, this would be significant evidence that one existed, certainly as early as 2009,\u201d said Ammons, who has settled two of the cases and has one pending.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and an expert in automotive safety and regulation said that Honda could make an argument that \"it\u2019s always improving its products \u2013 for instance, that air bags are getting safer every year,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how a jury would approach or examine that.\u201d\n\nThe federal cases against Takata, Honda and other automakers have been consolidated in a Miami court. They involve individual claims for injuries and deaths and proposed class actions seeking to represent millions of customers who say their vehicles lost value. Trials in both types of federal cases could start as soon as 2017, according to court filings.\n\nHonda has reached confidential settlements in some personal-injury lawsuits, court records showed.\n\nAN EFFECTIVE FIX\n\nSince 2008, Honda has recalled 8.5 million vehicles to replace defective inflators, including 2.3 million in February. All but 875,000 of those recalls came in 2014 or later.\n\nTakata inflators in Honda vehicles have been linked to nine deaths and more than 90 injuries in the U.S., according to NHTSA.\n\nSeven of those deaths and 70 injuries have occurred since Takata began producing the new inflator design for Honda starting in late 2010.\n\nThe redesign worked as intended, Martin said. All of the deaths and injuries happened in vehicles with older inflator designs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DETROIT (Reuters) - In August of 2009, after ruptured airbag inflators in Honda vehicl", "title": "Exclusive: Honda and Takata's stealth airbag fix", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/24/Exclusive-Honda-and-Takatas-stealth-airbag-fix", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autos-honda-failsafe_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/24/Exclusive-Honda-and-Takatas-stealth-airbag-fix", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/autos-honda-failsafe_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "DETROIT (Reuters) - In August of 2009, after ruptured airbag inflators in Honda vehicl", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Takata inflators in Honda vehicles have been linked to nine deaths and more than 90 injuries in the U.S., according to NHTSA.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how a jury would approach or examine that.\u201dThe federal cases against Takata, Honda and other automakers have been consolidated in a Miami court.\nSeven of those deaths and 70 injuries have occurred since Takata began producing the new inflator design for Honda starting in late 2010.\nHonda Motor Co asked supplier Takata Corp to produce a \u201cfail-safe\u201d airbag inflator, according to Takata presentations and internal memos reviewed by Reuters.\nHonda is Takata\u2019s biggest customer, and the automaker owns a small stake in the airbag supplier."}
