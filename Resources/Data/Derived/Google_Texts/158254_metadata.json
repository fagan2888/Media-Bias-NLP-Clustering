One of them bans the state from discriminating against any employee or job applicant based on a host of criteria including \"gender expression or identity.\"\n\n\"This is the right thing to do. ... This is also the smart thing to do,\" Wolf said, citing PayPal's decision in North Carolina.\n\nLast year, the Democratic governor named a transgender woman as the state's physician general, a Cabinet-level post.\n\nMore than a dozen states have considered bathroom provisions this year that would restrict access for transgender people, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe measures come amid a wave of legislation pushed by social conservatives after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage last year.\n\nMississippi's Republican governor on Tuesday signed a law allowing people with religious objections to deny wedding services to same-sex couples and permitting employers to cite religion in determining workplace policies on dress code, grooming and bathroom and locker access.\n\nIn response, a number of governors and mayors have banned non-essential government travel to Mississippi or North Carolina.\n\nLast week, the governors of Georgia and Virginia vetoed \"religious liberty\" bills, which critics said discriminated against same-sex couples.\n\n(Reporting by Colleen Jenkins in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Daniel Trotta in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler and Peter Cooney)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - South Carolina lawmakers have introduced a measure that would require tran", "title": "South Carolina bill aims to limit transgender access to bathrooms", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/South-Carolina-bill-aims-restrict-transgender-access-bathrooms", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-transgender-california_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/South-Carolina-bill-aims-restrict-transgender-access-bathrooms", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-transgender-california_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - South Carolina lawmakers have introduced a measure that would require tran", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The South Carolina measure would prohibit local governments from requiring private businesses to provide restroom access based on gender identity rather than birth gender.\nIn response, a number of governors and mayors have banned non-essential government travel to Mississippi or North Carolina.\n\"Government simply has no place in our bathrooms,\" said Jeff Ayers, executive director of South Carolina Equality, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights group.\nThis is also the smart thing to do,\" Wolf said, citing PayPal's decision in North Carolina.\n\u201cNorth Carolina is getting so much flak over what is common sense.\u201dThe South Carolina measure is narrower than North Carolina's law, which precludes local governments from adopting anti-discrimination ordinances with protections based on gender identity and sexual orientation."}
