FRANKFORT, Ky - Gov.-elect Matt Bevin on Friday announced that Chad Meredith, a Lexington attorney with the firm of Ransdell & Roach, will be hired as deputy general counsel for the Governor's Office.

Meredith, 34, is native of Leitchfield who got his Bachelor's degree from Washington & Lee University and his law degree from the University of Kentucky College of Law.

Bevin said Meredith is one of the few Kentucky lawyers to have clerked for both a U.S. district judge (Amul R. Thapar) and a U.S. circuit judge (John M. Rogers), according to a news release announcing the appointment

The new release said following his clerkships, Meredith entered private practice with Frost Brown Todd in Louisville. He later went to work for Ransdell & Roach where he's worked with John Roach, who was general counsel in the Governor's Office during the Ernie Fletcher administration.

In the Governor's Office, Meredith will be the deputy to Steve Pitt, who Bevin previously announced as the general counsel on his office staff. The Bevin transition team has not released the salaries of the Bevin appointees who will assume their new roles on inauguration day - Dec. 8.
