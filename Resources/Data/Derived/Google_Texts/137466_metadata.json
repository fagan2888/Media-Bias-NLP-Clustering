Ryan Silvey\u2019s SB287.\n\nThe bill would allow veterans and their spouses and dependent children, as well as spouses and dependent children of deceased veterans, with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, to be eligible for MO HealthNet benefits. The bill effectively expands Medicaid for veterans and their families.\n\nWith Bond were three veterans who are current students at the University of Missouri \u2013 Columbia who fall within the coverage gap that Silvey\u2019s bill seeks to address.\n\nRyan Gerard Gill (immediate right of Bond) was in the Army National Guard from 2007-2013. While in the Guard, he was deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Haiti earthquake relief, and as support to Operation Enduring Freedom via deployment to Qatar. Gill is from Portageville and is the current Missouri Student Veterans Association (MSVA) president.\n\nSean McLafferty (left) also served in Operation Iraqui Freedom in combat infantry with the 82nd Airborne. He was active from 2004-2008 and is presently active in the Army Reserves. McClaferty is getting his graduate degree in public policy. He was raised in Ferguson, but lives in Columbia and plans to stay.\n\nJohn Quade (far right) is a Marine veteran who served in Operation Enduring Freedom and is also the former president of the MSVA. Quade is a Springfield native and a member of QEBH, a senior Mizzou honor society.\n\nAll three stand to lose insurance coverage in two years and all three will still be in school.\n\n\u201cThey are living proof that veterans, when they come back, after 5 years are not covered \u2013 and their families are not covered \u2013 by the VA health system, and if they are covered, there are many areas of this state where they cannot get health care,\u201d Bond told The Missouri Times. \u201cSince they are making less than $26,000 for a family of three, they don\u2019t qualify for the Obamacare. They fall in the gap and they don\u2019t have any health coverage.\u201d\n\nBond shared that other states who have expanded Medicaid cover the gap needed for veterans. Silvey\u2019s bill has no reliance on federal funds and there is no deadline for the bill to pass.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t fix everything, let\u2019s at least help our veterans,\u201d Bond said. \u201cI am very, very partial to the men and women who have served this coverage. This is one group that we owe it to.\u201d\n\nThis is the first day that Bond and the students have been actively rallying support for SB287. Silvey\u2019s legislation was introduced last week.\n\n\u201cWe really just got started,\u201d said Gill. \u201cWe have 700 [veterans] at MU that if not currently affected by [the gap], they know someone who is.\u201d\n\nOne concern that is a priority for the Mizzou veterans was the increase in female veterans who have served in combat and that they are able to have coverage.\n\n\u201cNever before have [women] been so exposed to combat and combat experience,\u201d said Gill. \u201cA really big concern is for them \u2013 \u2018lady warriors,\u2019 we like to call them, and their families. It\u2019s really important and it\u2019s a niche subject. Our VA is not really prepared to handle a lot of the female needs yet. There are other avenues that allow them to have more piece of mind.\u201d\n\nThe students are in the developmental stages of their campaign of support for the bill on campus.\n\nCurrently, VA benefits only apply to veterans for 5 years out of service. Many veterans as they enter the workforce fall in the gap because they make too much for Medicaid, but too much for Affordable Care Act coverage.\n\n\u201cIf everything stays the same, I will be in the gap,\u201d Gill said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see a proactive measure and not a reactive measure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2013 Former Missouri auditor, governor, and U.S. Senator Kit Bond was in the building today lending his support to Kansas City Republican Sen.
