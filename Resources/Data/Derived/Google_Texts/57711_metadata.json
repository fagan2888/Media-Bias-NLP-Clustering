To this end, the chairmen of the two committees are asking (PDF) the IRS for answers.\n\n\u201cMany Americans would be surprised to learn that their tax dollars may be subsidizing health coverage for foreign diplomats,\u201d wrote Royce and Camp. \u201cWe are seeking to determine how many such individuals participate in these programs and the total cost of such benefits.\u201d\n\nThe existence of the loophole itself is noteworthy, Republicans argue, and say taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for subsidizing the health costs of foreign diplomats.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the ability of foreign diplomats to purchase health care coverage in the United States. We do not, however, believe that American taxpayers should subsidize these services,\u201d the letter continues.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has informed the House Foreign Affairs Committee that \u201ca foreign diplomat could satisfy the statutory criteria to be eligible for a premium tax credit and cost-sharing reductions.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd the State Department has circulated notices to foreign diplomats that inform them about Obamacare and note that \u201cthe benefits of the United States Affordable Care Act are available\u201d to them.\n\n\n\nThe State Department has already told House Foreign Affairs Committee investigators that it did not keep data on how many foreign diplomats \u201cobtain government-funded benefits.\u201d Similarly, the Department of Health and Human Services could not provide investigators with that information.\n\n\n\nInvestigators from the House Foreign Affairs and Ways and Means Committees said they wanted information from the IRS on the foreign diplomats that have received premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions under the Affordable Care Act, as well its associated costs, by Nov. 12.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "timkmak"}, "keywords": "House of Representatives, u.s. poli, Obamacare, Ways and Means Committee", "publicationDate": 201410291920, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Two House committees are demanding answers after learning that the Affordable Care Act makes foreign diplomats eligible for health care subsidies.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Obamacare Covers Foreign Diplomats", "tags": "entity:organization/house_of_representatives,topic:politics,Obamacare:Industryterm,entity:organization/ways_and_means_committee", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare Covers Foreign Diplomats\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/29/obamacare-covers-foreign-diplomats.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/29/obamacare-covers-foreign-diplomats/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47153715.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/29/obamacare-covers-foreign-diplomats\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-29T19:20:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Tim Mak\",\"tags\":[\"house_of_representatives\",\"politics\",\"Industryterm\",\"ways_and_means_committee\"]}", "news_keywords": "House of Representatives, US Politics, Obamacare, Ways and Means Committee", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Tim Mak", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-29T19:20:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/tim-makhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/29/obamacare-covers-foreign-diplomats", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Two House committees are demanding answers after learning that the Affordable Care Act makes foreign diplomats eligible for health care subsidies.", "title": "Obamacare Covers Foreign Diplomats", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/29/obamacare-covers-foreign-diplomats.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/29/obamacare-covers-foreign-diplomats/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1414611464712.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/t/tim-mak", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83c1\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare has a loophole that allows foreign diplomats to receive healthcare subsidies, the House Ways and Means and Foreign Affairs Committees revealed Wednesday as they announced a joint investigation.\nTwo House committees are demanding answers after learning that the Affordable Care Act makes foreign diplomats eligible for health care subsidies.\n\u201cWe fully support the ability of foreign diplomats to purchase health care coverage in the United States.\n\u201cMany Americans would be surprised to learn that their tax dollars may be subsidizing health coverage for foreign diplomats,\u201d wrote Royce and Camp.\nThe State Department has already told House Foreign Affairs Committee investigators that it did not keep data on how many foreign diplomats \u201cobtain government-funded benefits.\u201d Similarly, the Department of Health and Human Services could not provide investigators with that information."}
