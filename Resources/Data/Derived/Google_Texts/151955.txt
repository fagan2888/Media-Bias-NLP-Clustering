Police in Chicago are trying to identify and bring to justice the cab driver who allegedly ripped off thousands of dollars from a student from China who was trying to travel from O’Hare International Airport to his University of Illinois campus.

The driver apparently told the student, 18, the charge was $1,000. After arriving at campus, the cabbie then told the student it would cost $4,800, The Daily Mail reported.

“The student said he didn’t have that much so he gave him all he had,” which was $4,420, University of Illinois police Sgt. Tom Geis said, to the News-Gazette.

The ride spans about 150 miles. Rightly, it should cost between $290 and $300, the site WorldTaxiMeter.com said. University materials say a bus from the airport to campus costs about $30.
