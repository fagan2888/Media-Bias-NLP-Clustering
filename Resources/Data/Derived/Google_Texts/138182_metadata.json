Music to the ears of most in the audience.\n\nTwo proposals that soaked up much of the spotlight in the course of the day\u2019s event were Senate Bill 182 and Senate Bill 278. The former would require a tax rate election if a city, county, or school district\u2019s property tax revenues grew in excess of 4 percent over the year before while the latter would increase the mandatory school homestead exemption from $15,000 to $25,000.\n\nThough the policy solutions differ somewhat in their approach, it\u2019s encouraging to see that there\u2019s bipartisan recognition of the problem and a move towards a substantive solution. Of course, this may be because the problem has become so pronounced.\n\nAccording to the Tax Foundation\u2019s latest national rankings, Texas\u2019 property tax system ranks as the 15th worst in the nation for taxpayers, collecting more than $1,550 per man, woman, and child. That per capita figure is up from $1,393 just a few years prior when the Tax Foundation ranked Texas\u2019 tax system as the 17th worst.\n\nAnother report, Homeowners and the Texas Property Tax, moves beyond the per capita measure and examines the average yearly burden on homeowners. The study finds that from 2010 to 2012, the three-year average annual property tax burden on a Texas homeowner was $2,477. By comparison, the same three-year annual average for a homeowner in the U.S. Southern Region was a much smaller $1,411 while a typical U.S. homeowner paid just $2,091.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that property taxes are bigger in Texas though, it\u2019s also that these types of taxes are outstripping standard economic measures, like population and inflation, by a wide margin.\n\nConsider that from fiscal years 2000 to 2011, property taxes levied across the state increased by almost 80 percent. Over the same period, population and inflation combined for an increase of just 53.2 percent, a significantly slower rate of growth. The difference in these two measures signals that property taxes, as a whole, are humming along at a much quicker pace than Texans can afford them without going broke.\n\nOf course, the financial burden created by Texas\u2019 property tax system is only part of the overall problem. Property taxes also disincentive property investment and impede job creation by penalizing land development and causing out-of-state businesses to think twice about relocating to Texas. Worse yet, property taxes prevent homeowners and businesses from ever truly owning their own property, whether it\u2019s been paid off in full or not.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s against this backdrop of a broken system that state lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum have come together in agreement of the problem and proposed much-needed reforms. Though the exact nature of the reforms won\u2019t be known for quite some time, current and prospective homeowners and businesses can at least take heart that the conversation, irrespective of party labels, is headed in the right direction.\n\nJames Quintero is the Director of the Center for Local Governance at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a non-profit, free-market research institute based in Austin.
