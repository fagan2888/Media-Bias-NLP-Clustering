But instead of dominating hitters, he struggled as pain in his elbow increased with each outing. On the last game of the season, a pitcher\u2019s nightmare unfolded on one pitch.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a grenade went off in my elbow,\u201d Cramer recounted. \u201cI knew something was wrong immediately.\u201dThe diagnosis was a torn ulnar collateral ligament, or UCL, an injury that has become increasingly prevalent in youth baseball. Cramer\u2019s surgeon, Dr. Marc Safran of the Stanford University Department of Orthopedic Surgery, saw very few options.Cramer was told that the surgery was the only answer if he wanted to continue to live and play baseball without pain. The torn ligament was replaced and reinforced by another ligament in his body, and he rehabilitated his arm and didn\u2019t pitch competitively for over a year.The surgery was developed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Frank Jobe in 1974 and first used on major league pitcher Tommy John, whose torn UCL was the first to be successfully surgically reinforced, allowing him to return to professional baseball. The surgery \u2014 also called ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction \u2014 became widely known as \u201cTommy John surgery.\u201dFour decades later, the procedure has been developed and perfected to a stage in which the rate of recovery is relatively high. A recent study published by the American Journal of Sports Medicine examined the careers of 216 major league pitchers who had undergone the procedure at some point during their careers in professional baseball. The study found that 83 percent of the pitchers returned to the majors following surgery, and that 97 percent were able to throw again competitively at some level of professional baseball.However, the medical community has expressed dismay over the number of surgeries in sport, particularly among younger players. Dr. Steven Isono, a sports orthopedic surgeon based in Oakland, Calif., said that the tendency for young pitchers to experience a heavy year-round throwing load often causes the development of chronic elbow injuries from overuse.The sport\u2019s top young talent \u2014 who according to Isono are primarily players who specialized early in their careers \u2014 are becoming increasingly vulnerable to Tommy John Surgery.Sports Illustrated reported that 12.8 percent of top 30 high school draft picks underwent the surgery in 2002, while 31.3 percent of the top 30 picks in 2010 have undergone the surgery.\u201cThese kids are starting way down in middle school and Little League and have pitching coaches,\u201d Isono said. The early specialization and prioritization on skills development has accounted for higher workloads at earlier ages, he added.The physical effects of youth baseball on players can be observed by comparing durability of Latin-American and American-born pitchers in their early professional careers. Without the prevalence of organized competition seen in the United States, young Latin-American pitchers typically pitch fewer innings year round.The result is a significant difference in the number of Tommy John operations between the two groups. Of the first twenty Major League pitchers to need the surgery in 2014, nineteen were born in the United States, despite roughly a quarter of Major League Baseball claiming Latin-American origin.\u201cFrom a medical standpoint, it\u2019s tough,\u201d Isono said. \u201cThe overuse injuries are so much more prevalent and devastating.\u201dThe allure of early specialization can be hard to resist. Playing an extra six to nine months each year increases the likelihood of stress injury, but also provides players with an opportunity to improve their skills and experience. As a result, a player can see increased playing time during the next season, and a higher likelihood of college and professional exposure.\u201cNow your level of baseball is higher coming into the next season than the guys who didn\u2019t specialize,\u201d Isono said.Cramer and his surgeon believe his injury was the result of over-pitching from an early age. \u201cI was playing baseball ten months out of the year,\u201d Cramer said. He was pitching nearly year round.Cramer was just 13 years old when he began to notice pain and weakness in his elbow. In one instance after pitching a complete game, he struggled to lift a fork while eating dinner with the team. \u201cMy dad had to feed me because my UCL was quivering,\u201d he said.The consequences of recent early specialization may now be visible at baseball\u2019s highest level. Over the course of the last several years, emerging young stars such as Jose Fernandez (age 22), Matt Harvey (age 24), and Stephen Strasburg (age 23) have had to undergo the procedure after short stints in the Major Leagues.Preventative resources are emerging from a variety of sources and angles, including pitchsmart.org , a recent initiative launched by Major League Baseball and USA Baseball to try to provide medical information and recommendations to young players and their parents, including pitch counts, rest and warning signs for possible injury.For Dr. Isono, pitch counts and other regulations are a good start but can also be misleading. \u201cYou can\u2019t put the intensity of throwing into the equation,\u201d he said. In other words, pitchers throw at differing levels of intensity depending on the stakes involved in a particular game, or the part of the game in which they are throwing.It\u2019s also difficult for younger pitchers to self-regulate on the basis of pain. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 10 and 12, you\u2019re not going to say, \u2018I\u2019m not throwing, I\u2019m going to rest. I need physical therapy,\u2019\u201d Isono said.Cramer looks back at his rigorous competitive schedule with some regret, but also perspective. \u201cI wish I could go back and tell myself that those innings don\u2019t matter. I threw hard from a young age and put irreversible innings in my arm.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Experts say the tendency for young baseball pitchers to experience a heavy year-round throwing load often causes the development of chronic elbow injuries from overuse.", "title": "Concern with early youth specialization grows as 'Tommy John surgeries' increase - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TommyJohnSurgeries.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-06T06:58:48+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/02/02/tommy-john-surgeries-increase/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Health", "tag": "tommy john", "published_time": "2015-02-02T09:11:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T06:58:48+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Experts say the tendency for young baseball pitchers to experience a heavy year-round throwing load often causes the development of chronic elbow injuries from overuse.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TommyJohnSurgeries.jpg", "title": "Concern with early youth specialization grows as 'Tommy John surgeries' increase - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe overuse injuries are so much more prevalent and devastating.\u201dThe allure of early specialization can be hard to resist.\nA recent study published by the American Journal of Sports Medicine examined the careers of 216 major league pitchers who had undergone the procedure at some point during their careers in professional baseball.\n\u201cI knew something was wrong immediately.\u201dThe diagnosis was a torn ulnar collateral ligament, or UCL, an injury that has become increasingly prevalent in youth baseball.\nGabe Cramer was a 17-year-old pitcher bound for Stanford and in the midst of his senior year of high school.\nI need physical therapy,\u2019\u201d Isono said.Cramer looks back at his rigorous competitive schedule with some regret, but also perspective."}
