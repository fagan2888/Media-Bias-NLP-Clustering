That number amounted to just below one-third of people in New Mexico on individual plans.\n\nShipley pointed to the company's inability to reach an agreement with the Office of Superintendent of Insurance. BCBSNM had asked the OSI for a 51.6 percent rate increase in May, which was denied earlier this month.\n\nOther health care insurance providers were only seeking increases of about 5 percent.\n\nThe company said it would work with the OSI, health care providers and stakeholders to make the transition to a new provider.\n\n\"To the 35,000 customers who selected Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico individual products, we thank you and look forward to continuing to compete for your business now and in the future,\" Shipley wrote.\n\nThe company said it would communicate with customers via mail and online son.\n\nBCBSNM said approximately 11,600 members were impacted by a Feb. 4 data breach from its affiliated company, Anthem Inc., and that a small percentage of those people's Social Security numbers were exposed.\n\nThe CEO of the Health Insurance Exchange responded Thursday:\n\n\u201cFollowing the recent announcement by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico, we want all New Mexicans to know that there will still be plenty of choices for consumers looking for individual health insurance coverage during Open Enrollment this fall,\u201d said Amy Dowd, CEO of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange (NMHIX).\n\nShe said BCBS enrollment accounted for about 50 percent of coverage plans through the exchange.\n\nOpen enrollment for the exchange will begin Nov. 1 and run through the end of Jan. 2016. If you enroll prior to Jan. 1, you should be able to qualify for a new plan.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.KOB.com", "description": "The president of Blue Cross Blue Shield New Mexico announced Wednesday that BCBSNM is pulling out of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange, potentially leaving all New Mexicans who signed up for health care insurance with the company through the state exchange without insurance as of Jan. 1 of next year.", "title": "Blue Cross Blue Shield NM to pull out of NM exchange; current individual policies will end Jan. 1", "url": "http://www.kob.com/article/stories/s3890018.shtml", "image": "http://www.kob.com/kobtvimages/repository/2015-08/Blue_Cross_Blue_Shield_of_New_Mexico_seeks_big_premium_hike-syndImport-062553.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 258993120802213}, "thumbnail": "http://www.kob.com/kobtvimages/repository/2015-08/Blue_Cross_Blue_Shield_of_New_Mexico_seeks_big_premium_hike-syndImport-062553.jpg", "robots": "FOLLOW,INDEX", "description": "The president of Blue Cross Blue Shield New Mexico announced Wednesday that BCBSNM is pulling out of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange, potentially leaving all New Mexicans who signed up for health care insurance with the company through the state exchange without insurance as of Jan. 1 of next year."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40c6\"", "article_summary": "\"To the 35,000 customers who selected Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico individual products, we thank you and look forward to continuing to compete for your business now and in the future,\" Shipley wrote.\nOpen enrollment for the exchange will begin Nov. 1 and run through the end of Jan. 2016.\nHe cited the prices the company charged for health insurance in 2014 and 2015 did not cover their costs, resulting in $19.2 million in losses last year.\nThat number amounted to just below one-third of people in New Mexico on individual plans.\nShipley said the company would \"continue to offer an HMO product off exchange in 2016,\" which he said would be available \"to all customers.\""}
