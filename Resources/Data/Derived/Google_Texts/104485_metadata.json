Sleep and sushi. These are a few of the secrets women living well into their 100s reveal when asked about longevity. But Elizabeth Sullivan, a former math teacher from Forth Worth, Texas, who just turned 104, has a sweeter secret.\n\n\u201cI saw the doctor and he said, \u2018Are you careful about what you eat?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Certainly not, I drink three Dr. Peppers a day,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Oh my goodness, that\u2019s too much sugar. You will die if you keep drinking that,\u2019\u201d Sullivan told ABC News 24. \u201cBut 10 years later he died and I had to change doctors. So I\u2019m still drinking three Dr. Peppers a day and people said that\u2019s bad for me but you know, not very many people live to be 104.\u201d\n\nThe sugary soda, Sullivan added, is what she guesses has been keeping her alive. And when Dr. Pepper\u2019s CEO Larry Young caught wind of this, he wanted to send her a gift. Young personally delivered cases of Sullivan\u2019s favorite soda in 70s-style glass bottles, which is how the soda was packaged when Sullivan first started to drink it.\n\n\u201cWe saw it as a unique opportunity to ring in her big 104,\u201d Chris Barnes, Dr. Pepper\u2019s director of corporate communications, told ABC. \u201cWe wanted to thank her for being such a big fan of the brand and making us a part of her daily life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dr, pepper, secret, 104, year, old, womans, long, life, she, says", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Drinking three sodas a day keeps Elizabeth Sullivan's doctors away, apparently.", "title": "This Woman Says Dr. Pepper Got Her To 104 Years Old", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dr-pepper-secret-104-year-old-womans-long-life-she-says-326514", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/21/dr-pepper-secret-104-year-old-womans-long-life-she-says.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drinking three sodas a day keeps Elizabeth Sullivan's doctors away, apparently.", "title": "This Woman Says Dr. Pepper Got Her To 104 Years Old", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dr-pepper-secret-104-year-old-womans-long-life-she-says-326514", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/21/dr-pepper-secret-104-year-old-womans-long-life-she-says.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/21/dr-pepper-secret-104-year-old-womans-long-life-she-says.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-21T11:23:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T11:23:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Drinking three sodas a day keeps Elizabeth Sullivan's doctors away, apparently."}, "article_summary": "And when Dr. Pepper\u2019s CEO Larry Young caught wind of this, he wanted to send her a gift.\n\u201cWe saw it as a unique opportunity to ring in her big 104,\u201d Chris Barnes, Dr. Pepper\u2019s director of corporate communications, told ABC.\nYou will die if you keep drinking that,\u2019\u201d Sullivan told ABC News 24.\nBut Elizabeth Sullivan, a former math teacher from Forth Worth, Texas, who just turned 104, has a sweeter secret.\n\u201cWe wanted to thank her for being such a big fan of the brand and making us a part of her daily life.\u201d"}
