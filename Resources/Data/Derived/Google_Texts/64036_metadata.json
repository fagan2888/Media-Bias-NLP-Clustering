Filing into brightly colored classrooms, the students take their seats. In a matter of minutes, a steady buzz of quiet conversation, pencils scratching and focused concentration takes over.\n\nFor over 25 years, East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring (EPATT) has been ushering low-income East Palo Alto kids from the tennis courts to the classroom. What started as a summer tennis clinic in 1988 has developed into a comprehensive youth development program, with one-on-one tutoring provided by Stanford students and tennis lessons taught by a team of professional coaches and former alumni.\n\nThe organization has had enormous success. In a community where the high school dropout rate is estimated to be between 60-75 percent, 95 percent of EPATT students graduate and many go on to university. As a result, there\u2019s a waiting list \u2014 sometimes of several years \u2014 to get into the program.\n\nHaving achieved these academic goals, EPATT is now focused on getting parents \u2014 who are primarily Spanish-speaking and some of whom never completed high school themselves \u2014 more involved in their children\u2019s education.\n\n\u201cIf I could say that there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s really changed about our academic focus, it\u2019s changing who we\u2019ve focused on,\u201d explained Kesha Weekes, EPATT\u2019s academic director. \u201cAt this point in our 25 years we understand tutoring \u2026 but parents, and helping them to be effective has been our new charge.\u201d\n\nEPATT\u2019s focus on parents comes as the Ravenswood City School District, which serves East Palo Alto and east Menlo Park, is experiencing major changes. The district is slated to receive new funds from the state under a new K-12 school funding formula. It is implementing new state educational standards. And it just elected a new superintendent, Gloria Hernandez, who has also made increased parental outreach a primary goal.\n\nClick here to open the gallery.\n\n\n\nHernandez said EPATT was a good model for what she hopes to see happen in the district more broadly.\n\n\u201cWhat EPATT has proven is the central role our parents play in determining our students\u2019 success,\u201d Hernandez said in an email, explaining that the organization serves as \u201cproof of the large number of parents we have in Ravenswood who are ready and eager to engage in their students\u2019 education.\u201d\n\nAt EPATT, the organization\u2019s staff is available for one-on-one consultation with parents every night of the week. Furthermore, parents are required to follow-up on these meetings in order to continue to be a part of EPATT.\n\nEach family receives an EPATT report card, evaluating students\u2019 performance in the classroom and on the court, as well as parents\u2019 involvement.\n\nAs parents filed in to pick up their kids on a recent Wednesday evening, Christina Erwin, the coordinator for EPATT\u2019s elementary school students, handed them a list of activities differentiated by grade level that counted towards the parental involvement portion of the report card.\n\nFor kindergarteners through fifth graders, suggestions included volunteering in the child\u2019s classroom. For middle school-aged kids, parents were encouraged to take a leadership role in the PTA. For high school-aged kids, going on family college tours and communicating with college counselors was advised.\n\nConcrete suggestions are important, Weekes said, because not all parents intuitively understand how to be advocates for their children. \u201cThere is no set of training courses or requirements for parenthood. It\u2019s amazing how many people go \u2018I\u2019m learning this as I go,\u2019\u201d she explained.\n\nCurrently, EPATT serves 150 kids and their families. Trying to reach beyond this select group, Ravenswood began offering an eight-week workshop series for parents of elementary school kids in January, focusing on how to partner with their children\u2019s schools and connect with their community at large.\n\n\u201cOur parents, they want their kids to succeed and they want to be as involved as possible, but unfortunately that\u2019s not always the case,\u201d Ravenswood School Board President Ana-Maria Pulido said, explaining that parents are oftentimes working multiple jobs, making it difficult for them to be as involved as they would like.\n\nWeekes hopes that Ravenswood and EPATT will continue to learn from each other, ideally working more closely in years to come. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that in this new administration there\u2019s a long-term commitment to East Palo Alto,\u201d Weekes said, \u201cbecause the problems are long-term problems to solve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "East Palo Alto,East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring,Education,epa,EPATT,Katie Brigham,Ravenswood City School District,schools,youth development program,Culture & Features,Politics & Gov,Features,Frontpage Featured,Sports", "description": "East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring ushers low-income kids from the tennis courts to the classroom.
