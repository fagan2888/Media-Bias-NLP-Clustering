Arnold Palmer will skip the annual Masters Tournament par-3 contest due to a shoulder injury suffered in a recent fall, Augusta National Golf Club said.

The four-time Masters winner separated a shoulder in December and has only recently resumed swinging his golf clubs. Palmer, 85, is still planning to hit the tournament’s ceremonial opening tee shot, along with six-time winner Jack Nicklaus, 75, and three-time winner Gary Player, 79, on Thursday.

“His health is most important,” Augusta National Chairman Billy Payne said in a statement. “We look forward to Arnold’s return to the par-3 contest next year.”

Palmer will be replaced in the event by two-time Masters winner Ben Crenshaw in a group with Nicklaus and Player. Crenshaw, 63, said he will be making his final appearance in the Masters this year.
