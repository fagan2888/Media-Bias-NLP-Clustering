Because the GOP has more incumbents up for re-election in the Senate, that party potentially has more seats to lose, according to speakers at the conference. There is a reasonable chance that control of the Senate could shift to the Democrats if voting goes that party\u2019s way, said Tom Nickels, executive vice president of government relations and public policy for the AHA. The House is less likely to shift away from the Republican Party, he said. Regardless, the current outlook is that no single party is likely to control Congress and the executive branch, meaning that large-scale changes to the Affordable Care Act are unlikely.\n\nAs noted yesterday, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt\u2019s talk stressed that the agency is trying to be considered as less of an adversary and more of a transparent regulator working alongside the hospital field.\n\nIn addition, Slavitt predicted that the value-based models being tested through the enactment of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 and the ACA are going to evolve over time, and likened them to early generations of the Apple iPhone. \u201cI think it would be a mistake to view these models as fully calibrated,\u201d Slavitt said. \u201cWe should expect theses models to get better and better with each release,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least three of the speakers described their personal links to health care. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough\u2019s mother was an emergency department nurse, which served as a prelude to his overview of the Obama Administration\u2019s approach to the opioid addiction crisis. \u201cWith your continued leadership, we\u2019ll be able to help more and more Americans defeat the scourge of this epidemic of opioid use and heroin use, and help people take back their communities and their families,\u201d McDonough said.\n\nKeynote speaker Megyn Kelly\u2019s mother also worked as a nurse, but in behavioral health. The Fox News television host dedicated the bulk of her speech to the lessons her mother taught her.\n\nBroadcaster Jane Pauley\u2019s major experience was more direct. She grew up in Indiana with a name so ordinary that her own father suggested she change it. Professionally, her value to her employers was that she seemed \u201cnormal.\u201d But that equilibrium was upset when a case of hives triggered behavioral changes that were later diagnosed as a bipolar disorder, Pauley said.\n\nWith her equilibrium now restored, Pauley came to the AHA meeting with the goal of asking health care leaders to work to take the stigma out of behavioral health issues. \"It's a problem of the brain,\" Pauley said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 With the 2016 American Hospital Association Annual Membership Meeting concluded, several topics covered at the meeting are important for the hospital field to keep an eye on going forward.
