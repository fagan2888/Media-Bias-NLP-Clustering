But inside the U.S., half the time, the dose was above 11.6 mSv.\n\nThis analysis, based on data collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency to assess radiation exposure in cardiology, examined practices in 308 labs from 65 countries and included 55 U.S. facilities.\n\nEinstein and colleagues examined whether these labs used recommended radiation doses through practices such as minimizing use of higher-dose radioactive materials, tailoring doses to patient weight, and doing stress tests with less nuclear medicine when possible.\n\nMore U.S. labs avoided use of thallium, a material that exposes people to higher radiation, in patients younger than 70. But fewer U.S. labs adjusted doses to patient weight or had protocols favoring stress tests done in part without nuclear medicine.\n\nWhen patients undergo \u201cstress-only\u201d imaging, they receive nuclear medicine for initial tests but only get another dose for additional images if the first pictures suggest a problem. Patients with normal results at the start of the process don\u2019t receive additional nuclear tests.\n\nAdopting stress-only protocols reduced the average radiation dose by about 64%, from 11 mSv to 4 mSv, Einstein and colleagues noted in a second study in the journal.\n\nEven though the risk of cancer linked to nuclear imaging is thought to be small and is dwarfed by the risk of serious problems from heart disease, the results from these studies still highlight the need for doctors to do a better job of minimizing radiation exposure, Einstein said.\n\nRadiation exposure will still cause cancer in a small, but real number of patients, noted Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman of the University of California, San Francisco, author of an accompanying editorial.\n\n\u201cThe right imaging tests performed at the right time can lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses, better treatment decisions, and improved patient outcomes, and advanced imaging has had a very positive impact on patient care,\u201d she wrote in her editorial.\n\nHowever, she continued \u201cUnnecessary and inappropriately performed tests harm patients by causing them discomfort and anxiety, by leading to a large number of irrelevant incidental findings, and by exposing them to ionizing radiation which can have harmful effects on their health.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1PsxiAS, http://bit.ly/1OgYH9U and http://bit.ly/1knV2Lw\n\nJAMA Intern Med 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cancer, radiation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Compared to patients in other countries, the typical U.S. patient is more often exposed to excessive radiation during myocardial perfusion imaging, a new study suggests.", "title": "U.S. Patients Get Higher Radiation Doses In Some Heart Tests", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-patients-get-higher-radiation-doses-some-heart-tests-367034", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/28/radiation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Compared to patients in other countries, the typical U.S. patient is more often exposed to excessive radiation during myocardial perfusion imaging, a new study suggests.", "title": "U.S. Patients Get Higher Radiation Doses In Some Heart Tests", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-patients-get-higher-radiation-doses-some-heart-tests-367034", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/28/radiation.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/28/radiation.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-12-28T14:50:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-28T14:50:15-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Compared to patients in other countries, the typical U.S. patient is more often exposed to excessive radiation during myocardial perfusion imaging, a new study suggests."}, "article_summary": "To minimize the slight risk of cancer associated with radiation exposure, guidelines recommend that exposure during myocardial perfusion tests be limited to 9 millisieverts (mSv).\nMore U.S. labs avoided use of thallium, a material that exposes people to higher radiation, in patients younger than 70.\nPatients with normal results at the start of the process don\u2019t receive additional nuclear tests.\nBut fewer U.S. labs adjusted doses to patient weight or had protocols favoring stress tests done in part without nuclear medicine.\nRadiation exposure will still cause cancer in a small, but real number of patients, noted Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman of the University of California, San Francisco, author of an accompanying editorial."}
