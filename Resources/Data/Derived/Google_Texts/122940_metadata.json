It may be the most virulent form of HIV in Russia and accounts for more than 50 percent of new HIV infections in the Novosibirsk region, according to the region\u2019s Koltsovo science city statement. Russia has battled against AIDS for the past decade, and the epidemic appears to be getting worse. \u201cIt\u2019s the 1980s in Russia,\u201d Kenneth Rapoza writes on Forbes regarding the HIV/AIDS crisis.\n\nThe subtype was discovered by scientists at the State Research Center of Virology and Viotechnology Vektor in Novosibirsk, located in Siberia. There are two groups of the HIV virus, the more virulent HIV-1 and HIV-2. A subtype of HIV-1 known as 02_AG/A is believed to be more easily transmitted compared to other strains of the virus.\n\nThe number of people in Novosibirsk infected with HIV has grown from 2,000 in 2007 to 15,000 in 2012, Russia\u2019s Federal AIDS Centre reports. Meanwhile, the United Nations states that Eastern Europe and Central Asia are the only parts of the world where HIV infections are rising, the majority of infected people living in Russia. Roughly one million people out of 143 million in Russia are HIV-positive. The World Bank estimates that by 2020, nearly 21,000 Russians per month could die because of HIV/AIDS. Globally, however, the incidence of HIV infections has dropped by a third since 2001.\n\n\u201cRussia has experienced the fastest-spreading HIV/AIDS epidemics in any one country in history, but there remains a lack of effective preventative measures to slow it down \u2014 in large measure because the people most affected are also the country\u2019s most reviled,\u201d Gregory Gilderman of the Pulitzer Center writes. A study completed in 2009 about HIV/AIDS in Russia and Ukraine, which has one of the highest rates of HIV in the world, noted that the empowerment of women in particular, \u201cis vital to reversing the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\u201d The authors concluded that \u201cit is important to find ways to empower [women] by implementing policies and specific prevention measures that increase their access to knowledge about HIV/AIDS.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "russia, hiv strain, hiv/aids, virulent, new hiv virus", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A severe form of HIV is spreading rapidly through a Siberian region in Russia.", "title": "New 'Virulent' HIV Strain Accounts For 50 Percent Of New Infections In Russian Region", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-virulent-hiv-strain-spreading-rapidly-through-siberia-identified-russian-scientists-accounts-50", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/19/trans-siberian-railway.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A severe form of HIV is spreading rapidly through a Siberian region in Russia.", "title": "New 'Virulent' HIV Strain Accounts For 50 Percent Of New Infections In Russian Region", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-virulent-hiv-strain-spreading-rapidly-through-siberia-identified-russian-scientists-accounts-50", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/19/trans-siberian-railway.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/19/trans-siberian-railway.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-10-19T18:08:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-19T18:10:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A severe form of HIV is spreading rapidly through a Siberian region in Russia."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3eb6\"", "article_summary": "There are two groups of the HIV virus, the more virulent HIV-1 and HIV-2.\nGlobally, however, the incidence of HIV infections has dropped by a third since 2001.\nScientists in Novosibirsk, Russia believe they have identified a new HIV strain that is more severe than others, and it\u2019s spreading at a \u201crapid rate\u201d throughout Russia, Chechnya, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan.\nIt may be the most virulent form of HIV in Russia and accounts for more than 50 percent of new HIV infections in the Novosibirsk region, according to the region\u2019s Koltsovo science city statement.\nThe subtype of the HIV virus is referred to as 02_AG/A and was first detected in Novosibirsk in 2006, the Moscow Times reports."}
