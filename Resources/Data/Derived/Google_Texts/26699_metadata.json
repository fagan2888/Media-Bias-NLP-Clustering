He will pray for migrants and victims of violence at a Mass a few hundred feet from the border. A platform built next to the border fence will allow Pope Francis to address El Pasoans watching from the United States.\n\nThe Catholic Diocese in El Paso said it gave an estimated 10,000 tickets for free to parishioners for the Papal Mass. On some Internet sites, those tickets were selling at more than $150.\n\nFor those who could not score a ticket for the Mass, the El Paso Diocese created a \u201cTwo Nations, One Faith\u201d viewing party at the Sun Bowl Stadium, with a capacity of 50,000 people.\n\nThrough a two-way live stream broadcast, the Argentine pontiff can view the thousands of attendees and issue a formal blessing.\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Maria Garza; Editing Jon Herskovitz and Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "EL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - As many as 200,000 Catholics are expected to cross four bri", "title": "Large crowds to cross U.S.-Mexico border at El Paso to see pope", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/16/Large-crowds-cross-US-Mexico-border-El-Paso-Pope-visit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-mexico_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/16/Large-crowds-cross-US-Mexico-border-El-Paso-Pope-visit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pope-mexico_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "EL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - As many as 200,000 Catholics are expected to cross four bri", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Extra border patrol agents and security measures are in place to keep up checks in El Paso and other parts of the border, he added.\nOn an average weekday, 30,000 vehicles and 20,000 pedestrians cross through the El Paso ports of entry, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nBusinessman Stan Okes wants to avoid the papal frenzy sweeping El Paso.\nThe Catholic Diocese in El Paso said it gave an estimated 10,000 tickets for free to parishioners for the Papal Mass.\nEL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - As many as 200,000 Catholics are expected to cross four bridges from El Paso, Texas into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico on Wednesday to see Pope Francis in a massive pilgrimage likely to choke roads and immigration offices, U.S. officials said."}
