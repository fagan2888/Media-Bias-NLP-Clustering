But Jean resolved to make her own desires known, as a gift to her three adult sons.\n\n\u201cI told them I\u2019ve made these decisions: This is the quality of life that is the minimum for me, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve set down here,\u201d she says. \u201cAnything worse than that, forget it.\u201d\n\nOksner, like many Americans, has broached end-of-life scenarios in conversations that are both philosophical and technical in their scope. A recently enacted Medicare rule also makes it easier to discuss advance care directives with physicians.\n\nOn Jan. 1, doctors could start billing the federal health insurance program for those conversations.\n\nThe new Medicare rule puts advance care discussion on the radar for some doctors and boosts its priority for others, says Dr. Hillary Lum, geriatrician at University of Colorado Hospital and assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cIn a best-case situation, excellent primary care physicians already are having this conversation,\u201d Lum says. \u201cBut because it\u2019s time-consuming, sometimes they run behind, and it\u2019s hard to fit those conversations in.\u201d\n\nMedicare doesn\u2019t limit the number of times an individual can have these advance care planning talks \u2014 something Lum says reflects the idea that they should take place multiple times as individuals age and their preferences change.\n\nSurveys show that most people recognize the importance of communicating end-of-life wishes, yet relatively few have formalized the process.\n\nThe discussions have particular resonance for baby boomers, who have turned 65 at a rate of about 10,000 per day since 2011. Colorado has one of the fastest-growing older adult populations in the nation.\n\nEileen Doherty, executive director of the Colorado Gerontological Society, says that when her organization gives presentations on Medicare, news of the new rule elicits lots of approving nods from the audience.\n\n\u201cWe present it as, even if you want all treatment, it\u2019s as important as if you want to have no treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cWe present it in broad context, so we\u2019re not promoting one kind of philosophy over another.\u201d\n\nAlthough early drafts of the Affordable Care Act included provisions to cover end-of-life conversations, political backlash invoking government \u201cdeath panel\u201d rhetoric prompted them to be pulled.\n\nMore recently, the Medicare rule has raised concerns from critics who fear such discussions might steer patients toward rejecting life-saving treatment in the name of lowering health care costs.\n\n\u201cAnd the way you\u2019re doing it is by not giving balanced and accurate information that allows people to bring their own values and preferences to bear,\u201d says Burke Balch, director of the National Right to Life Committee\u2019s Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is giving them information that has one finger on the scale.\u201d\n\nBurke adds that his group supports the idea of advance directives but also backs proposed legislation that includes requiring Medicare to provide a wider range of advance directive choices, including pro-treatment options such as the NRLC\u2019s Will to Live.\n\nKaiser Permanente, one of Colorado\u2019s largest health care providers, adopted a systematic approach to advance care planning several years ago that seeks to identify patients\u2019 goals, to link them to resources such as classes and online videos and to better train the staff to facilitate one-on-one conversations, says Dr. Dan Johnson, Kaiser\u2019s director of supportive care solutions in Colorado.\n\nHe adds that studies show following people\u2019s wishes tends not to drive up costs.\n\n\u201cIt tends to ensure the care given is aligned with what people want,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cMany times, what people want is not the most expensive option.\u201d\n\nHe wonders how, as advance care planning continues to take hold, doctors will adapt their practice \u2014 adding that the biggest unknown could be how much physicians fear having such an intimate conversation with patients.\n\n\u201cI think society is making progress on that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat will be interesting is: Are doctors making progress on that? Are we able to make a safe space where these conversations can become the norm as people are doing their planning so that they and their families have the support they need?\u201d\n\nEfforts to encourage more \u2014 and more effective \u2014 conversations between health care providers and patients have sprung up across the country. For instance, the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement has hosted webinars designed to help providers understand best practices and pitfalls of advance care discussions while also explaining how to document and bill for them.\n\nAmid more intensive professional training efforts, groups like The Conversation Project have provided grassroots resources designed to make exploring the issues around end-of-life care more accessible for individuals.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to push this conversation upstream, so people who are healthy have these conversations before chronic or serious illness has descended on us,\u201d says Constance Holden, co-founder of a Boulder County effort based on the national model. \u201cWe think every adult should be having these conversations.\u201d\n\nA best-selling book, Atul Gawande\u2019s \u201cBeing Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,\u201d explores the nexus of end-of-life issues and the American health care system in depth. A wide variety of tools are available to help individuals sort through the issues.\n\nIn Colorado, documents like the MOST form \u2014 Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment \u2014 can spell out directives, while Five Wishes provides a popular template for a living will. So-called \u201cdeath cafes\u201d provide forums for conversation on the subject in Denver, Boulder and Colorado Springs, while Death Over Dinner also offers opportunities for discussions in a social environment.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIn the absence of well-articulated or well-documented preferences, decisions on an individual\u2019s end-of-life care can wreak havoc on families.\n\nTrude Bershof, a hospital palliative care volunteer for six years, has seen deep-seated guilt, anger, fear \u2014 and any number of other emotions \u2014 rip apart families struggling to determine what course to pursue on behalf of an ill and incapacitated relative.\n\nAll that bedside drama moved her to file her own advance directives with her doctor. She designated one of her three adult children as her surrogate on health care decisions if she could not make them herself.\n\nShe re-examines her choices every couple of years, because individuals\u2019 attitudes tend to change with age and circumstance.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s idea of quality of life changes a lot when they\u2019re facing mortality,\u201d Bershof says.\n\nShe faced mortality during a battle with breast cancer. The experience led her to some basic decisions: not to be a burden to her kids; to remain independent as long as possible; and not to be intubated in an emergency.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m 75, going on 76, there are a lot of treatments I would not want,\u201d Bershof says. \u201cI know I\u2019m not going to live forever. I don\u2019t want extreme measures on any level.\u201d\n\nNo matter what a person believes about how \u2014 and how much \u2014 modern medicine should play a role in addressing life-threatening illness, the conversation looms paramount, advocates say.\n\nDr. Lum, the CU geriatrician, recently used a Colorado Health Foundation grant to develop a new model for advance care planning among groups of patients at their usual primary care clinic.\n\nOver two years, professionals and \u201cpeer partner\u201d volunteers helped guide the groups through discussions about their own wishes for how end-of-life scenarios might play out.\n\n\u201cThe stuff that came out in the sessions was largely about things going horribly wrong,\u201d says Lois Knight, one of the peer partners who also volunteers in hospice care. \u201cThat may be the first thing you know. You may not know what you want, but you know what you don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nMany of the patients signed up to explore advance care because their experience with a spouse, or close friends or family members, forced them to confront the issue.\n\nKnight\u2019s interest had been piqued by her experience with medical professionals in the last years of her parents\u2019 lives, when they were in and out of hospitals, subjected to what she later would learn were pointless but painful tests.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget,\u201d she says, \u201cthey gave my dad a spinal tap when he was in the hospital for pneumonia. And afterward, I asked the resident, \u2018What were you testing for and how will this change his treatment?\u2019 And the guy honestly said it won\u2019t. And I thought, why did we do this to this poor old man?\u201d\n\nThe talks walked participants through various directives and documents but also targeted basic themes: What matters most? What constitutes a meaningful life?\n\nHere, conversations became both broadly philosophical and surprisingly specific. One person defined meaningful life like this: \u201cIf I can\u2019t read \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 and understand it, then it\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\nJean Oksner, who had the discussion with her kids after losing her husband and now calls herself a \u201cproselytizer\u201d on behalf of advance planning, acknowledges that her instructions are basic and don\u2019t cover every scenario.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of everything, but they understand, especially my son Jerry, who\u2019s here, is very compassionate and intelligent,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019d know how and what I would want. He\u2019d just know.\u201d\n\nJerry Oksner, who often accompanies his mother to doctor visits, allows that nobody likes to talk about potentially difficult choices they may have to make for their parents.\n\nBut he appreciated his mom\u2019s effort to make sure he and his brothers would not be conflicted or in doubt if and when that time came.\n\n\u201cI accepted it as a gift,\u201d Jerry says. \u201cShe did it with the best of intentions, looking out for the rest of us, who are going to be struggling with whatever the final situation is.\u201d\n\nKevin Simpson: 303-954-1739, ksimpson@denverpost.com or @ksimpsondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "As older adult population rises, end-of-life discussions gain traction", "title": "As older adult population rises, end-of-life discussions gain traction", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/05/as-older-adult-population-rises-end-of-life-discussions-gain-traction/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160305__DP_NGPS_TypeSetExport20160306_B1_CDXXADVANCECARE1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160305__DP_NGPS_TypeSetExport20160306_B1_CDXXADVANCECARE1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-05T19:26:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:03:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022In the absence of well-articulated or well-documented preferences, decisions on an individual\u2019s end-of-life care can wreak havoc on families.\nShe designated one of her three adult children as her surrogate on health care decisions if she could not make them herself.\nA recently enacted Medicare rule also makes it easier to discuss advance care directives with physicians.\nAmid more intensive professional training efforts, groups like The Conversation Project have provided grassroots resources designed to make exploring the issues around end-of-life care more accessible for individuals.\nFor instance, the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement has hosted webinars designed to help providers understand best practices and pitfalls of advance care discussions while also explaining how to document and bill for them."}
