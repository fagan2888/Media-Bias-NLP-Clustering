But they don\u2019t get vast public attention, unlike communicable diseases such as TB, malaria, Ebola or, more recently, cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\n\nThis is partly why I\u2019d held off going to see the Oscar-winning film, Still Alice. For one thing, it used a relatively young 50-something as the central character suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 which seemed odd, given that Alzheimer\u2019s is one of the seminal health problems of today\u2019s aging America. And two, movies (to me at least) are meant for escape and entertainment, not tragedy and emotional upheaval.\n\nRelated: Why the Alzheimer\u2019s Fight Has Only Just Begun\n\nSo I\u2019d resisted. Until now. How wrong I was on both counts. Julianne Moore\u2019s portrayal of the impact of Alzheimer\u2019s on an individual and her family is not only breathtaking and captivating (no wonder she won the Oscar for best actress) \u2013 but beyond that the film shared critical information in a visually striking and intellectually significant way.\n\nThe film shares (to name but a few) the creative use of technology in the early stages of the disease to assist memory loss; the dearth of medicines available for more limited help; the decline of simple everyday actions like bathing and cleaning; the social isolation caused by other people\u2019s ignorance of the disease; and the small amount of funding dedicated to finding a cure.\n\nPerhaps the film, beyond its release date and Oscar glory, will help elevate a focus on what is rapidly becoming the public health, social and fiscal nightmare of our 21st century.\n\nRelated: 11 Reasons We Can\u2019t Ignore Alzheimer\u2019s Anymore\n\nIt may do that partly because of its uniqueness. Clearly a story about a grandmother in her 80s wouldn\u2019t have done what a young, smart, vivacious and beautiful Columbia University linguistics professor managed to do. Yet Alzheimer\u2019s demands attention not because of its horrible impact on one person but because of the vast numbers it will affect if we don\u2019t find a cure. In this century Alzheimer\u2019s will affect billions of people around the globe when you multiply the tens of millions by the impact on whole families and communities.\n\nThe $604 billion spent on it today, or roughly one percent of global GDP, will in time be dwarfed.\n\nWe\u2019re living 30 years longer on average than people did in the last century \u2013 so the age when Alzheimer\u2019s would have affected just a tiny number of people is long gone. We fail to get this at our peril.\n\nRelated: The Dementia Diagnosis That Took 10 Years\n\nIt was perhaps the clear and articulate portrayal in Still Alice of the genetic impact of Alice\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 on how it might affect her children and grandchildren \u2013 that is the most important aspect of the film. Pondering right now our longevity and what\u2019s at stake for the rest of the population is what makes Alzheimer\u2019s a public issue of great importance today.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Blogs/Age-Reason/2015/03/24/What-Smart-People-Get-Wrong-About-Alzheimer-s", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Rare diseases \u2013 such as Alzheimer\u2019s in anyone under age 60 \u2013 are heart-wrenching and t", "title": "What Smart People Get Wrong About Alzheimer\u2019s"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Blogs/Age-Reason/2015/03/24/What-Smart-People-Get-Wrong-About-Alzheimer-s", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Rare diseases \u2013 such as Alzheimer\u2019s in anyone under age 60 \u2013 are heart-wrenching and t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7271\"", "article_summary": "For one thing, it used a relatively young 50-something as the central character suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 which seemed odd, given that Alzheimer\u2019s is one of the seminal health problems of today\u2019s aging America.\nBut they don\u2019t get vast public attention, unlike communicable diseases such as TB, malaria, Ebola or, more recently, cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\nPondering right now our longevity and what\u2019s at stake for the rest of the population is what makes Alzheimer\u2019s a public issue of great importance today.\nIn this century Alzheimer\u2019s will affect billions of people around the globe when you multiply the tens of millions by the impact on whole families and communities.\nRare diseases \u2013 such as Alzheimer\u2019s in anyone under age 60 \u2013 are heart-wrenching and tragic."}
