Rhone Capital Buys Training Co. Global Knowledge

The move follows training acquisitions from Grace Hill and Bertelsmann

Rhone Capital LLC is buying GK Holdings Inc. from New York private equity firm MidOcean Partners.

GK Holdings, headquartered in Cary, North Carolina, is a corporate training company. The business, which operates as Global Knowledge, provides information technology and business skills training to professionals. The company's users include Cisco, Microsoft and VMWare. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Under MidOcean's ownership, Global Knowledge expanded its technology education partnerships, adding IBM and Amazon Web Services. The firm recently invested in supplements company NutraBolt in July.

Rhone Capital focuses on investing in middle market businesses in the U.S. and Europe. In August, the firm invested in Ranpack Holdings Inc., a packaging company. The firm has offices in New York and London.

Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc. and Kirkland & Ellis LLP advised Global Knowledge on the deal. Credit Suisse, Macquarie and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP advised Rhone.

Several other training companies have been making acquisitions lately. In November, private equity-backed Grace Hill added some of LeaseHawk's training services, and Bertelsmann SE's purchase of U.S. online-course provider Relias Learning in October.
