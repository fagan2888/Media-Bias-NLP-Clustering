Mike Lee, R-Utah, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that congressional Republicans think the president abused the government\u2019s separation of powers by using the executive orders to sidestep Congress and delay the law\u2019s employer mandate.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nHowever, he said critics would be challenged to win in court because Congress lacks the so-called \u201clegal standing\u201d to present the case and they would have a \u201ctough time\u201d finding somebody hurt enough by the delays to be a good plaintiff.\n\n\u201cThe president knows this is wrong,\u201d said Lee, among the most outspoken ObamaCare critics. \u201cWhat gives him the ability to rewrite the law?\u201d\n\nMore On This... Could ObamaCare executive action backfire if GOP wins WH?\n\nLast week the president, for the second time in about seven months, delayed the employer mandate, which requires medium- and large-sized businesses to offer insurance to employers.\n\nThe original Jan. 1, 2014, start for the mandate, which requires businesses with 50 to 99 full-time employees to offer the insurance or face a tax penalty, was delayed in July for one year. On Monday, Obama delayed it until 2016.\n\nRep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., defended the president\u2019s actions Sunday, telling \u201cFox News\u201d that Obama is \u201cmaking sure laws are written and executed\u201d to help Americans.\n\nHe also said that if Obama\u2019s actions \u201cwere against the Constitution somebody would have sued him by now.\u201d\n\nObama has used executive order less than modern U.S. presidents -- 167 times so far, compared to 238 for President Carter and 256 for President Reagan.\n\nStill, Lee called Obama\u2019s actions \u201ca shameless act, a shameless power grab.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 06:19:16 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Washington Republicans on Sunday restated their argument that President Obama has violated the constitution by using executive orders to alter the Affordable Care Act but acknowledged they likely have no recourse or ability to stop another incident.", "twitter": {"description": "Washington Republicans on Sunday restated their argument that President Obama has violated the constitution by using executive orders to alter the Affordable Care Act but acknowledged they likely have no recourse or ability to stop another incident.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/16/republicans-obama-is-violating-constitution-but-little-can-do.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/021714/0/0/021714_otr_gowdy_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Republicans: Obama violating Constitution, but little can be done about it", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Joseph Weber\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Republicans: Obama violating Constitution, but little can be done about it\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/021714/0/0/021714_otr_gowdy_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-16T15:45:53Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/16/republicans-obama-is-violating-constitution-but-little-can-do.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"1ac93742-fd17-4b01-8a7d-2166a970caf6\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Washington Republicans on Sunday restated their argument that President Obama has violated the constitution by using executive orders to alter the Affordable Care Act but acknowledged they likely have no recourse or ability to stop another incident.", "dc.identifier": "1ac93742-fd17-4b01-8a7d-2166a970caf6", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "description": "Washington Republicans on Sunday restated their argument that President Obama has violated the constitution by using executive orders to alter the Affordable Care Act but acknowledged they likely have no recourse or ability to stop another incident.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Republicans: Obama Violating Constitution, But Little Can Be Done About It", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-30 06:19:16 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Washington Republicans on Sunday restated their argument that President Obama has violated the constitution by using executive orders to alter the Affordable Care Act but acknowledged they likely have no recourse or ability to stop another incident.", "title": "Republicans: Obama violating Constitution, but little can be done about it | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/16/republicans-obama-is-violating-constitution-but-little-can-do.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/021714/0/0/021714_otr_gowdy_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-02-16", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Joseph Weber\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Republicans: Obama violating Constitution, but little can be done about it\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/021714/0/0/021714_otr_gowdy_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-16T15:45:53Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/16/republicans-obama-is-violating-constitution-but-little-can-do.html\",\"post_id\":\"1ac93742-fd17-4b01-8a7d-2166a970caf6\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Joseph Weber"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe06\"", "article_summary": "Washington Republicans on Sunday restated their argument that President Obama has violated the Constitution by using executive orders to alter the Affordable Care Act but acknowledged they likely have no recourse or ability to stop another incident.\nOn Monday, Obama delayed it until 2016.\nStill, Lee called Obama\u2019s actions \u201ca shameless act, a shameless power grab.\u201d\nRep.
