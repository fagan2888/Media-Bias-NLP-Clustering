Fox Newsian: Fifty Shades of Grey is a sign of the end times\n\nPastor Robert Jeffress, a paid Fox contributor, went on Alan Colmes\u2019 radio show this week, and thankfully, he didn\u2019t forget to bring the crazy with him. Jeffers is pretty sure there are three telltale signs that Armageddon is coming, including: the gays getting married, \u201cradical Islam\u201d and most logically, Fifty Shades of Grey.\n\nNot that he\u2019s read the book, mind you. But he\u2019s heard things. Dirty things. Quoting scripture (2 Timothy 1), Jeffers says the end of days will be terrible, and by \u201cterrible\u201d he means filled with a \u201clack of moral restraint.\u201d He goes on from there: \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing that everywhere, whether it is the attempt to change the most basic unit of society, the family and marriage by redefinition of marriage, or the acceptance of perversion. You know, this Fifty Shades of Grey, or fifty shades of perversion. I think that\u2019s symptomatic of what is happening.\u201d\n\nAnd he kept going, because it\u2019s awful hard to turn off the loony when it\u2019s on full blast, to compare gay marriage with incest.\n\nJeffers was basically there to promote his new book titled \u2014 what else? \u2014 Countdown to the Apocalypse: Why ISIS and Ebola Are Only the Beginning, which should, at the very least, earn him a medal for cramming the most scary words into a single book title.\n\nWatch the segment in its entirety:\n\n2. Rush Limbaugh makes rape jokes; says liberal American colleges create ISIS members\n\nBloviating asshole and former drug addict Rush Limbaugh took to the airwaves this week to do what he loves, which is basically arguing that rape isn\u2019t a real thing.\n\nLimbaugh kicked things off by complaining about Obama\u2019s anti-domestic violence PSA at the Grammy Awards last Sunday, rhetorically asking if the President mentioned \u201cISIS or Al-Qaeda at all?\u201d You know, because why even open your mouth \u2014 especially if you\u2019re going to be talking about violence \u2014 if you\u2019re not going to find a way to blame it all on Muslims?\n\nHe went on to accuse Obama of \u201cmaking up statistics about the number of women who are sexually assaulted,\u201d and trotted out his own figures, which (suprise!) suggest women are sexually assaulted at far lower rates. In fact, Obama\u2019s stats came from a September 2014 Centers for Disease Controlreport, but never mind that. Let\u2019s instead get our numbers from Limbaugh, because if there\u2019s anything Rush Limbaugh is known for being, it\u2019s trustworthy. (Forward Progressives explains in painstaking detail exactly how wrong Rush\u2019s numbers are, here.)\n\nThen a couple of days ago, Limbaugh doubled down and offered some unsolicited advice to college dropout and probable presidential candidate Scott Walker. When asked why he left school, Limbaugh \u2014 himself a college dropout, so he oughta know \u2014 suggests Walker should respond that he \u201cleft college because [he] didn\u2019t want to be accused of rape someday.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust ram it right down their throats!\u201d said Limbaugh. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to create this \u2018rape culture\u2019 on the campus\u2026it seems like any man who goes to college could randomly be accused of committing rape.\u201d\n\nCan you believe this one is taken, ladies?\n\nWe don\u2019t even have space to get into Limbaugh saying that liberal colleges are essentially driving young American students to join up with ISIS. That\u2019s right: there is literally not enough space here to cover a whole week of Limbaugh crazy. Oh well.
