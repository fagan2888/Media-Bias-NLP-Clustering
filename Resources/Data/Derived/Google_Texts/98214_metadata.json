The highly active minerals react with moisture to release vapors that deer can smell from great distances. That scent draws deer to the supplement site, and once they get a taste, they will keep coming back.\n\nThis is the original mineral attractant that quickly had hunters talking about holes deer were creating from pawing at mineral sites. Deer Cane and Deer Co-Cain are available in a 6.5-pound bag of concentrate mix, a 1-gallon liquid jug and a 4-pound block. All contain the irresistible mineral mixture from Evolved Habitats that will have deer will licking, pawing and literally gnawing at the soil to get the nutrients they crave.\n\nDeer Cane Apple and Deer Cane Sack Attack are the next evolution in mineral attractants from Evolved Habitats. Apple flavoring and UV enhancement put Deer Cane Apple in its own new level of attractant. Apple flavoring enhances the already attractive draw of Deer Cane, and UV technology makes this attractant visible to deer.\n\nEven if the wind is wrong and a deer can\u2019t smell Deer Cane Apple, they see the UV enhancement and come to investigate. Deer Cane Apple is available in a 5-pound bad of concentrate mix and a ready-to-hunt (RTH) spray bottle.\n\nDeer Cane Sack Attack is a time-release mineral attractant that simultaneously emits both a vapor trail and a mineral drip. Simply fill the burlap sack with the included contents, wet it down and hang it from a branch. The Deer Cane Sack Attack will create an irresistible, must-stop mineral site for all of the deer in your area.\n\nSince 1992, Evolved Habitats has helped attract, pattern and hold deer and other wildlife with legendary products that provide nutrients necessary for maximum antler growth and reproductive success.
