Hillary Clinton criticized the way the media covers Donald Trump, claiming that reporters don't ask him enough follow-up questions, as she encouraged voters to pay closer attention to his speeches and policies.

"Donald Trump says he is going to repeal it," Clinton said while talking about Obamacare during a rally in Oakland California on Friday. "Somebody should ask, 'What are you going to replace it with' and if the answer is 'something great,' there should at least be a follow-up question, don't you think?"

This echoes a criticism President Obama has made of the press' treatment of Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee.

Although Clinton has not yet secured the Democratic nomination, she is only 60 delegates short of clinching. She has begun focusing her stump speeches on Trump in preparation for the general election.

"We're getting slogans and one-liners on the other side â€¦ and some of what I'm hearing from Donald Trump is quite concerning," Clinton said as she went on to list off Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants being "rapists" and his proposals that all Muslims who are not U.S. citizens should be barred from entering the country.

"You've got to pay attention to what the Republicans are saying and particularly pay attention to what Trump is saying when it comes to our rights," Clinton said. "We can't continue to allow groups of Americans to be targeted and scapegoated. That is no way to build the future that we want to see."
