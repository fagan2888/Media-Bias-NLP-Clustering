Mr. Ibbott will share tools and best practices from his work with state health programs. He will present successful strategies for helping states understand the cultural and linguistic needs of the Latino community in order to communicate important information and help people navigate the health care system, complete complex forms, locate providers and services, share health history with providers, and become proactive in maintaining their own health. Mr. Ibbott will be joined during the session by Juan Carlos Arroyo, Research Analyst, SRA International, Inc.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act provided access to health insurance coverage for millions of Americans who previously weren\u2019t covered.
