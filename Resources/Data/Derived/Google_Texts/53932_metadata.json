That\u2019s a lot of what people are seeing. In some cases, it might be sewage backing up into homes. In those cases, we\u2019re asking people to evacuate because it\u2019s a health issue.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Colorado police also blocked off a footpath on east campus, north of the Space Science Building, where a broken sewer line was spilling Sunday evening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not near any classrooms or dorms \u2014 it\u2019s an almost rural area of campus,\u201d said CU police spokesman Ryan Huff. \u201cFacilities managers are aware of it.\u201d\n\nBoulder officials are asking residents to report any raw sewage backing up into their homes by calling the Emergency Call Center at 303-413-7730 and asking it to forward the report to Public Works crews.\n\nBoulder is also asking residents to minimize water use, including flushing toilets and discharging anything more into the sewer system.\n\nIn the city of Evans and environs in Weld County, a no-flush order is in effect because floodwaters have damaged the First Avenue Waste Water Treatment Plant. While drinking water is still safe to drink, city officials said, they are asking residents to refrain from all uses of the wastewater system. This means no flushing of toilets, no laundry, no baths or showers, and no washing dishes.\n\nThe city planned to distribute some portable potties to affected areas over the weekend.\n\nFor those interested in their own do-it-yourself sanitation, Public Works officials don\u2019t recommend burying solid waste in your yard. Residents could, however, borrow a page from outdoor enthusiasts who routinely use portable toilet systems.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management advises that toilet systems consist of some type of sturdy, leak-proof container with either a liquid or dry base material designed to reduce odor until the material can be dumped.\n\nSingle-use individual bag products are available \u2014 typically a heavy-duty bag with a seal that contains an odor-neutralizing powder. Such bags can be sent to the landfill.\n\nTo address the system-wide sanitation issues in Boulder, officials said, they must work in low-lying areas first because waste flows downhill to the wastewater treatment plant on 75th Street east of the city. But first floodwaters must recede. In a release Sunday, Public Works said it hopes to see \u201csignificant progress in the next few days.\u201d\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hygiene down the drain as Colorado floodwaters strain wastewater systems", "title": "Hygiene down the drain as Colorado floodwaters strain wastewater systems", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/15/hygiene-down-the-drain-as-colorado-floodwaters-strain-wastewater-systems/", "image": {"width": 816, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915_064034_evanspotties-1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130915_064034_evanspotties-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-15T20:39:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:00:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For those interested in their own do-it-yourself sanitation, Public Works officials don\u2019t recommend burying solid waste in your yard.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing most is it\u2019s floodwaters overwhelming the sanitary sewer system,\u201d said Boulder Public Works spokesman Mike Banuelos.\nIn a release Sunday, Public Works said it hopes to see \u201csignificant progress in the next few days.\u201dElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper\nWhile drinking water is still safe to drink, city officials said, they are asking residents to refrain from all uses of the wastewater system.\nBoulder is also asking residents to minimize water use, including flushing toilets and discharging anything more into the sewer system."}
