He read about silent films, lauded actors, and television personalities. And every now and then between 2004 and 2009, he inserted revisions of his own. At least that's what Wikipedia admin think. The prominent film critic apparently built a presence on the online encyclopedia as the user \"Rebert.\" Though his identity was never confirmed, there's plenty of evidence it was him: \"Rebert\" only linked to Ebert's work and added insight demonstrating expansive film knowledge. Plus, Ebert himself often praised and referenced Wikipedia in his reviews. Now, Netherlands-based Australian artist and documentarian Quenton Miller has traced Ebert's virtual Wiki-tracks and collected all of Ebert's edits into a single print book. The book isn't for sale\u2014Miller only made a single copy for himself. But its 45 pages are full of Ebert's Wikipedia edits presented opposite the original text.\n\n\"I was writing a lot about Wikipedia, and I became very interested in tracking down someone well known who also writes or edits on Wikipedia,\" he says. \"I was intrigued, I was quite surprised at how [the edits] fit into Ebert's work as a film reviewer.\"\n\nCourtesy of Quenton Miller\n\nFor example, Ebert's connection to Chicago\u2014he grew up near the city and spent more than four decades as the film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times\u2014makes his 2008 edit of Gotham City's Wikipedia page especially illuminating. Under a section devoted to representations of Batman's fictional home in film, Ebert's revision (which Miller characterizes as a \"quite nerdy argument\") crackled with pride for his hometown: Of the five feature-length Batman films, only the third, \"Batman Forever,\" (1995) was filmed partly in New York City, with additional locations in California, Oregon and Israel. Of the others, \"Batman\" (1989) was filmed in London. \"Batman Returns\" (1992) was filmed on the back lots and sound stages of Warner Brothers in Burbank. \"Batman and Robin\" (1997) was filmed in California, Texas, Canada, Vermont and Austria. \"Batman Begins\" (2005) was filmed in London, Chicago, Iceland and Waukegan, IL. \"The Dark Knight,\" (2008), the film depending most on exteriors, was filmed entirely on location in Chicago, including recognizable shots using the Sears Tower, the Trump Tower, LaSalle St. and Navy Pier (for the Joker's seemingly fatal joke involving the two boats). Based on the films, Chicago seems to have the best claim as Gotham City, followed by California and London. Of course, not all of Ebert's edits were this extensive. He edited sparingly\u2014totaling just 18 Wikipedia entries\u2014and preferred to pepper the chosen pages with links to his own columns. (Only his final edit, done in 2009, was flagged as a \"possible conflict of interest\" for the self-linking.) One of them, for the Wikipedia page on the \"Inherently funny word,\" noted his own belief that \"turtle\" was, well, an inherently funny word.\n\nCourtesy of Quenton Miller", "article_metadata": {"description": "The late film critic was a fan of the online encyclopedia, allegedly adding notes where he saw fit.", "author": "Shirley Li", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The late film critic was a fan of the online encyclopedia, allegedly adding notes where he saw fit.", "title": "Roger Ebert's Wikipedia [Citation Needed]", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/10/AP617449919995/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/roger-eberts-wikipedia/381239/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0c7\"", "article_summary": "But its 45 pages are full of Ebert's Wikipedia edits presented opposite the original text.\nNow, Netherlands-based Australian artist and documentarian Quenton Miller has traced Ebert's virtual Wiki-tracks and collected all of Ebert's edits into a single print book.\n\"I was intrigued, I was quite surprised at how [the edits] fit into Ebert's work as a film reviewer.\"\nOf course, not all of Ebert's edits were this extensive.\nThough his identity was never confirmed, there's plenty of evidence it was him: \"Rebert\" only linked to Ebert's work and added insight demonstrating expansive film knowledge."}
