But the comments seem to imply that wage stagnation will somehow be \u201cworse\u201d in a world where employers compensate primarily/solely in wages, rather than in a combination of wages and other employee benefits.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that view necessarily holds. After all, the entire transition from defined-benefit plans to defined-contribution plans has already been a form of adjustment in compensation. The declining percentage that employers pay for health insurance\u2013compared with a decade or two ago\u2013is another.\n\nIn other words, for better or worse, the stagnation of wage growth is already present across all compensation and benefits\u2013because from the employer\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s all part of the cost of maintaining employees\u2013but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will be worse in a world more wage-centric and less employee-benefits-centric. In fact, I could also make the case that employees would be able to better negotiate for compensation if part of the negotiations weren\u2019t mired in certain \u201copaque\u201d employee benefits that many employees don\u2019t necessarily know the cost of anyway.\n\nThere are also some questions about the relative differences of these outcomes from a tax perspective. While it\u2019s true that, technically, not all employee benefits and wages are completely \u201cinterchangeable\u201d under the tax code as it stands now, remember that the tax code can\u2013and does\u2013change over time. After all, we didn\u2019t add broad employer deductibility of health insurance until after World War II when companies were already starting to do it and we adjusted the tax code to support it.\n\nSimilarly, we didn\u2019t have a wide range of options for deductible contributions to retirement plans (from 401(k) plans to IRAs)\u2026until we decided to encourage that as a means of savings, and then the tax code was adjusted to fit the policy goal. Which means ultimately, if we decide broadly to continue the trend toward a primarily wage-based world (where employees simply take their wages and purchase their own benefits as desired), there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t adjust the tax code going forward to support those goals.\n\nIn reality, that\u2019s how most provisions in the tax code come about in the first place, and change as our country\u2019s policy goals change.\n\nMichael Kitces is a partner and the director of research for Pinnacle Advisory Group, and publisher of the financial planning industry blog Nerd\u2019s Eye View.
