Former state and federal transportation official Jane Garvey and Braintree Mayor Joe Sullivan, who also played a major role in transportation policy during his days as a state representative, have been working with the former head of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority Katherine Lapp and others to come up with ideas to make the transit system more reliable for the millions who count on its services. When the task force was named Feb. 20, Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack said, \"The problems that have beset the MBTA and made it unable to provide reliable public transportation services for the last few weeks are of course a serious problem. But we also see them of symptoms of an even more serious problem. This panel has been asked to address the larger problem - not the immediate cause of what happened this winter, but the deeper causes, the root causes of what occurred.\" Gov. Charlie Baker has discouraged the push by some for new taxes to help solve the MBTA's problems, arguing management solutions may be just as effective. The task force's recommendations will be watched closely for their balance between reforms and revenues.\n\nThe budget battle\n\nThe report should arrive in time for House leaders to give it consideration as they redraft Baker's $38.1 billion fiscal 2016 budget. The House Ways and Means Committee plans to release its budget on April 15 with the full House considering it during what will likely be lengthy sessions the week of April 27. Members of the House and Senate Ways and Means committees are in the midst of budget hearings and plan to meet Tuesday in Medford and Thursday in Springfield to hear from Baker aides about health and human services priorities, including veterans services, public assistance, elder affairs and the Department of Children and Families. The final budget hearing is set for the State House on Monday, April 13.\n\nAfter drafting a $36.5 billion fiscal 2015 state budget that quickly careened out of balance, Democratic legislative leaders have largely assented to Baker's wishes on budget matters. In place of that traditional battleground, they've found ample room for disagreement over more basic matters. Instead of Democrats dueling with the new Republican governor, they are in conflict with each other over the flow of bills. New Senate President Stanley Rosenberg has opted to take up the fight with the House, saying the Senate can't even access its own bills for floor debates, and calling for more equality in the joint committee process. The procedural fight, which is formally before a six-member conference committee, appears to have contributed to the slow start to the 2015-2016 session - with three months gone by bills are still getting numbers and being assigned to committees and public hearings have not yet begun in any concentrated fashion.\n\nOther developing storylines in the week ahead:\n\n-- The House has the next move on the budget but the new leader of the Senate, Stanley Rosenberg, has center stage Wednesday for a potentially newsmaking address to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. The chamber this week chose Jim Rooney to succeed Paul Guzzi as its president, which will open up the top job at the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority at a time when there's a push to advance a $1 billion expansion of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.\n\n-- The House and Senate could wrap up work on a $200 million local road repair bond bill and send that legislation to Gov. Baker's desk. The bill needs a recorded vote, with two thirds support in each chamber, to be enacted. That should not be a problem as the legislation enjoys strong support from lawmakers who are hearing calls from local officials about the need for repair funds to be delivered soon now that the weather has warmed up.\n\nSUNDAY, APRIL 5, 2015\n\nKEATING 'ON THE RECORD': U.S. Rep.
