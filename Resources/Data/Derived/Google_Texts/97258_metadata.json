Government surveys show that the average SNAP recipient drinks the equivalent of a little more than a can of soda a day.\n\nStanford researchers used two data sets, one on diet and another on price data for food, and then used simulations to estimate the effect of a ban on using SNAP funds to buy sugary beverages, including sodas and sports drinks, but excluding 100 percent fruit juices.\n\nOver a 10-year period, the simulation indicated that such a ban would amount to a 2.4 percent drop in obesity prevalence and a 1.7 percent decline in Type 2 diabetes among SNAP recipients.\n\nWhile those percentage changes sound small, lead author Dr. Sanjay Basu, a professor of medicine at Stanford, says the real impact across a population would be impressive.\n\n\u201cThis shift in policy would be preventing around 400,000 cases of obesity in the next decade and nearly 250,000 cases of Type 2 diabetes,\u201d Basu said.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Health Affairs.\n\nThe American Beverage Association criticized the idea of a ban. In a statement, the group said a ban would be an \u201cexpensive and unnecessary restriction that (has) negligible benefits.\u201d The association called instead for heath education and healthy incentives.\n\nBut Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy, was intrigued by the analysis. \u201cI look at these federal dollars as a subsidy to Coke and Pepsi,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s a strategy that could have a significant impact on low-income folks who have among the highest diabetes rates in the country.\u201d Goldstein was not involved in the research.\n\nAnother federal program, Women, Infants and Children, already does not allow the purchase of sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\nThe researchers also looked at the impact of giving 30 cents back to SNAP participants for each dollar they might spend on fruits and vegetables. While such a reward doubled the number of people eating the recommended requirements of fruits and vegetables, obesity and diabetes indicators \u201cdid not improve considerably,\u201d Basu said.\n\nLast June, a bipartisan group of mayors sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi advocating improvements to the SNAP program, saying it was time to consider limiting subsidies for sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\nMonday\u2019s study comes against a backdrop of renewed calls in California cities for a soda tax \u2014 and just days after the California Senate passed a bill that would require a health warning label on sodas and other sugary beverages.\n\nDoctors and other public health professionals are growing increasingly concerned about the health impact of sugary beverages, or what Goldstein referred to as \u201cliquid sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that there is overwhelming science that the liquid sugar in these beverages is a unique driver in today\u2019s skyrocketing obesity epidemic,\u201d he said.\n\nThis post has been updated to clarify the American Beverage Association\u2019s opposition to a policy on banning food stamps for purchase of sugar-sweetened beverages.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Banning food stamps for sugary drinks could reduce obesity, Type 2 diabetes rates, says Stanford study.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Should There Be a Ban on Using Food Stamps to Buy Soda?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/02\\/stanford-study-should-there-be-a-ban-on-food-stamps-to-buy-soda\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-02 17:25:49\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-04 09:32:35\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19324,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Diabetes\",\"Obesity\",\"Science\",\"Sugar-Sweetend Beverage\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/02\\/RS7242_136799870-1-hpf.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Banning food stamps for sugary drinks could reduce obesity, Type 2 diabetes rates, says Stanford study.", "title": "Should There Be a Ban on Using Food Stamps to Buy Soda?", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/02/stanford-study-should-there-be-a-ban-on-food-stamps-to-buy-soda/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/02/RS7242_136799870-1-hpf.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "diabetes,obesity,science,sugar-sweetend beverage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc88\"", "article_summary": "Should There Be a Ban on Using Food Stamps to Buy Soda?\nThis post has been updated to clarify the American Beverage Association\u2019s opposition to a policy on banning food stamps for purchase of sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\u2018Shift in policy could prevent 400,000 cases of obesity.\u2019About one in seven Americans \u2014 more than 46 million people \u2014 currently receive food stamps, now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\nBanning the use of food stamps to purchase sodas and other sugary drinks could reduce both obesity and Type 2 diabetes rates, according to new research from the Stanford University School of Medicine.\nGovernment surveys show that the average SNAP recipient drinks the equivalent of a little more than a can of soda a day."}
