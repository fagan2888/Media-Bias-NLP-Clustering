The FDA allowed compounders to manufacture and ship some medicines on a wide scale, absent the agency\u2019s usual oversight, simply because compounded drugs could be sold more cheaply. One of those firms was the New England Compounding Center (NECC). In 2012 one of NECC\u2019s drugs became tainted, killing 64 Americans and sickening 800 others.\n\nDrug compounding was supposed to be confined to pharmacies that made specialized drugs for individual patients. Companies like NECC used the guise of a pharmacy license to operate as large-scale drug manufacturers, but absent the traditional FDA oversight. The episode instigated the passage of the Drug Quality and Security Act in 2013, a law designed to close these loopholes. Mr. Baum advocates the re-extension of a dual market\u2014one for approved generics and one for widely marketed compounded drugs to compete with them. Under his construct, the FDA would oversee the compounded drugs for their manufacturing, but not confirm their effectiveness and safety as it is required to do for the generic medicines.\n\nTo address high costs without creating new patient risks, the FDA can take steps to reduce the 50 months it takes for a generic drug to win approval or the 18 months it takes to prepare a generic application. Mr. Baum\u2019s framework would undermine our generic drug model, without fixing the regulatory woes that are the real culprit in reducing generic drug competition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drug compounding was supposed to be confined to pharmacies that made specialized drugs for individual patients.", "og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "Drug compounding was supposed to be confined to pharmacies that made specialized drugs for individual patients.", "title": "Compounding labs: No answer for high prices - AEI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/compunding_labs_medicine_research_laboratory_2020_500x293.jpg", "url": "http://www.aei.org/publication/compounding-labs-no-answer-for-high-prices/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before 2012, the Food and Drug Administration reluctantly embraced the basic framework advocated by Mark Baum (\u201cA New Prescription for Lower Drug Prices,\u201d op-ed, Jan. 26).
