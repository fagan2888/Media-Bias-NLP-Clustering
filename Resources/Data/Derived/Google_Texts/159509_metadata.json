A lost superstar, a host of players in return, and a chesty declaration that no, it in fact was not the end but a new beginning.\n\nAnd, secretly, a pit in their stomachs knowing they are anything but in total control.\n\nThese deals are never easy for the team losing the franchise player. The Nuggets are well-versed in that. Carmelo Anthony\u2019s trade to the New York Knicks in 2011 changed the course of everything the Nuggets were then known to be. And it will play out that way in Minnesota, as well, after its trade of prolific power forward Kevin Love to the Cavaliers.\n\nBut the similarities end there.\n\nThe Nuggets got younger with the trade, but not as young as the Timberwolves just did. Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton and Timofey Mozgov had all played pro ball extensively \u2014 in the NBA or overseas \u2014 before coming to Denver. Only Thaddeus Young has for the Timberwolves.\n\nThen Nuggets coach George Karl was innovative enough to not just make losing one of the league\u2019s most feared scorers (Anthony) and most respected leaders (Chauncey Billups) work anyway, but did so without hitting so much as a speed bump. They went 18-7 after the trade, and two seasons later \u2013 with a couple of roster tweaks \u2013 won 57 games, rising to third in the Western Conference.\n\nThough Minnesota got the single best player (Wiggins) in comparison to the Nuggets\u2019 deal, it is in for much rockier times before things get better. It is highly doubtful that they finish with a winning record this season. It is highly doubtful that, as great as Wiggins may turn out to be, in two seasons Minnesota will win 57 games.\n\nAnd on top of all of that, they are on the clock \u2013 again.\n\nThe current collective bargaining agreement, carefully crafted to help level the playing field between the haves and have-nots, assumed players were robots. It assumed that once the opportunity to make max money came along, players would automatically take it, thereby giving the small- or medium-market team the clear advantage in retaining them as free agents.\n\nIt\u2019s not turning out that way.\n\nMinnesota will survive Wiggins\u2019 rookie-scale contract, which only makes the player a restricted free agent at its end. He\u2019ll then get max dollars. The second contract is the frightening one. That\u2019s the one Love used to force his way out of Minnesota. It\u2019s the one that expired and allowed LeBron James to go to Miami all those years ago. It\u2019s the one Anthony was on when he forced his way out of Denver.\n\nThe new \u201cgoing home\u201d phenomenon and the slightly older one of taking less money for fewer years to get more money later in a city they want to be still stack the decks against the Minnesotas and Denvers of the league. Even when players are woven into the fabric of their new community, and even if they like it there, they are starting to have no problem leaving it behind.\n\nIn 2006, after signing a five-year, $80 million deal, Anthony crowed: \u201cThis is where I want to be. The whole state has embraced me.\u201d Five years later, he\u2019d give the Nuggets a directive to trade him or lose him for nothing in free agency.\n\nThings can change that quickly.\n\nMinnesota can only win if it figures out a solution to that issue, where it could not the first time with Love, and where the Nuggets couldn\u2019t with Anthony. Lessons learned from that can be applied to a better strategy for the future.\n\nComparing the Deals Carmelo Anthony Trade (2011) Kevin Love Trade (2014) Denver Got Cleveland Got SF Danilo Gallinari PF Kevin Love SF Wilson Chandler Minnesota Got PG Raymond Felton SF Andrew Wiggins C Timofey Mozgov SF Andrew Bennett C Kosta Koufos PF Thaddeus Young New York\u2019s 2012 second-round pick $6.3 million trade exception New York\u2019s 2013 second-round pick Philadelphia Got New York\u2019s 2014 first-round pick SG Alexey Shved Right to swap Knicks 2016 first-round pick F Luc Mbah a Moute $3 million cash Miami\u2019s 2015 first-round pick (protected) New York Got SF Carmelo Anthony G Chauncey Billups PF Shelden Williams PG Anthony Carter F Renaldo Balkman SG Corey Brewer Minnesota Got PF Anthony Randolph C Eddy Curry Denver\u2019s 2015 second-round pick $3 million cash\n\n.tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}.tg .tg-m7vj{font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;font-family:Georgia, serif !important;;background-color:#3166ff;color:#ffffff;text-align:center}.tg .tg-ls8f{font-family:Georgia, serif !important;}.tg .tg-utv3{font-weight:bold;font-family:Georgia, serif !important;;background-color:#f8a102}.tg .tg-asmn{font-weight:bold;font-size:18px;text-align:center}.tg .tg-5b7i{font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;font-family:Georgia, serif !important;;background-color:#bbdaff;color:#ffffff;text-align:center}.tg .tg-hhon{font-family:Georgia, serif !important;;background-color:#bbdaff}\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Who fared better in trade of stars: Timberwolves or Nuggets?", "title": "Who fared better in trade of stars: Timberwolves or Nuggets?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/25/who-fared-better-in-trade-of-stars-timberwolves-or-nuggets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825__melo-lovep1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140825__melo-lovep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-25T15:57:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:33:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI am truly excited to welcome Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett and Thaddeus Young to our team,\u201d Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor said.\nThe Nuggets got younger with the trade, but not as young as the Timberwolves just did.\n\u201cAdding these young players, along with our No.\n1 pick from this year, Zach LaVine, to our existing squad gives us a solid nucleus for the future.\u201dThe Nuggets have been there.\nCarmelo Anthony\u2019s trade to the New York Knicks in 2011 changed the course of everything the Nuggets were then known to be."}
