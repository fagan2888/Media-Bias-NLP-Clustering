Cruz opposes budget deal\n\nTed Cruz broke days of silence on the bipartisan budget agreement Thursday, releasing a highly critical statement shortly before the House was set to vote on it.\n\nThe Texas Republican senator said that he can\u2019t support legislation forged by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) because it \u201cmoves in the wrong direction.\u201d One of his main problems with the agreement: it will fund President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz\u2019s fight to defund Obamacare triggered an impasse between the House and Senate, leading to a 16-day government shutdown in October.\n\n( PHOTOS: 18 times the government has shut down)\n\n\u201cIt spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis proposal undoes the sequester\u2019s modest reforms and pushes us two steps back, deeper into debt. Supporters of this plan are asking for more spending now in exchange for minor changes that may possibly reduce spending later.
