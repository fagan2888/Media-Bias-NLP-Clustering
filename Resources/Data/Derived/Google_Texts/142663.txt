Custer, SD

A record crowd of about 21,000 visitors attended the 50th annual Buffalo Roundup in Custer State Park.



Friday's roundup featured horseback riders joined by all-terrain vehicles and pickup trucks gathering some 1,300 bison into corrals. The buffalo are branded and given vaccinations, and then the herd is culled, or reduced, to about 900 that will be released back onto the park to roam free for another year. The rest are sold at auction.



The park's Craig Pugsley says the buffalo is kind of the iconic image of the west. He says visitors can feel the ground rumble, and the dust flies in a spiritual way.



James and Maria Sanders say the event gave a small impression of what the original settlers saw on the plains.
