Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930\u2019s. So, let\u2019s not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it\u2019s Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what\u2019s best for the American people.\n\nHillary is absolutely right. And in my view, she let Bernie off the hook. She could have asked him a simple question: Does he believe President Obama is corrupt because of financial industry contributions?\n\nIt\u2019s a yes or no question that is central to the 2016 race. Does Bernie think President Obama is compromised by Wall Street contributions? If so, he should have the courage to say it. If not, he shouldn\u2019t imply that a female candidate would be influenced by donations or speaking fees. There\u2019s a word for that.\n\nThe endless drumbeat that Hillary is dishonest is now driven directly from the top of Bernie\u2019s campaign. The candidate doesn\u2019t say it in so many words, but the inference is crystal clear. It is an \u201cartful smear\u201d where any mention of the \u201cestablishment\u201d or Wall Street is a Pavlovian trigger designed to impugn Hillary\u2019s character. The Wall Street Dog Whistle.\n\nNo matter how lofty and inspiring Bernie\u2019s message, no matter how much he motivates younger voters, it is deeply unjust \u2013 and frankly, reckless \u2013 to run a campaign premised on the destruction of Hillary\u2019s character through false innuendo. And make no mistake, Bernie\u2019s campaign message and the behavior of his supporters have become less about something and more against someone. His path to victory runs right through Hillary\u2019s integrity. It\u2019s a regrettable turn of events in an election where Bernie had initially vowed to stay positive and issue-driven.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the Bernie/Obama relationship further. What is Bernie\u2019s true posture toward the President?\n\nSpeaking as a progressive who has been critical of American drone policy and of some aspects of the extension of Bush\u2019s transgressions on civil liberties (such as indefinite detention), I can understand the progressive critique of President Obama. Indeed I was an early and vocal critic. But there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the President has done a tremendous job of moving the progressive agenda forward in the face of an intransigent Republican Party. His signature accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act, is a monumental achievement, and something Hillary worked on decades before.\n\nBernie stated during the debate that he and President Obama were friends:\n\nAs you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re-election. His first election and his re-election. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have.\n\nIs that the full story? To bolster Hillary\u2019s assertions that Bernie has positioned himself in opposition to the President\u2019s legacy, her campaign released an extensive fact-sheet to the media listing the following proof points:\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to draw a clear inference from all this: any voter who wants to preserve and extend President Obama\u2019s signature accomplishments should vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnd one last thing: that Bill Press book Bernie promoted? The publisher\u2019s mission is to \u201cprovide a forum for the creative people, bedrock principles, and innovative ideas of contemporary conservatism and to chronicle the historic reforms those people and principles would bring.\u201d\n\nTheir other authors: Donald Trump.
