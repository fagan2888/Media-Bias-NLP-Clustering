The fire is now 90 percent contained. ( Stephen Lam/KQED )\n\nEditor\u2019s note: For Lake County veterans who fought in Vietnam, the sights and sounds of the Valley Fire two weeks ago immediately stirred images of burning napalm and exploding grenades. As part of our Vital Signs series, reporter April Dembosky interviewed Vietnam veteran Jack Reece. He shares his story, starting with his view of the fire \u2014 just before he fled his home in Hidden Valley. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was up there on that hillside watching that fire come off of Cobb [in Lake County] and then down and into the valley.\n\nIt was like a unit moving forward with tanks and everything, and those canisters, those propane canisters going off, they make a \u201cwhooooo\u2026 boom!\u201d\n\nI tried to stay there as long as I could, and then I had to drive out through a firestorm. All those houses were on fire and I had to drive through it, about 150 yards. It tripped me, the flashes.\n\nIt all flashed back.\n\nI mean, watching people get hit with napalm. Taking a hill and having little children dropping grenades down these things. You run up to them and kill them all \u2014 and find out they\u2019re children. It\u2019s horrible. You don\u2019t want to know. I was a squad leader and a hit man.\n\nMy whole f***ing leg got blown apart. All the way up to here. And then I got a concussion. I was in a coma for three days.\n\nNinety-six of us went over in our unit, and only 14 of us came back.\n\nAs soon as you go through an experience like that again, you start hearing people screaming and yelling. I don\u2019t need that in my life and so, I self medicated. Night before last \u2014 I like gin and tonic, and I can just, run \u2019em through. It was okay, for just that night, because I couldn\u2019t get any meds \u2014 because my meds were up the house.\n\nMonday morning, I knew I had to, I knew it. I got my ass over there and got to see the psychiatrist, and she took care of me.\n\nBecause with vets, we\u2019re never going to get over it, honey. Never. But, we can learn to manage it. When we realize we\u2019re at those points where we go and we need help and we ask for it. Most guys don\u2019t know that. They freak out on it.\n\nAnyway. I\u2019m so fortunate. I think the guys upstairs, whoever\u2019s watching over, they have to do double time with me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"All those houses were on fire and I had to drive through it.
