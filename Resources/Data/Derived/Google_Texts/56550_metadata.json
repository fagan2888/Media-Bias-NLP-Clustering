The 87-year old Democrat and dean of the House of Representatives was first elected in 1955, and is the longest-serving member at 58 years last year. He was first elected at the age of 29.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle paid tribute to the Michigan representative\u2019s historic career. \u201cCongressman Dingell is a living legend and one of the most prominent and accomplished lawmakers in American history and it has been a great honor to serve beside him,\u201d said Rep. Frank Pallone (D\u2014N.J.). \u201cFrom Medicare, to the Affordable Care Act, to the Clean Air Act, Congressman Dingell\u2019s work endures and continues to improve people\u2019s lives every day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBy any standard, he will not only be viewed as the \u2018Dean of the House,\u2019 but also one with an incredible record of getting the job done,\u201d said Rep. Fred Upton (R\u2014MI). \u201cThe term \u2018legendary\u2019 will always be associated with the name \u2018John Dingell.'\u201d\n\nThe retiring congressman\u2019s wife, Deborah, is considered a possible candidate for his congressional seat.\n\nIn 2009, TIME asked Dingell, who was representing Michigan\u2019s 15th district at the time, whether he would run for Congress in 2010.\n\n\u201cWhen that time comes, Deborah and I sit down and we decide what the people of the 15th want, we decide what the good Lord wants, and then we decide what we want,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a decision I make every two years, and I don\u2019t make it before the right time.\u201d\n\nHe did run again\u2014twice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "87-year-old Democrat John Dingle, who has represented Michigan since 1955, announced on Monday that he is retiring", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "87-year-old Democrat John Dingle, who has represented Michigan since 1955, announced on Monday that he is retiring", "title": "Longest-Serving Congressman John Dingell Is Retiring", "url": "http://time.com/9277/longest-serving-congressman-john-dingell-is-retiring/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/johndingell.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/johndingell.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "87-year-old Democrat John Dingle, who has represented Michigan since 1955, announced on Monday that he is retiring", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Longest-Serving Congressman John Dingell Is Retiring"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "congress, john dingell, longest-serving congressman, michigan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "congress, john dingell, longest-serving congressman, michigan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc85b\"", "article_summary": "Congressman John Dingell of Michigan, the longest-serving member of Congress, is retiring.\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle paid tribute to the Michigan representative\u2019s historic career.\nThe 87-year old Democrat and dean of the House of Representatives was first elected in 1955, and is the longest-serving member at 58 years last year.\n\u201cCongressman Dingell is a living legend and one of the most prominent and accomplished lawmakers in American history and it has been a great honor to serve beside him,\u201d said Rep.
