And that means more sitting. Do not give in. Here, two more reports underscore the perils of sitting, one from the U.K. and one out of New York City.\n\nIn the U.K., sedentary behavior \u201cnow occupies around 60% of people\u2019s total waking hours in the general population, and over 70% in those with a high risk of chronic disease. For those working in offices, 65\u201375% of their working hours are spent sitting,\u201d according a new study published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n\nTo try to get workers off their bums, public health experts issued a consensus statement urging periodic stand-up breaks during the day.\n\nAccording to the panel backing the new recommendations:\n\n\u2026for those occupations which are predominantly desk-based, workers should aim to initially progress towards accumulating 2 hours a day of standing and light activity (light walking) during working hours, eventually progressing to a total accumulation of 4 hours a day\u2026 To achieve this, seated-based work should be regularly broken up with standing-based work, the use of sit\u2013stand desks, or the taking of short active standing breaks. Along with other health promotion goals (improved nutrition, reducing alcohol, smoking and stress), companies should also promote among their staff that prolonged sitting, aggregated from work and in leisure time, may significantly and independently increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases and premature mortality.\n\nEven New Yorkers, who live in one of the best walking cities on the planet, are sitting far longer than what\u2019s considered healthy, according to a new study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and researchers at New York University, published in the journal Preventing Chronic Disease.\n\nResearchers found great differences among various demographics \u2014 surprisingly, higher income folks spent more time sitting compared to those with lower incomes.\n\nAmong the findings, detailed in a news release:\n\n\u2022At the lower economic end, individuals spent 6.3 hours per day sitting, while those with higher incomes spent 8.2 hours per day sitting \u2022College graduates spent 8.2 hours per day sitting, compared with 5.5 hours per day for those with less than a high school education \u2022Whites spent on average 7.8 hours per day sitting, African Americans spent 7.4 hours sitting, Hispanics spent 5.4 hours sitting, and Asian Americans spent 7.9 hours per day sitting \u2022Sitting time was highest in Manhattan, compared to other boroughs\u2026 Sitting time is linked to death from heart disease and other causes, with life expectancy increasing by two years if adults reduced their sitting time to three hours per day. Individuals who exercise regularly but are still sedentary for several hours a day may be at greater risk for adverse health outcomes than their physical activity levels might suggest.\n\nWe\u2019ve written frequently about the bad health outcomes of sitting. And while sitting may not quite be the new smoking, as some suggest, it\u2019s worth recalling the wisdom of Dr. Eddie Phillips, director of the Institute of Lifestyle Medicine in Boston, who says that sitting is a \u201cdisease state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two more reports that underscore the perils of sitting, one from the UK and one out of New York City.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Two more reports that underscore the perils of sitting, one from the UK and one out of New York City.", "title": "Why To Exercise Today: Because It\u2019s Not Sitting", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/06/why-to-exercise-today-not-sitting", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/06/sitting1-620x465.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/06/why-to-exercise-today-not-sitting", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/06/sitting1-620x465.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Why To Exercise Today: Because It's Not Sitting"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-02", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Tue, 02 Jun 2015 19:29:17 -0400"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b9d\"", "article_summary": "Among the findings, detailed in a news release:\u2022At the lower economic end, individuals spent 6.3 hours per day sitting, while those with higher incomes spent 8.2 hours per day sitting \u2022College graduates spent 8.2 hours per day sitting, compared with 5.5 hours per day for those with less than a high school education \u2022Whites spent on average 7.8 hours per day sitting, African Americans spent 7.4 hours sitting, Hispanics spent 5.4 hours sitting, and Asian Americans spent 7.9 hours per day sitting \u2022Sitting time was highest in Manhattan, compared to other boroughs\u2026 Sitting time is linked to death from heart disease and other causes, with life expectancy increasing by two years if adults reduced their sitting time to three hours per day.\nWhy To Exercise Today: Because It\u2019s Not SittingIf you\u2019re like me, this bout of November weather in June provides yet another excuse to ratchet back your exercise regime.\nFor those working in offices, 65\u201375% of their working hours are spent sitting,\u201d according a new study published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\nHere, two more reports underscore the perils of sitting, one from the U.K. and one out of New York City.\nResearchers found great differences among various demographics \u2014 surprisingly, higher income folks spent more time sitting compared to those with lower incomes."}
