Burwell, involved seven Christian groups demanding full exemption from the requirement to provide insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe latest challenge to the health care law was led by The Little Sisters of the Poor charity, which argued against the option to opt-out of the so-called contraception mandate, which requires groups to notify the government of their objections.\n\nThe Supreme Court met for a fourth encounter with President Obama's health care law https://t.co/lqlKYNQa6Dpic.twitter.com/3Kg7fna9No \u2014 NYT Politics (@nytpolitics) March 23, 2016\n\nThe Little Sisters and others argued that taking any action to comply with that requirement, even those as simple as completing form or writing a letter, went against their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cIn reality, it\u2019s an opt-in, a permission slip,\u201d Sister Constance Veit from Little Sisters of the Poor told the Associated Press.\n\nSister Constance said that the only alternative is to pay a big fine, which would amount to much as $70 million a year in the Little Sisters\u2019 case, according to USA Today.\n\nWashington lawyer Paul Clement, who represented the charity, said the government would not allow the group to be \u201cconscientious objectors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government insists they be conscientious collaborators,\u201d Clement said in his closing argument, according to AP.\n\nSupreme Court tosses out lower court ruling on stun gun possession https://t.co/yGOoQmsCEDpic.twitter.com/UomgHNqmK0 \u2014 RT America (@RT_America) March 22, 2016\n\nThe court\u2019s four liberals seemed supportive of the Obama Administration\u2019s position. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the liberal justices, said that the administration\u2019s accommodation insulated the religious groups, while wondering \u201chow will we ever have a government that functions\u201d if everyone felt laws violated their beliefs.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, on the conservative side, expressed doubts.\n\nHe told the Justice Department\u2019s lawyer that it sounded as if the challengers were right in their allegation that the government was \u201chijacking\u201d their insurance plans to provide contraceptive coverage, rather than finding a way to provide the coverage without involving the groups at all.\n\nChief Justice John G.

Burwell case of 2014, when it split along ideological lines. In the 5-4 ruling, the court found that the chain of craft stores and other companies must be exempt from the mandate to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees.\n\nThat decision was reached when the court still included Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in mid-February. Since his death, if the eight remaining justices deadlock, the law could be administered differently depending on which court district objecting organizations and their employees are located in.
