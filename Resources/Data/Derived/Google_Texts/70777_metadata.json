His dissenting opinion in King v. Burwell, a ruling on a clause in the Affordable Care Act, referred to the majority\u2019s reasoning as both \u201cjiggery-pokery\u201d and \u201cpure applesauce.\u201d His objection, he wrote, was that the majority relied on an interpretation of the legislative intent behind the law, instead of relying on the text of the law itself. As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the Court\u2019s opinion, \u201cIt is implausible that Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner,\u201d to which Scalia replied, in brief, \u201cWords no longer have meaning.\u201d\n\nScalia was in the minority in this opinion, but on Friday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the former Acting Solicitor General of the United States, Neal Katyal, said the justice has actually largely won over the Court on the question of statutory interpretation.\n\nJustice Scalia has this view that when Congress passes a law, you read the text of the law, but you don\u2019t read all the legislative history around it. Why? He says that\u2019s often doctored, it\u2019s advocates trying to get their particular views in committee reports. He has won that debate. He has persuaded a majority of the Court to do that.\n\nDispatches from the Aspen Ideas Festival/Spotlight Health\n\nRead More\n\nThis position is widely debated within the legal community, and it\u2019s it\u2019s likely that other Court-watchers have a different interpretation of Scalia\u2019s degree of influence. Katyal also argued that Scalia ended up in the minority in King and other recent decisions because he is urging the other justices to ignore both the legislative history and intent behind laws. Legislative history includes all documents that were produced by Congress during the process of a bill becoming a law. Intent is the meaning and effect that legislators presumably wanted a law to have when they were writing it. Here\u2019s Katyal again:\n\nNow, he\u2019s gone further, though, saying, \u201cJust read the text, don\u2019t try to understand the purpose behind the text.\u201d That\u2019s a losing argument. So we\u2019re seeing sometimes Justice Scalia overplaying his hand and reaching results that aren\u2019t going to command a majority of the Court.\n\nFor an Obama-appointed government official, Katyal sang the Reagan-appointed justice\u2019s praises pretty sweetly. \u201cJustice Scalia is brilliant,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of President Reagan\u2019s greatest legacies will be Justice Scalia. He\u2019s changed the game in so many areas.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The justice has redefined how the Supreme Court interprets statutes, a former Acting Solicitor General of the United States says.", "author": "Emma Green", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The justice has redefined how the Supreme Court interprets statutes, a former Acting Solicitor General of the United States says.", "title": "The Lasting Legacy of Antonin Scalia?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/07/RTR1IJM7/facebook.jpg?1435968707", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/lasting-legacy-antonin-scalia/397712/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOne of President Reagan\u2019s greatest legacies will be Justice Scalia.\nSo we\u2019re seeing sometimes Justice Scalia overplaying his hand and reaching results that aren\u2019t going to command a majority of the Court.\n\u201cJustice Scalia is brilliant,\u201d he said.\nJustice Scalia has this view that when Congress passes a law, you read the text of the law, but you don\u2019t read all the legislative history around it.\nIn the latest round of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, the country got a doozy\u2019s worth of linguistic throwdowns from Antonin Scalia, the Court\u2019s longest-serving and possibly most-crotchety justice."}
