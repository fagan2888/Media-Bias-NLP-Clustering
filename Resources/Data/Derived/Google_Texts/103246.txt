The 2016 presidential election is still quite a ways away, but it looks like Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has got the inside track when it comes to securing that most coveted of endorsements — that of “700 Club” host and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson.

During Monday’s edition of his seemingly never-ending show, Robertson introduced a short profile of Jindal by noting his “Indian background” as well as his rumored interest in running for president.

Once the segment — a complete puff piece that featured Jindal spouting right-wing pablum about religious liberty under “assault” and the world-historic awesomeness of the United States — was completed, Robertson continued to speak positively of Jindal, describing the seriously unpopular governor as “an amazing man.”
