Despite declining or stagnant inpatient rates, hospital systems here made quite a bit of money in 2013. They recorded $1.998 billion in net patient revenue, less than the $2.034 billion in 2012, but still good enough for a 12.1 percent margin.\n\nHouston hospitals logged an 11.1 percent margin for net patient revenue in 2013, bringing in $1.98 billion. In Houston, there\u2019s more risk sharing between insurance plans and providers, Baumgarten says. Kelsey-Seybold, for instance, has a longstanding history of providing care alongside insurance plans like Aetna and Prudential, which came into town in the 1980s looking to partner with a local provider group to offer Medicare Risk plans.\n\nThese partnerships acted like early accountable care organizations (ACOs)\u2014or maybe an ACO is just a later form of risk sharing, Baumgarten joked\u2014and provided incentives for keeping patients out of hospital beds. North Texas, meanwhile, is beginning to shift into this fee-for-value model, away from the volume-based care that proliferated around the area pre-Affordable Care Act. It also lacked large specialty providers like Kelsey, which stood apart from the larger hospital systems.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line, in Houston, I do think that because they\u2019ve moved toward a fee-for-value type arrangement to a grater extent, that their revenues and income are more modest than in Dallas/Fort Worth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just moving that way today.\u201d\n\nHouston and Dallas could wind up being closer in the future than they are today. Baumgarten looks to Ohio, where the Cleveland Clinic and five other health systems teamed to form a strategic affiliation to share best practices and drive down costs. They\u2019re also looking into offering a statewide network of providers, which would be especially appealing to large employers who have a presence in multiple markets.\n\nThe big providers in Texas could soon come together much in the same way\u2014appealing for them because it could help lower costs, appealing for purchasers because it could give its employees access to the market leaders in Texas\u2019 largest cities.\n\n\u201cMore and more you have provider systems moving in the direction of forming statewide networks,\u201d Baumgarten says. \u201cNot mergers or acquisitions, but partnerships, so they can form a statewide network or as close to a statewide network that they could offer to employer groups as a preferred provider network.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "D Healthcare Daily", "description": "Dallas hospital systems are slightly more profitable\u2014both in net revenue and margin\u2014than their Houston counterparts, although the reason why may be because of the\u00a0southernmost mecca\u2019s long-standing prominence of specialty clinic groups like Kelsey Seybold.
