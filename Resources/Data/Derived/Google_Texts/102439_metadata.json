Many pundits are saying so, but their reasoning takes us to a place where everyone\u2019s lives would be worse.\n\nThe signs were there: ISIS-pledged Islamic radicals Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik appeared to be plotting something, but at least one person says he was afraid to speak up for fear of being labelled an anti-Muslim bigot. National Review\u2019s David French opined that this shows us the high cost of political correctness:\n\nAs my wife points out over at Patheos, this is \u201cClock Boy\u201d thinking. \u201cIf you see something, say something\u201d has been transformed into \u201cif you see something \u2014 especially suspicious Middle Easterners \u2014 say nothing.\u201d Otherwise you might be the focus of a social-media shame-storm and a multi-million-dollar lawsuit. In this case, saying nothing meant the authorities didn\u2019t discover Syed Farook\u2019s home-based \u201cIED factory\u201d until after 14 Americans were dead and 17 were injured Let\u2019s be clear: \u201cIf you see something, say something\u201d doesn\u2019t violate any person\u2019s rights, and there is nothing wrong with acting on a hunch that something feels a bit off. Political correctness has nothing to do with reality, and often the best eyes and ears for law enforcement are the people who know a neighborhood and are able to recognize unusual events. If ISIS or al-Qaeda established a program designed to decrease American vigilance, they couldn\u2019t do any better than the Left\u2019s hashtagging and public shaming. Responsible citizens should ignore the scolds and have the courage to do the right thing. In a Fox News segment, French\u2019s colleague Katherine Timpf made a similar point (albeit in reference to a separate incident, in Britain): If you see something, you should say something to keep people safe. It should be more important to keep people safe than to be politically correct.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s unfortunate that no one reported Farook and Malik to the authorities, thus preventing their attack. We are now enjoying all the benefits of hindsight, so it\u2019s easy to say that whatever obstacles got in the way of stopping the murderous couple should never have existed in the first place. I don\u2019t want the possibility of public shaming to stop people from doing the right thing, in the event that calling the cops is the right thing to do. Nobody wants that.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest: most Muslims who go to the gun range, or have lots of Muslim visitors, are not planning terrorist attacks. Suspicion would be ill-founded. Nancy French says that we\u2019ve succumbed to \u201cClock Boy thinking,\u201d but clock boy was innocent\u2014the cops were wrong to detain him.\n\nSometimes, knee-jerk suspicions are valid. But a lot of other times, they are not. Consider child services investigations. Are children occasionally in actual danger at home, necessitating police intervention? Certainly. But well-meaning strangers (and less-than-well-meaning ex-husbands/wives/relatives) call the cops all the time in situations where the kids are perfectly healthy and safe. These interventions have a cost of their own: kids get taken away from responsible, loving parents; mothers and fathers go to jail and pay huge fines; families are split up. \u201cIf you see something, say something\u201d has a certain allure in the wake of a mass shooting, but \u201cmind your own business\u201d still seems like an appreciably wiser rule of thumb.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to defend political correctness\u2014in fact, I write constantly about how ideologically-motivated PC concerns are shutting down the presumption of free expression at college campuses. But in a sense, this phenomenon is the exact opposite of the thing French et al are complaining about. On campuses, political correctness means that everyone who says something problematic is presumed to have malicious intentions. Political correctness assumes the worst in people: everyone is racist, or sexist, or bigoted, or homophobic, even when their transgressions are trivial.\n\nPolitical correctness in the San Bernardino context appears to mean assuming the best in people\u2014taking for granted that most people aren\u2019t planning a terrorist attack. And I don\u2019t really think we want to live in a country where that kind of political correctness is destroyed\u2014even if it seems to have been a bad thing, in this specific case.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "'See something, say something' vs. 'mind your own business'", "title": "Don't Blame the San Bernardino Shooting on Political Correctness", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/08/dont-blame-the-san-bernardino-shooting-o", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14496073737881.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'See something, say something' vs. 'mind your own business'", "title": "Don't Blame the San Bernardino Shooting on Political Correctness", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14496073737881.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-12-08T21:10:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b06\"", "article_summary": "Should we be blaming deference to political correctness and excessive sensitivity for allowing\u2014or at least, failing to stop\u2014the San Bernardino shooting?\nPolitical correctness in the San Bernardino context appears to mean assuming the best in people\u2014taking for granted that most people aren\u2019t planning a terrorist attack.\nPolitical correctness assumes the worst in people: everyone is racist, or sexist, or bigoted, or homophobic, even when their transgressions are trivial.\nOn campuses, political correctness means that everyone who says something problematic is presumed to have malicious intentions.\nBut in a sense, this phenomenon is the exact opposite of the thing French et al are complaining about."}
