And, of course, when you\u2019re talking federal budgets, the devil\u2019s in the details. And there are some ugly details in this budget.\n\nFor example, in addition to language that would weaken aspects of Dodd-Frank, the proposed legislation cuts the IRS budget.\n\nRecent House Republican budgets have called for large, deep tax cuts that thankfully \u2013 as our future challenges are much more likely to call for more, not less, revenue \u2013 haven\u2019t been legislated. In that regard, one way to view these IRS cuts, especially given some of the facts I report below, is as a back door way to reduce taxes, not by policy, but by undermining the agency\u2019s ability to reduce tax evasion (not to mention, its role in implementing Obamacare).\n\nIRS funding levels have been slashed dramatically in recent years, down nearly $2 billion in real terms between fiscal years 2010 and 2014. As shown in the chart below, the House budget would cut the agency\u2019s budget even further.\n\nWhy is reduced IRS funding a problem? As my CBPP colleagues Chuck Marr and Joel Friedman report:\n\n\u2026vital federal services [have] suffered as funding has declined. The IRS faces cost pressures common to most programs, such as a growing workload and the effects of inflation. But it also faces unique demands, such as the growing problem of identity theft and the tax compliance issues associated with offshore accounts. Demands will only grow in coming years, as the IRS implements the Affordable Care Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which is designed to avert illegal tax evasion that occurs through the use of offshore accounts.\n\nThe agency\u2019s enforcement budget has been hit hard by cuts, and if this new budget were to become law, its inflation-adjusted funding level would be down by 20 percent since 2010. The Treasury estimates that a $1 investment in enforcement yields a $6 return; there\u2019s a strong case to be made for a substantial increase in IRS funding. Remember, these are not new taxes; they\u2019re taxes owed that are being left on the table due to underfunded enforcement of the existing code.\n\nThere\u2019s also some serious chutzpah going on here when the same politicians who call for the IRS\u2019s defunding complain about enforcement problems. If lawmakers are serious about reducing error rates, they must provide the agency with adequate resources.\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear about this proposed budget cut: it\u2019s not simply motivated by the desire for \u201cless government.\u201d It\u2019s a way to cut taxes without explicit tax cuts.\n\nMore broadly, budgets aren\u2019t just numbers on a spreadsheet. They represent our priorities. They speak to how we can meet the challenges we face. So ask yourself: is what\u2019s holding America back right now too much financial oversight and not enough tax avoidance?\n\nThat\u2019s one of them thar rhetorical-type questions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The omnibus budget bill proposed by the House contains a big cut to the IRS.
