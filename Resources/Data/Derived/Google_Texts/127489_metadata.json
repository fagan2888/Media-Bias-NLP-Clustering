She is being treated for high blood pressure and Graves\u2019 disease, an autoimmune disorder, after years of going uninsured and rarely seeing doctors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tickled to death with it,\u201d Ms. Evans, 49, said of her new coverage as she walked around the Kentucky State Fair recently with her daughter, who also qualified for Medicaid under the law. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me out a bunch.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Evans scowled at the mention of President Obama \u2014 \u201cNobody don\u2019t care for nobody no more, and I think he\u2019s got a lot to do with that,\u201d she explained \u2014 and said she would vote this fall for Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader, who is fond of saying the health care law should be \u201cpulled out root and branch.\u201d\n\nMs. Evans said she did not want the law repealed but had too many overall reservations about Democrats to switch her vote. \u201cBorn and raised Republican,\u201d she said of herself. \u201cI ain\u2019t planning on changing now.\u201d\n\nRemaking Medicine\n\nKentucky is arguably one of the health law\u2019s biggest early successes, with about 10 percent of the population getting coverage through the state\u2019s online insurance marketplace \u2014 albeit mostly through Medicaid, not private plans \u2014 and none of the technology failures that plagued other enrollment websites. The uninsured rate here has fallen to 11.9 percent from 20.4 percent, according to a recent Gallup poll that found only Arkansas had experienced a steeper decline.\n\nBut there is little evidence that the expansion of health coverage will help Kentucky Democrats in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans hold all of the state\u2019s congressional seats except for one, in a district centered in Louisville, and none are considered vulnerable this year. Republicans, who already control the State Senate, have a chance of taking the State House of Representatives, where Democrats hold an eight-seat majority. And several recent polls have put Mr. McConnell ahead of his Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, even though his approval ratings are tepid.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McConnell and other Republicans here, while more focused on other issues, like protecting Kentucky\u2019s coal industry, continue to attack the health law as a symbol of government overreach and Democratic bungling. And far from flaunting Kentucky\u2019s strong enrollment numbers, Democratic candidates \u2014 most notably Ms. Grimes \u2014 have remained reticent about the law, even its successes.\n\nIn many ways, the role that the law is playing in Kentucky politics reflects what is going on nationally as the midterm elections approach. The law remains deeply unpopular among Republicans and independents, and Republican candidates still use it to flog their Democratic opponents, although not as single-mindedly as before. That is partly because voters are more focused on other issues: A recent George Washington University Battleground Poll found that among likely voters who think the country is on the wrong track, only 5 percent blamed \u201cissues with Obamacare.\u201d More pointed to concerns about the economy, foreign policy, President Obama and Congress.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhy would people like Ms. Evans who are benefiting from the law vote for candidates who would dismantle it? Gov. Steven L. Beshear, one of the few Democrats forcefully promoting the law here, said many were driven by a dislike of Mr. Obama. A recent CNN poll found that only 33 percent of likely voters here approved of his job performance, and that 63 percent disapproved.\n\n\u201cThe campaign by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s critics against it has been very effective in demonizing the phrase Obamacare and anything to do with the president,\u201d said Mr. Beshear, who cannot seek re-election next year because of term limits. \u201cSo I think you find a reluctance on the part of people, even though the law is benefiting them, to publicly acknowledge it.\u201d\n\nInterest groups and candidates, including Mr. McConnell, have run more than 10,000 broadcast television spots here since January 2013 that mention the law in a negative way, according to Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. Kantar found only one positive television ad, from Elisabeth Jensen, the Democrat challenging Representative Andy Barr in the state\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. The ad referred to Mr. Barr\u2019s votes to repeal the law, warning that he \u201cwould restrict our access to affordable health care.\u201d Ms. Jensen, who is running in a swing district, also ran a radio ad praising the law last spring.\n\nAt the state fair\u2019s annual ham breakfast, Mr. Beshear tried to humanize the law, describing how several farmers in attendance had signed up for the new coverage and how one had used it to check out a spot that turned out to be skin cancer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the president,\u201d he told the crowd of 1,600, who did not applaud once during the six minutes he spent discussing the law. \u201cIt\u2019s about you. It\u2019s about your families. It\u2019s about your children.\u201d\n\nThat message has not persuaded people like Billy Bishop of Lexington, who is retired and gets health insurance through his former employer. He said his out-of-pocket costs had risen sharply while his coverage had gotten worse. He blamed the Affordable Care Act \u2014 particularly its expansion of Medicaid to many more low-income Americans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything good about it, to be honest,\u201d said Mr. Bishop, who has diabetes and heart stents. \u201cI\u2019ve heard with this, you can\u2019t get doctors\u2019 appointments and people get put on wait lists for surgery.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, at the state fair, Mr. Bishop, 57, and his wife, Cindy, 56, stopped by an information booth run by Kynect, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace. Mrs. Bishop was curious about whether she could get less expensive coverage through Kynect, even though her husband refused to consider it for himself.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe took some brochures but said that regardless of what she learned about the cost, she and her husband would vote for Mr. McConnell. Mrs. Bishop said Ms. Grimes was \u201cwith Obama on everything,\u201d and she called the president \u201cthe worst we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nAt the teeming fairgrounds in late August, the Kynect booth handed out 26,000 reusable shopping bags stamped with its logo and toll-free number, and more fairgoers were clutching them than corn dogs or cotton candy. Crowds also gathered around information booths sponsored by the managed-care companies providing Medicaid coverage for the newly insured, one of which had a star University of Louisville basketball player greeting passers-by one day.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140916105729, "twitter": {"description": "Although expanded coverage made the state an early success story, there
