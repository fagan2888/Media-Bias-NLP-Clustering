The rest has to come out of either his pocket or theirs, or both.\n\nIt\u2019s all a bit of a game, of course. Insurance is a cost of doing business, and a cafe owner could just as logically separate the rising cost of potatoes or cooking oil and put a notice on the menu that he\u2019s charging a quarter more for french fries, and here\u2019s why.\n\nIt\u2019s all marketing, and Obamacare is this season\u2019s loss leader. The president richly deserves the honor, it seems to us.\n\nThe money, after all, has to come from somewhere to pay for the health insurance mandates imposed by a Democratic Congress with little regard for whether businesses such as the Denver pizzeria could afford it.\n\nNobody in Washington worries about the problems of such shopkeepers very much. Hillary Clinton summed up Washington\u2019s attitude years ago when she was beating the drum for Hillarycare: \u201cI can\u2019t be responsible for every undercapitalized small business in America.\u201d\n\nShe might not put it quite that way when and if she campaigns for president.\n\nThe Denver surcharge added $1.51 to customer Bonnie Bell\u2019s $30 tab, and she didn\u2019t appreciate it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be shoved in people\u2019s faces like this,\u201d she said.\n\nBut rising prices for goods and services of all kinds became inevitable after Obamacare was enacted in 2010. Cliff Young, a business professor at the University of Colorado at Denver, says he expects more restaurants and other service-sector businesses to add Obamacare surcharges.\n\nIn Florida, customers at eight Gator\u2019s Dockside restaurants are greeted with blunt notice at the door: \u201cThe costs associated with [Affordable Care Act] compliance could ultimately close our doors. Instead of raising prices on our products to generate the additional revenue need to cover the costs of ACA compliance, certain Gator\u2019s Dockside locations have implemented a 1 percent surcharge on all food and beverage purchases only.\u201d\n\nThis appears on the check as \u201cACA surcharge,\u201d directly above the bottom line.\n\nThe upscale Republique restaurant in Los Angeles has been adding a 3 percent Obamacare surcharge, explained on the menu, since opening in November.\n\n\u201cEven if this isn\u2019t the perfect solution, it\u2019s definitely a solution,\u201d owner-chef Walter Manske tells a television interviewer, \u201cand so far, there isn\u2019t any other solution.\u201d\n\nObamacare was designed to provide benefits to certain demographic groups without letting on to younger folks that they would be paying far more than their share.
