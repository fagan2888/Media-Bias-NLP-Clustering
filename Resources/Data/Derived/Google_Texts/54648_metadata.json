As the organization scales back, it will leave a void that some worry could be difficult to fill, even as it trains local organizations to do just that.\n\nOne of Enroll America\u2019s biggest funders, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which donated $13 million in 2013 and $10 million in 2014, had planned to end funding this year. Other donors are also cutting back, Ron Pollack, chairman of Enroll America\u2019s board, told Politico. In 2013, more than 30 donors gave $27 million to Enroll America. In 2014, nearly 80 donors gave $20 million.\n\nJustin Nisly, a spokesman for Enroll America, told International Business Times on Thursday that the organization had been planning these structural and strategic changes \"for some time.\" Because the number of uninsured Americans has decreased since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the group would be changing its approach to find those who still lack health insurance.\n\nThe organization was moving toward what Anne Filipic, president of Enroll America, called a \"smarter, more targeted approach\" aimed at \"difficult-to-reach consumers.\" She said it would do so by continuing to train local partner organizations -- 4,600 of them across all 50 states -- that would be working on insurance enrollment in the future.\n\nSome say Enroll America played a major role in the implementation of Obamacare. \u201cThe field work that Enroll America did has really contributed significantly to the numbers that we do have,\u201d Anne Gauthier, a senior program director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, told Politico.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAn estimated 11 million people have gained health insurance coverage through state and federal exchanges created under Obamacare, although 30 million remain uninsured. \"Enrolling people for health insurance through the exchanges is a lot harder that anybody thought. In a sense they got the low-hanging fruit already,\" Joseph Antos, a health care policy scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told Politico.\n\nEnroll America, whose stated goal is \u201cmaximizing the number of Americans who are enrolled in and retain health coverage,\u201d was initially supposed to raise $100 million for a five-year period. It has had the support of high-ranking government officials, such as Kathleen Sebelius, former secretary of Health and Human Services, but nevertheless struggled to gain full funding.\n\n\u201cOur goal over the next few years is to make ourselves unnecessary by passing the baton to local organizations and leaders,\" Alescia Teel, Enroll America\u2019s deputy state director for New Jersey, told the Record last month.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare, obamacare enrollment, enroll america, affordable care act, affordable care act enrollment, enroll america funding, robert wood johnson foundation, how do i sign up for obamacare, obamacare insurance options, health care exchanges, job cuts, fun", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Since its inception, Enroll America has struggled to attract the financing it needs.", "title": "Enroll America, Obamacare Signup Group, Loses Funding, Cuts 100 Jobs", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/enroll-america-obamacare-signup-group-loses-funding-cuts-100-jobs-1875847", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/09/rtx10bjw.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since its inception, Enroll America has struggled to attract the financing it needs.", "title": "Enroll America, Obamacare Signup Group, Loses Funding, Cuts 100 Jobs", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/enroll-america-obamacare-signup-group-loses-funding-cuts-100-jobs-1875847", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/09/rtx10bjw.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/09/rtx10bjw.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-04-09T10:51:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-09T13:30:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Since its inception, Enroll America has struggled to attract the financing it needs."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5bc\"", "article_summary": "Some say Enroll America played a major role in the implementation of Obamacare.\nThe organization was moving toward what Anne Filipic, president of Enroll America, called a \"smarter, more targeted approach\" aimed at \"difficult-to-reach consumers.\"\nJustin Nisly, a spokesman for Enroll America, told International Business Times on Thursday that the organization had been planning these structural and strategic changes \"for some time.\"\nIn 2013, more than 30 donors gave $27 million to Enroll America.\nEnroll America, a major nonprofit organization that works on helping people obtain and keep health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, is cutting 100 jobs after losing significant funding from donors, Politico reported."}
