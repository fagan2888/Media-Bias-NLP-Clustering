From 4 p.m. to midnight, none of MSNBC\u2019s shows was able to break 100,000 viewers in the demo, which has long been considered a cut-off for viability in cable news,\u201d observes Mark Joyella, a columnist for TVNewser.com\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a fluke - the network\u2019s shows on Friday again failed to break 100,000 in the demo, with Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow both fighting not for second place against CNN, but for third place with Forensic Files on HLN,\u201d Mr. Joyella points out.\n\nCould anything help them?
