Cathy Reisenwitz detailed in October how this shift of treating prostitutes as victims rather than criminals doesn\u2019t necessarily result in more freedom or better lives for the women forced to participate in order to avoid criminal charges.\n\nOn the other hand, the growing trend of treating prostitutes as though they\u2019re victims rather than criminals can result in prostitutes being able to turn to the state for help when they truly are victimized. California has a Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board that, among other things, helps pay for medical treatment and certain losses that are directly connected to a crime. For example, a woman who has been sexually assaulted can turn to the agency to help pay for medical and mental health treatment to recover from the crime.\n\nThe laws, though, exempt victims who were involved in illegal activities at the time, such as prostitution. A prostitute who was raped could not turn to the state for assistance with health care costs.\n\nToday the agency voted to change that rule. The Sacramento Bee reports:\n\nCalifornia's three-member Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board voted unanimously Thursday to overturn a regulation barring victims of sexual assault from receiving restitution if they work in the sex trade. The 14-year-old policy states that victims of a violent crime may be denied compensation if they were involved in the events leading up to that crime, including mutual combat, illegal drug-related activity, gang-related activity and prostitution. Advocates for sex workers argued that the regulation was discriminatory, essentially blaming prostitutes for their own rape and putting other women at greater risk of attack.\n\nOf course, the change comes at the speed of government. The new policy probably won\u2019t be in place until next spring.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Will be able to get help with costs if attacked on the job", "title": "Calif. to Open Victim Compensation Funds to Prostitutes", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/12/12/calif-to-open-victim-compensation-to-pro", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13868869821314.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The growing trend of treating\nprostitutes as though they\u2019re victims of sex-trafficking even when\nthey aren\u2019t is paternalistic and often forces women into mandatory\n\u201ctreatments,\u201d unwilling to acknowledge a person\u2019s free choice to\nengage in sex work. \nCathy Reisenwitz detailed in October how this shift of treating\nprostitutes as victims rath", "title": "Calif. to Open Victim Compensation Funds to Prostitutes", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13868869821314.jpg", "creator": "@sshackford", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Nanny State", "published_time": "2013-12-12T22:40:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/scott-shackford"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab58\"", "article_summary": "On the other hand, the growing trend of treating prostitutes as though they\u2019re victims rather than criminals can result in prostitutes being able to turn to the state for help when they truly are victimized.\nCalifornia has a Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board that, among other things, helps pay for medical treatment and certain losses that are directly connected to a crime.\nCathy Reisenwitz detailed in October how this shift of treating prostitutes as victims rather than criminals doesn\u2019t necessarily result in more freedom or better lives for the women forced to participate in order to avoid criminal charges.\nAdvocates for sex workers argued that the regulation was discriminatory, essentially blaming prostitutes for their own rape and putting other women at greater risk of attack.\nThe growing trend of treating prostitutes as though they\u2019re victims of sex-trafficking even when they aren\u2019t is paternalistic and often forces women into mandatory \u201ctreatments,\u201d unwilling to acknowledge a person\u2019s free choice to engage in sex work."}
