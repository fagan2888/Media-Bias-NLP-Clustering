Reader Troy May writes to say Gov.-elect Matt Bevin\u2019s plan to dismantle Kynect will hike the cost of insurance and swell the ranks of the uninsured. (Photo: Louisville Courier-Journal/Alton Strupp)\n\nCovington resident Troy May is a graduate student at Cincinnati Christian University.\n\nIf Kentucky Governor-elect Matt Bevin dismantles the health care exchange, known as Kynect, he will be going against the state\u2019s business community and hurt average Kentuckians like myself. As a resident of Covington, a full-time graduate student and part-time worker, I purchase a federally subsidized health plan from Anthem via Kynect.\n\nBevin claims that once Kynect is shut down, I can obtain the same health plan on the federal exchange, but that\u2019s not true. Anyone who claims that Kynect is just a duplicate service of the federal exchange doesn\u2019t understand the system or the benefits Kynect provides.\n\nKynect.com provides access to affordable health insurance by offering federal subsidies to help people afford monthly premiums. I pay $132 a month for a comprehensive health plan with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. My monthly premium amount is based on my income and expenses. There are plans for under $50 a month. The working poor can also obtain Medicaid insurance through Kynect depending on their economic status.\n\nTroy May (Photo: Provided)\n\nMost people in the state don\u2019t even realize the benefits of Kynect, not even those who have obtain Medicaid coverage through the program. Some of the counties with the highest rate of Medicaid, voted for Bevin, not knowing they were casting a vote to have their health insurance card snatched right out of their hands. Bevin claims all the new people on Medicaid will be a financial drain on the state budget. We all know that the Medicaid program needs reform, but Bevin doesn\u2019t have to shut down Kynect and my access to high-quality health plans to reform Medicaid.\n\nThe Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and Kentucky Hospital Association worked with the state to develop the best market exchange in the country. The business community has endorsed Kynect because it provides access to affordable health plans for the uninsured workers of small businesses at no cost to the state. Kynect is such a great technology platform that other states may purchase the system for their state, generating revenue for Kentucky.\n\nKynect officials work directly with health insurers to develop top-quality health plans for the people of Kentucky. Kynect offers a long list of benefits for Kentuckians that aren\u2019t offered on the federal exchange.\n\nIf Bevin shuts down Kynect it will cause me to pay more every month for health insurance and get less coverage. Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield already told me my health plan is not available on the federal exchange. And shutting down Kynect would create financial barriers for me to obtain expensive medicine I need because of a childhood illness.\n\nSince Kynect was launched over a year ago, the uninsured rate in Kentucky has dropped by half. Dismantling Kynect would cause the uninsured rate to escalate once again. It would be cruel of Bevin to take away people\u2019s health insurance and access to high-quality health plans by dismantling Kynect.\n\nThere is no logical reason to shut down Kynect other than pure politics motivated by Republicans who don\u2019t like Obamacare. Plus, it\u2019s estimated that shutting down the program could cost the state upward of $23 million to pay for the huge task of transitioning hundreds of thousands of people off their health insurance.\n\nI\u2019m confident that the majority of good people in Kentucky don\u2019t want me or anyone else in the state to suffer because of a political dispute between Republicans and Democrats over Obamacare. I beg Bevin to put Kentuckians ahead of politics and leave Kynect alone.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1QoTq0A", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "If Bevin shuts down Kynect it will cause me to pay more every month for health insurance and get less coverage.", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "If Bevin shuts down Kynect it will cause me to pay more every month for health insurance and get less coverage.", "title": "Opinion: Dismantling Kynect will hurt citizens", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/12/02/opinion-dismantling-kynect-will-hurt-citizens/76696372/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Bevin shuts down Kynect it will cause me to pay more every month for health insurance and get less coverage.", "title": "Opinion: Dismantling Kynect will hurt citizens", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68039de1d2646abd6d24fffd9feacf059a4c9d2f/c=872-0-3539-2667&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Cincinnati/B9319837473Z.1_20151206122942_000_GSQCOKDTB.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "title": "Opinion: Dismantling Kynect will hurt citizens", "author": "Troy May", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb962e196037d42841987f773a63ca788489f056/c=1051-0-3051-2667/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Cincinnati/B9319837473Z.1_20151206122942_000_GSQCOKDTB.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f522ffc37aa775175bbe23c65ea5bf0646229835/c=872-0-3539-2667/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Cincinnati/B9319837473Z.1_20151206122942_000_GSQCOKDTB.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/852e5062f9b52592a59d05cb0812720f073d47ca/c=222-0-3769-2667/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Cincinnati/B9319837473Z.1_20151206122942_000_GSQCOKDTB.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c4d041d6bc7a3929fdf57b10cfae2c290c6b3564/c=0-0-3995-2257&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Cincinnati/B9319837473Z.1_20151206122942_000_GSQCOKDTB.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-06T12:39:04.027000-05:00", "shorthed": "Opinion: Ending Kynect will hurt citizens", "articleid": 76696372, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8ff7954bd9fb3d7f1677fea4416c73729602a6f3/c=0-0-3995-2257/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Cincinnati/B9319837473Z.1_20151206122942_000_GSQCOKDTB.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/07bcfa3a470d1d6ef66e7ae16c610e7725b919fa/c=766-0-2260-2667/local/-/media/2015/12/06/Cincinnati/B9319837473Z.1_20151206122942_000_GSQCOKDTB.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "It would be cruel of Bevin to take away people\u2019s health insurance and access to high-quality health plans by dismantling Kynect.\nAs a resident of Covington, a full-time graduate student and part-time worker, I purchase a federally subsidized health plan from Anthem via Kynect.\nThe working poor can also obtain Medicaid insurance through Kynect depending on their economic status.\nI pay $132 a month for a comprehensive health plan with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\nKynect officials work directly with health insurers to develop top-quality health plans for the people of Kentucky."}
