In a town decked out in navy blue and green, the Denver Broncos Fans of Seattle arrived in orange, waving a Broncos flag and carrying purple signs (the official color for Alzheimer\u2019s awareness) that read \u201cThis One\u2019s For Pat!\u201d\n\nThe group of fans more than 1,300 miles from Broncos Country had never met Pat Bowlen. And many, including Thorington, had no personal experience with Alzheimer\u2019s. But they loved their Broncos and loved their team\u2019s owner and, therefore, were eager to fight for his cause.\n\nRELATED: Bowlen family finds support, solidarity in fight against Alzheimer\u2019s\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people have been touched by this disease without even knowing it,\u201d Thorington said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disease that\u2019s not talked about as much. You hear about cancer and diabetes and heart disease and things like that. For me, it\u2019s devastating.\u201d\n\nWhen Thorington sent out an announcement to the fan club in late July, she was hoping to get just 10 volunteers to raise $1,000. The group of 30 who signed up collected $6,312, the fifth-most of any team at the Seattle walk.\n\nNext up is a trip to San Diego. Thorington and her husband Michael bought 30 club seats to the Broncos\u2019 Dec. 6 game against the Chargers for a group trip. Twenty-eight tickets have been claimed. The last two will be raffled off, along with a weekend hotel stay and airfare contributed by a Seattle bar. All funds from the winning bid will go to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nIt\u2019s a grand prize, but not the grand finale for Thorington and the Denver Broncos Fans of Seattle, a group that has grown to include more than 1,300 online and 930 in Seattle. More events will be planned, she said.\n\nThe fight against Alzheimer\u2019s, in Pat Bowlen\u2019s honor, continues.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos fan club in Seattle walks to fight Alzheimer\u2019s in Bowlen\u2019s honor", "title": "Broncos fan club in Seattle walks to fight Alzheimer\u2019s in Bowlen\u2019s honor", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/19/broncos-fan-club-in-seattle-walks-to-fight-alzheimers-in-bowlens-honor/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150919__FB_IMG_1442600917172-1p1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150919__FB_IMG_1442600917172-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-19T15:00:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:55:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Pat Bowlen"}, "article_summary": "On Aug. 29, Shawna Thorington of Marysville, Wash., corralled about 30 Broncos loyalists to the starting line of the Walk to End Alzheimer\u2019s in Seattle.\nThorington and her husband Michael bought 30 club seats to the Broncos\u2019 Dec. 6 game against the Chargers for a group trip.\nThe fight against Alzheimer\u2019s, in Pat Bowlen\u2019s honor, continues.\nIt\u2019s a grand prize, but not the grand finale for Thorington and the Denver Broncos Fans of Seattle, a group that has grown to include more than 1,300 online and 930 in Seattle.\nBut they loved their Broncos and loved their team\u2019s owner and, therefore, were eager to fight for his cause."}
