In June 2013, the former top economist for President George W. Bush published a paper titled \u201cDefending the One Percent\u201d in which he tried (and failed) to convincingly defend the rising incomes of the richest 1 percent of Americans. On Saturday, he turned to the pages of the New York Times to argue that inherited wealth is good for the economy. But just like in 2013, his argument is unconvincing.\n\nInherited wealth has garnered greater attention since the release of Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty First Century. Mankiw begins his piece by linking to a half dozen critiques of Capital before stating, \u201cThe Piketty scenario is best viewed not as a solid prediction but as a provocative speculation.\u201d But Piketty is not, in fact, making a prediction. His theory argues that there are \u201cforces of divergence\u201d in capitalism that can lead to extreme concentration of wealth if left unchecked. That\u2019s not a prediction, it\u2019s a theory. Mankiw conflates the two.\n\nMankiw spends the next 600 words explaining why it\u2019s rational for parents to bequest wealth to their kids. The reasons he identifies make sense, but Mankiw is attacking a straw man here. No one is arguing that inheritance serves no purpose whatsoever. That\u2019s why the estate tax exempts the first $5.34 million. But at some income levels, the reasons Mankiw offers lose their significance.\n\nFor instance, take consumption smoothing. Mankiw explains, \u201cConsuming $50,000 of goods and services in each of two years is generally better than consuming $80,000 one year and $20,000 the next. People smooth consumption by saving in good times and drawing down assets when conditions are lean. \u2026 Hence, to smooth consumption across generations, they need to save some of their income so future generations can consume out of inherited wealth.\u201d For most people this holds true, but for those at the far upper-end of the income distribution it falls apart. In 2012, the threshold for being in the top 0.01 percent required wealth of more than $100 million. Consumption smoothing doesn\u2019t really apply to these households, because in both good and bad times, the have adequate financial resources to live as they please.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Whenever the 1 percent needs someone to provide academic support for their extraordinary incomes, they always know just who to call: Greg Mankiw.
