A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.\n\nBut this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "An Australian search and rescue official says that planes have been sent to check on two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.", "author": "News9.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25025229/malaysian-official-says-possible-plane-debris-sighting-is-credible-but-not-confirmed", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25025229_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Australian search and rescue official says that planes have been sent to check on two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.", "title": "Official Says Possible Plane Debris Sighting Is 'Credible'"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25025229_SA.jpg", "description": "An Australian search and rescue official says that planes have been sent to check on two objects possibly related to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.", "card": "summary", "title": "Official Says Possible Plane Debris Sighting Is 'Credible'"}, "wnreadableurl": "malaysian-official-says-possible-plane-debris-sighting-is-credible-but-not-confirmed", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/03/20", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, malaysia air, plane, missing, possible debris, pieces, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, malaysia air, plane, missing, possible debris, pieces, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda623\"", "article_summary": "Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.\nA yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash.\nJohn Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority cautioned Thursday against expectations that this may help solve the mystery of the plane that went missing with 239 people on board nearly two weeks ago.\nThe hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared March 8 above the Gulf of Thailand.\nBut John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority cautioned Thursday against expectations that this may help solve the mystery of the plane that went missing with 239 people on board nearly two weeks ago."}
