He said China has mostly built civilian facilities.\n\nLiu's comments at the annual East Asia Summit, this year hosted by Kuala Lumpur, were some of the most forceful explanations that China has given regarding its position on the South China Sea.\n\nWashington was testing Beijing with its insistence on \"freedom of navigation\" patrols in the strategic waterway, Liu said.\n\nChina, which claims almost the entire energy-rich South China Sea, has been transforming reefs into artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago and building airfields and other facilities on some of them.
