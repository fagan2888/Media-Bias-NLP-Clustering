Earth is closest to the Sun for the year at 3:49 p.m. on Jan. 2, 2016. So why are we in the middle of winter?

The Earth orbits the Sun in more of an oval shape than a circle. This time of year we are about 3 million miles closer to the Sun than in the summer. However, this is just a small fraction of millions of more miles between our planet and the Sun. In reality, the change in distance has very little to do with seasons here on Earth. The tilt of the Earth on the axis is much more important.

This time of year the northern hemisphere is leaning away from the sun. This decreases the angle of the sun's rays hitting the Earth, which weakens the effect of the heating needed to warm the planet. However, the southern hemisphere is leaning towards the sun and experiences much more direct sunlight. Therefore, while we have winter in the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere has summer. The below image from NASA breaks down how the seasons change as the Earth orbits the Sun.
