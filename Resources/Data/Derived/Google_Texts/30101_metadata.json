The shirts are meant to raise funds for the abortion giant\u2019s political group as it prepares to launch an advertising campaign to trash pro-life candidates.\n\nThe campaign is also responding to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision protecting Hobby Lobby and other pro-life-run businesses that do not want to be forced pay for abortion-causing drugs for their employees.\n\nHere\u2019s more:\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that some politicians were cheering the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to give bosses the right to interfere in our access to birth control, I thought I had woken up in another decade,\u201d said Johansson in a statement. Johansson, who has starred in Hollywood hits including Iron Man and Lost in Translation, designed the shirt to help the pro-abortion-rights group\u2019s political arm raise money for its \u201cWomen are Watching\u201d campaign. The campaign intends to target candidates who support the high court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling. The Supreme Court allowed \u201cclosely held\u201d companies with religious objections to opt out of covering birth control for employees under ObamaCare. The pink T-shirts designed by Johansson read, \u201cHey Politicians! The 1950s called \u2026\u201d on the front. On the back, the shirts say: \u201cThey want their sexism back!\u201d Text on the left sleeve is signed, \u201cLove Scarlett Johansson.\u201d \u201cWomen will be the key to the elections this November and it\u2019s more important than ever that young women register to vote and vote for the candidate that will stand up and fight for them,\u201d said Johansson.

In 2006, she attacked President Bush for his pro-life views on abortion. She said women\u2019s rights would be doomed if the law was left up to him.\n\nShe accused the president, in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine, of denying women their rights and forcing them to carry unwanted pregnancies to term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be liberated in America but if our President had his way, we wouldn\u2019t be educated about sex at all,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery woman would have six children and we wouldn\u2019t be able to have abortions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actress Scarlett Johansson Designs New T-Shirt for Planned Parenthood Abortion Biz", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Actress Scarlett Johansson has designed a new t-shirt for the nation's largest abortion business, Planned Parenthood.
