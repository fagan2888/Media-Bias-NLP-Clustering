He says that he wants to move to another level of relations, to a deeper level of relations with Russia. How can we not welcome that? Of course we welcome it,\" Putin told reporters, according to a translation by the U.K.\u2019s Telegraph newspaper.\n\nRelated: Brits Sign Petition to Ban Trump, Who Cameron Calls \u2018Divisive and Stupid\u2019\n\nPutin\u2019s decision to weigh in with praise for Trump came just a day after the leader of the United States\u2019 closest ally harshly criticized the GOP frontrunner. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron called Trump\u2019s recent proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. \u201cdivisive, stupid, and wrong\u201d and said that a Trump visit to the U.K. would \u201cunite us all against him.\u201d Putin weighed in with praise for the billionaire former reality television star.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear which Trump statements Putin was praising. The billionaire has, on multiple occasions said that he is perfectly at ease with Russia\u2019s intervention in the Syrian civil war, where Moscow claimed to be bombing the terror group ISIS, but in fact directed most of its attacks on rebel groups opposed to dictator Bashar al-Assad, one of Moscow\u2019s only allies in the region.\n\nTrump has implied that he is friendly with Putin, mostly based on their having been \u201cstable mates\u201d when they both appeared on the same episode of the news show 60 Minutes. However, both appeared in prerecorded interviews, which were conducted on different continents. So Trump\u2019s claim that, \u201cI got to know him very well\u201d because of the appearance was obviously false.\n\nRelated: Rubio Outshines Trump, Cruz in GOP Foreign Policy Debate\n\nOn many occasions, Trump has said that he thinks he and Putin could develop a strong relationship.\n\n\u201cI think that I would at the same time get along very well with him,\u201d he told Face the Nation host John Dickerson in October. \u201cHe does not like Obama at all. He doesn't respect Obama at all. And I'm sure that Obama doesn't like him very much\u2026. But I think that I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump just got a pretty high-profile sort-of endorsement from Russian President", "title": "Putin Would \u2018Welcome\u2019 a Donald Trump Presidency", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/17/Putin-Would-Welcome-Donald-Trump-Presidency", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09112013_Putin_Winking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/17/Putin-Would-Welcome-Donald-Trump-Presidency", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09112013_Putin_Winking.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Donald Trump just got a pretty high-profile sort-of endorsement from Russian President", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Of course we welcome it,\" Putin told reporters, according to a translation by the U.K.\u2019s Telegraph newspaper.\nRelated: Rubio Outshines Trump, Cruz in GOP Foreign Policy DebateOn many occasions, Trump has said that he thinks he and Putin could develop a strong relationship.\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear which Trump statements Putin was praising.\nHe says that he wants to move to another level of relations, to a deeper level of relations with Russia.\nAnd I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now.\u201d"}
