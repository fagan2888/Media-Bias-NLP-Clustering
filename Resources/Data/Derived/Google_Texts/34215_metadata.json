These price fixes make it economically unviable to buy or sell drugs across the country, causing regional shortages. Ceballos is demanding a government response to what he calls a \u201chumanitarian crisis.\u201d The price fixes also affect the production of drugs, which has almost completely halted.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cPeople are dying because of a lack of medicine,\u201d he asserted.\n\nThe result is a pharmaceutical market where Venezuelans are seeking remedies for their health problems by any means necessary. The PanAmerican Post notes that many have resorted to social media, Twitter in particular, to find sellers for the particular drug they need to survive.\n\nPharmacists, meanwhile, have resorted to other medications. \u201cWe are using veterinary drugs\u2026 because the Venezuelan state does not give us money to produce [drugs for human use] here,\u201d Ceballos told the Cuban independent publication 14 y medio", "article_metadata": {"description": "Venezuelans have resorted to using home remedies, procuring veterinary medications, and looking for drugs on social media.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Venezuelans have resorted to using home remedies, procuring veterinary medications, and looking for drugs on social media.", "title": "Venezuelans Using Animal Drugs as 85% of Pharmacies Short", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/venezuela-dogs-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-12-16T13:25:51-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/12/16/venezuelans-using-animal-drugs-as-85-percent-of-pharmacies-close-to-shutting-down/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Venezuelans have resorted to using home remedies, procuring veterinary medications, and looking for drugs on social media.", "creator": "@francesmartel", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/venezuela-dogs-Getty.jpg", "title": "Venezuelans Using Animal Drugs as 85% of Pharmacies Short", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Latin America, Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela,Economics, National Security,Venezuelans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-16T11:10:07-07:00", "section": "Economics", "modified_time": "2015-12-16T13:25:51-07:00", "tag": "Venezuela", "categories": "National Security,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are using veterinary drugs\u2026 because the Venezuelan state does not give us money to produce [drugs for human use] here,\u201d Ceballos told the Cuban independent publication 14 y medio\n\u201c85 percent of the nation\u2019s pharmacies will go bankrupt,\u201d asserted Freddy Ceballos, the head of the Pharmaceutical Federation of Venezuela, on Monday.\nThese price fixes make it economically unviable to buy or sell drugs across the country, causing regional shortages.\nThe result is a pharmaceutical market where Venezuelans are seeking remedies for their health problems by any means necessary.\nThe PanAmerican Post notes that many have resorted to social media, Twitter in particular, to find sellers for the particular drug they need to survive."}
