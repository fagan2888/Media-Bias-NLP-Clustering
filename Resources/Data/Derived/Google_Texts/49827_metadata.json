Peterson Foundation, where V.I.P.s and reporters once flocked for budget news, the newsmakers\u2019 talk often veered far from the fiscal. The main news was politics.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, a featured speaker at all five summit meetings, responded to recent speculation from Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, that Hillary Rodham Clinton might have suffered a \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d in a 2012 fall that would preclude her from being president.\n\n\u201cFirst, they said she faked her concussion, and now they say she\u2019s auditioning for a part in \u2018The Walking Dead,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Clinton said, addressing the issue for the first time.\n\n\u201cAs far as I can tell, she\u2019s in better shape than I am,\u201d he added. \u201cShe certainly seems to have more stamina now. And there\u2019s nothing to it. I was sort of dumbfounded.\u201d\n\nMr. Clinton said that this was \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of Republicans going after Mrs. Clinton, and suggested the sort of counsel he might give her as she weighed whether to seek his former job. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for them to admit there was nothing to Whitewater,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the deal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe did acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton had suffered a \u201cvery serious concussion,\u201d and that it had taken her months to fully recover. Mrs. Clinton was hospitalized for a few days at the end of 2012 after sustaining a concussion, which led to a blood clot in a vein between her brain and her skull behind her right ear.\n\nFollowing Mr. Clinton on the stage, Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, said a quick yes when asked whether he was considering running for president \u2014 even as new questions about his state\u2019s budget woes combined with a continuing political scandal to complicate a potential candidacy.\n\nWith New Jersey facing an annual deficit approaching $1 billion in a roughly $34 billion budget, Mr. Christie said: \u201cI\u2019ll make an announcement next week about how do we fix it. We will fix it.\u201d But he ruled out tax increases, saying wealthy residents were already taxed too highly there.\n\nThe event\u2019s timing was awkward for both Mr. Christie and his hosts at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which invited him on the program for his experience \u201cbalancing difficult fiscal choices,\u201d and to discuss the federal budget outlook, not New Jersey\u2019s.\n\nPhoto\n\nA day earlier, Moody\u2019s Investors Service announced the latest of a series of recent downgrades of New Jersey\u2019s creditworthiness by major ratings firms, all of which have criticized it for annually overestimating revenue collections and relying on one-time deficit-cutting measures rather than tax or spending changes that would have a continuing impact to limit budgets.\n\nWhile New Jersey\u2019s revenues have fallen short for several years, Mr. Christie focused on 2013 in explaining the latest shortfall. He blamed state economists for not anticipating how much high-income residents, like those who work on Wall Street, would shift income into late 2012 to avoid higher federal income taxes on the wealthy that took effect last year.\n\nMr. Christie said the economists told him they were sorry, and he replied, \u201cYeah, sure you are, but I\u2019m the one who has to fix your miss.\u201d\n\nHis questioner, Bob Schieffer of CBS News, followed the volley of queries on New Jersey\u2019s budget woes with a few on the scandal involving the role of former Christie aides in days of politically motivated traffic jams. Asked what impact the scandal and continuing investigations would have on his political ambitions, Mr. Christie quickly said, \u201cI think it will have none because I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile he and Mr. Clinton both drew interest for their potential parts in the 2016 election, each addressed the approaching midterm elections for Congress.\n\nMr. Clinton said Democrats should not run away from the Affordable Care Act in their campaigns, but embrace it for its benefits and promise improvements where needed. \u201cNobody could have done this perfectly,\u201d he said, given the complexity of the health system.\n\nAnd citing benefits and improved insurance coverage that millions of Americans are receiving, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019re rocking along pretty good here.\u201d\n\nMr. Christie was critical of congressional Republicans\u2019 opposition to any increase in the federal minimum wage. He said he favored an increase, just not in one step but in stages to give businesses time to adjust. In general, he said, Republicans should be \u201cexplaining ourselves and not appearing to be intolerant.\u201d\n\nIf Republicans take control of Congress in this year\u2019s midterm elections, Mr. Christie said that Republican lawmakers as well as President Obama will be tested, since they will have to work together if anything is to get done.\n\nHe suggested that for Mr. Obama to have a more productive final two years, \u201cThe argument is for a Republican House and Senate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140514163616, "twitter": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton and Gov.
