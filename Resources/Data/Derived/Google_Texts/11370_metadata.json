It might have something to do with the size of his paycheck.\n\nA new study of British families where both spouses work full-time found that high-earning men were less likely than low-income earners to share housework equally with their wives.\n\nThe research was based on interviews with one representative apiece from 48 families, all of which included at least one child under 14. That\u2019s not a large sample size, but the interviews did confirm some nearly universal beliefs: Most participants said housework should be shared and admitted it was a source of conflict and frustration.\n\nRelated: Why Men and Women Still Can\u2019t Get Along at Work\n\nThe study also found some clear rifts, though. \"There's a stark difference in couples' attitudes towards gender equality depending on how much they are earning,\" said lead researcher Dr. Clare Lyonette from the Warwick Institute for Employment Research, a British social science group. Her study was published this month in the British Sociological Association\u2019s journal Work, Employment and Society.\n\nLyonette said that the household division of labor is generally more equal today than it has been in the past, but women still bear most of the responsibility for housework no matter how much they earn.\n\nIn families where men earned more than women, women handled most of the housework 80 percent of the time. In families where women earned the same or more than men, women still had the most responsibility for housework two-thirds of the time.\n\nThese labor divisions were more pronounced among families that identified as \u201cprofessional/managerial.\u201d Of professional families 62 percent said women had main responsibility for housework. Of couples doing \u201croutine/manual\u201d work, only 25 percent said the woman had more responsibility for those chores.\n\nIn short, perhaps unsurprisingly, men do more around the house when women are the primary breadwinners and higher earners are less likely to help out with domestic duties. Higher income families were more likely to hire a cleaner to ameliorate the situation.\n\n\"It seems men on lower incomes are happily picking up the dusters, filling the dishwasher and generally starting to do their bit,\u201d Lyonette said. \"But there's a different attitude when it comes to higher earners. We found that while men in these households do also recognize the need to help their partners, they remain reluctant to lift a finger and appear to simply throw money at the issue by hiring a cleaner instead.\u201d\n\nRelated: After Gaffe, Microsoft Board to Look at Gender Pay Gap, Male Culture\n\nEven when professional men said they shared housework, the study found that \u201cmale \u2018sharing\u2019 was confined to what was left after both the wife and the cleaner had divided the majority of the housework between them,\u201d Lyonette said.\n\nMen Really Are Idiots, and Science Proves It\n\nBoth genders rationalize the gap in domestic responsibilities in part by referring to what researchers call \u201cthe myth of male incompetence.\u201d \u201cThis is a belief by some women \u2014 and our study shows it's still rife \u2014 that men are unable to complete housework to an acceptable standard,\u201d said Lyonette.\n\nLyonette and her co-researcher Rosemary Crompton believe women\u2019s responsibility for most domestic work restricts their ability to perform equally with men in the workplace.\n\n\u201cIf male partners do more, it may follow that employed women\u2019s lives will improve considerably, allowing them to take on additional workplace responsibilities and compete on a more equal footing with men,\u201d they wrote as they introduced their findings.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "New research finds that high-earning professional men who make more than their wives are much less likely to share domestic duties.", "title": "Chore Wars: High-Earning Husbands Do Less Housework", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/07/Chore-Wars-High-Earning-Husbands-Do-Less-Housework", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142012_Dollar_Couple_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/07/Chore-Wars-High-Earning-Husbands-Do-Less-Housework", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142012_Dollar_Couple_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ameystone"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "New research finds that high-earning professional men who make more than their wives are much less likely to share domestic duties.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In families where men earned more than women, women handled most of the housework 80 percent of the time.\nIn families where women earned the same or more than men, women still had the most responsibility for housework two-thirds of the time.\nA new study of British families where both spouses work full-time found that high-earning men were less likely than low-income earners to share housework equally with their wives.\nThese labor divisions were more pronounced among families that identified as \u201cprofessional/managerial.\u201d Of professional families 62 percent said women had main responsibility for housework.\nRelated: Why Men and Women Still Can\u2019t Get Along at WorkThe study also found some clear rifts, though."}
