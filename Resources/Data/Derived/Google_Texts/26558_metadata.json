(Photo: Charlie Neibergall/The Associated Press)\n\nDAVENPORT, Iowa \u2014 Most Americans, including most gun owners, would support reasonable limits on guns to help stop massacres like the one last week in Oregon, Hillary Clinton said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of people in public life saying, \u2018Our thoughts and prayers are with families whose children are murdered at community colleges or elementary schools or people killed at Bible studies or going to the movies,\u2019 \u201d the Democratic presidential candidate said. \u201cWe can\u2019t tolerate that. This doesn\u2019t just happen. \u2026 We let it happen.\u201d\n\nHer audience at Davenport\u2019s RiverCenter applauded as Clinton vowed to make it harder for people who shouldn\u2019t have guns to obtain them. Among other things, she favors broader background checks, including for sales at gun shows, and stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers or people with serious mental health problems.\n\n\u201cWe keep getting stymied because of the lobby for a very small minority of gun owners and the gun manufacturers, which stand in the way,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton has spoken throughout the campaign about her intention to implement tighter gun rules, despite pressure from the National Rifle Association. This week, she released specifics of her proposals.\n\n\u201cI feel like this is unfinished business in our country, and I am very determined that we are going to try to bring some sanity back, so that people\u2019s Second Amendment rights are protected \u2014 but they are not absolute, the way the NRA wants them to be. There are common-sense ways to make sure people are not using guns to commit mass murders.\u201d\n\nLater Tuesday, speaking outside a bed and breakfast in Muscatine, Clinton alluded to comments former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush made after the Oregon shooting at a community college.\n\n\u201cWhen one of the leading Republican candidates when asked about this, said, \u2018Yeah, stuff happens,\u2019 \u201d Clinton recounted, to groans from her audience. \u201cNo. That\u2019s like an admission of fatalism and defeat. That\u2019s not who we are as Americans.\u201d\n\nClinton spent much of her time at both events responding to voter questions on topics ranging from Social Security to Islamic State to the economy. In Davenport, she spoke at length about her intention to protect gains from the Affordable Care Act, including insurance coverage for millions more Americans, and to address continuing problems in health care, such as huge price increases for medication.\n\nClinton singled out Iowa\u2019s dominant health insurer, Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, for criticism. She panned Wellmark\u2019s near monopoly in Iowa, and noted that it recently gained approval for premium increases of 18% to 28%. \u201cThat is a lack of competition,\u201d she said.\n\nWellmark spokeswoman Traci McBee responded in an email to the Register that Wellmark\u2019s rate increases were legitimate.\n\n\u201cRate increases in Iowa are designed to cover the increased cost of care as well as required fees and administration expenses. Nothing more,\u201d McBee wrote. \u201cIn fact, the Affordable Care Act protects consumers from unnecessary increases in premiums and prevents health insurance companies from using rates to make up for past losses or excessive profits.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Rt2gct", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The candidate says most Americans, including gun owners, would support reasonable limits.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "The candidate says most Americans, including gun owners, would support reasonable limits.", "title": "Clinton vows tighter but \u2018sensible\u2019 gun rules", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/06/clinton-vows-tighter-sensible-gun-rules/73489998/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The candidate says most Americans, including gun owners, would support reasonable limits.", "title": "Clinton vows tighter but \u2018sensible\u2019 gun rules", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/194610a340c1917ec7a189587f45947fb56ffdf1/c=1007-0-3835-2828&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797457144143515-DEM-2016-Clinton-Pres-3-.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Jeb Bush", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Persons/Jeb Bush", "title": "Clinton vows tighter but \u2018sensible\u2019 gun rules", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/de4d9e329e4ab102e137f7dc763564a68380ff14/c=1360-0-3481-2828/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797457144143515-DEM-2016-Clinton-Pres-3-.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e084379803cf36e0121873e69592ba0cfa53fd7/c=1007-0-3835-2828/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797457144143515-DEM-2016-Clinton-Pres-3-.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e5968ead8fd4a9567ad294fbd401faa4519bebb/c=540-0-4301-2828/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797457144143515-DEM-2016-Clinton-Pres-3-.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ee2042aeb1a461ee48684bfd996aac4053d9a0d/c=0-0-4837-2733&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797457144143515-DEM-2016-Clinton-Pres-3-.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-10-06T21:07:04.357000-04:00", "shorthed": "Clinton vows tighter but \u2018sensible\u2019 gun rules", "articleid": 73489998, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5f0225c57cb6802f4811ea6b636375c2d85f4a23/c=0-0-4837-2733/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797457144143515-DEM-2016-Clinton-Pres-3-.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/82a3d66b12b1d81c75a885b1f6d7bfb8a63b61c3/c=1629-0-3213-2828/local/-/media/2015/10/06/IAGroup/DesMoines/635797457144143515-DEM-2016-Clinton-Pres-3-.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2b4\"", "article_summary": "Clinton has spoken throughout the campaign about her intention to implement tighter gun rules, despite pressure from the National Rifle Association.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks during a community forum, Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2015, in Davenport.\n\u201cWe keep getting stymied because of the lobby for a very small minority of gun owners and the gun manufacturers, which stand in the way,\u201d she said.\n\u201cRate increases in Iowa are designed to cover the increased cost of care as well as required fees and administration expenses.\nAmong other things, she favors broader background checks, including for sales at gun shows, and stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers or people with serious mental health problems."}
