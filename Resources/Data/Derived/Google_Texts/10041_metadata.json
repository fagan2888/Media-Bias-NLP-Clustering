Things cleared up pretty fast and, I\u2019ve been down that road before and didn\u2019t want to go down it again. I don\u2019t want to miss any hockey here.\u201d\n\nForward Jesse Winchester, who has not yet played for the Avs after suffering a concussion in the preseason, has been medically cleared and might make his season debut Thursday against the visiting New York Islanders, Avs coach Patrick Roy said.\n\nWinchester was signed as a free agent last summer and expected to bolster the third- and fourth lines.\n\n\u201cFeeling good and eager to get back with the guys,\u201d Winchester said. \u201cI felt pretty good in the preseason and was having fun.
