However, actual construction on the new QuikTrip isn\u2019t expected to start until the first quarter of next year, says QT spokesman Mike Thornbrugh.\n\nOnce construction starts, he says, stores typically take 25 weeks to complete.\n\nThis is the latest in a recent string of upgrades for QuikTrip.\n\nThe company has been updating existing stores and outfitting them with an in-house food-service concept, called QT Kitchens. Those give customers opportunities to purchase made-to-order food and drinks.\n\nQuikTrip is also adding new stores across the Wichita area, some of which are to replace existing stores, while others are in areas that have not had a QuikTrip before.\n\nSites near Highway K-96 and Ridge Road and K-96 and Oliver are under construction and are among the brand new stores QuikTrip has planned for the Wichita area.\n\nQuikTrip also recently added a replacement store at 37th Street North and Rock Road and has another planned for 47th Street South and Hydraulic.\n\nQuikTrip won\u2019t disclose publicly the extent of its capital improvement plan in Wichita, but it\u2019s clear the plan is extensive.\n\n\u201cWhen we are finished, Wichita is going to be like a brand new division for us,\u201d Thornbrugh says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of capital and a lot of effort.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "QuikTrip Corp. is moving forward with plans to transform a former Dillons grocery store into a gas station.", "language": "english", "author": "Josh Heck Reporter- Wichita Business Journal", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/QuikTrip-to-build-new-store-near-Lincoln-Hydraulic-278154121.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/qtopening7.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "QuikTrip Corp. is moving forward with plans to transform a former Dillons grocery store into a gas station.", "title": "QuikTrip to build new store near Lincoln, Hydraulic"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "QuikTrip Corp. is moving forward with plans to transform a former Dillons grocery store into a gas station.", "title": "QuikTrip to build new store near Lincoln, Hydraulic", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/QuikTrip-to-build-new-store-near-Lincoln-Hydraulic-278154121.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/qtopening7.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "QuikTrip to build new store near Lincoln, Hydraulic", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "QuikTrip to build new store, near Lincoln"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb36\"", "article_summary": "The Tulsa, Okla.-based convenience has green-lighted a construction project to build one of its \u201cGen-3\u201d stores near Lincoln and Hydraulic, a site that is across the street from an existing QuikTrip.\nQuikTrip also recently added a replacement store at 37th Street North and Rock Road and has another planned for 47th Street South and Hydraulic.\nThe former Dillons building, which QuikTrip purchased in 2011, will be razed to make room for the new QuikTrip.\nQuikTrip is also adding new stores across the Wichita area, some of which are to replace existing stores, while others are in areas that have not had a QuikTrip before.\nThe company has been updating existing stores and outfitting them with an in-house food-service concept, called QT Kitchens."}
