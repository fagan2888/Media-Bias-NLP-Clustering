We apologize for the inconvenience to our patients who are running to the Dec. 15 deadline in order to continue coverage into January.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe remain optimistic that we will likely have the contract finalized by the end of the Covered California open enrollment period.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SANTA CRUZ >> Santa Cruz County residents who bought health insurance through Covered California and picked a Health Net plan to see physicians with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation will have to change plans for 2015 to continue seeing those doc", "title": "Health Net\u2019s 2015 changes affect Santa Cruz County residents", "og": {"url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20141210/NEWS/141219963", "image": {"width": "470px", "identifier": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016", "height": "247px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Health Net\u2019s 2015 changes affect Santa Cruz County residents"}, "twitter": {"domain": "santacruzsentinel.com", "description": "SANTA CRUZ >> Santa Cruz County residents who bought health insurance through Covered California and picked a Health Net plan to see physicians with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation will have to change plans for 2015 to continue seeing those doc", "title": "Health Net\u2019s 2015 changes affect Santa Cruz County residents", "url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20141210/NEWS/141219963", "image": {"src": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016"}, "site": "@scsentinel", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563358177?mt=8", "iphone": "id499677382?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.santacruzsentinel"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "business,cityeditor,hcare,jondigumz,santacruz, Business", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "business,cityeditor,hcare,jondigumz,santacruz, Business"}, "article_summary": "SANTA CRUZ >> Santa Cruz County residents who bought health insurance through Covered California and picked a Health Net plan to see physicians with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation will have to change plans for 2015 to continue seeing those doctors.\nHealth Net spokesman Brad Kieffer said he did not know how many Santa Cruz County residents are affected by its change in plans.\nOnly 2,074 Santa Cruz County residents bought unsubsidized health insurance from Covered California for 2014.\nAdvertisementPAMF\u2019s agreement with Blue Shield runs until Dec. 31 but 2015 is under negotiation.\nIt could be as many as 1,000, based on Covered California reporting enrollment by 15,000 Santa Cruz County residents and Health Net\u2019s 8 percent market share in the tri-county Santa Cruz-Monterey-San Benito region, dwarfed by Anthem with 62 percent and Blue Shield 30 percent."}
