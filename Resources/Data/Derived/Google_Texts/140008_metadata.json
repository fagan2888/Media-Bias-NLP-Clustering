For many years the GOP has advocated things that are supposed to bring the magic of the marketplace and individual incentives to health care: higher deductibles to give people \u201cskin in the game\u201d, competition among private insurers via exchanges \u2014 competition that would include reducing costs by limiting networks \u2014 and, of course, for cuts in Medicare. Now the GOP complains bitterly that some Obamacare policies have high deductibles, that it relies on the horror of exchanges, that some networks are limited, and that there are cuts in Medicare.\n\nKlein suggests that Republicans are really upset by other aspects of Obamacare, but are going after the easy targets even though they\u2019re attacking their own ideas. In a sense he\u2019s right, but as I said, I suspect that he knows that the issue is both bigger and simpler than he says.\n\nWhat underlies what Jonathan Chait calls the Heritage uncertainty principle? He describes it thus:\n\nConservative health-care-policy ideas reside in an uncertain state of quasi-existence. You can describe the policies in the abstract, sometimes even in detail, but any attempt to reproduce them in physical form will cause such proposals to disappear instantly. It\u2019s not so much an issue of \u201chypocrisy,\u201d as Klein frames it, as a deeper metaphysical question of whether conservative health-care policies actually exist. The question should be posed to better-trained philosophical minds than my own. I would posit that conservative health-care policies do not exist in any real form. Call it the \u201cHeritage Uncertainty Principle.\u201d\n\nWell, actually it\u2019s pretty simple. The purpose of most health care reform is to help the unfortunate \u2014 people with pre-existing conditions, people who don\u2019t get insurance through their jobs, people who just don\u2019t earn enough to afford insurance. Cost control is also part of the picture, but not the dominant part. And what we\u2019re seeing right now, in any case, seems to confirm a point some of us have been making for a long time: controlling costs and expanding access are complementary targets, because you can\u2019t sell things like cost-saving measures for Medicaid and limits on deductibility of premiums unless they\u2019re part of a larger scheme to make the system fairer and more comprehensive.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: Republicans don\u2019t want to help the unfortunate. They\u2019ll propound health-care ideas that will, they claim, help those with preexisting conditions and so on \u2014 but those aren\u2019t really proposals, they\u2019re diversionary tactics designed to stall real health reform. Chait finds Newt Gingrich more or less explicitly admitting this.\n\nHence the rage of the right. Here they were, with a whole raft of ideas they could throw out, like chaff thrown out to confuse enemy radar, to divert and confuse any attempt to actually provide insurance to the uninsured. And those dastardly Democrats have gone ahead and actually incorporated those ideas into real reform.\n\nOnce you realize this, you also realize that people who warn that by opposing Obamacare Republicans are undermining their own proposals are missing the point. Yes, the Ryan plan to privatize Medicare looks a lot like Obamacare \u2014 but Ryan comes to Medicare not to save it, but to bury it, so the question of whether his plan could work is irrelevant.\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery here; it\u2019s just top-down class warfare as usual.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131213103626, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 13, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/A Health Care Mystery Explained ( 20131213 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "What do Republicans want?", "title": "A Health Care Mystery Explained", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/a-health-care-mystery-explained/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002601391, "description": "What do Republicans want?", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 13, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1386948986, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-12-13T15:36:26-05:00"}, "utime": 20131213153626, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20131213, "pdate": 20131213, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "What do Republicans want?", "title": "A Health Care Mystery Explained", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/a-health-care-mystery-explained/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/a-health-care-mystery-explained/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "A Health Care Mystery Explained", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Ezra Klein is puzzled (or at least says he is; I suspect he understands it perfectly) by Republican hypocrisy on health care.\nOnce you realize this, you also realize that people who warn that by opposing Obamacare Republicans are undermining their own proposals are missing the point.\nNow the GOP complains bitterly that some Obamacare policies have high deductibles, that it relies on the horror of exchanges, that some networks are limited, and that there are cuts in Medicare.\nIt\u2019s not so much an issue of \u201chypocrisy,\u201d as Klein frames it, as a deeper metaphysical question of whether conservative health-care policies actually exist.\nThey\u2019ll propound health-care ideas that will, they claim, help those with preexisting conditions and so on \u2014 but those aren\u2019t really proposals, they\u2019re diversionary tactics designed to stall real health reform."}
