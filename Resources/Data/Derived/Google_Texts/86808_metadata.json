The Dreamliner itself made up just 36 of the 331 commercial plane orders and commitments Boeing announced during the air show.\n\nEthiopian Airlines announced its order for six 787-8 Dreamliners. The order had been placed earlier but was attributed to an unidentified customer on Boeing\u2019s website prior to the air show. The order is worth $1.3 billion at list prices, but airlines typically negotiate better deals.\n\nBoeing also announced a commitment by Garuda Indonesia to buy 30 787-9s worth $10.9 billion at list prices.\n\nDreamliner analysts don\u2019t appear too concerned about the slow sales in Paris.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfair to say that the 787 had a bad or a slow showing at Paris \u2014 there\u2019s still some 800-plus in the backlog that is yet to be delivered,\u201d said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst for StrategicAero Research. \u201cOn that basis alone, the 787 is doing just fine, especially as Boeing is on track to break even on unit costs on the airplane this year.\u201d\n\nAhmad said it also is unrealistic to expect big orders at every air show, especially with a calendar full of big events.\n\n\u201cThe 787\u2019s sales success speaks for itself and the backlog shows it,\u201d Ahmad said. \u201cWith so many airlines already 787 customers, you can\u2019t expect every air show to churn out yet more orders while the backlog is still so big.\u201d\n\nUresh Sheth, a New York investment banker and Dreamliner enthusiast, also said time is on Boeing\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThis is just four days out of 365 and we have a whole other six months-plus coming that would see some major fleet contests being decided,\u201d Sheth said on his \u201cAll Things 787\u201d website. Sheth said possible sales include up to 100 Dreamliners to Emirates Airline later this year.\n\nEmirates has been playing Boeing and France-based Airbus against each other for the order, trying to negotiate a lower price. Ahmad said Boeing is the front-runner for the Emirates order, especially since the airline nixed an earlier order for Airbus\u2019 A350 wide-body.\n\n\u201cEmirates has never re-ordered a plane it ditched, and with no A350 (delivery) slots available ahead of the 787-10, Boeing is in prime position to land this deal,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with the orders, Russian carrier Aeroflot announced its cancellation of 22 787s.\n\nRay Conner, head of Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane unit, told Bloomberg News that he isn\u2019t concerned about the cancellation because the Dreamliner production backlog stretches past 2020 and another airline likely will pick up the slots.\n\nReach David Wren at 937-5550 or on Twitter at @David_Wren_", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Hot video doesn\u2019t translate to big Dreamliner sales in Paris, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalIndustry, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Wren, \r\nDavid Wren, 787,Airbus,Airbus A350,Boeing,Dreamliner,North Charleston,Paris Air Show", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The footage of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner making a dramatic near-vertical takeoff might have been the hit of last week\u2019s Paris Air Show, but it didn\u2019t translate into many sales of the long-range, wide-body jet that\u2019s made in North C", "title": "Hot video doesn\u2019t translate to big Dreamliner sales in Paris", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150621/150629981/hot-video-doesn-x2019-t-translate-to-big-dreamliner-sales-in-paris", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150621/PC05/150629981/AR/0/AR-150629981.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150621/PC05/150629981/AR/0/AR-150629981.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The footage of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner making a dramatic near-vertical takeoff might have been the hit of last week\u2019s Paris Air Show, but it didn\u2019t translate into many sales of the long-range, wide-body jet that\u2019s made in North C", "title": "Hot video doesn\u2019t translate to big Dreamliner sales in Paris", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150621/PC05/150629981/AR/0/AR-150629981.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150629981}}, "keywords": "Hot video doesn\u2019t translate to big Dreamliner sales in Paris , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalIndustry, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Wren, \r\nDavid Wren, 787,Airbus,Airbus A350,Boeing,Dreamliner,North Charleston,Paris Air Show", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-21T17:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-19T16:04:00Z", "author": "David Wren"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The footage of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner making a dramatic near-vertical takeoff might have been the hit of last week\u2019s Paris Air Show, but it didn\u2019t translate into many sales of the long-range, wide-body jet that\u2019s made in North C"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18ea\"", "article_summary": "The Dreamliner itself made up just 36 of the 331 commercial plane orders and commitments Boeing announced during the air show.\nBoeing Co. announced the sale of 36 Dreamliners during last week\u2019s Paris Air Show.\nDreamliner analysts don\u2019t appear too concerned about the slow sales in Paris.\nThe footage of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner making a dramatic near-vertical takeoff might have been the hit of last week\u2019s Paris Air Show, but it didn\u2019t translate into many sales of the long-range, wide-body jet that\u2019s made in North Charleston and Everett, Wash.\nBoeing also announced a commitment by Garuda Indonesia to buy 30 787-9s worth $10.9 billion at list prices."}
