El Paso County authorities say a suspect who barricaded himself in a home for five hours on Christmas morning died after shooting himself.

Sheriff’s deputies were called to the area of Fairfax and Niagra streets in the town of Security, just southeast of Colorado Springs, about 3 a.m. on reports of a domestic violence situation.

County sheriff’s deputies who first arrived at the scene were able to speak to the man, but communication with him was soon lost, said Jacqueline Kirby, a sheriff’s office spokeswoman.

SWAT officers entered the home several hours later.

“When they first entered the home, there were shots fired by the suspect,” Kirby said.

No one was injured, Kirby said, and authorities did not return fire.

About 7:45 a.m., SWAT officers released an undisclosed gas into the home.

“As soon as the gas was deployed, we heard the gunshot,” Kirby said, explaining that the man was found dead soon after.

Kirby said a woman initially called in the domestic violence report, but was no longer at the home during the shooting. Officials have not said how she was related to the man.

Further information on the case, including the man’s name, was not immediately released.
