Their militants abducted more than 200 schoolgirls in April in an unresolved case that has sparked a wave of international condemnation.\n\nEarlier this week, at least 14 people died when a bomb tore through a venue where World Cup fans had gathered to watch a match. On Saturday, militants stormed a village near where the schoolgirls were kidnapped and killed several people.\n\nNigeria coach Stephen Keshi said Friday that the violence had compounded Nigerians' frustration with World Cup results so far and he hoped to give them a victory on Saturday.\n\nBut Odikpo said he didn't think the violence back home was distracting the coach or team.\n\n\"Nobody should use it as an excuse, at all,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Mary Milliken, Editing by Nigel Hunt)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The Nigerian press covering the World Cup in Brazil seized on the high-profile soccer tournament on Saturday show their opposition to the Boko Haram Islamist militants by wearing protest T-shirts.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140621&t=2&i=910448022&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA5K0GQ", "title": "Nigerian press protest Boko Haram with World Cup T-shirts", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
