New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), when asked during Thursday's GOP debate to name “one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all,” that could be cut to balance the budget, pointed to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

Christie was then pressed on whether he’d cut “anything bigger than that,” since Planned Parenthood receives just $528 million annually; a miniscule sum compared with the kind of cuts needed to balance the budget.

“When you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can’t think of anything bigger than that,” he said in response.

Christie wasn’t characterizing the federal funding that Planned Parenthood receives accurately.
