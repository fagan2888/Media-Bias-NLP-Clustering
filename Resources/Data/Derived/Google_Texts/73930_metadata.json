The bill, which was proposed back in October by City Council Member Corey Johnson, passed 39-4 with three abstentions.\n\nJohnson stated that the bill was \u201cthe most progressive in the country\u201d due to its elimination of sex reassignment surgery as a requirement to change gender on your birth certificate. \u201cGender won\u2019t be about your physicality,\u201d he told the NY Daily News. \u201cIt won\u2019t be about your body. It\u2019s about how you identify.\u201d\n\nNot being able to change their gender on birth certificates forced transgenders to face myriads of obstacles, such as being turned down from jobs, accused of fraud, harassed, or attacked. New York City has joined California, Iowa, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C. in not requiring proof of surgery to change sex on their birth certificates. Most other states in the U.S. allow transgender people to fix their sex on the birth certificate as long as they have proof of sex reassignment surgery or some form of gender-reassignment treatment, like hormone therapy.\n\nSex reassignment surgery (SRS) involves altering the patient\u2019s physical appearance and function of their genitals or sexual characteristics \u2014 such as hysterectomies, mastectomies, chest reconstruction, and even some facial plastic reconstruction.\n\nEarlier this year, New York state \u2014 with the exception of NYC \u2014 passed a similar bill, eliminating the surgery requirement. According to the office of the governor, about 100 people seek to change their sex every year. Because NYC has a separate records system from the rest of the state, it was still required to enforce proof of surgery until now.\n\nNow, New Yorkers will be able to adjust their sex on birth certificates without hassle or discrimination. \u201cMy birth certificate was incorrect when it was filled out, and it is still incorrect to this day,\u201d Joann Prinzivalli told the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF). \u201cThe old policy was unfair to me and to other transgender people who just want ID that reflects who we are. I am extremely relieved and grateful for the City\u2019s action.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled by the passage of this legislation,\u201d Michael Silverman, executive director of TLDEF, said in a press release. \u201cToday\u2019s action will dramatically improve the lives of transgender people born in New York City. We thank Councilmember Corey Johnson, the City Council, and the Board of Health for taking action. The city\u2019s policy served only to harm transgender people, and they moved to change it. We also thank the many activists and advocates who have worked tirelessly to ensure that the city\u2019s harmful policy will be changed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nyc, lets, transgender, people, change, sex, birth, certificate, without, surgery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "New York City has finally joined the rest of the state in allowing transgender people to change their sex designation on birth certificates, without requiring a proof of surgery.", "title": "NYC Lets Transgender People Change Birth Certificate Without Surgery", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nyc-lets-transgender-people-change-sex-birth-certificate-without-surgery-313624", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/09/transgender.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York City has finally joined the rest of the state in allowing transgender people to change their sex designation on birth certificates, without requiring a proof of surgery.", "title": "NYC Lets Transgender People Change Birth Certificate Without Surgery", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nyc-lets-transgender-people-change-sex-birth-certificate-without-surgery-313624", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/09/transgender.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/09/transgender.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2014-12-09T15:59:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-09T15:59:27-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "New York City has finally joined the rest of the state in allowing transgender people to change their sex designation on birth certificates, without requiring a proof of surgery."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde01\"", "article_summary": "Transgender people in New York City will now be able to change the sex designation on their birth certificate without getting surgery, thanks to a bill passed by the NYC Council on Monday.\nJohnson stated that the bill was \u201cthe most progressive in the country\u201d due to its elimination of sex reassignment surgery as a requirement to change gender on your birth certificate.\nNew York City has joined California, Iowa, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C. in not requiring proof of surgery to change sex on their birth certificates.\nMost other states in the U.S. allow transgender people to fix their sex on the birth certificate as long as they have proof of sex reassignment surgery or some form of gender-reassignment treatment, like hormone therapy.\nSex reassignment surgery (SRS) involves altering the patient\u2019s physical appearance and function of their genitals or sexual characteristics \u2014 such as hysterectomies, mastectomies, chest reconstruction, and even some facial plastic reconstruction."}
