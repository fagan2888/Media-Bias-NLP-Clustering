That was a 88% increase from the same period in 2014.\n\nSo where did the proceeds from all these new muni bonds go? Not to new roads, bridges and tunnels, according to recent data.\n\nIn fact, almost 70% of year-to-date muni bond issuance went to refinance existing debt, as opposed to new capital spending, said Jim Grabovac, senior portfolio manager at McDonnell Investment Management.\n\nOr, as Schankel put it, \u201cthere is \u2018new\u2019 [bonds] as in new to the market and then again there is \u2018new\u2019 as in new money for new projects.\u201d\n\nAs the chart below indicates, the share of new bond sales that is spent on capital projects has declined by 37.4% over the past 15 years:\n\nThe percentage of new municipal bond proceeds that are used for infrastructure spending has declined\n\nThe chart tracks the percentage of new muni bonds that are used for capital projects, such as roads, bridges and other public infrastructure\u2014as opposed to refinancing existing debt.\n\nThe share of bond proceeds that is actually used for the construction of new projects, or maintenance, has declined over the past four years.\n\nThe reason is that cities and states are trying to take advantage of the low-interest rate environment to lower their debt obligations, said Rob Williams, director of income planning for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\nThe word on the street is that \u201cif you\u2019re a local government and you can refinance your debt, you\u2019ll do it,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAs the window of opportunity is closing, given that a potential interest-rate increase could be approaching, the trend has picked up in 2015.\n\nNew muni-bond issuance year to date is currently at $145.9 billion, 60% above the same 2014 period, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma).\n\nBut new capital has in fact fallen by 4% compared with last year, whereas year-to-date refinancing volume is currently up 122.7% from the same period in 2014, according to Sifma.\n\nThe trend may suggest that U.S. states and municipalities are still in austerity mode. Refinancing muni bonds\u2014just like refinancing mortgages or student loans\u2014is a way to obtain lower interest rates on existing debt, thus reducing the cost of repayment.\n\nThis means that municipalities aren't increasing their debt, but rather paying off their existing loans and substituting it with new bonds with a lower interest rate.\n\n\u201cThe aftermath of the 2008 recession is still very sharply in the minds of public administrators,\u201d Williams said.\n\nUnlike the corporate space, where debt is ballooning even as earnings fall, public administrators are in fact hesitant to borrow for new projects and are still in the process of delevering balance sheets.\n\nAfter the recession, monthly municipal-bond issuances dropped about 68%, according to a Brookings Institution research paper.\n\nIn response to the credit crunch, Congress created the Build America Bonds (BABs) program through the \u201cstimulus\u201d bill of 2009, which authorized state and local governments to issue special taxable bonds that received either a direct federal subsidy or a federal tax credit.\n\nThe program expired in 2010 and in the past two years, congressional budget sequestration put a damper on the market. In fact, spending cuts reduced the federal BABs subsidy by 8.7% in 2013 and since then, municipalities have been redeeming their BABs to cut costs and to take advantage of historically low interest rates, the Brookings report showed.\n\nIn this context, it is no coincidence that net government investment as a share of GDP has been near all-time lows at the beginning of 2015.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The municipal bond market has seen a selling spree of new bonds in 2015.
