My boyfriend had taken me to sunny Riverside to meet his parents and their lovable Weimaraner, Clancy. On the drive home, I remembered something from my childhood.\n\n\u201cMy family almost got a Weimaraner, too,\u201d I recalled. \u201cBut we thought they were kind of ugly, so we opted for a Great Dane instead.\u201d\n\nIt seemed an innocuous enough comment, though in retrospect telling a guy his dog is ugly could be right up there with insulting his mother or something. But even that did not justify the torrent of anger that consumed the entire hour-long drive home. Words no one had ever spoken to me before torpedoed out of his mouth.\n\n\u201cCunt!\u201d \u201cFucking bitch!\u201d \u201cIdiot!\u201d he screamed at me, unleashing his own dogs of hell on this terrified and captive audience of one. I had to fight the overwhelming urge to open the car door and jump out onto the rushing freeway to escape this verbal attack.\n\nI felt emotionally battered, bloodied and bruised. Tomorrow, I thought, I\u2019d break up with him. The intensity of his anger wasn\u2019t normal. And it scared me. Yes, I was new in town and hadn\u2019t made many friends yet. But I vowed to find my own way without him \u2026 as I always had before we\u2019d met.\n\nMy fighting, independent spirit was speaking to me even then, banging the wake-up drum. Regretfully, I would ignore it.\n\nThe next day he called with his tail between his legs.\n\n\u201cI really overreacted. I\u2019m so sorry, Babe,\u201d he said.\n\nI accepted his heartfelt and sincere apology, and with it, I took that first step into the rabbit hole of love and denial. Down, down, down I would spiral into what was supposed to be a wonderland, losing perspective\u2014and my beautiful spirit\u2014along the way.\n\nIt is this sacred female spirit that Gloria Champion wants to remind every abused woman that she must protect. For 21 years, Champion was the executive director of Home for Women and Children, a nonprofit shelter on the Navajo reservation. As Champion was helping hundreds of Native and non-Native women heal and gather the strength they needed to leave their abusers, she too was healing from a sexual assault.\n\nThrough the prayers and songs of a Navajo medicine man, the Comanche native had a life-changing experience.\n\n\u201cI saw this beautiful Plains native woman dancing before me in a white buckskin, and the lower part was a jingle dress,\u201d recalled Champion in a recent interview. \u201cI could just feel her purity.\u201d\n\nA spirit was speaking to her, she said, urging her to keep watching.\n\n\u201cShe was so pure and continued to dance with this beautiful eagle plume, then joined with my spine and became one with me,\u201d Champion said. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I could feel what it was like to never be sexually abused, to never have been beaten or tossed aside.\u201d\n\nChampion said that all women are pure and have a great beauty but have forgotten about their own empowerment.\n\n\u201cIn the Navajo tradition, women were thought of as sacred and strong,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of victims told me that this spiritual practice of honoring women was the first thing that went out the door when they were being beaten, because they believed what the abuser was saying to them.\u201d\n\nHer message to all abused women: \u201cIt\u2019s really way overdue that all women\u2014not just Natives\u2014reawaken and reaffirm their sacred power, and if you feel it slipping away, grab onto it quickly!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s help empower each other by keeping the conversation going about domestic violence.
