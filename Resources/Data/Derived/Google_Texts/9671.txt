Republican Texas Rep. Steve Stockman arranged to have a book calling for President Obama’s impeachment hand delivered to all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Stockman, whose Twitter motto is “Speaking truth to power,” ensured Friday that all House members have a copy of “Impeachable Offenses: The case for removing Barack Obama from office” by Aaron Klein and Brenda J. Elliott.

The House of Representatives, currently controlled by Republicans, is the body vested with the power to impeach the president, having last done so in 1998 after allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice against President Clinton.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s investigation into the IRS targeting of conservative groups is ongoing. Special assistant to the president for health policy Jeanne Lambrew, the top White House official in charge of Obamacare implementation, exchanged confidential taxpayer information with IRS official Sarah Hall Ingram, according to emails obtained by Oversight and previously provided to The Daily Caller.
