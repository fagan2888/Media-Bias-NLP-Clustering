Let\u2019s give him a shot.\u2019\u2019\n\nHost Dagen McDowell noted that four years was enough time for President Obama to pass Obamacare, for example.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRight, well, that\u2019s the chance you take,\u2019\u2019 Boch said.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com\n\nBoch\u2019s why not-like case for voting Trump fits in with his remarks last month, when he told CNN that voting is like choosing which girl \u201cyou have to go home with\u2019\u2019 at 2 a.m. at a bar.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re single, you understand this. It\u2019s the end of the night, you want to go home with somebody. The bar is about to close. You have to pick somebody,\u2019\u2019 Boch said. \u201cIf you line up all of the candidates with their positives and negatives, I think Mr. Trump is the man.\u2019\u2019\n\nMcDowell also criticized that analogy on Tuesday\u2019s interview.\n\n\u201cErnie, at last call at a bar, the other option that many people choose is going home with no one,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cGoing home alone rather than getting in the sack with somebody who you\u2019re not very attracted to. So I don\u2019t know\u2014\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cYou have to vote,\u2019\u2019 Boch said, interrupting.\n\n\u201cActually, people can choose not to vote,\u2019\u2019 she said, as Boch shook his head. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Trump supporter, is that you\u2019re concern at this point, that people go to the polls and say \u2018I\u2019m not voting for either\u2019? Or, \u2018I\u2019m voting for Hillary\u2019?\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think if you\u2019re gonna go to the polls, you are going to vote,\u2019\u2019 Boch said. \u201cI think Mr. Trump has brought people out that normally don\u2019t vote.\u2019\u2019\n\nBoch has been in Trump\u2019s camp since last August, when he held a fundraiser at his Norwood mansion for the businessman. In addition, he tried to donate almost $87,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign for the cost of the event, which was about $84,000 more than the legal limit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What could go wrong?", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "What could go wrong?", "title": "Ernie Boch Jr. on why to vote Trump: \u2018It\u2019s only four years!\u2019", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/BDC_b_logo_transparent_background_og.jpg", "creator": "@ejleven", "site": "@BostonDotCom", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/smalltile.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Boston.com", "description": "What could go wrong?", "title": "Ernie Boch Jr. on why to vote Trump: \u2018It\u2019s only four years!\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tlumacki_trumpfundraiseratboch_s_metro990-850x478.jpg", "url": "http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/03/08/ernie-boch-jr-on-why-to-vote-trump-its-only-four-years", "type": "article"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/boston", "section": "News", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-03-08T11:23:29-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eric.levenson.3"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mediumtile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Or, \u2018I\u2019m voting for Hillary\u2019?\u2019\u2019Advertisement\u201cI think if you\u2019re gonna go to the polls, you are going to vote,\u2019\u2019 Boch said.\nIn an interview on Fox Business on Tuesday, Boch was asked why he was telling voters to choose Trump in the Republican primary.\nSo I don\u2019t know\u2014\u2019\u2019\u201cYou have to vote,\u2019\u2019 Boch said, interrupting.\nErnie Boch Jr. was one of Donald Trump\u2019s earliest and most prominent supporters in his run for president.\nBut for the second time in the past month, Boch\u2019s case to vote for Trump has been to promote him in mild terms."}
