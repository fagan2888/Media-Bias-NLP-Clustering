This is in contrast with Biden who, despite his record of supporting legal abortion, is set to receive Notre Dame\u2019s Laetare Medal, given \u201cannually to an American Catholic in recognition of outstanding service to Church and society.\u201d\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nThe Little Sisters are at the center of the current U.S. Supreme Court challenge to the Obama administration\u2019s HHS contraception/sterilization/abortifacient health insurance mandate, which would force religious organizations and colleges alike to cover the costs of services that contradict their sincerely held beliefs. Biden, on the other hand, in addition to publicly defending Roe v. Wade, legalized abortion and same-sex marriage, has been a champion of Obamacare and the HHS mandate.\n\nThe Little Sisters should be praised, stated McGurn, because despite threats of fines in excess of $70 million should they not comply with the mandate, they have \u201cconsistently refused to bend.\u201d Notre Dame\u2019s handling of the Obama administration\u2019s mandate however has communicated the exact opposite.\n\nWhile many organizations and colleges refused to comply with the mandate, even temporarily, Notre Dame chose to comply in the short term and subsequently lost its federal appeals court case, McGurn recalled. The Cardinal Newman Society stated its concern at the time, noting the poor example it could set for other Catholic colleges. And the website SCOTUSblog, which exclusively covers the Supreme Court, suggested that the University\u2019s loss may in part be due to its temporary compliance with the mandate.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only mixed signal, said McGurn. With the honoring of Biden to come just weeks after the Little Sisters\u2019 award, the University is sending mixed messages all over again.\n\n\u201cNot only does Vice President Biden have a long and loud public record in opposition to Catholic teaching on abortion and marriage, he is the second-highest official in an administration that Notre Dame has accused in court of forcing it to \u2018violate its own conscience,\u2019\u201d McGurn continued.\n\n\u201cOn top of this, the university gets a prince of the church\u2014Washington\u2019s Cardinal Donald Wuerl\u2014to come out for an honorary degree, providing an imprimatur that effectively big-foots the local bishop,\u201d he added.\n\nFt. Wayne \u2013 South Bend, Ind., Bishop Kevin Rhoades, along with students, alumni and a group of University faculty, have all voiced their objections in recent weeks, but the University has yet to budge or respond to the calls that the Biden honor be rescinded.\n\nIt is a shame that the University of Notre Dame has to muddle its award to Little Sisters with public honors to politicians who contradict the pro-life message. But the Little Sisters have fought for the freedom to live out their faith time and again, and regardless of the contradictory honors they will continue to do so, McGurn added.\n\n\u201cThe good news is, the Little Sisters do not punt. And if freedom does prevail over this mandate, it will be in good part because these women put it all on the line when others \u2026 took the road more timid,\u201d he said.\n\nLifeNews Note: Justin Petrisek writes for Catholic Education Daily, an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society, where this originally appeared.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Notre Dame Sends Mixed Signals Honoring Both Pro-Abortion Joe Bide and Little Sisters of the Poor", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "By presenting prominent awards to both Vice President Joe Biden and the Little Sisters of the Poor, the University of Notre Dame has once again set up a contrad", "title": "Notre Dame Sends Mixed Signals Honoring Both Pro-Abortion Joe Biden and Little Sisters of the Poor", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2016/04/07/notre-dame-sends-mixed-signals-honoring-both-pro-abortion-joe-biden-and-little-sisters-of-the-poor/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/notredame2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "notre dame sends mixed signals honoring both pro-abortion joe bide and little sisters of the poor", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With the honoring of Biden to come just weeks after the Little Sisters\u2019 award, the University is sending mixed messages all over again.\nIt is a shame that the University of Notre Dame has to muddle its award to Little Sisters with public honors to politicians who contradict the pro-life message.\n\u201cThe good news is, the Little Sisters do not punt.\nBut the Little Sisters have fought for the freedom to live out their faith time and again, and regardless of the contradictory honors they will continue to do so, McGurn added.\nWhile many organizations and colleges refused to comply with the mandate, even temporarily, Notre Dame chose to comply in the short term and subsequently lost its federal appeals court case, McGurn recalled."}
