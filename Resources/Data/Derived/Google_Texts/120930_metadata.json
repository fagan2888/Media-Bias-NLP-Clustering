That's when it distributes gifts to them and $50 gift cards to parents for Christmas shopping, along with food items for each household.\n\nCans for Kids raises money throughout the year by recycling aluminum cans. Many of them are donated by people like you.\n\n\"We do a lot of good Christmas and throughout the year. Can prices are down right now,\" said Cans for Kids representative, Gary Turbville. \"From August till our Christmas program we usually recycle about $3,000 worth of cans. But prices are down and we're not able to make that this year, so we're depending on donations.\"\n\nToy donations may be made at Long John Silver's on South Frontage Road in Meridian. If you would like to donate money to the Cans for Kids Christmas Program & Party, call Turbville at 601-513-0805, or send checks payable to Cans for Kids, 10898 Gilbert Joyner Road, Meridian, MS 39305.\n\nThroughout the year you may donate your aluminum cans to Cans for Kids. A collection site is located outside at the Cans for Kids office at 1207 19th Avenue in Meridian.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A local charity is looking to you for some help in meeting the needs of 200 children this Christmas.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "A local charity is looking to you for some help in meeting the needs of 200 children this Christmas.", "title": "Cans for Kids Ministry Seeking Christmas Help", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Cans-for-Kids-Ministry-Seeking-Christmas-Help-356194951.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/929/D2F/929D2F66FF944794A6952B958EE147F4", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/EE9/AAF/EE9AAFE03F0D45B49A1EC69DB1A294CD.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A local charity is looking to you for some help in meeting the needs of 200 children this Christmas.", "title": "Cans for Kids Ministry Seeking Christmas Help", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Cans-for-Kids-Ministry-Seeking-Christmas-Help-356194951.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/cans+for+kids+two.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Cans for Kids Ministry Seeking Christmas Help", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Cans for Kids Ministry Seeking"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b46\"", "article_summary": "Cans for Kids Children's Ministry will have a Christmas party for these children Dec. 19.\nIf you would like to donate money to the Cans for Kids Christmas Program & Party, call Turbville at 601-513-0805, or send checks payable to Cans for Kids, 10898 Gilbert Joyner Road, Meridian, MS 39305.\nThroughout the year you may donate your aluminum cans to Cans for Kids.\nCans for Kids raises money throughout the year by recycling aluminum cans.\n\"From August till our Christmas program we usually recycle about $3,000 worth of cans."}
