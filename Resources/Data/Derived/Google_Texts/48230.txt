President Barack Obama phoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, pledging future consultations with the U.S. ally regarding the nuclear deal made between Iran and six major powers that Israel opposes on Saturday.

The White House announced the call while Obama was aboard Air Force One en route to Seattle for a fundraising event.

Netanyahu, who had warned of the deal's insufficiency in the weeks leading up to the agreement, told his cabinet the deal was a "historic mistake."

In a readout of the phone call, the White House said the president and prime minister reiterated their commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.

"The President underscored that the United States will remain firm in our commitment to Israel, which has good reason to be skeptical about Iranâ€™s intentions," the White House wrote.
