Larry Hogan\u2019s signature, according to aides from the governor\u2019s office.\n\nOne of the proposals requires health insurers to offer fertility treatments as a benefit regardless of a person\u2019s sexual orientation, while the other allows transgender residents to change the gender on their birth certificates.\n\nThe House and Senate approved the legislation by wide margins earlier this year, and the LGBT community was watching carefully to see what Hogan (R) would do. Equality Maryland, one of the state\u2019s leading gay rights advocates, named the proposals among its top legislative priorities.\n\nHogan has until June 3 to either sign or veto the measures before they become law by default. His office said Friday that he has decided to do nothing, allowing the measures to take effect without his explicit approval.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really happy,\u201d Equality Maryland executive director Carrie Evans said. \u201cThese are bills that we worked very hard on, and they had bipartisan support in the General Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe decision provides one of the earliest indications of how Maryland\u2019s new governor will approach social issues, suggesting he has little appetite for stirring up controversy over such matters.\n\nBefore Hogan\u2019s surprise victory over former Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown (D) in the 2014 election, the businessman-turned-politician focused his campaign largely on pocketbook issues, especially taxes and economic growth. He called for \u201ctolerance and respect\u201d during his inauguration speech, and after nearly five months in office, he has neither taken up progressive causes nor pushed for policies that would satisfy social conservatives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re opposed to discrimination \u2014 all forms of discrimination,\u201d Hogan spokesman Matt Clark said Friday regarding the governor\u2019s position.\n\nUsing that simplified approach, Hogan has avoided the kind of social-issues debates that have tripped up many Republicans nationally, including Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who signed a religious-liberty bill last month that critics fear will allow businesses to discriminate against the LGBT community, and former congressman William Todd Akin of Missouri, an outspoken opponent of abortion who lost a 2012 Senate race after commenting that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely results in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIt seems like he doesn\u2019t come in with a very entrenched opinion on social issues and that he really is looking at each bill individually,\u201d Evans said of Hogan. \u201cWith a lot of the measures we\u2019re supporting that don\u2019t cost money, I think he\u2019s going to support them. I think he\u2019ll continue with a sort of fiscal-economic lens, and if we put forward something that would cost the state millions of dollars, he probably wouldn\u2019t support it then.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, LGBT advocates grew concerned about a potential veto of the fertility treatment legislation after Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) warned in an April letter to Hogan that the plan might inadvertently discriminate against straight couples.\n\nFrosh said at the time that the proposal could violate the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s ban on treating patients differently based on their sexual orientation by allowing lesbian couples to use donor sperm for in-vitro fertilization while continuing a requirement that heterosexual couples use only the husband\u2019s sperm. He clarified in a follow-up letter that he supported the legislation and that the General Assembly could address any resulting disparity in the treatment of straight and lesbian couples during the next session.\n\nHogan apparently agreed, based on his decision to allow the proposal to become law.\n\nAs it stands, Maryland\u2019s LGBT protections are among the most robust in the country, with same-sex marriage being legal since 2012, and more transgender provisions on the books than ever before.\n\nHogan has shown little desire to tinker with the policies.\n\n\u201cSo far, our record has been to uphold the laws that are already in effect, and the governor has no interest in rewriting any of them,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s our intention to uphold and enforce those laws.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Hogan\u2019s inaugural year has been marked by some hiccups on the LGBT front.\n\nFor example, a brief controversy arose over the governor\u2019s first executive order, which advised executive-branch employees not to discriminate against Marylanders based on age, gender, national origin, race, religion or sexual orientation when it comes to state laws and regulations. LGBT advocates complained that the order did not cover marital status and gender identity. The governor eventually added language to address their concerns.\n\nAnother brief controversy arose in January after Hogan delayed regulations from the previous administration, including one that would have barred state Medicaid providers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nSome LGBT advocates suspected that the move was an attempt to withdraw the guideline, but Hogan insisted that he just wanted to review all of the rules that his predecessor, Martin O\u2019Malley (D), pushed through late in his final year as governor.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have, in the middle of the transition, time to do a full analysis on every regulation, so timing dictated that we stop those regulations from being published to review them and fully understand their implications,\u201d Clark said.\n\nHogan green-lighted the anti-discrimination rule about a week after pulling the new regulations for examination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The proposals involve fertility treatments for lesbians and birth certificates for transgender people.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jadam.hicks", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The proposals involve fertility treatments for lesbians and birth certificates for transgender people.", "title": "New LGBT protections to take effect without Gov.
