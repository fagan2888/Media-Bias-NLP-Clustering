But so did folks who hope spending is still under control.\n\nNow everybody\u2019s trying to sort out the mixed message.\n\nThe answer matters because deficit debates and affordability concerns revolve around forecasts that health spending will speed up as the economy revives. If it doesn\u2019t, the future looks better for consumers, employers and taxpayers.\n\nTo hear hospitals tell it \u2014 based on earning reports issued over the last two weeks \u2014 we might be heading back toward the painful, 8 percent spending increases of the early 2000s. (National health spending rose only 3.7 percent in 2012, the most recent year for complete results.)\n\nThanks to expanded coverage from the Affordable Care Act that began in January, \u201cwe have seen higher utilization rates than maybe we originally anticipated,\u201d William Rutherford, chief financial officer at the hospital chain HCA Holdings, told stock analysts last week.\n\nHCA\u2019s admissions rose after declining in the previous two quarters. Revenue increased 5 percent, and the company raised its profit forecast.\n\nTenet Healthcare, another hospital chain, booked its best quarter in six years for admissions covered by private insurance. Inpatient revenue at Universal Health Services\u2019 general hospitals popped 12 percent. Most hospital stocks are up more than a tenth since earnings season began.\n\nSo the insurance companies who pay for all this must be getting killed, right? Not exactly.\n\n\u201cMedical cost trends continue to be moderate,\u201d Aetna\u2019s chief financial officer said last week. Cost increases at WellPoint for the second quarter stayed close to a tame 6 percent, the company says. It doesn\u2019t see that changing soon.\n\n\u201cOur underlying cost trends remain very well controlled,\u201d UnitedHealth Group\u2019s top financial officer told analysts. Cigna even lowered its cost outlook, projecting an increase for 2014 of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on?\n\nPart of the apparent contradiction is that health plans focus on per capita, not total costs, says Ana Gupte, who follows insurers for Leerink Partners, an investment house.\n\nPart of the apparent contradiction is that health plans focus on per capita, not total costs, says Ana Gupte, who follows insurers for Leerink Partners, an investment house. \u201cModerate\u201d expense increases for an insurer means moderate per member \u2014 even if thanks to the ACA insurers have many more members than they did a year ago.\n\nThat new membership is why hospitals \u201care getting new patients from Obamacare, and they\u2019re getting it in spades,\u201d Gupte said in an interview.\n\nBut somebody is paying for the expanded coverage: federal taxpayers, through subsidies for private insurance bought online and direct payments for expansion of the Medicaid program for low-income consumers.\n\nTo a smaller extent, employers are also probably getting billed for hospitals\u2019 revenue gains, as economic improvement means more people have jobs and employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nDoes this mean national health spending is off to the races? Not necessarily.\n\nPart of the second quarter\u2019s volume surge looks like pent-up demand from the previously uninsured, analysts say. That may not last.\n\nAnd not all the billions spent on Medicaid expansion and insurance subsidies are net new money to the system. The ACA partly compensates for those additional dollars by cutting federal support for hospitals to care for the poor and seniors.\n\nThe law also includes readmission penalties and other efficiency incentives that should reduce hospitals\u2019 future revenue. The Labor Department estimates hospitals cut 7,000 jobs in July, suggesting they feel financial pressure.\n\nEven so, health spending in the second quarter looks a lot stronger than it did over the winter, when bad storms helped shrink the whole economy.\n\nOne after another in recent days, insurers reported higher ratios of medical expenditures to second-quarter premiums even as they reassured investors about cost trends.\n\nThat\u2019s not very persuasive evidence that costs will stay on track, especially since health plans don\u2019t have a good record of predicting spikes, says Citigroup analyst Carl McDonald.\n\nIn a note to clients he writes: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to correlate plan comments on slowing [cost] trend with the recent commentary from some providers that underlying volumes are rising for the first time in years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Analysts who fear health spending is accelerating got plenty of evidence in Wall Street's second-quarter results to support their thesis.
