It's a lot of fun. It's a chance to compete against your peers.\"\n\nA number of athletes from out of state competed, including Katie Schewanick, 20, of Birmingham, Ala., who became a paraplegic following an auto accident.\n\nShe said became involved in athletics through the Lakeshore Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Alabama that serves people with physical disabilities\n\nShe said of the track events, \"I like that it's an individual sport, and I don't have to rely on anyone else. It's just me. And I like the speed of it.\"\n\nA number of the athletes were just beginning to get involved in the sport, like 13-year-old Cooper Hagler of Bartlett, who has been competing for two months. Hagler, who has cerebral palsy, has also participated in sled hockey and wheelchair basketball.\n\n\"I like that (GLASA) gives opportunities for kids with special needs,\" Hagler said.\n\nFor Cooper, there was a special Father's Day element, since he was accompanied by his grandfather, Mike Weber of Schaumburg.\n\nFor 16-year-old Brian Nelson of Lake Villa, this is his first year running.\n\nNelson, who has cerebral palsy -- he had a stroke before he was born -- said there is a lot of hard work involved.\n\n\"You just have to train as hard as you can and the best you can. The more you train, the better you get and the more opportunities you will get,\" he said.\n\nHe said the person who influenced him the most is Michael Phelps.\n\nAfter seeing Phelps compete, Nelson said to his mother, Ginnie, \"Mom, I want to go to the Paralympics.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Great Lake Adaptive Sports Association (GLASA) is hosting the 2014 Adult National Open & Great Lakes Regional Games at Lake Forest High School.
