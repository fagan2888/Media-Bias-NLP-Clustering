Obama is gambling that the Tehran regime, a longtime U.S. adversary, will live up to the commitments it makes, which many congressional conservatives strongly doubt. He is asking Congress and the American public to trust him to properly evaluate Tehran's intentions in order to foster peace in the Middle East. In another example of his new aggressiveness, he hosted a White House reception for Democratic senators last week to lobby them on Iran and other controversial issues, the kind of social interaction with stubborn legislators that he has resisted in the past.\n\n[PHOTOS: The Big Picture \u2013 June 2015]\n\nIt's all part of a larger dynamic that other presidents have faced in their second terms: the conflict between opportunity and overreach. And history is not comforting, because past presidents have often gone too far after being reelected as they succumbed to hubris and arrogance.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt overreached after his first re-election in 1936. In 1937, he attempted to pack the Supreme Court with supporters of his New Deal expansion of federal power, seeking to add up to six new justices. The effort failed, and it remains a blot on his record.\n\nRichard Nixon, widely seen as an imperial president especially after his reelection in 1972, misjudged the opposition to the Vietnam war when he escalated the conflict and, just as important, he underestimated the power of the Watergate scandal, which resulted in his resignation in August 1974.\n\nRonald Reagan endured the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal during his second term. But he also seized a historic opportunity in the mid- and late 1980s and forged a partnership with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev which helped end the cold war.\n\nBill Clinton let his self-indulgence get the better of him when he had an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and then lied about it under oath, which led to his impeachment by the House in December 1998 and acquittal by the Senate in February 1999. But he presided over a time of relative peace and prosperity, and his seizing of the centrist high ground is remembered positively by most Americans.\n\nGeorge W. Bush ordered a surge of U.S. troops into Iraq in 2007 to salvage the U.S. invasion of that troubled country, which helped stabilize Iraq but increased Bush's unpopularity with war-weary Americans.\n\nThere are several reasons for the emergence of an unfettered Obama. He was re-animated last month when the Supreme Court affirmed his health care law for a second time and upheld the validity of same-sex marriage as Obama wished. In a rare show of cooperation, he also worked with the Republican majority in Congress, and against his own Democratic legislators, to get a fast-track trade bill passed. This was designed to facilitate congressional approval of a massive Asia-Pacific trade deal in the coming months, which is one of his top second-term goals.\n\n[RELATED: Obama Hits Perfect Pitch in Charleston Eulogy]\n\nClearly, Obama seems increasingly relaxed and willing to take charge. As the first African American president, he has been more blunt in calling for racial justice, delivering an emotional rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" during his eulogy for African American worshipers recently gunned down at their church in Charleston, S.C.\n\nHe is moving more aggressively to bypass a Congress controlled by the GOP in ways big and small. He recently authorized an increase in overtime pay for many lower- and middle-income Americans. His Environmental Protection Agency is taking steps to limit coal-fired power plants, a major source of carbon emissions. He has ordered fewer deportations of people who entered the United States illegally. He plans to use his executive clemency power to free dozens of federal prisoners who have been jailed on nonviolent drug offenses, according to the New York Times. This is part of his larger effort to change criminal justice policies and reduce the massive incarcerations of recent years, especially the jailing of African American men. On foreign policy, he continues authorizing deadly drone strikes to kill leaders of the Islamic extremist movement around the world. He is maintaining sanctions against Russia to pressure the Kremlin to stop its bellicose approach to Ukraine. He has announced plans to restore diplomatic relations with long-time adversary Cuba and intends to reopen the U.S. Embassy in Havana. \"This is what change looks like,\" he said in a White House speech last week.\n\nOn a light-hearted but revealing note, he jumped back into pop culture by expressing his chagrin over a New York Times recipe for guacamole that included the unusual addition of peas. Obama tweeted that it sounded like a bad idea to him: \"Respect the NYT, but not buying peas in guac. Onions, garlic, hot peppers. Classic.\" He congratulated the U.S. soccer team for winning the Women's World Cup last Sunday night, tweeting, \"What a win for Team USA! Your country is so proud of all of you. Come visit the White House with the World Cup soon.\" The Associated Press reported, \"Obama is composing his own tweets almost daily, weighing in on issues of the day from any location without the filter of his press office. He's been tweeting with increased frequency since inaugurating his personal twitter account, @POTUS, earlier this summer.\" He has more than 3 million Twitter followers so far. All these tweets provide more evidence of a looser, more activist commander in chief.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Report [News]", "title": "President Obama's New Bold Style Shows With Iran Negotiations", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "President Obama is pushing ever more aggressively for his political and policy goals.", "title": "The Take-Charge President", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/07/13/president-obamas-new-bold-style-shows-with-iran-negotiations", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c3/4f/630362b64dcb944f70f5d28b2d73/150713reportpres-editorial.pres.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama is pushing ever more aggressively for his political and policy goals.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "President Obama's New Bold Style Shows With Iran Negotiations"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "July 13, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kenneth T.
