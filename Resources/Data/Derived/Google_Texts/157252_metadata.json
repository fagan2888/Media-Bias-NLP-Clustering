The demolition came as the Sunni-led, al-Qaeda-linked militants\u2014who stormed Mosul June 10 and have since occupied Iraq\u2019s second largest city and the surrounding area in Nineveh province\u2014also demolished tombs and related sites sacred to Shiite Muslims. Already the fighters have chased thousands of Christians out of Mosul, confiscating their homes and belongings.\n\nIn addition\u2014according to Archimandrite Emanuel Youkhana, an Assyrian Christian leader who heads the Christian Aid Program in northern Iraq\u2014Islamic State fighters have seized all 30 churches and monasteries in the Mosul area, removing their crosses and burning or destroying many of the buildings. They have converted to a mosque the Syriac Orthodox Cathedral in Mosul\u2019s Al Shurta district, Mar Ephraim, installing loudspeakers issuing calls to Islamic prayer. Two ancient monasteries have been looted and their residents forced to convert to Islam or be killed, forcing them to flee into exile farther north.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

This is a huge loss for human beings everywhere.\u201d\n\nIslamic State militants also are targeting non-Sunni Muslim communities, and Youkhana said he believed all Yezedis, a minority Kurdish religious community, have been forced out of the area since June.\n\nIn a further sign of Islamic State brutality, reports emerged yesterday that the terror group is ordering women ages 11 to 46 in and around Mosul to undergo female circumcision. The BBC and Al Jazeera quoted a top UN official who said that militants controlling the city since June issued the decree, which could affect 4 million women.\n\n\u201cThis is not the will of Iraqi people, or the women of Iraq in these vulnerable areas covered by the terrorists,\u201d said Jacqueline Braddock, the UN\u2019s resident and humanitarian coordinator in Iraq. The decree was posted on Twitter, but several sources in Iraq have questioned its authenticity.\n\nFemale genital mutilation, a ritual cutting and suturing of women\u2019s genitals, has been practiced by some groups in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia as way to prepare women for marriage. It poses many health risks: severe bleeding, infection, problems with urinating, and increased risk of newborn deaths in childbirth. Its practice in Iraq is not common or widespread, and many countries have banned it in recent years. The UN approved a resolution calling on member states to ban the procedure in 2012.\n\nEvents have reached a point of madness on Iraq. With the worst atrocities and injustices being carried out in broad daylight, the Obama administration is determined to pretend that the Iraq war did not happen\u2014that thousands of American families didn\u2019t commit their loved ones to serving there, that lingering security pacts no longer exist, that the United States having been the primary force for change there for almost a decade has no control over events, and that it can feign indifference without consequence.\n\nSince the Islamic State ordered the ethnic and religious cleansing of Christians (mostly Assyrians in a city long a mix of Arab, Kurd, Turkmen, and Assyrian) a week ago, President Barack Obama has made no statement on those events. The silence is deafening, considering that former military commanders and Democrats are vocally taking issue with the president\u2019s posture, and that Muslim leaders in Mosul have spoken against ISIS. One, University of Mosul law professor Mahmoud Al-Asali, was killed as a result of his outspoken opposition of the terrorists\u2019 reign.\n\nNewspapers have noted the void, with the British Spectator saying, \u201cThe mass culling of Chaldean and Assyrian Christians brings out in Obama a streak of insouciance and laid-back cowardice that is very much his own.\u201d\n\nThe lack of concern is more striking considering the way Obama and the State Department under Hillary Clinton, both Democratic leaders affiliated with Christian churches, stood up for Muslim Brotherhood extremists in Egypt, joined a NATO war on the side of Muslim revolutionaries in Libya, and have sided with Islamic State affiliates in bringing down the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria.\n\nThus far this week the only reaction to ethnic and religious cleansing in northern Iraq has been from the State Department. One week ago it issued a statement calling \u201cabominable\u201d the Islamic State\u2019s announcement \u201cthat Christians in Mosul must either convert, pay a tax, leave or face execution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "IRAQ | The Islamic State destroys Jonah\u2019s tomb and other Judeo-Christian sites in Mosul while President Obama remains mute", "title": "WORLD | Steady destruction\u2014and deafening silence | Mindy Belz | July 25, 2014", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2014/07/steady_destruction_and_deafening_silence", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/ap533224991874.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "IRAQ | The Islamic State destroys Jonah\u2019s tomb and other Judeo-Christian sites in Mosul while President Obama remains mute"}, "article_summary": "The silence is deafening, considering that former military commanders and Democrats are vocally taking issue with the president\u2019s posture, and that Muslim leaders in Mosul have spoken against ISIS.\nIslamic State militants have destroyed tombs long ascribed to the Old Testament prophets Jonah and Daniel yesterday in Mosul, according to eyewitness reports and video footage posted on YouTube (see below).\nThus far this week the only reaction to ethnic and religious cleansing in northern Iraq has been from the State Department.\nAlready the fighters have chased thousands of Christians out of Mosul, confiscating their homes and belongings.\nIn a further sign of Islamic State brutality, reports emerged yesterday that the terror group is ordering women ages 11 to 46 in and around Mosul to undergo female circumcision."}
