Candidate Barack Obama might take issue serious issue with President Obama’s use of executive power. Citing his time as a constitutional-law professor lecturer, the then-senator emphasized the importance of the separation of powers while on the campaign trail.

“The biggest problems we’re facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power in to the executive branch, and not go through Congress at all,” he told an Iowa audience. “That’s what I intend to reverse when I’m president of the United States of America.”

During last month’s State of the Union address, President Obama stated that he will circumvent Congress by using executive orders to push his domestic agenda. Earlier this week, the administration delayed the Affordable Care Act’s employer mandate for medium-sized businesses until 2016 and weakened it for large businesses.
