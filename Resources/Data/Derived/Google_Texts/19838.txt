Sisseton, SD

KELOLAND News introduced you to the Tiospa Zina students using a shirt to spread awarness about the Sisseton School Mascot earlier this month. Now, the girls are joined by Native American activists across the country that vows to change the Redman Mascot.

When the students first started raising awareness about what they say is a civil rights issue, they never envisioned the support they would have now.

The Damakota Youth Group and the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media held a press conference Saturday. They held a public forum discussing what they say is a dehumanizing mascot and what the effects are on Native American youth.

"We started making a Facebook page and a twitter and stuff on social media and get more people to want to interview us for magazines, newspapers, news and we took the opportunity because it is important and this is something that needs to be address," Tiospa Zina student Bethany Robertson said.

Some of the panel members were from as far away as Arizona and New York.
