WASHINGTON (WTNH) — Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy will attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address in Washington DC, as a guest of the President.

Every year, the White House invites a number of special guests to sit with the first lady. Over the years, we’ve seen servicemen and women, athletes, heroes, astronauts and survivors. Many times, the President references them specifically in his address.

The White House says the special guests for this year’s address represent progress that has been made since the President’s first State of the Union.

Governor Malloy, according to the White House, has initiatives and ideas that are in line with some of the President’s priorities, from criminal justice reforms, gun safety laws and raising the minimum wage to $10.10.

Malloy released a statement in response to the White House’s invitation to sit in First Lady Michelle Obama’s box at President Obama’s State of the Union address:

“It’s truly an honor. I want to thank the President and the First Lady for this once-in-a-lifetime invitation. We’re doing big things in Connecticut. We’ve passed the smartest gun law in the nation, and we’ve helped drive a national conversation to help prevent gun violence. The President is taking action on this important issue just as we have in Connecticut – it is commonsense to keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have them. We’re proud of that record, just as we are proud of the myriad other initiatives Connecticut has led on, from Second Chance, to being the first state in the nation to raise the minimum wage to $10.10, to the first state to pass paid sick days, to launching a first-in-the-nation green bank to tackle global warming, to the best implementation of the Affordable Care Act in America. Connecticut has an amazing story to tell over the past few years – and we’re proud to tell it.”
