Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat and the bill\u2019s co-author, said CISA \u201cincentivizes the sharing of cybersecurity threat information between the private sector and the government and among private sector entities.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt responds to the massive and growing threat to national and economic security from cyber intrusion and attack, and seeks to improve the security of public and private computer networks by increasing awareness of threats and defenses,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said.\n\nAs with similarly worded proposals that have surfaced during the past few years, however, detractors claim the language of the bill is too broad and brings up big concerns over the types of data that the government can collect from innocent internet users.\n\nSen.
