A national advisory panel comprised of sport-specific experts and sports journalists helped select her from nearly 430,000 high school volleyball players nationwide. Lanier is now a finalist for the prestigious Gatorade Female High School Athlete of the Year award, to be presented at a special ceremony prior to The ESPY Awards in July.\n\nThe 6\u2019 2\u201d senior outside hitter recorded 496 kills, 324 digs and 28 service aces while posting a kill percentage of .438 and leading the Gators (34-8) to the Division I state final this past season.\n\nIn addition to being a two-time 2015 First Team All-American, by the American Volleyball Coaches Association and Under Armour, Lanier was the top-ranked player in the nation as rated by PrepVolleyball.com.\n\nLanier also was a member of the U.S. Girls\u2019 Youth National Volleyball Team, leading some of the country\u2019s finest prep players to the 2015 FIVB Girls\u2019 U18 World Championship final in Peru last summer.\n\nLanier has maintained a weighted cumulative GPA of 4.21, spent nine days last summer working in an orphanage in Komga, South Africa teaching preschool-aged children, and volunteered on behalf of the Desert Mission Food Bank providing emergency food assistance to help families in North Phoenix.\n\n\u201cKhalia Lanier has been a star on the court since she led the Gators in kills the first match of her freshman year,\u201d said John Tawa, managing editor of PrepVolleyball.com. \u201cPhysically imposing on attack, she packs a punch few can match and has the intelligence and vision to make opponents pay in myriad ways. Her ability to score combined with a deft passing touch made her the consensus top recruit in the country. She played like it this past fall, fighting through an ankle injury to lead the nationally ranked Gators to the Arizona Division I final. In her four years, Lanier\u2019s teams averaged 35 wins per season and won a state title, and she was the principal reason why.\u201d\n\nLanier has signed a National Letter of Intent to play volleyball at the University of Southern California next fall.\n\n\u201cKhalia embodies everything we look for in a Gatorade Player of the Year recipient,\u201d said Gatorade Chief Marketing Officer Morgan Flatley. \u201cIn addition to being one of the best high school volleyball players in the country, Khalia has excelled in the classroom and been a positive influence in her community. She is a role model for younger student-athletes to look up to and we are excited to see all the things she will accomplish in the future.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Vincent R.
