Really?\n\nFor those who thought they had seen the last of Liz and her ill-fated and absurd challenge to Republican Sen. Mike Enzi from Wyoming, the state she hardly lived in and didn\u2019t know, she\u2019s back! And Dick, who can\u2019t resist a diatribe to justify his ill-fated and disastrous policy in Iraq, has never learned to zip it.\n\nThe worst part is the supposed substance of their piece: Iraq is all Obama\u2019s fault. He is \u201cwillfully blind,\u201d \u201che goes golfing,\u201d \u201che abandoned Iraq,\u201d he is guilty of \u201csimple -minded appeasement.\u201d The Cheney team\u2019s conclusion: \u201cPresident Obama is on track to securing his legacy as the man who betrayed our past and squandered our freedom.\u201d\n\nWhat drivel.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]\n\nThere is absolutely no discussion of the dynamics of the Middle East in their article. There is no mention of the deeply religious conflict between Sunnis and Shiites. There is no mention of the Kurds. There is no substantive exploration of the involvement of other nations, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran, in this conflict. There is not one reference to policy options that should be considered in response to the attack by terrorist groups associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, known as ISIL or ISIS.\n\nIn short, this is an article devoid of substance, let alone a reasonable discussion of public policy.\n\nSo, aside from being a vitriolic attack against President Obama, why did they write it? The answer is pretty straightforward, I think. The Cheneys are trying desperately to justify the unjustifiable.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on the Middle East]\n\nDick Cheney lied to get us into Iraq: weapons of mass destruction; Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11; the people want us there; we\u2019ll be greeted as liberators; chemical weapons are ready to be unleashed. On and on. Dick Cheney was one of the architects of one of the most extraordinary disasters ever in the history of American foreign policy: more than $1 trillion spent, thousands killed, a country destroyed. Al-Qaida was not present in Iraq before the invasion, but what about now? Because of the Bush-Cheney policy, we created more terrorists than we could ever have dreamed of killing.\n\nThe line from Dick and Liz that is truly astounding, and they seem most proud of, is: \u201cRarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many.\u201d It is truly sad that they don\u2019t recognize that such a line applies so much more completely to them and what they did. Their preferred policy was a complete disaster, and most people know it.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on Iraq]\n\nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush surely understood, when he wrote these words in his book about the policy decisions he made on Iraq back in the early 1990s: \u201cWe would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq. ... There was no viable 'exit strategy' we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been self-consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land.\"", "article_metadata": {"zone": "Peter-Fenn/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Dick and Liz Cheney Blame Obama For Their Iraq Disaster", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Dick and Liz Cheney have no business blaming Obama for the mess in Iraq.", "title": "The Cheneys' Continuing Iraq Disaster", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-fenn/2014/06/18/dick-and-liz-cheney-blame-obama-for-their-iraq-disaster", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/04/41/0ff026e24a19b382400610d95f94/140618-cheneys-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Dick and Liz Cheney Blame Obama For Their Iraq Disaster", "description": "Dick and Liz Cheney have no business blaming Obama for the mess in Iraq.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 18, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Fenn,Cheney, Dick,Cheney, Liz,politics,Politics [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Dick and Liz Cheney have no business blaming Obama for the mess in Iraq."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde611\"", "article_summary": "On the heels of Father\u2019s Day, we get a Wall Street Journal missive from none other than Dick and Liz Cheney, the father-daughter duo.\nAnd Dick, who can\u2019t resist a diatribe to justify his ill-fated and disastrous policy in Iraq, has never learned to zip it.\nDick Cheney was one of the architects of one of the most extraordinary disasters ever in the history of American foreign policy: more than $1 trillion spent, thousands killed, a country destroyed.\nThe worst part is the supposed substance of their piece: Iraq is all Obama\u2019s fault.\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]There is absolutely no discussion of the dynamics of the Middle East in their article."}
