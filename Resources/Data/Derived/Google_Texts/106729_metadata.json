He grew up in town and graduated high school a few years ahead of one of my kids. His initial questions regarding the refinancing of my mortgage all have to do with the house. I intersperse my recitation of the relevant specs \u2014 year built, square footage, lot size \u2014 with a thoroughly irrelevant story about the house across the road from mine. \u201cIt once belonged to Wally Cox.\u201d Of course, Wally Cox is every bit as familiar to him as, say, Archibald Cox. I explain that Wally Cox was an actor, and that he and Marlon Brando were best friends. \u201cOld timers in town say Brando was a frequent visitor.\u201d\n\nThe mortgage broker brightens, nods and smiles, and I lapse into a feeling neighboring on ease. Until we get to the income information section of the loan application.\n\n\u201cEmployer name?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t answer right away, so he rephrases the question. \u201cWhere do you work?\u201d\n\nInstead of saying, \u201cNowhere, everywhere, depends on the day,\u201d I reach into the accordion file on my lap. As I place my recent pay stubs beside the calculator on his desk, I\u2019m reminded of nothing so much as turning in homework in grade school, my response to what has been asked of me, always disappointing and frequently incomplete. I want now what I wanted then, a chance to explain, and I wonder for at least the hundredth time in my life why official documents don\u2019t provide a space for the real story, maybe a section labeled, \u201cthe narrative of particular circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe mortgage broker is quick with the calculator, but he pauses now, as he fingers the pay stubs from my teaching jobs at two different universities.\u201cYou\u2019re employed by \u2026 both these places?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, part-time,\u201d I say. \u201cLong-term, part-time. Five years at one place, 11 years at the other.\u201d I leave out the information that my employment is marked off in semesters, and some semesters only one of these two universities is desirous of my services. And, at any time, the permanent deletion of my name from the course catalog at either or both is a distinct possibility.\n\nHe asks for a copy of my most recent tax return. Flipping to the Schedule C, he says, \u201c This self-employment income \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s different every year,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t tell him that the number he\u2019s looking at is actually on the larger side and that if we were to flash backward or forward we would be talking about even smaller numbers. Instead, I sit very still, reminded of my grandmother\u2019s fake passports and doctored identity cards as she bobbed and weaved her way across Eastern Europe\u2019s ever-changing borders. My grandmother\u2019s best stories always included the breath-holding moment in which the papers were about to be discovered as forged and her access to freedom denied. Get a grip, I tell myself. It\u2019s not life or death. It\u2019s only money, which is something my grandmother often said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the self-employment income from?\u201d\n\n\u201cFreelance editing,\u201d I say. I could add that once every five or 10 years I sell a book, but I don\u2019t want to go down that road. I don\u2019t want him to ask me what I write, because I don\u2019t want to say novels, and then have to go further when asked what kind of novels. Here now at the bank, I\u2019m about as eager to say, \u201crealistic fiction,\u201d as I am to say, \u201cit\u2019s only money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pain of admitting to a mortgage officer \"I write realistic fiction\" for a living is almost too much to bear", "author": "Rachel Basch", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The pain of admitting to a mortgage officer \"I write realistic fiction\" for a living is almost too much to bear", "title": "A writer walks into a bank: Facing the financial fallout from a life dedicated to art", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/a_writer_walks_into_a_bank_facing_the_financial_fallout_from_a_life_dedicated_to_art/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/woman_worried_bills.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The pain of admitting to a mortgage officer \"I write realistic fiction\" for a living is almost too much to bear", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/woman_worried_bills.jpg", "title": "A writer walks into a bank: Facing the financial fallout from a life dedicated to art", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "A writer walks into a bank: Facing the financial fallout from a life dedicated to art", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, authors, Books, Finances, Writing life", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddba6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: authors, Books, Finances, Writing life, Life News, Entertainment NewsThe mortgage broker is very polite and very young.\n\u201cIt once belonged to Wally Cox.\u201d Of course, Wally Cox is every bit as familiar to him as, say, Archibald Cox.\nI explain that Wally Cox was an actor, and that he and Marlon Brando were best friends.\n\u201cOld timers in town say Brando was a frequent visitor.\u201dThe mortgage broker brightens, nods and smiles, and I lapse into a feeling neighboring on ease.\nHere now at the bank, I\u2019m about as eager to say, \u201crealistic fiction,\u201d as I am to say, \u201cit\u2019s only money.\u201d"}
