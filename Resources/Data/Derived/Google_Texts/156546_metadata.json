Mulligan, committee chair and a professor of surgery at Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe UNOS committee favors four to eight districts with no fewer than six transplant centers in each. Officials said this will give sicker patients equal access to organs.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there are many people that are dying every week around the country because they can't get access to lifesaving livers,\u201d Mulligan said.\n\nUnder the allocation system, donated livers first are offered to patients within defined local regions. If a transplant center rejects an organ, it is offered to patients within a region that might cover more than one state, and finally to all those waiting nationwide.\n\nThe donation needs to happen within hours because organ function can deteriorate.\n\nFederal officials prioritize transplant candidates based on a scoring system called MELD, or Model for End-stage Liver Disease. It ranges from 6 for the least ill to 40 for those at greater risk of death.\n\nPeople with higher MELD scores die more often while on the waiting list, Mulligan said, because some parts of the country have lower organ donation rates. He said donation rates match death rates, which vary because people tend to live longer in some parts of the country. Different lifestyles lead to different ages at death, which lead to differences in medically eligible potential donors.\n\nTransplant recipients in New England and California get organs at the highest MELD scores \u2014 above 28. In Pittsburgh, people on average get transplants when they have MELD scores between 26 and 28.\n\n\u201cThere's a huge disparity on how sick people are, depending on where they live, to have access to a lifesaving transplant,\u201d Mulligan said.\n\nPeople with MELD scores higher than 35 have a 33 percent chance of dying while awaiting a transplant, according to a UNOS analysis of 28,000 candidates added to wait lists between 2007 and 2010. By contrast, patients with MELD scores lower than 15 have an 8 percent chance of dying while waiting.\n\n\u201cMore people, year by year, continue to die on the wait list ... and this is an ongoing problem and certainly something that we have to do something about,\u201d Mulligan said.\n\nStatistical modeling suggests that using fewer geographical allocation districts would reduce wait-list deaths, Mulligan said UNOS found.\n\nA redistribution plan with eight districts would result in 342 fewer deaths; a plan with four districts would result in 581 fewer deaths, according to the analysis.\n\nOfficials for years have talked about establishing a broader sharing process because of a limited supply of organs. More than 16,000 people nationwide are awaiting livers; doctors perform only about 6,400 liver transplants every year, according to UNOS.\n\nThe timing to change the system has not been right, said Dr. Ngoc Thai, director of transplantation at Allegheny Health Network, because transplant centers with sicker patients would dominate the landscape.\n\n\u201cWe would have the entire country dominated by a few transplant centers,\u201d Thai said. \u201cNow you have transplant centers everywhere, so it makes more sense.\u201d\n\nA 2008 Tribune-Review investigation found hundreds of patients each year underwent liver transplants when they didn't need them. Some received organs when their MELD scores were 14 or lower, despite research showing they had better odds of surviving by waiting until they became sicker.\n\nUPMC was one of four transplant centers that, combined, performed half of the low-MELD transplants between 2005 and 2007.\n\nDr. Christopher Hughes, UPMC's surgical director of liver transplantation, said UPMC sees much sicker patients than before. Though the region that includes Western Pennsylvania is constrained by a lack of donors, other parts of the country have higher donor rates and organs go to people with lower MELD scores, Hughes said.\n\n\u201cSomething has to change to be able to make it a little more even,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nChanging the system would result in fewer transplants on people with MELD scores lower than 15, according to UNOS.\n\nHughes said some transplant centers struggle to perform transplants on sicker patients because donated organs are not in the best shape. Organs from older donors or people with chronic diseases are not suitable for people with higher MELD scores, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you start adding marginal donor with a very sick recipient, your outcomes are poor,\u201d he said.\n\nUNOS said a proposal might not be ready for public review until spring.\n\nLuis F\u00e1bregas is Trib Total Media's medical editor.
