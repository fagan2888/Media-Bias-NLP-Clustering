[Controversy Weighs on Obamacare ETF]\n\nWith a 2013 gain of 31.4%, the SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (NYSEArca: XHS) is on the list of this year\u2019s high-flying health care ETFs. Now that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is rolling out, XHS could see an even more favorable fundamental picture next year as more Americans obtain health coverage.\n\n\u201cThe math is healthy for hospitals: currently, hospitals \u2018collect four cents on the dollar\u2019 on their costs from uninsured patients who go to an emergency room for care but don\u2019t have the ability to pay. Under the new law, once those folks are insured, the hospitals will \u2018collect closer to 100 cents on the dollar,\u2019 said Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management in an interview with USA Today.\n\nThat speaks to the notion of XHS being arguably the most credible Obamacare ETF most investors have not heard of. Nearly a third of the ETF\u2019s weight is allocated to health care facilities operators, but despite that leverage to potential Obamacare profits, XHS has just $61.7 million in assets under management. That is, however, up significantly on a percentage basis from mid-October when we first highlighted the ETF and it had $55.6 million in AUM. [Hidden Gem is Another Obamacare ETF Winner]\n\nHospitals are the big winners in the Affordable Care Act because more people \u2014 up to 27 million \u2013 could end up buying insurance and going for procedures. Unlike in times past, the hospitals won\u2019t have to do a lot of those procedures for free,\u201d reports Eric Balchunas for Bloomberg.\n\nAnd that should be good news for any ETF with an over 32% weight to hospitals and health care facilities operators.\n\nXHS has stumbled a bit since hitting its all-time around $91.50 in late November, though it should be pointed out that as XHS has gained 65% over the past two years, its pullbacks have usually been shallow.\n\nSPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF\n\nETF Trends editorial team contributed to this post.\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.
