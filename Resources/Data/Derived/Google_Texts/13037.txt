The aim of health insurance is to shield consumers from the high cost of medical services, but one in five working-age Americans with health insurance has trouble paying their medical bills, according to a new survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and The New York Times.

More than three-quarters have delayed a vacation or major household purchase, and near 40 percent have increased their credit card debt.

In addition to struggling with known costs, about a quarter of those with unaffordable bills say they received unexpected claim denials, and about a third say they received out-of-network care that wasn’t covered by insurance. More than two-thirds of those who got out-of-network care didn’t know that the provider would not be covered
