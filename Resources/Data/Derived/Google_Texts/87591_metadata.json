Because the only thing better than having a wall on our southern border is having a wall on our northern border, too! Here are nine other reasons we should build it:\n\n1. Stop the Poutine invasion\n\nCanada\u2019s heart-clogging national dish, poutine, is appearing on more and more Seattle menus where it has become a Happy Hour favorite. The basic ingredients: brown gravy and cheese over French fries. The way it congeals on your plate makes you wonder what it\u2019s doing in your blood vessels \u2014 OK, we all know what it\u2019s doing to our blood vessels. A wall might stop this slow, soggy \u2014 albeit delicious \u2014 invasion.\n\n2. Halt \u201cGoing Canadian\u201d\n\nThe U.S influence has caused some to complain that Canada\u2019s unique values are fading away. (Look at the conservatism of the Harper government, for example.) But Canadian healthcare still is a draw even in the age of Obamacare: How many people do you know who yearn to find a way to retire in Canada just to get their basic medical needs taken care of? A wall might keep Americans from getting restless and \u201cgoing Canadian.\u201d\n\n3. Plug Victoria\u2019s sewage\n\nFor years, Washingtonians have wanted British Columbia\u2019s capital to stop dumping its shit into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Who do they think they are, a cruise ship? The right kind of seawall \u2014 an underwater wall \u2014 could cause a sewage back-up that would make them think twice before they flush.\n\n4. Solve the Salmon problem\n\nA wall could block all that water gushing from Canada\u2019s mountains which creates an inconvenient barrier between Washington and Oregon called the Columbia River. If we block the flow, it would eliminate the expense of restoring salmon runs and all the attendant environmental mitigation and regulations. Plus, we\u2019d get a huge trench that could be repurposed as a tourist attraction: The Grand Canyon of the Northwest.\n\n5. Keep the animals out\n\nA wall would keep out dangerous wildlife \u2014 and I\u2019m not just talking about Canadian soccer fans and BC bikers. Already, Canadian grizzly bears have been seen roaming the North Cascades, and wolf packs have reestablished themselves. A wolverine has been spotted as far south as California. A little upfront investment in a wall would save us the cost of deporting these undocumented animals.\n\n6. Help with truth-in-filming\n\nHollywood shoots \u201cSeattle\u201d TV series in Vancouver. A wall could be used to stop studios from selling the world on a false image of the Emerald City. I bet a lot of Amazon\u2019s new employees get here and wonder, \u201cWhere\u2019s Stanley Park?\u201d or \u201cHow come the mountains don\u2019t come right down to the sea?\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t Seattleites say \u2018eh\u2019?\u201d However, they can enjoy that Seattle favorite, poutine.\n\n7. Bring true peace\n\nWe\u2019ve been plagued with border skirmishes with Canada in our history. Remember 54-40 or Fight? Remember the invasion of the Guess Who? Remember the Pig War? A wall could have prevented that Hudson\u2019s Bay pig from rooting in our all-American patriotic potato garden. Sure, we\u2019d have to tear the actual Peace Arch in Blaine down to erect of new barbed wired, pig-proof Peace Wall, but if it prevents even one pig from dying\u2026.\n\n8. Stimulate wall tourism\n\nA massive wall would be good for tourism. Think of all the places that have flourished with walls that divide them: Berlin, Cyprus, the West Bank, the Korean DMZ. Walls just seem to breed vitality!\n\n9. A job for Bertha!\n\nHere\u2019s an idea. We build the wall, then give Bertha to the Canadians and tell them hey, we\u2019re not such bad guys, you can tunnel underneath if you want.
