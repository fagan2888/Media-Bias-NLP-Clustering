About 81 percent of these visits were made to an obstetrician/gynecologist; the rest involved a primary-care doctor.\n\nThe analysis revealed that primary-care physicians were nearly 2.5 times as likely as OB/GYNs to address such problems as mental health issues, metabolic conditions and circulatory, respiratory, digestive and skin diseases during a preventive gynecologic visit.\n\nAn OB/GYN is primed to focus on your reproductive system and may be less attuned to other aspects of your health, says Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nFamily doctors learn to deliver services ranging from routine heart disease and diabetes care to Pap tests and even obstetrics, Cohen says. \u201cI was just up all night delivering babies,\u201d she points out.\n\nMany women don\u2019t know that a family physician can provide birth control, Pap tests and other women\u2019s health care, Cohen says.\n\n\u201cThey think they\u2019re supposed to go to another doctor for that.\u201d\n\nCohen\u2019s study found that the vast majority of women see an OB/GYN for their annual visit, and Barbara Levy, vice president of health policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), says that\u2019s OK. OB/GYNs are trained to deliver more than just Pap tests, she says.\n\nOne study found that nearly half of obstetrician-gynecologists considered themselves primary-care providers.\n\n\u201cWe know a patient\u2019s background, her children, her worldview,\u201d Levy says.\n\nACOG has issued guidelines for well-woman visits, and these include not just Pap tests but also cholesterol screenings and immunizations.\n\nYes, Cohen\u2019s study found that women were more likely to receive non-gynecologic diagnoses during a preventive care visit at a family physician than at the OB/GYN\u2019s office, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the specialists are overlooking these health problems, Levy says.\n\n\u201cWomen who have a lot of medical issues generally don\u2019t see me for their primary care, and those who do are generally healthy,\u201d she says.\n\nBut Wergin says making a family doctor your primary physician could save you time and money by sparing you extra referrals and visits.\n\n\u201cIf you come in to me and you have something simple like a rash, that\u2019s part of what I do \u2014 I don\u2019t refer you to dermatologist,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2013 Christie Aschwanden, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/07/hfbirth09c.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9fc\"", "article_summary": "Q: Is it OK for a woman to use an obstetrician/ gynecologist as her primary care doctor?\nMany women don\u2019t know that a family physician can provide birth control, Pap tests and other women\u2019s health care, Cohen says.\n\u201cWomen who have a lot of medical issues generally don\u2019t see me for their primary care, and those who do are generally healthy,\u201d she says.\nThe researchers evaluated 7,882 records of doctor visits for preventive gynecologic visits that occurred between 1999 and 2008.\nBut Wergin says making a family doctor your primary physician could save you time and money by sparing you extra referrals and visits."}
