Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the Democratic presidential debate Sunday in Charleston, S.C. (Mic Smith/Associated Press)

Lester Holt: Good evening and welcome to the last Democratic debate before the casting of the first vote. That has a certain ring to it, does it not? No? Well, we’re going with it. First: Martin O’Malley, how did you find us? I don’t know how viewers found us, opposite “Downton Abbey” on a holiday weekend, but I DEFINITELY don’t know how you found us. We told you that the debate was in an isolated warehouse that sold long stands and that you could only get in if you found a snipe.

O’Malley: By God and the grace of Maryland, I found that snipe you asked for. But when I got to where you said the debate would be, there was nobody there. Fortunately, fearing this would happen, I had placed a tracker on Bernie’s belt, and I slipped in through the back when no one was looking. I brought this lectern from home. I think —

Holt: Thank you, Martin. That will be the last we will hear from you this evening.

O’Malley: But I am the only candidate on this stage right now who —

Holt: Hillary, talk to me.

Clinton: Hello. Happy Martin Luther King Day! I once saw Dr. King.

Sanders: I SEE WHAT DR. KING SAW! A VAST CONSPIRACY OF CORPORATE INTERESTS!

O’Malley: Excuse me, this microphone doesn’t seem to be working?

Holt: Hillary. Bernie. Please fight about gun control.

Clinton: Sure. Bernie. My oppo research suggests that this is your area of vulnerability.

Sanders: LISTEN, I AM JUST TRYING TO DO MY PART FOR THE SMALL MOM AND POP OPERATIONS SELLING LITTLE ARTISANAL GUNS THAT THEY HAVE HAND-CRAFTED WITH LOVE. WHAT ABOUT THE MOMS AND THE POPS, HILLARY?

Clinton: Please keep talking so that we have more B-reel footage to use against you later in this campaign.

Holt: So, health care? Should we burn the whole thing down?

Sanders: I say we BERN the whole thing down! THE TIME IS NOW! THE PLACE IS HERE!

(Wild applause)

Clinton: ARE YOU SERIOUS? LISTEN. WE HAVE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ALREADY. WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT? HAS ANY OF YOUR PLANS EVER ACTUALLY BEEN IMPLEMENTED? DO YOU KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT A PLAN IN REAL LIFE IN THE WORLD? DOES IT HELP IF I TALK IN ALL CAPS, TOO?

*O’Malley streaks across the stage in flag boxers in a vain bid for anyone to notice that he is there. No one does.*

Holt: What would you do to implement plans?

Clinton: I would go anywhere and meet anyone. I am even here on stage meeting with you now, which just shows how much I am willing to do to achieve the outcomes I crave.

Sanders: I will gladly work with anyone who is not in the POCKET OF BIG MONEY BUT ALAS THAT IS THE WHOLE CONGRESS IF NOT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

Holt: Hillary, why aren’t you beating Bernie among young people?

Clinton: *twitches* You think I know the answer to that question? You think if I knew the answer to that question he would be standing here right now? Please tell me what you think the answer to this question might be, and I will adjust my campaign accordingly. Lester? Anyone?

Sanders: YOU SHOULD TRY COMBINING A GRANDFATHER’S FAMILIAR DEMEANOR WITH THE POLITICS OF THAT ONE GUY IN SEMINAR YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE! I HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE A WINNING FORMULA! PEOPLE FEEL REASSURED BY ME EVEN THOUGH I LITERALLY HAVE SPENT THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN CRYING OUT FOR REVOLUTION LIKE A GRIZZLED ENJOLRAS.

Clinton: I can try that. Should I try that? I will try that.

Holt: Talk more about big money.

Sanders: CASH RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME, LESTER! TREMENDOUS CREAM IS SPOILING OUR POLITICAL PROCESS!

Clinton: I can deal with being attacked, myself. I am going to take this as an attack on President Obama. Nobody says anything negative about President Obama, not on my watch. Nohow, no way. You’ll have to get through me first. *whips out a Z6 Stormtrooper fighting baton and spins it menacingly* TRAITOR! Come at me, bro!

*Martin O’Malley has been escorted from the venue during the course of commercials and he is now leaping up and down behind the window shouting “LESTER! LESTER!”*

Holt: How do we stop him?

O’Malley: VISIT MY WEBSITE!

Holt: Let’s talk about global warming.

Sanders: Listen, I went outside one day in Vermont this winter and it was 65 degrees! I think that tells us all we need to know. It is good that we understand how this science works, unlike our Republican opponents who draw unacceptably wide conclusions about overall trends based on individual days when they experienced specific types of weather.

Chuck Todd: And now it’s half-time at the Democratic debate! Wow, what a rip-roaring game this has been! Some whiffs, some at-bats, some runs, some touchdowns, a few great serves! Please explain to me why this commentary is necessary.

Mitchell: And we’re back. Foreign affairs. Talk about them.

Clinton: *emits a low, hollow laugh* Look at the people on this stage, Andrea. Just look at us. One of us was actually secretary ofsState. One of us has been in the situation room. But that one is going to have to sit there with a polite, non-commital expression while SOMEONE explains that Qatar is the key to the region. And she will not twitch once.

Sanders: I just think Qatar needs to put more skin in the game.

Clinton: *does not twitch, not even once. Across the auditorium, a fire starts with no logical explanation*

Holt: How do you feel about boots on the ground?

O’Malley: (standing up at the back of the auditorium with a megaphone) LESTER IF I COULD, I THINK “BOOTS” ON THE GROUND IS A MISLEADING AND DISMISSIVE PHRASE! THEY ARE SOLDIERS, NOT SYNECDOCHE!

(Lester Holt tackles him.)

Mitchell: Senator Sanders, you’ve said some pretty strong things about Bill Clinton. Care to repeat them?

Sanders: FRANKLY I AM HURT AND UPSET THAT PEOPLE KEEP ASKING ME TO SAY NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT SECRETARY CLINTON OR BILL CLINTON OR ANYTHING THAT IS NOT THE EVIL CONGLOMERATE OF CORPORATE INTERESTS TO WHOM SECRETARY CLINTON AND FRANKLY EVERY POLITICIAN OWE ALL THEIR SUCCESS. I AM NOT HERE TO ATTACK SECRETARY CLINTON, JUST THE MALIGNANT INTERESTS WHO HAVE HER SECURELY IN THEIR POCKET. PLEASE GIVE ME A COUGH DROP.

Holt: Is there anything else anyone would like to say?

O’Malley: Hi. My name is Martin O’Malley, and I’m running for pres–

Holt: For the last time, not you.
