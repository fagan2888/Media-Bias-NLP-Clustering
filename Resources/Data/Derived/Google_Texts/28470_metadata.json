For the root problem is exactly the same. Congressman Henry Waxman argued about glitches in the ACA, \u201cif anybody\u2019s head should roll, it should be the contractors who didn\u2019t live up to their contractual responsibility.\u201d But that\u2019s only half right. Consider the sign Harry Truman used to keep on his Oval Office desk: \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d The problem is not just the profusion of private contractors who do the public\u2019s business so poorly; it\u2019s the fact that the public\u2019s business is being so relentlessly privatized by the government executives in charge. Slowly, the perceived imperative to privatize has become the political tail that wags the policy dog. The results are before us.\n\nWhy, indeed, was this massive change in how Chicagoans pay for their bus and train fares initiated in the first place? \u201cWhat was wrong with the old system? It worked fine,\u201d ran the first comment on the Chicago Tribune\u2019s article on all the abuse the poor bus drivers are facing from frustrated customers. Ran the second, \u201cI have never even heard a compelling argument as to WHY we needed a new system to begin with.\u201d\n\nWell, my friends, here\u2019s your compelling argument: under the old system, rich investors didn\u2019t get a piece of the action. Under this one, they most decidedly do.\n\nThe contract to replace Chicago\u2019s fare payment system was awarded to the publicly traded corporation Cubic in 2011 by the previous mayor, Richard M. Daley, for $454 million, and implemented with alacrity by the current mayor Rahm Emanuel. I\u2019ll have much more to say about this company and its many dubious works in the next part of this series. For now, consider this. In a separate part of the project, Chicagoans are offered the following opportunity, as advertised on the back of their Ventra cards: \u201cGo beyond transit. Call or go online to activate your Money Network\u00ae MasterCard\u00ae Prepaid Debit Account and use your Ventra Card for purchases, direct deposit, bill pay, and at ATMs.\u201d This is how the City of Chicago intended to turn its millions of captive citizens over to the commercial banking industry: hoovering spare change from the pockets of Chicago\u2019s marginal communities into corporate America\u2019s overstuffed coffers. Ad Policy\n\nChicagoans who choose to turn bus cards into bank cards will be socked with hidden fees: $1.50 every time they withdraw cash using your bus-card-cum-bank-card from an ATM,$2.95 every time they add money using a personal credit card. Two dollars for every phone call with a service representative (or, oops, each \u201cOperator Assisted Telephone Inquiry\u201d). Two bucks for a paper copy of their account. An \u201caccount research fee\u201d of $10 an hour.\n\nAt which point, learning about all that, they might cry, Help! Let me out of this \u201cdeal\u201d! Well, that\u2019ll cost them $6\u2014a \u201cbalance refund fee.\u201d\n\nNow, turning your bus card into a bank card is optional\u2014a program supposedly intended to help Chicago\u2019s underbanked poor. I liked this observation, however, from a Tribune article last March: \u201cIt may be a tough sell, some experts said. Many low-income individuals are cash-centric in their spending habits because they are wise to the way of credit-card charges.\u201d But not to fear, if you\u2019re a Master of the Universe investing in one of the participating multinational banking concerns\u2014Mastercard, First Data, or MetaBank\u2014backing the play. Even though Chicago\u2019s impoverished might not make ready marks for the scam, Chicagoans who don\u2019t choose the banking option will suffer hidden charges. There is, for instance, a $7 \u201cdormancy\u201d fee if you don\u2019t use your transit card for eighteen months, with another $5 charge tacked on for every dormant month after that.\n\nNote that I said hidden fees. How hidden? Well, the only reasons Chicagoans learned about them was that the Chicago Tribune pored through over 1,000 pages of legal boilerplate (for more on how impossibly complex user contracts rip off consumers generally see my reporting here) and discovered them.\n\nThe reporters at the local CBS affiliate, meanwhile, reported that First Data got an \u201cF\u201d rating from the Better Business Bureau, with ninety-seven complaints filed against it over the past three years. MetaBank was recently ordered to pay $5.2 million by federal regulators for another public/private hustle, a now-discontinued program of issuing debit cards funded by tax refund loans at interest rates between 120 and 650 percent with a fee of $2.50 per $20 loaned.

Subscribe\n\nThe Trib noted, \u201cNeither the CTA nor Cubic\u2026nor MasterCard; nor MetaBank; nor First Data, which will issue the prepaid debit accounts, have disclosed the extra charges or how consumers can avoid them.\u201d The city promised, though, that a \u201cCTA public education campaign on all aspects of the Ventra card, including the fees, will start soon.\u201d I must have missed it. Another fee which all transit users will have to bend over backward to dodge is the $5 it costs to get a transit card in the first place. That $5 is supposed to be refunded if you register your card online or by phone. I didn\u2019t learn about that until I began researching this piece, though I was unable to make the site work on my decrepit old computer. Then they decided to waive the $5 fee, but only if you buy your card via phone or online, not at vending machines\u2014which sort of compounds the insult against less-savvy customers or those with decrepit computers, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nNow, you might think poorer Chicagoans without even decrepit old computers should be able to hobble along paying for their fares like they always have, in cash. But single-ride tickets are going to be $3, instead of the normal $2.25\u2014with what the CTA calls a seventy-five-cent \u201cconvenience fee\u201d tacked on.\n\nChicagoans, these are the business partners your city has chosen. And this is the man in charge of protecting you from them: Forest Claypool, president of the Chicago Transit Authority. Some protector. Claypool wrote that \u201cthe \u2018convenience fee\u2019 covers the cost of producing the disposable tickets and is \u2018entirely avoidable to any and every customer\u2019 so long as they purchase and register Ventra cards.\u2019\u201d But as I noted above, poor people tend to use cash because they don\u2019t trust cards\u2014reasonably enough. But the black-hearted bureaucrat \u201cbristled at the characterization by many critics that cash-payers are being penalized\u2026\u2019There is no $3 cash fare,\u2019 he said. \u2018The $3 is if a person chooses a disposable, one-ride ticket. It has nothing to do with cash.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe editors of Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, no Bolsheviks they, disagree with his blithe assessment. They say \u201cthe embedded fees could prey upon the least financially savvy among us, those for whom a $5 charge here and a $7 fee there add up to real money\u2026 They rely on people\u2019s ignorance to take in money. And that\u2019s not the kind of business our public servants ought to be in.\u201d\n\nSo, so na\u00efve, Crain\u2019s Chicago Business. That\u2019s precisely the business our public servants want to be in\u2014\u201cpublic\u201d servants like Mayor Emanuel. As Chicago anti-privatization activist Tom Tresser explained to me last summer, \u201cWe have a massive global movement of capital which, because they\u2019ve burned their own fucking houses down through their own greed, don\u2019t have the gilt returns that they\u2019re used to receiving\u2026. So the new guaranteed annual returns that big business and big capital are looking for is our assets.\u201d\n\nNext time, I\u2019ll focus on the particular big business behind the fare collection system in Chicago\u2014and in Sydney, Vancouver and London, too. I guarantee it will be eye-opening.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chicago_subway_map_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Rick Perlstein", "description": "Chicago's commitment of almost half a billion dollars to privatize its transit fare collections sweated greed from every pore\u2014and it doesn't even work.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Chicago's commitment of almost half a billion dollars to privatize its transit fare collections sweated greed from every pore\u2014and it doesn't even work.", "title": "Chicago\u2019s \u2018Smart Card\u2019 Debacle and Privatisation", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/chicagos-smart-card-debacle-and-privatisation/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chicago_subway_map_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T10:02:06+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chicago's commitment of almost half a billion dollars to privatize its transit fare collections sweated greed from every pore\u2014and it doesn't even work.", "title": "Chicago\u2019s \u2018Smart Card\u2019 Debacle and Privatisation", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/chicagos-smart-card-debacle-and-privatisation/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chicago_subway_map_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chicago_subway_map_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "December 10th, 2013", "sailthru.title": "Chicago\u2019s \u2018Smart Card\u2019 Debacle and Privatisation", "keywords": "Ventra, Chicago Transit Authority, Transportation, Privatization, Cubic, Rick Perlstein, The Nation", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 109358, "sailthru.tags": "Cities,Urban Planning and Development,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "The Nation", "published_time": "2013-12-10T19:53:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T10:02:06+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "Chicago\u2019s commitment of almost half a billion dollars to privatize its transit fare collections sweated greed from every pore\u2014and it doesn\u2019t even work.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chicago_subway_map_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb59a\"", "article_summary": "And that\u2019s not the kind of business our public servants ought to be in.\u201dSo, so na\u00efve, Crain\u2019s Chicago Business.\nAnd this is the man in charge of protecting you from them: Forest Claypool, president of the Chicago Transit Authority.\nWell, that\u2019ll cost them $6\u2014a \u201cbalance refund fee.\u201dNow, turning your bus card into a bank card is optional\u2014a program supposedly intended to help Chicago\u2019s underbanked poor.\nAnother fee which all transit users will have to bend over backward to dodge is the $5 it costs to get a transit card in the first place.\nIt has nothing to do with cash.\u2019 \u201dThe editors of Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, no Bolsheviks they, disagree with his blithe assessment."}
