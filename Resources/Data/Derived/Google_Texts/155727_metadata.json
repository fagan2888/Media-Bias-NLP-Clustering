It turns out, however, that the symptom is a central part of the body\u2019s own defense protocol, and that messing with it ultimately comes to the detriment of everyone around you. With no fever, viral activity goes on unbridled, allowing the infection to claim even more victims.\n\nDon\u2019t Take Your Medication\n\nDr. David Earn, investigator at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research and lead author of the study, said in a press release that, ironically, drugs like ibuprofen and acetaminophen may for this reason be viewed as significant factors of disease growth. \"Because fever can actually help lower the amount of virus in a sick person's body and reduce the chance of transmitting disease to others, taking drugs that reduce fever can increase transmission,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe've discovered that this increase has significant effects when we scale up to the level of the whole population.\"\n\nHe added that the effect is amplified by the common misconception that a person\u2019s fever corresponds to the intensity of his or her illness. \"People often take \u2014 or give their kids \u2014 fever-reducing drugs so they can go to work or school, Earn said. \"They may think the risk of infecting others is lower because the fever is lower. In fact, the opposite may be true: The ill people may give off more virus because fever has been reduced.\"\n\nBoosting Influenza Rates\n\nEarn, who also happens to be a professor of mathematics at McMasters University in Canada, used a mathematical model to estimate the impact of fever-reducing medication on North American flu rates. He and his colleagues found, on average, these drugs drive annual cases up by five percent. This figure may sound small, but on a continental scale, it corresponds to about 1,000 more influenza deaths.\n\nThe current study adds to the growing number of efforts to improve national flu prevention and public knowledge about disease control. Another example is the recent New York City mandate whereby all children enrolled in city-licensed day care services and preschools must get seasonal flu shots. While these measures have been praised by organizations like Families Fighting Flu, they have also received excoriating criticism from groups like Autism Action Network, who believes that immunization can lead to autism and other developmental disorders.\n\nThat said, it may take years before new guidelines hit municipal health boards across the nation. \"Although we have put together the best available estimates for each parameter in our model, we have a long way to go before we can make concrete policy proposals,\u201d co-author Ben Bolker told reporters. \"We need more experiments to determine precisely how much reducing fever increases viral shedding in humans and to estimate how much more people spread disease because they are more active in the community when they alleviate their symptoms by taking medication.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fever-reducing medication flu, influenza, new york city flu shots, flu deaths each year, influenza control", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Fever-reducing drugs like ibuprofen may actually increase the spread of the flu by offsetting one of the body's most important defense mechanisms.", "title": "Fever-Reducing Drugs Make The People Around You Sick", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ibuprofen-other-fever-reducing-medications-may-cause-1000-additional-flu-deaths-each-year-267528", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/fever-drugs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fever-reducing drugs like ibuprofen may actually increase the spread of the flu by offsetting one of the body's most important defense mechanisms.", "title": "Fever-Reducing Drugs Make The People Around You Sick", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ibuprofen-other-fever-reducing-medications-may-cause-1000-additional-flu-deaths-each-year-267528", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/fever-drugs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/fever-drugs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-01-21T19:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-21T19:00:14-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Fever-reducing drugs like ibuprofen may actually increase the spread of the flu by offsetting one of the body's most important defense mechanisms."}, "article_summary": "\"People often take \u2014 or give their kids \u2014 fever-reducing drugs so they can go to work or school, Earn said.\nThis figure may sound small, but on a continental scale, it corresponds to about 1,000 more influenza deaths.\nIn fact, the opposite may be true: The ill people may give off more virus because fever has been reduced.\"\nThe current study adds to the growing number of efforts to improve national flu prevention and public knowledge about disease control.\n\"They may think the risk of infecting others is lower because the fever is lower."}
