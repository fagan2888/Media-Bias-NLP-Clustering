Mr. Troyan, 59, who works at a furnace at the company\u2019s new, $1.2 billion Brackenridge mill, said he was told to report for his shift, which started at 7 p.m. Friday and ends at 7 a.m. today.\n\n\u201cEverybody knew it was coming because of the company\u2019s stance,\u201d said Mr. Troyan, who has worked at Brackeridge for eight years. \u201cEverybody\u2019s saying it\u2019s corporate greed. They\u2019re trying to eliminate the middle class.\u201d\n\nAllegheny Technologies vice president Bob Wetherbee said significant differences remain between the two sides on healthcare benefits for current employees, benefits for future employees, the use of outside contractors, and scheduling.\n\n\u201cThese differences have remained since formal negotiations began more than three months ago,\u201d Mr. Wetherbee said in a statement released by the company Friday. \u201cATI has made substantial good faith moves throughout the negotiations, with little movement on these issues by the USW.\u201d\n\nThe last labor dispute at the company occurred in 1994, when a strike idled operations for 10 weeks.\n\nThe 12 plants affected by the lockout are located in six states, including the company\u2019s operations in the Alle-Kiski Valley. They produce stainless steel and other flat-roll products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate they had to make this decision,\u201d said Fran Arabia, president of USW 1196, which represents workers at the Brackenridge plant. \u201cAnytime the company wants to come back to the bargaining table, we\u2019re willing. We have a lot more bargaining to do.\u201d\n\nUnion officials said Monday that Allegheny Technologies had wanted them to recommend by 3 p.m. Aug. 10 that the company\u2019s four-year contract proposal be submitted to a member vote. Even before that ultimatum, union workers claimed the company had made arrangements to hire replacement workers and security firms that specialize in labor disputes, accusing the company of planning a \u201cD-Day assault.\u201d Recently, the USW warned workers to prepare for a strike or lockout.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that ATI intended to lock these workers out since day one,\u201d USW president Leo Gerard said in a statement released by the union Friday.\n\nThe company\u2019s contract proposal includes $4,500 in lump sum payments over the life of the contract. It also would require some workers to cover an increasing share of healthcare insurance premiums and all workers to pay higher deductibles and out-of-pocket medical costs over the life of the contract. There were no changes to pension plans for current workers, but the company demanded the flexibility to schedule a longer working day and hire more outside contractors.\n\nIndependent metals industry analyst John Tumazos said a provision of the Affordable Care Act that subjects companies to a tax if the premiums on their employee healthcare coverage exceed certain levels is one issue at the bargaining table. The tax had been dubbed the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d because it was expected to apply only to high-paid employees. But in fact, it is expected to apply to many companies with union workers when it takes effect in 2018.\n\nMr. Tumazos also said Allegheny Technologies must curb costs because it faces competition from cheap imports as well as domestic competitors with non-union work forces. He expects that operating plants with non-union personnel will make the company realize that it doesn\u2019t need as many employees as it currently has.\n\n\u201cI expect the company will learn that 10 to 30 percent of its workers are not necessary,\u201d Mr. Tumazos said.\n\nMr. Troyan questioned the company\u2019s assertion that the average union worker covered by the contract makes $94,000 a year.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, they owe me a lot of money,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said workers can make that much because the company asks them to work six or seven days straight for 12 to 16 hours a day.\n\n\u201cThey were scheduled that way because there\u2019s no one to fill in,\u201d Mr. Troyan said.\n\nMr. Troyan said he works 12-hour shifts, five or six days a week and seldom gets to see his daughter. When the family was discussing the possibility of a lockout recently, his daughter offered Mr. Troyan her Holy Communion money and money she was saving to buy a golden retriever. As touched as he was, Mr. Troyan said her willingness to sacrifice made him angrier about the company\u2019s tactics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so mad. What do you do?\u201d he asked.\n\nLen Boselovic: lboselovic@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1941", "article_metadata": {"description": "With no contract, don\u2019t bother coming to work, Allegheny Technologies tells more than 2,000 union workers at 12 plants in six states.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Art Troyan said his fellow Allegheny Technologies\u2019 union workers knew for some time that the Pittsburgh specialty metals producer would lock them out of the company\u2019s plants.
