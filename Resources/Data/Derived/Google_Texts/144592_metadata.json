REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque - RTR4U8LI\n\n4511104\n\nA group of Democratic senators is urging the Obama administration to delay a key portion of Obamacare because the results could be \u201charmful and disruptive.\u201d\n\nIn a letter exclusively obtained by The Daily Caller, Senate Democrats pleaded with Health and Human Services secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell to delay an Obamacare rule change that puts companies with 51 to 100 employees in the costlier \u201csmall group\u201d market instead of the \u201clarge group\u201d market. The rule change, which will result in higher premiums for many companies, goes into effect in 2016.\n\nThe letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill, Heidi Heitkamp, Chris Coons, Joe Manchin, Joe Donnelly and Jon Tester and independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe are writing to share our concerns regarding scheduled changes to the definition of the small group market under the Affordable Care Act (ACA),\u201d the senators wrote in the letter, dated March 12.\n\n\u201cUnder the law, employers with 51 to 100 employees will be included in the ACA\u2019s definition of small group market starting in 2016. Instead of providing stability, we believe expanding the definition will force those historically defined \u2018large group plans\u2019 into the \u2018small group market,\u2019 where they could experience higher premiums, less flexibility, and new barriers to coverage. We therefore encourage you to delay the effective date in the definition change for two years so the market can more smoothly transition to the new rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the Administration\u2019s efforts to ensure the law is implemented in the least disruptive, most beneficial manner. For example, the Administration has delayed implementation of the employer shared responsibility requirements. At the same time, the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) has experienced delays in implementation. As enacted, the ACA was to have provided this market segment two full years of experience under the employer mandate and in SHOP exchanges before re-categorizing their plans into the small group market. Because these two very significant building blocks have not occurred as anticipated, we believe continuing on with the redefinition of small group next year would be particularly harmful and disruptive.\u201d\n\nFollow Howley on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Six Democrats and an independent ask the Obama administration to delay another key portion of the health care law.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A group of Democratic senators is urging the Obama administration to delay a key portion of Obamacare because the results could be \"harmful and disruptive.\"    In a letter exclusively obtained by The", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Democratic Senators Beg For Another Obamacare Delay", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/23/exclusive-democratic-senators-beg-for-another-obamacare-delay/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamapoints.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bombshell letter begs for another delay", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Democratic Senators Beg For Another Obamacare Delay Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/23/exclusive-democratic-senators-beg-for-another-obamacare-delay/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamapoints.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-23 22:02:40", "sailthru.title": "EXCLUSIVE: Democratic Senators Beg For Another Obamacare Delay", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "angus-king,barack-obama,chris-coons,claire-mccaskill,heidi-heitkamp,joe-donnelly,joe-manchin,jon-tester,obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "angus king,barack obama,chris coons,claire mccaskill,heidi heitkamp,joe donnelly,joe manchin,jon tester,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "A group of Democratic senators is urging the Obama administration to delay a key portion of Obamacare because the results could be \"harmful and disruptive.\"    In a letter exclusively obtained by The", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamapoints.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cUnder the law, employers with 51 to 100 employees will be included in the ACA\u2019s definition of small group market starting in 2016.\nBecause these two very significant building blocks have not occurred as anticipated, we believe continuing on with the redefinition of small group next year would be particularly harmful and disruptive.\u201dFollow Howley on Twitter\nAs enacted, the ACA was to have provided this market segment two full years of experience under the employer mandate and in SHOP exchanges before re-categorizing their plans into the small group market.\n\u201cWe are writing to share our concerns regarding scheduled changes to the definition of the small group market under the Affordable Care Act (ACA),\u201d the senators wrote in the letter, dated March 12.\nInstead of providing stability, we believe expanding the definition will force those historically defined \u2018large group plans\u2019 into the \u2018small group market,\u2019 where they could experience higher premiums, less flexibility, and new barriers to coverage."}
