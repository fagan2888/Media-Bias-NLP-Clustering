Not Stephen Colbert.\n\nIn a video segment entitled \u201cApocalypse Dow,\u201d the late-night comedian took to You Tube late Wednesday to offer his take on the stock-market shut-down, which hit on the same day that Chinese shares were crumbling and United Airlines was forced to ground dozens of flights because of a technical issue.\n\nHis reaction to the day\u2019s events? He locked himself in his office with a stash of supplies, and proclaimed the arrival of the end times.\n\nWednesday\u2019s events, he said, were a \u201cfestival of dread and an all-you-can-eat hysteria buffet.\u201d Holding up a chart that showed stock-trading volumes, he cried:\n\n\u201cDo you understand that for nearly four hours, America\u2019s bankers had no idea how rich they were?!\u201d\n\n(That\u2019s not technically correct, of course. Even as trading ground to a halt on the NYSE floor, it continued on other platforms.)\n\nThen he ran through the list of supplies he\u2019d stockpiled in his \u201cbunker,\u201d including some bottled water, snack foods, three-hole-punched paper\u2026and a chicken.\n\n\u201cI have prepared for the times when pain is the only law and blood is the only truth,\u201d he cried.\n\nThen he summoned an intern, who came in looking like a character from the latest Mad Max movie, and issued a command:\n\n\u201cBring me the head of the false profit, Jim Cramer!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Most people took yesterday's outage at the New York Stock Exchange in stride.
