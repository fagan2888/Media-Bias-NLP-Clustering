Its creator, Eric Mutchler, alas informs me today the name of his new metal 3D printed handgun is not a deliberate shout-out to Reason, despite our early and often coverage of the world of 3D printed weapons in both plastic and metal. It was just named that "for the sake of it, it seemed a useful term" for such a gun since "who can argue with 'reason'?"

Mutchler tells me that, despite erroneous reporting all around the tech field this morning from TechCrunch to Gizmodo, his weapon is not an official product of his employer, Solid Concepts.

It was made by him and for him, merely as his personal example of how interestingly personalized 3D printing allows metal weapons to be. (Solid Concepts, now owned by a bigger, and publicly held, 3D printing interest Stratasys, is trying to avoid being too connected with the weapons field these days.)

The weapon was made mostly out of stainless steel with store-bought grips, using an EOS M280 3D printer. It chambers 10mm ammo and features the word "Reason" printed in the slide, and the preamble to the Declaration of Independence on the front of the grip.

The unique trigger was designed to look like Mutchler's last initial "M." Mutchler says all the work, including the inscriptions, was done via CAD and required no post-cleanup.
