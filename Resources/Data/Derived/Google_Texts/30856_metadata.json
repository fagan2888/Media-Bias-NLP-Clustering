One paragraph in the 64-page document includes a sexual harassment complaint made by a Tennessee trainer in 1996 involving an incident that occurred in a training room while she was treating Manning.\n\nThe trainer, Jamie Ann Naughright, settled in 1997, but sued Manning for defamation in 2002 after he discussed the incident in a book. The lawsuit was settled in 2003.\n\nManning played for Tennessee from 1994 through 1997.\n\nNaughright\u2019s sexual harassment claim involved a 1996 incident in which Manning exposed his buttocks as Naughright, then known as Jamie Whited, bent over to examine his foot in a training room. Manning said at the time it was a prank intended for another athlete. The Title IX lawsuit says Manning had \u201csat on her face\u201d while she was assessing the extent of an injury.\n\nThe New York Daily News released a 74-page document Saturday that Naughright\u2019s lawyers had filed on her behalf in 2003 while the defamation suit was still in litigation.\n\nThe federal lawsuit filed Tuesday says Tennessee created a \u201chostile sexual environment\u201d through a policy of indifference toward assaults by student-athletes. The plaintiffs say Tennessee\u2019s policies made students more vulnerable to sexual assault and that the school had a \u201cclearly unreasonable response\u201d after incidents that caused the women making complaints to endure additional harassment. The suit also states the university interfered with the disciplinary process to favor male athletes.\n\nBill Ramsey, a lawyer representing the school, said in a statement the university \u201cacted lawfully and in good faith\u201d in the situations outlined in the complaint.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Manning, the Broncos quarterback, is mentioned in the lawsuit filed against Tennessee last week in which plaintiffs said the school violated Title IX regulations in its handling of reports of sexual assaults by student-athletes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Manning, the Broncos quarterback, is mentioned in the lawsuit filed against Tennessee last week in which plaintiffs said the school violated Title IX regulations in its handling of reports of sexual assaults by student-athletes.", "title": "Peyton Manning mentioned in lawsuit filed against Tennessee", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/14/peyton-manning-mentioned-in-lawsuit-filed-against-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/14/tennessee-title_ix_lawsuit-manning_football.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/14/tennessee-title_ix_lawsuit-manning_football.jpeg", "title": "Peyton Manning mentioned in lawsuit filed against Tennessee", "description": "Manning, the Broncos quarterback, is mentioned in the lawsuit filed against Tennessee last week in which plaintiffs said the school violated Title IX regulations in its handling of reports of sexual a", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Education, Law Crime, Peyton Manning, University Of Tennessee"}, "article_summary": "The federal lawsuit filed Tuesday says Tennessee created a \u201chostile sexual environment\u201d through a policy of indifference toward assaults by student-athletes.\nThe Title IX lawsuit says Manning had \u201csat on her face\u201d while she was assessing the extent of an injury.\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning is mentioned in the lawsuit a group of women filed against the University of Tennessee last week in which they said the school violated Title IX regulations in the way it has handled reports of sexual assaults by student-athletes.\nThe lawsuit was filed by six unidentified women and focuses on five cases that were reported between 2013 and 2015, but it also references incidents involving Tennessee student-athletes dating to 1995.\nOne paragraph in the 64-page document includes a sexual harassment complaint made by a Tennessee trainer in 1996 involving an incident that occurred in a training room while she was treating Manning."}
