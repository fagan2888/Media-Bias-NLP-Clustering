Kids warmed up their legs hitting the dance floor before the walk even started.

Local middle schools and high schools came out to Frank Brown Park not just to walk in support for Down's syndrome, but carry the message of inclusion and acceptance of people with Down's syndrome.

"We really want to get the word out in Panama City to come out and support you know the Down Syndrome kids, plus anybody with a disability that they can do anything that they set their mind to," says Chris Moseley, Buddy Walk Chair.

"Everyone that goes here and comes here to support everything, you have Down syndrome people, autistic people, it's a really great cause to come and support and it makes high schoolers like me feel for people and like I want to help," says Julya Lizzarralde, Bay High Cheerleader.

"It's really nice to see all the schools come to support you have cheerleaders from Bozeman, from Bay, from Surfside, from Arnorld, they're all out here supporting one cause," says Terri McGruder, Surfside Middle School Teacher.

Middle school's like Surfside started raising money even before the event hitting more than $1500 before Saturday's walk.

All proceeds from the Buddy Walk go to Acton Up with Downs a local non-profit.

"It's a quick fun walk and then we just have fun the rest of the afternoon."

from belly dancers to cheerleaders, this year's buddy walk was a way to not only promote awareness, but have fun doing it.

"If we all come together to support one another then we can accomplish a great number of things and help this cause and a lot of other causes," says Craig Bush, New Horizons Learning Center.

This year's Buddy Walk raised around $20,000.
