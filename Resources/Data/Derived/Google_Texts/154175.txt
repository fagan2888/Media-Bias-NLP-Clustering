A Denver Police helicopter made an emergency landing shortly after 7:30 p.m. Saturday night in Washington Park — as a precaution to check for possible damage after a collision with a bird, police said.

Nobody was injured, a District 3 dispatcher said.

Damage to the helicopter was said to be minimal. Ground-based police were at the scene.

Denver Police tweeted that it’s standard procedure to land after a suspected “bird strike” and that Washington Park was the closest, safest location for an emergency landing.
