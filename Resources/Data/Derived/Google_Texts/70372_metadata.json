Securitas had previously planned to give employees a health plan with more benefits that required them to contribute more to opt in, but executives decided instead to focus on moving to 2015 when the federal law kicks in.Mini-med plans have been used for lower wage employees at companies seeking to offer employees at least some coverage with small co-pays or deductibles required. But they typically don't cover catastrophic health problems, leaving those subscribers in trouble if they face major illness and large medical bills.Some large U.S. companies are also dropping coverage for part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. Among them are Home Depot andTrader Joe's had been seen as setting an industry standard by offering such benefits as healthcare, dental and vision to part-time workers. But its CEO said in a memo on Aug. 30, that he was offering those workers $500 in January and steering them to plans available under the federal Affordable Care Act, the Post reported.Industry analyst Robert Laszewski told Bloomberg \"Obamacare is predicated on employers maintaining coverage. It\u2019s supposed to pick up the relatively few people who can\u2019t access health insurance because they\u2019re self-employed or work for small employers who can\u2019t afford it. The big guys were supposed to stay committed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Securitas,obamacare,exchanges", "pubdate": "2013-09-26T16:48:01", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Even the lowest-cost health care plans are being dropped for some 55,000 employees of the nation's largest security guard provider, as it joins the ranks of the large-scale employers moving to insurance exchanges provided under the Obamacare law.", "title": "Security Firm Drops Coverage, 55,000 Workers Sent to Obamacare Exchanges", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Securitas-obamacare-exchanges/2013/09/26/id/527923/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Securitas-obamacare-exchanges/2013/09/26/id/527923/", "description": "Even the lowest-cost health care plans are being dropped for some 55,000 employees of the nation's largest security guard provider, as it joins the ranks of the large-scale employers moving to insurance exchanges provided under the Obamacare law.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Security Firm Drops Coverage, 55,000 Workers Sent to Obamacare Exchanges"}, "epoch": 1380214081, "keywords": "Securitas,obamacare,exchanges", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2013-09-26T16:48:01"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/Securitas-obamacare-exchanges/2013/09/26/id/527923/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Even the lowest-cost health care plans are being dropped for some 55,000 employees of the nation's largest security guard provider, as it joins the ranks of the large-scale employers moving to insurance exchanges provided under the Obamacare law."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd98e\"", "article_summary": "\"A July change in the law delaying penalties for a year on employers who don't offer coverage may have changed the minds of corporations on how to proceed on benefits.\n\"The mini-meds go away and we're not replacing them,\" Jim McNulty, Securitas' U.S. operation spokesman told the Journal.\nAmong them are Home Depot andTrader Joe's had been seen as setting an industry standard by offering such benefits as healthcare, dental and vision to part-time workers.\nIt\u2019s supposed to pick up the relatively few people who can\u2019t access health insurance because they\u2019re self-employed or work for small employers who can\u2019t afford it.\n\"Their option is to go to the exchanges."}
