Kayla Gahagan for Al Jazeera America\n\nThe strategy \u2013 called \u201cpost plan\u201d \u2013 is expected to save the service half a billion dollars annually once it is completely implemented this January. Announced in May 2012, the plan realigned retail window hours based on customer use. Since it started, more than 9,000 post offices have seen retail operating hours reduced to two, four, or six hours per day.\n\nPost Service spokesman Peter Nowacki said the plan is aimed at balancing customer needs and declining volumes and revenues.\n\n\u201cWe have to align service hours offered to better match actual customer demand and reduce costs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shift to electronic forms of communication has had a profound impact on the entire Postal Service, not just rural post offices, Nowacki said.\n\nSince 2006, overall mail volumes have declined by more than 25 percent, with single-piece First-Class Mail, like birthday cards and bills, down about 60 percent from its peak. Fewer people buying fewer stamps means visits to post offices declined as well.\n\nBut customers, particularly elderly people who still conduct business by paper mail, have been impacted by the cuts.\n\nLarry Livingston, who lives across the street from the Fairburn Post Office in western South Dakota, is one of them.\n\n\u201cNowadays everything\u2019s on computer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just not what you call computer literate.\u201d All of his correspondences and bills are sent by traditional mail service.\n\nHe said that while reducing window hours makes sense, he worries about what the future will bring; it would be a hardship for people living in rural communities to have to travel to larger towns or cities every time they want to mail something or pick up their mail, he said.\n\nThe post office, particularly in rural communities, is more than a store, Jamison said.\n\n\u201cPost Masters were an asset to the community,\u201d he said, a connection that has been lost because dedicated, full-time, experienced postal workers are increasingly being replaced with inexperienced people who have taken the part-time job on the side, resulting in a loss of quality service.\n\nCritics of the post plan say the reduction of hours at offices in rural communities has degraded service and derailed retirement plans of postmasters.\n\nSome also believe the plan is a ruse intended to make post offices less essential to rural communities so there will be less opposition when they are closed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing positive about it at all,\u201d said Jamison. \u201cIt\u2019s a scheme. They\u2019re undermining the connection of the community with the post office so people don\u2019t care. It\u2019s worse and worse service.\u201d\n\nDeElda Williams\u2019s plan was to work hard and retire at 62. Instead, she retired a year ago at 60, cutting into her pension and retirements funds.\n\n\u201cIn September, they were going to cut my hours to four a day and my pay would have been cut in half,\u201d said Williams, who had worked at the Fairburn Post Office for 26 years.\n\nWilliams said eventually poor service will force customers in rural communities to head to bigger cities \u2013 giving the Postal Service a reason to close smaller offices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way of closing little post offices and making everybody look good; they\u2019ll come out smelling like a rose,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNobody wants to work for four hours.\u201d\n\nBut Nowacki said the Postal Service is still effectively reaching its mission each year, \u201cto provide secure, reliable and affordable delivery to every address in America.\u201d\n\nHe said in developing their cost-cutting plan, the Postal Service held thousands of public meetings and conducted surveys, and the response was clear.\n\n\u201cCustomers and communities around the country [asked] that their post offices remain open,\u201d he said.\n\nNowacki added that the Post Office still recruits quality employees.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Postal Service prides itself on outstanding customer service and the organization\u2019s part-time employees have always been a valued and vital component of the postal workforce,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are fully confident in the ability of all of our employees to provide quality service to our customers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A cost-reduction plan cuts hours at 9K offices nationwide, stoking fears small towns could see postal services ended", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/12/13/postal-service-workersandruralcommunitiesfearpostofficeclosures.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/12/13/postal-service-workersandruralcommunitiesfearpostofficeclosures/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Post_Office_121214.1418401651858.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "A cost-reduction plan cuts hours at 9K offices nationwide, stoking fears small towns could see postal services ended", "title": "Postal Service workers and rural communities fear post office closures"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/12/13/postal-service-workersandruralcommunitiesfearpostofficeclosures/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Post_Office_121214.1418401651858.jpg", "description": "A cost-reduction plan cuts hours at 9K offices nationwide, stoking fears small towns could see postal services ended", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "Postal Service workers and rural communities fear post office closures"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "United States Postal Service, South Dakota, Elderly, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1cbc\"", "article_summary": "The shift to electronic forms of communication has had a profound impact on the entire Postal Service, not just rural post offices, Nowacki said.\n\u201cThe Postal Service prides itself on outstanding customer service and the organization\u2019s part-time employees have always been a valued and vital component of the postal workforce,\u201d he said.\nThe post office, particularly in rural communities, is more than a store, Jamison said.\nLarry Livingston, who lives across the street from the Fairburn Post Office in western South Dakota, is one of them.\nWilliams said eventually poor service will force customers in rural communities to head to bigger cities \u2013 giving the Postal Service a reason to close smaller offices."}
