'The rules about what companies who get that data can do with it are woefully inadequate.\n\n'For example, health and fitness apps on our phones or wristbands share all sorts of data about us to companies whose privacy policies can be unclear, and who face some pretty lax regulation.'\n\nBranding the conclusions of the committee 'analysis lite', he added: 'As far as we can tell, the Committee fail to look in any way at how targeted advertising works, how it collects information, or at the rules governing how companies can use and share our personal information.'\n\nTargeted advertising uses a number of means to build profiles of potential customers, tailoring the products promoted to them accordingly.\n\nAdvertising networks like Google have done this by following web users across the internet, using so-called 'third-party cookies' to record the websites they visit and tailoring adverts towards their interests.\n\n'We do not control when the gadgets we use leak information': Privacy campaigners have warned that online devices share data with companies whose privacy policies can be unclear and who face lax regulation\n\nBut even richer data is shared by the web's myriad social networks and online services, including customers' age, gender, post code, physical characteristics like height and weight, lifestyle, exercise frequency, the contents of personal messages\n\nAnd increasingly adverts are targeted according to personal details automatically collected from smartphones via apps, including the type of device and its software, its unique IMEI signature, the network it's on and, crucially, its precise location.\n\nThese information-gatherers argue that the data they collect about you is anonymous and they don\u2019t actually care who you are \u2014 only that they are sending you adverts they think you need.\n\nBut Jim Killock, ORG's executive director, explained to MailOnline that the profile built up by online advertising networks is so detailed that reuniting it with the person it describes is a fairly simple task.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords":
