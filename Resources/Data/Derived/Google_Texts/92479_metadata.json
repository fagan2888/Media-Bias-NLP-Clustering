And with Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans own\u00ading a Sen\u00adate ma\u00adjor\u00adity for the first time since the law passed, 2015 is the party\u2019s first real op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity to move a re\u00adpeal bill through Con\u00adgress. Obama would veto the meas\u00adure, of course, but the plan was to set the stage for real ac\u00adtion should the GOP cap\u00adture the pres\u00adid\u00adency in 2016.\n\nSen\u00adate Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans\u2019 re\u00adpeal ef\u00adfort is demon\u00adstrat\u00ading why a full re\u00adpeal of the law is likely im\u00adpossible. Be\u00adcause while re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation al\u00adlows a bill to pass the Sen\u00adate with a simple ma\u00adjor\u00adity, there are lim\u00adits to the type of bills that can be moved un\u00adder the pro\u00adced\u00adure, and a full re\u00adpeal falls out\u00adside of that scope.\n\nIn\u00adstead, even Sen\u00adate Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans con\u00adcede that the full re\u00adpeal meas\u00adure would have to pass through a more con\u00adven\u00adtion\u00adal pro\u00adcess\u2014in\u00adclud\u00ading over\u00adcom\u00ading a fili\u00adbuster.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to have 60 votes in the United States Sen\u00adate,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grass\u00adley, in an in\u00adter\u00adview about re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation\u2019s im\u00adplic\u00ada\u00adtions for re\u00adpeal in 2017.\n\nAnd giv\u00aden the land\u00adscape of the 2016 Sen\u00adate elec\u00adtion, scor\u00ading 60 Sen\u00adate votes is un\u00adlikely. The party cur\u00adrently con\u00adtrols 54 seats, and it would take a massive string of up\u00adsets to as\u00adsemble a fili\u00adbuster-proof ma\u00adjor\u00adity next ses\u00adsion.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the mat\u00adter is you can\u2019t re\u00adpeal all of Obama\u00adcare in re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation,\u201d said Doug Holtz-Eakin, pres\u00adid\u00adent of the Amer\u00adic\u00adan Ac\u00adtion For\u00adum and a policy dir\u00adect\u00ador for John Mc\u00adCain\u2019s 2008 pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial cam\u00adpaign.\n\nBut even if it\u2019s not a vi\u00adable path\u00adway to re\u00adpeal, re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation is still far from feck\u00adless in the GOP fight against the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act. In\u00adstead, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans could use the pro\u00adcess to strike down large chunks of the law\u2014per\u00adhaps even enough to prune back the law to near ir\u00adrel\u00adev\u00adancy.\n\n\u201cThe pro\u00adcess of us\u00ading re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation to re\u00adpeal parts of ACA is in many ways a tri\u00adal run for a ser\u00adi\u00adous ef\u00adfort to re\u00adpeal ACA un\u00adder a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan pres\u00adid\u00adent,\u201d said Ed Loren\u00adzen, a seni\u00ador ad\u00adviser at the Com\u00admit\u00adtee for a Re\u00adspons\u00adible Fed\u00ader\u00adal Budget. \u201cThe dif\u00adfi\u00adculty they are hav\u00ading in put\u00adting to\u00adgeth\u00ader re\u00adpeal le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion that sat\u00adis\u00adfies the Sen\u00adate rules re\u00adlated to re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation may make it a less at\u00adtract\u00adive strategy in 2017 [if] a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan pres\u00adid\u00adent is elec\u00adted.\u201d\n\nA po\u00adten\u00adtial em\u00adbar\u00adrass\u00adment\n\nFor this Con\u00adgress, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans\u2019 worst-case scen\u00adario would be a fail\u00adure to find an anti-Obama\u00adcare re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation meas\u00adure that they can even get 51 sen\u00adat\u00adors to line up be\u00adhind.\n\nSo far, they\u2019ve had some hic\u00adcups. Sens. Marco Ru\u00adbio, Ted Cruz, and Mike Lee have vowed to vote against any\u00adthing short of full re\u00adpeal. But in\u00adclud\u00ading a Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood de\u00adfund in the bill threatens the votes of mod\u00ader\u00adates such as Sens. Mark Kirk, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski.\n\nFor now, it re\u00admains un\u00adclear what will be the con\u00adtents of a bill by the time the Sen\u00adate votes on it, or when that will be, or even wheth\u00ader GOP lead\u00ader\u00adship will be able to scrape to\u00adgeth\u00ader the mere 51 votes needed to send the bill to the pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s desk. But the pro\u00adcess of fit\u00adting to\u00adgeth\u00ader Obama\u00adcare pro\u00advi\u00adsions like pieces of a puzzle to meet Sen\u00adate pro\u00adced\u00adur\u00adal rules\u2014and both mod\u00ader\u00adate and con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive ex\u00adpect\u00ada\u00adtions\u2014has demon\u00adstrated the dif\u00adfi\u00adculty of gov\u00adern\u00ading on the GOP\u2019s elec\u00adtion-win\u00adning philo\u00adsophy of re\u00adpeal-and-re\u00adplace.\n\nWhile the ex\u00ader\u00adcise is largely re\u00adgarded as polit\u00adic\u00adal mes\u00adsaging, the GOP\u2019s back-and-forth with the Sen\u00adate par\u00adlia\u00adment\u00adari\u00adan has real con\u00adsequences for 2017, when Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans have pledged that the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act will be re\u00adpealed un\u00adder a new pres\u00adid\u00adent from their party. In\u00adten\u00added to show what could hap\u00adpen with new lead\u00ader\u00adship, this year\u2019s re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation pro\u00adcess has in\u00adstead shown the un\u00adlike\u00adli\u00adhood of a full ACA re\u00adpeal. But when it comes to how the health care law works, polit\u00adic\u00adal mes\u00adsaging aside, it might not mat\u00adter wheth\u00ader it\u2019s fully or par\u00adtially re\u00adpealed.\n\n\u201cI think if we get to 2017 and we\u2019ve got a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan House, Sen\u00adate, and pres\u00adid\u00adent, what they\u2019re go\u00ading to care about is the out\u00adcome, not wheth\u00ader it\u2019s the spe\u00adcif\u00adics of re\u00adpeal-and-re\u00adplace,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThey don\u2019t ne\u00adces\u00adsar\u00adily have to try to re\u00adpeal the whole thing. They have to modi\u00adfy it and get to something they sup\u00adport as a party.\u201d\n\nThe House-passed bill cur\u00adrently de\u00adfunds Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood in ad\u00addi\u00adtion to strik\u00ading down sev\u00ader\u00adal pro\u00advi\u00adsions of the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act: the in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal and em\u00adploy\u00ader man\u00addates, the med\u00adic\u00adal-device tax, the Ca\u00addillac tax, and the Pre\u00adven\u00adtion and Pub\u00adlic Health Fund. An ad\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal auto-en\u00adroll\u00adment pro\u00advi\u00adsion was in\u00adcluded in the House bill, but was used as a pay-for in the budget deal passed by Con\u00adgress last month.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caitlin Owens", "description": "Republicans probably won\u2019t be able to fully repeal Obamacare in 2017 regardless of who\u2019s president.
