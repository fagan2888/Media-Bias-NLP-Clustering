On average, it found, ObamaCare enrollees had 32% fewer primary care doctors and 24% fewer hospitals from which to choose. Worse, ObamaCare plans covered 42% fewer oncologists and cardiologists than non-ObamaCare plans.\n\nYes indeed, what a deal. Couple that with sky-high deductibles (according to Health Pocket, average deductibles for the lowest cost Bronze Plan in ObamaCare are 42% higher than before the law was passed) and you\u2019ve got a real winner on your hands. By the way, the average Bronze Plan costs around $3,500 a year and has a whopping $5,181 deductible to be paid.\n\nOh, and here\u2019s the good news: \u201cinsurers are pushing double-digit premium hikes for 2016, some as high as 50%.\u201d\n\nSo again, let\u2019s ask, what good is insurance if you can\u2019t find a doctor or it doesn\u2019t pay a penny until you\u2019ve paid your huge deductible (not to mention the premium) out of pocket? As should be obvious, for the most part it isn\u2019t any good. Especially if you have a young, relatively healthy family. In that case, be prepared to pay for everything out of pocket.\n\nSounds like a pretty bad deal, doesn\u2019t it? However, remember, if you don\u2019t have insurance, well, the IRS will make sure to make life miserable for you.\n\nAnother example of the Democrats looking out for the middle/working class in this country.\n\n~McQ\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "What a deal!", "title": "ObamaCare: Fewer doctors but higher premiums and deductibles", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/20/obamacare-fewer-doctors-but-higher-premiums-and-deductibles/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-20T22:41:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T21:16:19+00:00"}, "keywords": "deductibles, doctors, ObamaCare, premiums,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93dd\"", "article_summary": "On average, it found, ObamaCare enrollees had 32% fewer primary care doctors and 24% fewer hospitals from which to choose.\nWorse, ObamaCare plans covered 42% fewer oncologists and cardiologists than non-ObamaCare plans.\nObamaCare: Fewer doctors but higher premiums and deductiblesposted at 6:41 pm on July 20, 2015 by Bruce McQuainA new report by Avalere Health points out what an \u201cimprovement\u201d ObamaCare has been:[E]nrollees in ObamaCare plans have access to 34% fewer providers than those who buy a commercial plan outside the exchange.\nCouple that with sky-high deductibles (according to Health Pocket, average deductibles for the lowest cost Bronze Plan in ObamaCare are 42% higher than before the law was passed) and you\u2019ve got a real winner on your hands.\nBy the way, the average Bronze Plan costs around $3,500 a year and has a whopping $5,181 deductible to be paid."}
