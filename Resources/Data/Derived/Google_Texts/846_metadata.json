First conducted in 2013, the company\u2019s 2015 \u201cU.S. Attitudes Toward Health Insurance and Healthcare Reform\u201d study found that Americans are spending more time evaluating their insurance options, and are securing coverage from sources other than their employer. This is despite widespread consumer unfamiliarity with non-traditional health plan options, including provider-sponsored health plans (PSHPs). Survey data also reveals that consumers consider a health plan\u2019s cost the most important factor when selecting coverage.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics (CDC NCHS) report announcing that for the first time in history, more than 90 percent of Americans are now insured, a statistic attributable to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, in combination with the industry\u2019s movement to fee-for-value and incentive-based payment models for providers, translates to more empowered healthcare consumers.\n\n\u201cIn the two years since we first conducted this study, millions of Americans have gained access to health insurance and significant shifts in the industry have placed more consumers in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to their care,\u201d said Phil Kamp, Valence Health\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer. \u201cThe survey results show that when given a choice, individuals readily take on more responsibility when selecting a health plan, and may in fact be paying less out of pocket for healthcare services than other industry reports suggest.\u201d\n\nKey Survey Findings Include:\n\nHealth Insurance Perceptions\n\nCompared with 59% in 2013, 38% of those surveyed receive insurance through an employer.\n\nof those surveyed receive insurance through an employer. 73% of respondents report being very or somewhat satisfied with their current health insurer.\n\nChoosing Health Insurance\n\nWhen selecting health insurance, in order of importance, consumers rank coverage of major medical expenses first, followed by prescription coverage (second), and routine preventative care (third).\n\nNearly 40% spend seven or more hours evaluating their health insurance options.\n\nspend seven or more hours evaluating their health insurance options.
