Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is at it again with his “Lie Witness News,” this time in a patriotic 4th of July segment. In the popular feature, a Kimmel staffer conducts man-on-the-street interviews, asking people about completely made up events &madsh; and you’d be amazed how the interviewees pretend to know what their talking about, and will even claim to have heard the “news” weeks earlier.

For Independence Day, the Kimmel show asked people how they felt about California governor Jerry Brown “moving the 4th of July to February,” or how they felt about Founding Fathers like “James Van Der Beek” and “Alex P. Keaton.”

It’s embarrassing to watch, but perhaps not as embarrassing as the things that some so-called news outlets believed this 4th. Or as embarrassing as Kimmel’s segment exposing how opponents of Obamacare would support it as long as you call it something else.
