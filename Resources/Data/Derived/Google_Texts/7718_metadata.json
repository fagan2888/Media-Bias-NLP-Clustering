He made it a centerpiece of his speech, touted his record of achievements, and mocked those who disbelieve the science behind it. \u201cSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn\u2019t deny Sputnik was up there,\u201d he quipped.\n\nWill Oremus Will Oremus is Slate's senior technology writer. Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter.\n\nObama clearly considers the nation\u2019s progress on climate change and the environment an integral part of his legacy. That squares with the emphasis he placed on the issue eight years ago, when he was first running for president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nExamine his words and actions during the seven intervening years, however, and you\u2019ll see that Obama has not been quite the environmental stalwart he\u2019d have us believe. Rather, his strongest leadership has come at the beginning and end of his presidency, when he had the least to lose from it and the most to gain. On the environment, as in other realms, Obama\u2019s defining trait as a leader has been his pragmatism. And while Obama can point to some genuine accomplishments, the forces that have shaped his environmental record\u2014and rhetoric, for that matter\u2014have been largely outside his control.\n\nIn 2008, then\u2013Sen. Obama put climate change at the forefront of his presidential campaign. The centerpiece of his energy plan was a cap-and-trade system that he said would cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The tough talk continued after he was elected. \u201cNow is the time to confront this challenge once and for all,\u201d he said in November 2008. \u201cDelay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response.\u201d\n\nClimate moved to the back burner, however, when Obama chose health care as his first big policy battle. Eventually, as the Obamacare fight boiled over and the economy failed to gain steam, it disappeared from the stove entirely. By 2012, Obama had grown so weak on the issue that when Mitt Romney accused him in a debate of not being \u201cMr. Oil or Mr. Gas or Mr. Coal,\u201d the president defended his fossil-fuel bona fides. Even after his re-election, Obama declined to push hard for climate legislation, noting that it \u201cwould involve making some tough political choices\u201d\u2014choices he was evidently unwilling to make. Greens were left disillusioned.\n\nBy his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama was beginning to quietly map out a new, more modest way forward. Even as he vaguely floated a \u201cbipartisan, market-based solution\u201d to climate change, which he knew would go nowhere in the Republican Congress, Obama promised to take action himself if the legislature wouldn\u2019t. It was not an empty promise. In September 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed carbon emission standards for new power plants, and Obama made them a priority in his 2014 State of the Union address. In August, he unveiled a 1,560-page \u201cclean power plan\u201d that included regulations on existing power plants, establishing compliance mechanisms that looked a lot like cap-and-trade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s rhetoric on the climate over the course of his second term gradually regained the force and confidence of his 2008 stump speeches. \u201cWe have to act with more urgency,\u201d he said in his 2014 State of the Union. Asked in a June 2014 interview whether he doesn\u2019t sometimes want to \u201cgo off like a Roman candle\u201d on those who deny that the climate is changing, he said, \u201cUh, yeah,\u201d and laughed as though it were obvious. \u201cScience is science,\u201d he added. And it was in his 2015 State of the Union speech that the president referred to climate change as the greatest threat to future generations.\n\nOn Tuesday, in his final State of the Union address, Obama talked climate more than he ever has\u2014and with more conviction. He began by laying out \u201cfour big questions that we as a country have to answer,\u201d the second of which was the challenge of confronting climate change:\n\nLook, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You\u2019ll be pretty lonely, because you\u2019ll be debating our military, most of America\u2019s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it\u2019s a problem and intend to solve it.\n\nObama went on to tout the country\u2019s investments in clean energy, which have resulted in a boom in solar and wind power, with the solar industry now employing more Americans than coal does. He also boasted that the country has \u201ccut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent.\u201d He paused, then added with a smile: \u201cGas under 2 bucks a gallon ain\u2019t bad either.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s tone was triumphant, his rhetoric that of a president burnishing his legacy. Certainly he deserves some credit for steering the country toward a cleaner future and for helping to negotiate the landmark Paris agreement in December. He has done, you might fairly say, as much as could reasonably be expected of a Democratic president facing an intransigent Congress in an era of deep economic anxiety.\n\nObama is not an environmental leader but a political one.\n\nAs much, yes\u2014but not more. Sure, Obama was out front on climate in 2008, when the nation was looking for some fresh air after two terms of George W. Bush. But it was relatively easy then, because his Republican opponent, John McCain, basically agreed with him. Once in office, Obama did push for a climate bill, but he pushed harder on health care, which was fine. It\u2019s not entirely his fault that the Republican response to his Obamacare victory was to swerve hard to the right, blocking and demonizing the rest of his agenda, including anything climate-related.\n\nStill, it\u2019s telling that the president clammed up about the climate after that. He clearly viewed it as a losing issue for him and his party, and he cared more about not losing than he did about beating the drum on that greatest of threats to future generations. An environmental leader would not have pointed to his record of opening public lands for oil drilling when Romney charged that he had not been Mr. Oil, Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal. He would have said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not Mr. Oil, Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal, and here\u2019s why.\u201d Nor would an environmental leader have dithered for years on the Keystone pipeline, evading attempts to pin him to one side or the other of the most polarizing energy project of his presidency.\n\nOver the past few years, the economy has continued to improve, the science has become ever clearer, the world keeps getting hotter, and even the \u201cdeniers\u201d have begun to admit that the climate is changing. Obama, meanwhile, has zero elections left to win and one presidential legacy to mold. In short, the political calculus has once again made it opportune for him to play a leading role in the climate fight. So he is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMake no mistake, as Obama would say: The United States has made significant progress on the climate over the course of his two terms. His sustained green jobs push has borne fruit, and his clean energy investments have helped to spur breakthroughs, like Tesla\u2019s wildly successful electric cars. New efficiency standards and EPA regulations have also made a difference. In the end, even kicking the Keystone can down the road turned out to be exactly the right move. By the time he finally rejected it in November, collapsing oil prices had undercut the whole point of the project.\n\nBut surprisingly few of the environmental achievements he\u2019s now touting are the result of his own efforts. U.S. emissions have plummeted\u2014oil prices, too\u2014as a direct result of a technological innovation that went unmentioned in Tuesday\u2019s address and that was not a part of any Obama-led policy push. That would be fracking, and the domestic drilling boom it has made possible. The combination of cheap natural gas and increased domestic oil production has done more to cut U.S. dependency on foreign oil than anything the Oval Office has done. Depending on how you feel about fracking and its effects, you can credit or blame Obama for not standing in the way\u2014but no one should pretend it\u2019s his doing. He was, in short, saved by the drill.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Obama wants to be remembered as a climate savior.
