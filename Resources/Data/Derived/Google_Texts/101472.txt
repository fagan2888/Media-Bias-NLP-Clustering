Talented musicians performing with toy instruments is a classic Jimmy Fallon gag that will never get old. On Monday night, singer Adele Dazeem Idina Menzel stopped by the “Tonight Show” to perform her Oscar-winning song, “Frozen’s” “Let It Go,” with Fallon and the Roots.

Fallon also mentioned John Travolta’s “Adele Dazeem” flub in his opening monologue, delivering a glorious pun about how Menzel simply had to “Let it Go.”
