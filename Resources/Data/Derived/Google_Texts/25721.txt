The city of Ringgold will host an area talent show April 30 and is accepting contestant applications for the event, which will culminate with the winner performing during the annual 1890’s Day Jamboree.



“City Manager Dan Wright has wanted to have a citywide talent show for the last couple of years,” Main Street Director Rhonda Johnson said. “We’re excited to have a bunch of different acts involved. I think an event like this is a good way to bring a community together to showcase local talent.”



"Any kind of act is welcome to try out, as long as the performance is appropriate. Singers, dancers, musicians, comedians, magicians, and all other kinds of talented folks are encouraged to enter. We are hoping the schools will promote the event, as well as local dance and music studios,” Ms. Johnson said.



The contest will be broken down into three age brackets: 3-14, 15-20, and 21-plus. Contestants are required to fill out an application, post the $20 entry fee, and then audition before the show.



“We’ll be having auditions April 12, 14, 19, and 21,” Ms. Johnson said. “Contestants can also send in video auditions, but they’ll still need to go through the steps with the application.”

The application deadline is Wednesday, April 20. "If we have the last of the applications in by April 20, we can still schedule those contestants for the last audition the day after that,” Ms. Johnson said.

The actual talent show will begin at 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 30, at the Historic Ringgold Depot, where contestants will compete for the cash prizes and a chance to perform at 1890’s Day.



“Third place will win $100, second place will win $250, and then the first-place winner will win $500 and a chance to perform at 1890’s Day,” Ms. Johnson said. “Whether you are 3 or 93, you can compete in this show. The age division winners will perform at 1890’s Day.” Contestant applications can be obtained in person at City Hall or online at cityofringgold.com.

“Once the application process is complete, we’ll schedule an audition with the contestants,” Ms. Johnson said.
