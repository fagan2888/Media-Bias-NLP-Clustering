Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo agreed to a statewide fracking ban after Acting Health Commissioner Howard Zucker held up a study at a December 17 cabinet meeting, and said he would not live in a community or allow his child to play in a school field near a hydraulic fracturing operation.\n\nNot only was the child hypothetical \u2014 Mr. Zucker has no children \u2014 but so was the research, according to a \u201cwhite paper\u201d released Thursday by the pro-industry group Energy in Depth. The study cited by Mr. Zucker was not only conducted in part by anti-fracking advocacy groups but was peer-reviewed by three fracking opponents, including Ithaca College professor Sandra Steingraber, a founder of New Yorkers Against Fracking.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the Cuomo administration\u2019s report relies on highly questionable sources, including research papers with strong ties to the fringe activists who helped hasten the ban in New York,\u201d said the white paper, \u201cA Look Inside New York\u2019s Anti-Fracking Echo Chamber.\u201d \u201cYet these same sources were misrepresented as purveyors and curators of \u2018bona fide\u2019 science by Cuomo officials.\u201d\n\nBias both ways?\n\nBut anti-fracking advocates counter that their critics are guilty of the bias in the other direction. New Yorkers Against Fracking called the white paper a \u201chollow, self-serving attack,\u201d noting that EID is funded by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, and accusing the industry of \u201cmisinformation propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe oil and gas industry is simply trying to deny and distract attention [as] the growing evidence for fracking-related impacts \u2014 earthquakes, water contamination, dangerous air pollution and negative health impacts all across the country \u2014 grow ever more desperate,\u201d said NYAF in a statement.\n\nThe anti-fracking group also cited a February report from the Public Accountability Initiative examining \u201chow the oil and gas industry presents science about fracking, including Energy in Depth, and found that the industry distorts science to deceive the public and policymakers.\u201d\n\nThen again, the Public Accountability Initiative isn\u2019t exactly bias-free either. The nonprofit is funded in part by the Park Foundation, a liberal nonprofit heavily involved in the anti-fracking fight, and also receives financial support from the Sunlight Foundation, which is funded by the Open Society Institute, part of the network funded by liberal billionaire George Soros.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the first national director of the Sunlight Foundation was Fordham University law professor Zephyr Teachout, who ran against Mr. Cuomo on an anti-fracking platform in the 2014 Democratic primary. Ms. Teachout received a larger-than-expected 33 percent of the primary vote, which critics say influenced Mr. Cuomo\u2019s decision to allow the ban.\n\nSo whose science can be trusted? Maybe nobody\u2019s, which is why disclosure is so important, EID\u2019s western director, Simon Lomax, told the House committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether people can advocate for a political viewpoint that they believe in. Of course they can,\u201d Mr. Lomax said. \u201cBut if they\u2019re going to try to represent themselves as independent researchers when they\u2019re actually running campaigns to try to ban hydraulic fracturing, that\u2019s something that needs to be disclosed.\u201d\n\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers jousted repeatedly over the quality and integrity of the science for and against fracking. Mr. Smith, citing what he said were unjustified critiques of fracking in his home state of Texas, said that even the Obama administration EPA has adopted an \u201cagenda-driven approach\u201d to connect fracking to groundwater contamination.\n\n\u201cTheir refusal to accept good science knows no bounds, which is why we should be suspect of other findings by the EPA,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Rep. Paul Tonko, New York Democrat, accused Republicans of being selective in their outrage over questionable scientific findings.\n\n\u201cI could point out that bad information on climate change or on the cost of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which some refer to as Obamacare \u2014 seems to be driving all kinds of voter choices around our country,\u201d said Mr. Tonko at the hearing. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think my friends on the other side of the aisle are going to work very hard to set those records straight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The old saw about statistics \u2014 that, given enough spin, they can be used to support anything &mdash; is being increasingly applied to science, especially, critics say, when it comes to the fight over hydraulic fracturing.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The old saw about statistics \u2014 that, given enough spin, they can be used to support anything \u2014 is being increasingly applied to science, especially, critics say, when it comes to the fight over hydraulic fracturing.", "title": "Fracking politics trump science as oil industry, environmental lobby push biased views", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/28/fracking-politics-trump-science-as-oil-industry-en/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/28/Fracking2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/28/Fracking2.jpg", "description": "The old saw about statistics \u2014 that, given enough spin, they can be used to support anything &mdash; is being increasingly applied to science, especially, critics say, when it comes to the fight over", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Fracking politics trump science as oil industry, environmental lobby p"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, New York, Lamar Smith, Andrew Cuomo, Howard Zucker"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce430\"", "article_summary": "Not only was the child hypothetical \u2014 Mr. Zucker has no children \u2014 but so was the research, according to a \u201cwhite paper\u201d released Thursday by the pro-industry group Energy in Depth.\nWhat\u2019s more, the first national director of the Sunlight Foundation was Fordham University law professor Zephyr Teachout, who ran against Mr. Cuomo on an anti-fracking platform in the 2014 Democratic primary.\nBut Rep.
