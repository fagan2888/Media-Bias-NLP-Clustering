But wrestling with the ideas contained in a book that\u2019s difficult for many people to read shouldn\u2019t result in patently unfair reviews from anonymous, intellectually dishonest critics like the individual who penned The Economist\u2019s.\n\nPutting aside the issue of anonymity \u2014 it\u2019s not as if The Economist covers race more judiciously on a typical day \u2014 the core problem with its review is that it\u2019s nothing more than yet another performance of the publication\u2019s long-tired contrarian shtick. \u201cThe epistolary form is not the only archaic thing about Mr Coates\u2019s book,\u201d the reviewer writes, apparently unaware that Coates is very deliberately referencing James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cLetter to My Nephew\u201d with this format.\n\n\u201cHe writes with the torrential outrage of a campaigning Victorian,\u201d the reviewer continues, because associating a black man with the gendered image of teetotalers like Carrie Nation is a perfectly sensible, and not the least bit sexist, thing to do.\n\nThe reviewer \u2014 I was about to write \u201che,\u201d for what I hope are sadly obvious reasons \u2014 proceeds to denigrate the quality of Coates\u2019 prose, characterizing it \u201cloquacious, repetitive, at times self-indulgent and just good enough to get away with it,\u201d and follows that judgment with a passage that demonstrates said judgment\u2019s worthlessness. Quoting a moving passage after claiming that the writer is barely capable of producing one is probably not the best idea.\n\nBut the reviewer had to pen a contrarian review, so quoting other passages was absolutely out of the question. It\u2019d be difficult to argue against the power of Coates\u2019 prose if one quoted this, after all:\n\nAmericans believe in the reality of \u201crace\u201d as a defined, indubitable feature of the natural world. Racism \u2014 the need to ascribe bone-deep features to people and then humiliate, reduce, and destroy them \u2014 inevitably follows from this inalterable condition.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t do at all. But the central offense the brave anonymous reviewer seems to have suffered from Coates\u2019 book stems from the fact that \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d contains many statements to the effect that well-intentioned white people are complicit in systemic racism \u2014 that they still accrue the benefits bequeathed to white people by virtue of their whiteness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"He writes with the torrential outrage of a campaigning Victorian,\" the brave anonymous reviewer argues", "title": "The Economist: Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d is \u201cjust good enough to get away with\u201d justifying its existence", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"He writes with the torrential outrage of a campaigning Victorian,\" the brave anonymous reviewer argues", "title": "The Economist: Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d is \u201cjust good enough to get away with\u201d justifying its existence", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/14/the_economist_ta_nehisi_coates_between_the_world_and_me_is_just_good_enough_to_get_away_with_justifying_its_existence/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/ta-nehisi-coates-new-york-magazine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"He writes with the torrential outrage of a campaigning Victorian,\" the brave anonymous reviewer argues", "title": "The Economist: Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d is \u201cjust good enough to get away with\u201d justifying its existence", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/ta-nehisi-coates-new-york-magazine.jpg", "creator": "@scottekaufman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Eric Kaufman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Race, Ta-Nehsis Coates, The Economist", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc578\"", "article_summary": "But the reviewer had to pen a contrarian review, so quoting other passages was absolutely out of the question.\n\u201cThe epistolary form is not the only archaic thing about Mr Coates\u2019s book,\u201d the reviewer writes, apparently unaware that Coates is very deliberately referencing James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cLetter to My Nephew\u201d with this format.\nTopics: Books, Race, Ta-Nehsis Coates, The Economist, News, Politics NewsThe reviews of Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 controversial new book, \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d were bound to be contentious \u2014 the epigraph is an excerpt of the poem by Richard Wright from which the book draws its title, after all.\nQuoting a moving passage after claiming that the writer is barely capable of producing one is probably not the best idea.\nRacism \u2014 the need to ascribe bone-deep features to people and then humiliate, reduce, and destroy them \u2014 inevitably follows from this inalterable condition."}
