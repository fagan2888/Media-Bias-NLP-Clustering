Sen. Ted Cruz has a narrow edge over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in a new survey on 2016 GOP hopefuls in Texas.

Twenty percent prefer Mr. Cruz in a would-be 2016 GOP presidential primary match-up, and 19 percent prefer Mr. Walker in a new University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll. The numbers present a rapid rise for Mr. Walker, who was at 2 percent to Mr. Cruz’s 27 percent a few months ago.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson were next at 9 percent apiece, followed by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who had been in second place in October, at 8 percent.

Back then, Mr. Cruz led the way at 27 percent, followed by Mr. Perry, then still governor, at 14 percent and Mr. Carson at 10 percent.

Next in the new poll was former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 5 percent, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at 4 percent apiece, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin at 3 percent, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 2 percent.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania were at 1 percent apiece, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were at 0 percent.

Thirteen percent said they hadn’t thought about it enough to have an opinion.

The survey of 1,200 registered voters was taken from Feb. 6-15, and the Republican sub sample of 547 has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.19 percent.
