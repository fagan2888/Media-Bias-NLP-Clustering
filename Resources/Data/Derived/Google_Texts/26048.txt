Commuting thoughts of a run

On my long commute home at the start of this holiday weekend, I did an interview with Hugh Hewitt, who asked as he always does if I am thinking of running for president next year.

I said “No.”

Hugh then asked if I would consider running for Marco Rubio’s seat in 2016. Again, I said “no” but said if I were running for anything, it would be in Florida and that 2018 would make more sense than 2016. Hugh then said he was going to trumpet the breaking news that I was running in 2018. I laughed and said "Well, you can make that up if you want to.”

We then got on to the topics I called in to discuss. Proving that it takes very little to make news these days, several blogs began talking about a future Senate run. The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple wrote and asked whether I was serious about a run.

This was my response by email:

Never given it a serious thought. I've always thought about getting back in public service one day but was just responding to 2016 question he always asks. I said no to POTUS run and 2016 Senate run and then suggested 2018 was more realistic, but that's not realistic either. I'm in a contract with NBC until 2019 and have a 6 year old and 11 year old in school very far away from Florida. Besides, I love what I am doing.

If I ever get back into public service, I suspect it is at least a decade away. And I doubt I will even then. Hugh got me talking when I was on my commute home on a Friday at the end of a long week. It's not going to happen.

Thanks for the question.

All the best,

Joe

Now back to painting Easter eggs with the kids.

Happy Easter!
