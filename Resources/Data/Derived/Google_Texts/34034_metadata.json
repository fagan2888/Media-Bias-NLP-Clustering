I\u2019ll give you three examples:\n\nDonald Trump\n\n\u2013 Many people love him because they fear more of President Obama\u2019s policies.\n\nHe wants to defund Planned Parenthood; strengthen the military; return jobs here from over the border or overseas; says same-sex marriage is a state issue; looks to eliminate corporate taxes; favors capital punishment; wants to cut the U.S. Department of Education, leave to local control; opposes hikes in the minimum wage; believes climate change is a hoax; is in favor of drilling for oil domestically; likes Russia (Putin), not China; says no to Syrian refugees; OK with no limits on guns; opposes Political Action Committees; wants to stop immigration, particularly Muslims; says no to a flat tax; and, among other concepts, wants to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nOf course, he did not announce those stances \u201cthat way\u201d or use what many would call politically correct words. Trump often delivers his message with words, that prior to now, no one would say in public or on TV; to listen to some of his speeches, you\u2019d think it was a late night talk show (or reality TV).\n\nBernie Sanders \u2013 He embodies hope for his supporters. That should come as no surprise, considering he is a self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d and wants to expand what we call handouts and entitlement programs.\n\nHe also wants to charge companies for carbon emissions (is considered a \u201cclimate change hawk\u201d); favors free preschool and free tuition at public colleges and universities; is pro-choice; wants to break up big banks and open up the Fed; looks to ban assault weapons, and repeal laws protecting gun manufacturers from lawsuits; likes universal, government-provided health care; wants to waive deportations and offer a path to citizenship; promises to raise income taxes on those making $250,000 or more, and tax capital gains same as dividends; calls for withdrawal of all troops as soon as possible; and, among other ideas, supports the deal with Iran and opposes tougher sanctions.\n\nSanders is viewed as the \u201cI like him, but he can\u2019t win\u201d guy, and 60 percent of his support is from the younger generations (ages 18-34). He also has an unpredictable track record on gun control.\n\nMy third example is local (think: Prescott and Yavapai County). Fear of increases in sales and property taxes; hope for more services; hope for and fear of a new county jail, depending on your opinion; worries over assured water supply and group homes; and myriad other topics, including zoning, spending, transparency, and access.\n\nIf you\u2019re not the whimsical voter who makes a decision based on a candidate\u2019s appearance, it behooves you to examine the issues. Open your eyes and mind. Approach candidates and officials mentally knowing what you want, and see how they fit into your mold \u2026 and if they change your mind.\n\nOtherwise, if we operate out of only hope or fear, we\u2019re looking at the candidates with glasses colored by emotion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.dcourier.com/news/2016/mar/29/editorial-hope-fear-color-choices-politics/", "site_name": "dcourier", "type": "article", "description": "Politics would not exist without hope and fear.", "title": "Editorial: Hope, fear color choices in politics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 157422494277}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "title": "Editorial: Hope, fear color choices in politics"}, "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdef\"", "article_summary": "Otherwise, if we operate out of only hope or fear, we\u2019re looking at the candidates with glasses colored by emotion.\nPolitics would not exist without hope and fear.\nFear of increases in sales and property taxes; hope for more services; hope for and fear of a new county jail, depending on your opinion; worries over assured water supply and group homes; and myriad other topics, including zoning, spending, transparency, and access.\nI\u2019ll give you three examples:Donald Trump\u2013 Many people love him because they fear more of President Obama\u2019s policies.\nOf course, he did not announce those stances \u201cthat way\u201d or use what many would call politically correct words."}
