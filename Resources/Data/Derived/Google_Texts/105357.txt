Copper Mountain began making snow during the early hours of Saturday as the ski season looms.

Snow making began on a morning when the overnight temperature was 27 degrees, the resort said in a press release.

Snow-making guns began to fire on Andy’s Encore, an intermediate run on Copper Mountain.

“They will continue to blow snow to lay down a good base,” said Stephanie Sweeney, a Copper Mountain spokeswoman.

Snow making will go on around the clock, unless temperatures grow too warm, Sweeney said.

Snowmaking resources are also focused around the U.S. Ski Team Speed Center.

At a pep rally a full roster of Olympic medalists and world champion alpine skiers will be on hand on Copper’s opening day on Nov. 6.

Atletes expected to attend include Mikaela Shiffrin, Julia Mancuso, Ted Ligety and Lindsey Vonn.

“People can come out and see the ski team named for the 2015/16 season,” Sweeney said.

Once a snow base is laid down, Sweeney said, “groomers will come in and start pushing that snow around to make a good snow surface.”
