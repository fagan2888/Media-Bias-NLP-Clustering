The consensus expects the benchmark rate to spike to 1% by the end of next year. Given that bonds yields and prices move in opposite directions, investors in long-dated 10- to 30-year bonds, will be mauled.\n\nThe longer a bond has until maturity, the more sensitive it is to interest rates movements. Last year when yields on 20-year Treasury bonds rose 1.09% , iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) dropped 13%, according to Morningstar. Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury Index ETF (EDV) crashed 20% while PIMCO 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury Index ETF (ZROZ) plunged 21% -- painful drops for risk-averse investors relying on yield income. Thankfully, they\u2019ve rebounded 20% and 23%, respectively, so far this year, as of July 16, as 20-year Treasury rates declined by 0.6%.\n\nBut the pain is expected to return as rates rise and bond prices fall. Here\u2019s one way you can treat the anticipated wounds to your taxable portfolios. In industry parlance, it\u2019s called a tax swap. You simply sell one bond to harvest a tax loss and then buy another one of similar maturity. In a taxable portfolio, realizing losses can reduce your tax bill in several ways:\n\n1. Losses in asset can be used to offset realized capital gains on another investment.\n\n2. They can be carried forward to offset future realized capital gains.\n\n3. They can be used to reduce ordinary income in current and future tax years by a maximum of $3,000 per year.\n\nBecause of the higher income-tax rates that went into effect last year because of the fiscal cliff deal and Obamacare (Affordable Care Act), tax efficiency is more important than ever.\n\nTax Swapping\n\nSay you sold a double-A minus-rated bond with a 5% coupon that matures in May 2028, callable in May 2018. And say you realized a loss of $7,744 and had total proceeds of $224,718. Then you buy a AAA-rated municipal bond with a 5% coupon that matures in October 2028, callable October 2019, for a total of $225,939. The transaction costs you $1,200.\n\nHow did this bond swap benefit you? In this example, you increased the credit quality, along with the call protection and extended the maturity by five months. If you had no realized gains for the year you could offset ordinary income by $3,000. The remaining $4,744 can be carried forward to future years.\n\nAs we all know too well, the IRS likes to put rules and regulations in place so we don\u2019t do tax swaps willy-nilly.\n\nIn doing these bond swaps, you need to be attentive to what\u2019s considered substantially identical and the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s wash sale rule. The wash sale rule basically states that if you have a losing position, sell it, and then buy back the same -- or substantially identical -- asset within 30 days, you cannot count that as a tax loss.\n\nThe term \u201csubstantially identical\u201d is a fuzzy rule under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a7 1091, hence the tax courts are hearing several cases related to bond sales.\n\nFor example, according to Revenue Ruling 1960-195, the new issue Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority 3.45% Revenue Bonds and the additional issue Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority 4.5% Revenue Bonds were not deemed \u201csubstantially identical\u201d securities. These bonds were issued by the same issuer at different times with the same maturity and a 1.05% difference in coupon rates. But they were not considered substantially identical.\n\nPlease keep in mind that everyone\u2019s situation is different and you should consult your or a tax expert to make sure this makes sense for you.\n\nKenneth J.
