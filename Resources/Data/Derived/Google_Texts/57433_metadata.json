Kim Cattrall has teamed up with Pfizer to alleviate the stress that\u2019s entangled in a woman\u2019s menopause chapter by telling her story and teaching them to embrace it with poise. The campaign has also created a personalized song collection, \u201cTune In To Menopause\" playlist, on Pandora Radio for women, designed to inspire them through their new journey.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve really discovered about menopause is that there\u2019s no two menopauses that seem to be alike. There\u2019s no one size fits all...\u201d Golden Globe-winning Actress Kim Cattrall, who is best known for her role as Samantha Jones in the HBO series Sex and the City, told Medical Daily. Cattrall played a very vivacious and take-charge kind of woman who begrudged the process of menopause and approached it with a sense of dread.\n\n\u201cPlaying a character before I was in menopause is one thing, but actually going through it two years later after we filmed those sequences and having experienced my own menopause, I\u2019ve really thought in some ways I\u2019d like to go back and address it differently,\u201d Cattrall said. \u201cIt was quite overwhelming for me. You could see that Samantha didn\u2019t like it, but she didn\u2019t like it like she didn\u2019t like a certain outfit. Menopause was quite bewildering for me in the beginning, which is why I went to my doctor, writing down the symptoms and saying this is what I\u2019m experiencing and then working through the process.\u201d\n\nTo be able to bring the menopause conversation to the forefront, the campaign encourages on motivating women during this new advent in their lives and to learn how to embrace the changes with a sort of savviness. Every time a woman goes onto the site and participates in the \u201cmeno-cause\u201d quiz to help women find out what their menopausal style is, Pfizer will donate one dollar. The company plans on donating up to $50,000 to Dress for Success, a nonprofit organization aimed at helping women transition back into the workforce by providing them professional attire and a network that breeds career development and confidence. Cattrall has been a long-time supporter of the organization and believes the two causes interweave seamlessly, with the same support and collaborative mission.\n\n\u201cWhen women hit this stage, they think, \u2018OK, I\u2019m just getting old and my body is decaying and there\u2019s just nothing I can do about it,\u201d Obstetrician and Gynecologist Dr. Patricia Sulak, told Medical Daily. Sulak, who treats patients at the Scott & White Hospital and Clinic as well as Texas A&M College of Medicine, has more than 34 years of experience specializing in menopause, and has worked as the medical advisor for TuneInToMenopause.com. \u201cBut that\u2019s so wrong! There are so many things that we can be doing at this stage. This stage is critical.\"\n\nThe importance of creating a strong relationship with a doctor during this stage in a woman\u2019s life is, as Cattrall calls it, \u201cinstrumental\u201d to helping her through the process. Every day another 6,000 more women enter into the first stages of menopause, which is defined as a not having a menstrual cycle for 12-consecutive months. But once those months are over, it\u2019s not just a marker in their life, as Sulak says. Women will be in menopause for the rest of their lives until they die. It just depends what menopausal symptoms they're experiencing and how long or severe those symptoms may be.\n\nWhile 80 percent of women have moderate to severe hot flashes, it turns out 50 percent of women over the age of 50 have low bone density, and if not managed, can lead to osteoporosis, which is a disease that makes bones fragile and much more likely to fracture. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the hot flashes that women go through, but also it\u2019s things that women don\u2019t sense, such as the osteoporosis that can be developing,\" Sulak added. \"During menopause there\u2019s accelerated bone loss that we know occurs by the first few years after that last menstrual cycle. Menopause can really affect a woman\u2019s personal and professional life.\u201d\n\nSamantha Jones\u2019 Menopause\n\nKim Cattrall Tune In To Menopause Kim Cattrall Tune In To Menopause\n\n\u201cMy platform, especially since Sex and the City, has been looking at issues that affect women and what it\u2019s like to be a woman living in this time in this age and the challenges that that poses that. The work I\u2019m choosing to do is reflecting a lot of what I\u2019m experiencing in my life,\u201d Cattrall said, adding:\n\nI think the one piece of advice I hear in my heart and also think about the things in my past, as far as encouraging myself, is to be good to yourself and take care of yourself. And that\u2019s not just meaning go on vacations or to order that great dessert that you\u2019ve been depriving yourself of. It\u2019s really taking measures to know what\u2019s going on in your body, in your mind with your hormones, and to take time to yourself. Investing in yourself by tuning into what\u2019s going on with you is really discovering the true sense of who you are and allowing it to happen.\n\nAside from her inspiring campaign and story for the women of Tune In To Menopause, Cattrall recently produced and starred in a new series Sensitive Skin, which premiered in July. The Canadian HBO series revolves around a married couple and a woman going through a midlife crisis.\n\n\u201cIt was liberating and empowering to take on themes that not a lot of people are addressing and find the comedy in it and the humor in it and to also find the pathos, the irony, and the fear and trepidation to make it as fully realized a story as much as possible. So this is really part of a thematic work process for me to be able to speak to women my age about these very important issues,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kim, cattrall, and, pfizer, launch, tune, menopause, campaign, sex, and, city, stars, platform", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new menopause campaign sets up a platform for women, with Kim Cattrall and Pfizer's support system leading the way.", "title": "Kim Cattrall Wants To Help Women Transition Into Menopause Gracefully", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kim-cattrall-and-pfizer-launch-tune-menopause-campaign-sex-and-city-stars-platform-promote-304600", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/kim-cattralls-story-inspire-menopausal-women.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new menopause campaign sets up a platform for women, with Kim Cattrall and Pfizer's support system leading the way.", "title": "Kim Cattrall Wants To Help Women Transition Into Menopause Gracefully", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kim-cattrall-and-pfizer-launch-tune-menopause-campaign-sex-and-city-stars-platform-promote-304600", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/kim-cattralls-story-inspire-menopausal-women.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/kim-cattralls-story-inspire-menopausal-women.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-23T18:01:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-24T12:42:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new menopause campaign sets up a platform for women, with Kim Cattrall and Pfizer's support system leading the way."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83b8\"", "article_summary": "\"During menopause there\u2019s accelerated bone loss that we know occurs by the first few years after that last menstrual cycle.\nAside from her inspiring campaign and story for the women of Tune In To Menopause, Cattrall recently produced and starred in a new series Sensitive Skin, which premiered in July.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve really discovered about menopause is that there\u2019s no two menopauses that seem to be alike.\nCattrall played a very vivacious and take-charge kind of woman who begrudged the process of menopause and approached it with a sense of dread.\nThe campaign has also created a personalized song collection, \u201cTune In To Menopause\" playlist, on Pandora Radio for women, designed to inspire them through their new journey."}
