Republicans on Capitol Hill would love nothing more than to derail the system, but with President Obama in office, that\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nThe right has instead focused on state-level fights, most notably Medicaid expansion through the ACA, which is a voluntary policy for governors and state legislators. If conservative groups and activists can persuade state-level Republicans to reject the policy, they can block \u201cObamacare\u201d from reaching more people and prevent the uninsured rate from falling further.\n\nAnd while this campaign has had some success, the wall of opposition continues to slowly crumble. This week, South Dakota\u2019s Republican governor became the latest to endorse Medicaid expansion. The Argus Leader reported\n\nTens of thousands of low-income South Dakotans could gain access to subsidized health care plans if the federal government agrees to a plan by Gov. Dennis Daugaard. Daugaard announced a plan to expand Medicaid in the state Tuesday during an address to unveil the Republican governor\u2019s $4.8 billion budget plan.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s legislature is dominated by a Republican majority, much of which is skeptical of the policy, so it\u2019s hardly a done deal. But the fact that yet another GOP governor in a ruby-red state has embraced the ACA policy is further evidence of a growing wave.\n\nIndeed, last week, Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead (R), a former opponent of Medicaid expansion, also reversed course and endorsed the idea as a way of reducing his state\u2019s budget shortfall.\n\nThis follows Louisiana\u2019s latest steps towards adopting Medicaid expansion, and Alabama taking steps in the same direction.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Kentucky, the only state of the 30 that have already accepted Medicaid expansion that wants to move backwards. New Gov. Matt Bevin (R) had vowed to eliminate the policy altogether, but he\u2019s now clarifying that he envisions an Indiana-style approach to Medicaid expansion, which would leave much of the status quo intact.\n\nThe far-right governor apparently discovered taking health security away from thousands of his constituents is easier said than done.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The wall of opposition to Medicaid expansion through the ACA continues to slowly crumble.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-right-red-states-embrace-medicaid-expansion", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The wall of opposition to Medicaid expansion through the ACA continues to slowly crumble.", "title": "Ignoring right, red states embrace Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-right-red-states-embrace-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=r7ZUIbER", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-right-red-states-embrace-medicaid-expansion", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/2013-09-29t010721z_1832254206_gm1e99t0p9501_rtrmadp_3_usa.jpg?itok=VlkmNjZk", "height": 553}, "title": "Ignoring right, red states embrace Medicaid expansion", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The wall of opposition to Medicaid expansion through the ACA continues to slowly crumble."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-10T09:20:24-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Ignoring right, red states embrace Medicaid expansion", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care,health-care-policy,health-care-reform,kentucky,medicaid,obamacare,south-dakota,wyoming,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "12/10/2015 09:20:24 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ignoring-right-red-states-embrace-medicaid-expansion"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "The wall of opposition to Medicaid expansion through the ACA continues to slowly crumble.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Health Care, Health Care Policy, Kentucky, Medicaid, Obamacare, South Dakota, Wyoming"}, "article_summary": "Matt Mead (R), a former opponent of Medicaid expansion, also reversed course and endorsed the idea as a way of reducing his state\u2019s budget shortfall.\nThe right has instead focused on state-level fights, most notably Medicaid expansion through the ACA, which is a voluntary policy for governors and state legislators.\nAnd then there\u2019s Kentucky, the only state of the 30 that have already accepted Medicaid expansion that wants to move backwards.\nThis follows Louisiana\u2019s latest steps towards adopting Medicaid expansion, and Alabama taking steps in the same direction.\nThis week, South Dakota\u2019s Republican governor became the latest to endorse Medicaid expansion."}
