One in nine fear they will be unable to meet January\u2019s payments, as families struggle to balance their budgets after Christmas.\n\nShelter says \u201csky high housing costs\u201d mean more people risk being swamped by their mortgage or rent demands.\n\n\u201cMany people have spent a long time thinking they have nowhere to turn and are often close to breaking point by the time they come to us. If you\u2019re in this situation, it\u2019s so important to remember you\u2019re not alone and that help is available,\u201d said Shelter\u2019s helpline adviser, Nadeem Khan.\n\nThe number of visitors to its website seeking advice on eviction, repossession and rent and mortgage arrears has spiked in recent months, suggesting the problem is becoming more acute, a spokesperson said.\n\nShelter urged people to get in contact if they need help to avoid eviction.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lady recently who was sick with worry for months because she couldn\u2019t meet her mortgage payments and felt too ashamed to ask for help,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhen finally a court notice landed on her doorstep she came to us and we were able to help the family keep their home.\u201d\n\nEvictions hit a record high of more than 100 a day in the autumn. Bailiffs repossessed more than 11,000 rented properties between July and September, the highest quarterly figure since records began in 2000, and 2,805 mortgage borrowers lost their homes during the quarter.\n\nThe bedroom tax has been blamed for driving the increase in evictions, by cutting the amount of housing benefit paid to social housing tenants whose homes are deemed too large for their requirements.\n\nUK interest rates are likely to remain at their current record lows for some months, but a rise in borrowing costs could push more overstretched households into financial trouble.\n\nAnother survey found that a third of borrowers would struggle to meet repayments if they increased by between \u00a3100 and \u00a3199 a month.\n\n\u201cOur latest mortgage mood data suggests that many borrowers are not ready for an interest rate rise,\u201d said Jeremy Duncombe, the director of Legal & General Mortgage Club. \u201cThe last time rates went up in the UK was in 2007, and although the base rate has been static at 0.5% for over five years, they will rise sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Money Advice Service, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would add \u00a390 a month to the cost of repaying a \u00a3180,000 mortgage. A rise of two points, taking the Bank of England\u2019s base rate to 2.5%, would add almost \u00a3200 a month to the average repayment.\n\nThe Bank of England has repeatedly said it would raise interest rates gradually when the time comes. It has also indicated that borrowing costs will remain low until there are signs that real wages are rising.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "description": "Interest rate rise would put many more in trouble, with almost 60% saying they are already struggling to meet housing costs", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Interest rate rise would put many more in trouble, with almost 60% saying they are already struggling to meet housing costs", "title": "Millions fear missing January\u2019s rent or mortgage payments, says Shelter", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/05/missing-rent-mortgage-payments-shelter-interest-rate-housing-costs", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/4/1420389305457/Evictions--012.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=ef517ae9e85481c11d0856c7d82e52d4", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2015/jan/05/missing-rent-mortgage-payments-shelter-interest-rate-housing-costs?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/05/missing-rent-mortgage-payments-shelter-interest-rate-housing-costs", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2015/jan/05/missing-rent-mortgage-payments-shelter-interest-rate-housing-costs?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/4/1420389305457/Evictions--012.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2015/jan/05/missing-rent-mortgage-payments-shelter-interest-rate-housing-costs?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Housing,Borrowing & debt,Mortgage arrears,Renting property,Communities,Society,Property,Mortgages,Money,Homelessness,Social exclusion,UK news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-01-05T00:02:01.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/graemewearden", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T07:33:59.000Z", "tag": "Housing,Borrowing & debt,Mortgage arrears,Renting property,Communities,Society,Property,Mortgages,Money,Homelessness,Social exclusion,UK news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/4/1420389305457/Evictions--012.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=50235690403442cd641b3fa81f74f5b7", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Housing,Borrowing & debt,Mortgage arrears,Renting property,Communities,Society,Property,Mortgages,Money,Homelessness"}, "article_summary": "More than 3m households in Britain fear missing their rent or mortgage payments this month, Shelter has said, adding that an interest rate rise would put many more in trouble.\nShelter says \u201csky high housing costs\u201d mean more people risk being swamped by their mortgage or rent demands.\nThe Bank of England has repeatedly said it would raise interest rates gradually when the time comes.\nResearch from the housing and homelessness charity shows that almost 60% of people say they are struggling to meet their housing costs.\n\u201cOur latest mortgage mood data suggests that many borrowers are not ready for an interest rate rise,\u201d said Jeremy Duncombe, the director of Legal & General Mortgage Club."}
