Through renovations, construction, new exam rooms and new hires, the clinics hope to bring what used to be viewed as disparate medical services into an integrated service model known as a \u201cpatient-centered medical home.\u201d\n\nThe three health centers are among 147 community clinics across that country that received $35 million in grants under the Affordable Care Act. In California, 21 health centers received a total of $5.3 million.\n\nAt Santa Rosa Community Health Centers, the funds are key to the success of a $360,000 project that will renovate 1,400 square feet of office space recently vacated near the Southwest Community Health Center campus.\n\nThe project will add seven new exam rooms and a new dental room, as well as space for an integrated care team that will address \u201cthe full spectrum of patient needs,\u201d said Laurie Lynn Hogan, a spokeswoman for Santa Rosa Community Health Centers.\n\nHogan said the care team will include three new medical providers whose work will be integrated with an existing mental health professional, a perinatal health educator, a registered nurse and a clinical team assistant.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that each patient has a whole team of providers available to them in addition to their primary care providers,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nThe one-stop, team approach allows for a \u201cwarm hand-off\u201d of patients between the primary care doctor and the mental health provider.\n\n\u201cIt dramatically increases the ability to intervene in crisis situations,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cAnd it increases the amount of follow-up care that can be provided because there\u2019s already a relationship established.\u201d\n\nHogan said it also reduces the stigma attached to mental health services, \u201cespecially for the Latino community, because the introduction is made by a trusted source of medical care.\u201d\n\nThe renovation and new hires will ultimately allow the health center to accommodate an additional 10,200 patient visits a year, as well as 1,288 on-site dental screenings.\n\nAt Alliance Medical Center, the federal funds will be used to expand the Healdsburg clinic by three exam rooms, said Beatrice Bostick, Alliance\u2019s chief executive officer. Another physician will be hired to care for patients newly insured under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting over 1,000 new patients to be seeking care at Alliance Medical Center over the next six months. We\u2019re pro-actively trying to build the space to accommodate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo create a patient-centered medical home you need to do things to your existing structures and existing buildings to better support the concept of team-based medical care,\u201d said Mary Szecsey, executive director of West County Health Centers.\n\nSzecsey said her organization will use the money to make improvements at the Forestville Wellness Center, which focuses on health education, healthy lifestyles and managing care so patients can better improve their own health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three Sonoma County health centers will receive federal funds aimed at site", "story version": 2016, "og": {"site_name": "Santa Rosa Press Democrat", "description": "Three county health centers will receive money aimed at improvements that will allow the clinics to accomodate a wave of newly insured patients.", "title": "Federal funds help Sonoma County clinics integrate health care", "url": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/2613606-181/federal-funds-help-sonoma-county", "image": "http://www.pressdemocrat.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=T60w_8$U0sXHPBOLXOCEoM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtaAXHrWaqd8VtXNYMvvfLmWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100003031242373, "app_id": 125780984227497}, "msvalidate.01": "9E66801B649686495190ABE3DA8985E7", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressdemocrat", "published_time": "2014-09-01T21:35:00-08:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Santa Rosa Community Health Centers, Alliance Medical Center in Healdsburg and West County Health Centers each received $250,000 to help fund facilities improvements.\nThree Sonoma County health centers will receive federal funds aimed at site improvements that will allow the clinics to accommodate a wave of newly insured patients and better integrate aspects of medical care that include mental, dental and preventative health service.\nAt Santa Rosa Community Health Centers, the funds are key to the success of a $360,000 project that will renovate 1,400 square feet of office space recently vacated near the Southwest Community Health Center campus.\nAt Alliance Medical Center, the federal funds will be used to expand the Healdsburg clinic by three exam rooms, said Beatrice Bostick, Alliance\u2019s chief executive officer.\nThe goal is part of a national health care movement toward comprehensive, patient-focused treatment and away from the traditional model that treats a single symptom or illness when individuals visit their doctor."}
