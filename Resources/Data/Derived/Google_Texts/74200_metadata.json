He didn\u2019t say a word about his probable presidential run, but his political proselytizing sounds like an appeal to his future political base. The only problem is the long list of controversial statements collected by the media.\n\nCarson\u2019s lecture, organized by the Kalamazoo Christian School Association, drew over 1,300 people, including local young people brought in from a half-dozen community organizations to hear the doctor\u2019s message and life story. Tickets cost $50 each, but the proceeds were donated to charity.\n\nBen Carson\u2019s speech was originally described as a look at how faith and family helped him achieve success, but it regularly mixed in his political views. According to MLive, Carson talked about his opposition to Obamacare, the idea that American education has been \u201cdumbed down,\u201d and his contempt for political correctness.\n\nAnd he has proved that he doesn\u2019t believe in political correctness.\n\nAs previously reported by the Inquisitr, Ben Carson said that the United States \u201cis very much like Nazi Germany, I know you\u2019re not supposed to say \u2018Nazi Germany,\u2019 but I don\u2019t care about political correctness.\u201d\n\nAs MSNBC reported, Dr. Ben Carson has also said that Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\u2026 It is slavery, in a way.\u201d\n\nHe also said of the new revamped AP history curriculum, \u201cI think most people when they finish that course, they\u2019d be ready to go sign up for ISIS.\u201d\n\nDr. Carson had some strong allegations against the president too, saying that if someone really wanted to understand Barack Obama\u2019s plan for America they should, \u201cread \u2018Mein Kampf,\u2019 and read the works of Vladimir Lenin.\u201d\n\nDespite the many quotes that some might consider extreme, Ben Carson seems to have high political ambitions.\n\nThe doctor said that there is a strong \u201clikelihood\u201d that he will be running for president. Although stopping short of officially announcing his candidacy, the renown neurosurgeon will release the biographical infomercial A Breath of Fresh Air: A New Prescription for America that details his life growing up.\n\nIn another sign of his impending candidacy, Carson cut ties with Fox News despite being a long time contributor. (Broadcasters cannot keep a presidential candidate on the air unless they give equal air-time to political rivals.)\n\nStill, even with his ad hoc statements, Carson\u2019s story may carry some appeal with voters. He grew up in dire poverty in a plight stricken home in Detroit. His single mother, working multiple jobs to support the family, forced young Ben Carson to read two books a week, which eventually brought up his grades and started him on the road to one day become a famous neurosurgeon.\n\nWhether that will be enough to be taken seriously as a candidate is still a problem for Ben Carson.\n\n[Image Credit: Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia Commons]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson told a crowd in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that \"we're making an attempt to push god out of our nation,\" and that Barack Obama does not get to decide if", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Ben Carson told a crowd in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that \u201cwe\u2019re making an attempt to push god out of our nation,\u201d and that Barack Obama does not get to decide if", "title": "Ben Carson On Faith: We\u2019re Attempting To Push God Out Of Our Nation", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1613383/ben-carson-on-faith-were-attempting-to-push-god-out-of-our-nation/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ben-Carson-670x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-16T15:58:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T16:15:24+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ben-Carson-670x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-11-16T15:58:03+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "ben carson,2016 presidential election,ben carson controversy,ben carson president,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ben-Carson-670x409.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ben Carson told a crowd in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that \u201cwe\u2019re making an attempt to push god out of our nation,\u201d and that Barack Obama does not get to decide if"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4b9\"", "article_summary": "Ben Carson told a crowd in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that \u201cwe\u2019re making an attempt to push god out of our nation,\u201d and that Barack Obama does not get to decide if America is a Judeo-Christian nation.\nWhether that will be enough to be taken seriously as a candidate is still a problem for Ben Carson.\nHe didn\u2019t say a word about his probable presidential run, but his political proselytizing sounds like an appeal to his future political base.\nIn another sign of his impending candidacy, Carson cut ties with Fox News despite being a long time contributor.\nThe only problem is the long list of controversial statements collected by the media."}
