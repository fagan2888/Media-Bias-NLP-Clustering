Now, it can only be accessed by government officials with the required security clearance.\n\nAt the end of last year, the auditors told lawmakers they were concerned about the government\u2019s decision to classify some important information on the Afghan forces mission. But now, they say the new classifications have gone \u201cmuch further,\u201d including retroactively classifying data that SIGAR has been using every \u201cquarterly report for the past six years to discuss the progress of the ANSF.\u201d\n\nRelated: 7 Threats to U.S. Rebuilding Efforts in Afghanistan\n\nDefense officials, for their part, told SIGAR the data is now classified due to security reasons\u2014though they declined to go into detail.\n\n\u201cI cannot comment upon the precise reason why certain information was considered unclassified in the past,\u201d General Campbell wrote in a response to the SIGAR report. \u201cHowever, I am compelled to also protect the lives of those individuals who could be put at risk by the release of sensitive information.\u201d\n\nThe IG\u2019s concerns about the \u201cunprecedented\u201d classification, comes after auditors released several alarming audits detailing the lack of accountability over the Afghan forces.\n\nIn one report, SIGAR revealed the government has essentially no oversight of the annual $300 million intended to go toward the Afghan National Police Force\u2019s payroll. The report suggested that much of that money was ending up in the wrong hands.\n\nNow, that information is classified and any new findings on the funding by SIGAR will not be available to the public.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Defense Department just made it extremely difficult for federal auditors to keep t", "title": "What the Pentagon is Hiding from Its Auditors", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/29/What-s-Pentagon-Hiding-It-s-Auditors", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09192014_pentagon_mini.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/29/What-s-Pentagon-Hiding-It-s-Auditors", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09192014_pentagon_mini.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Defense Department just made it extremely difficult for federal auditors to keep t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "At the end of last year, the auditors told lawmakers they were concerned about the government\u2019s decision to classify some important information on the Afghan forces mission.\nNow, the auditors say, classifying the increasing amount of information will hamstring their efforts and make it difficult to hold agencies and contractors accountable.\nThe Defense Department just made it extremely difficult for federal auditors to keep track of how billions of dollars are being spent in Afghanistan.\n\u201cI cannot comment upon the precise reason why certain information was considered unclassified in the past,\u201d General Campbell wrote in a response to the SIGAR report.\nIn one report, SIGAR revealed the government has essentially no oversight of the annual $300 million intended to go toward the Afghan National Police Force\u2019s payroll."}
