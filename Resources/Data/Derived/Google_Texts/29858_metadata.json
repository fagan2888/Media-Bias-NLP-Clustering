Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. The U.S. forces accompanied the Somali troops on the mission, but did not \u201cgo all the way to the objective,\u201d he said.\n\nA Somali intelligence official told The Associated Press that the person they wanted to get was apparently killed during the fight.\n\n\u201cIt was a high-profile target, and chances of capture were challenged by a stiff resistance by militants guarding the house targeted by the special forces, which forced the commando to resort to the kill or capture method,\u201d the official said. He spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press on the matter.\n\nAnother Somali intelligence official provided a similar account to AP. The exact target of the raid, if any, remains unclear.\n\nThe spokesman for the U.S. Africa Command, Col. Mark Cheadle, said the U.S. forces got out of the aircraft but \u201cstayed in a safe area to observe the actions on the objective.\u201d\n\nHe said the U.S. forces did not fire their weapons during the mission. He said the Somali troops successfully conducted the mission.\n\nThere were no U.S. casualties, Davis said.\n\nMore than 10 militants were killed, said other U.S. officials Wednesday who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an operation that has not been announced publicly.\n\nRoughly 50 U.S. special operations troops have been operating in Somalia on a rotational basis for the last few years. The raid came only three days after the U.S. carried out an air strike on an al-Shabab training camp that the Pentagon said killed about 150 of its members.\n\nThese are some of the most aggressive military actions in Somalia since a U.S. military intervention in the early 1990s during a famine culminated in the so-called Black Hawk Down battle, with heavy U.S. losses.\n\nFor its part, al-Shabab said its fighters had foiled the overnight attack on Awdhegle town in southern Somalia, and that the raiders retreated with casualties.\n\nResidents of Awdhegle described bullet-pockmarked walls blackened from explosions after the attack.\n\n\u201cAl-Shabab fighters cordoned off the area in the morning and made arrests of people suspected to be spies, a resident in the town told AP by phone. He refused to be identified, fearing reprisal by militants.\n\nSheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, a spokesman for al-Shabab, told a militant-run online radio that the foreign forces used two helicopters and that one militant was killed.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hoping to capture a high-profile target, Somali forces hopped off helicopters a couple of miles (kilometers) from an al-Shabab-controlled town, slipped through the dark and got into a fierce firefight that reportedly killed more than 10 Islamic extremists, US and Somali officials said.", "Author": "ABDI GULED", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hoping to capture a high-profile target, Somali forces hopped off helicopters a couple of miles (kilometers) from an al-Shabab-controlled town, slipped through the dark and got into a fierce firefight that reportedly killed more than 10 Islamic extremists, US and Somali officials said.", "title": "Somali forces kill 10 extremists in Somalia: Officials", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/9/foreign-commandoes-said-to-carry-out-night-raid-in/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/15/somalia_violence.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/15/somalia_violence.jpeg", "title": "Somali forces kill 10 extremists in Somalia: Officials", "description": "Hoping to capture a high-profile target, Somali forces hopped off helicopters a couple of miles (kilometers) from an al-Shabab-controlled town, slipped through the dark and got into a fierce firefight", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Al Shabab"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. forces accompanied the Somali troops on the mission, but did not \u201cgo all the way to the objective,\u201d he said.\nMOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - Hoping to capture a high-profile target, Somali forces hopped off helicopters a couple of miles (kilometers) from an al-Shabab-controlled town, slipped through the dark and got into a fierce firefight that reportedly killed more than 10 Islamic extremists, US and Somali officials said.\nHe said the Somali troops successfully conducted the mission.\n\u201cAl-Shabab fighters cordoned off the area in the morning and made arrests of people suspected to be spies, a resident in the town told AP by phone.\nA Somali intelligence official told The Associated Press that the person they wanted to get was apparently killed during the fight."}
