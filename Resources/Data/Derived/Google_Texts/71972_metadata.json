That\u2019s about 5,000 more than the 96,197 Kansans who enrolled before last year\u2019s deadline.\n\nHHS provided numbers for several population centers:\n\n110,572 consumers in the Kansas City area \u2014 which includes Kansas and Missouri \u2014 selected or were automatically enrolled in a plan.\n\n39,120 consumers in the Wichita-Hutchinson area selected or were automatically enrolled in a plan.\n\n12,677 consumers in the Topeka area selected or were automatically enrolled in a plan.\n\nMissouri had 290,201enrollees this year, compared to 253,969 last year. Those numbers include:\n\n134,934 consumers in the St. Louis area.\n\n56,449 consumers in the Springfield area.\n\n22,822 consumers in the Columbia-Jefferson City area.\n\nHHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said 12.7 million Americans signed up for 2016 coverage, including 4 million new people in the 38 states like Kansas and Missouri that rely on the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cSigning up 12.7 million people is an incredible undertaking, especially considering the progress we\u2019ve made to bring down the number of uninsured in years past,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore the marketplace opened in 2013 as part of the Affordable Care Act, the rate of Americans without health insurance ranged from about 15 to 18 percent. The figure now is below 10 percent.\n\n\u201cMore than 90 percent of Americans are insured, and that\u2019s the first time that this has ever been true,\u201d Burwell said.\n\nBut progress in Kansas has been slower than the nation as a whole, according to Health Reform Resource Project Director Sheldon Weisgrau. He said the most recent figure he has seen for the number of uninsured Kansans was about 11 percent, compared with about 13 percent before the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\n\n\u201cIt has dropped, but it has not dropped as rapidly as it has in all the states that have expanded their Medicaid programs,\u201d Weisgrau said. \u201cAnd so Kansas may well now be above the national average in uninsurance, which would be a historical turnaround for us.\u201d\n\nWeisgrau said Kansas\u2019 uninsured rate always was below the national average, but that is no longer the case.\n\n\u201cBecause we have not expanded our Medicaid program, at best we\u2019re going to be at the national average,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is that this year we\u2019re actually going to be above the national average.\u201d\n\n\u201cMissouri\u2019s numbers were spectacular this year,\u201d Weisgrau said. \u201cThe Missouri Foundation for Health poured, I think, literally millions of dollars into outreach efforts this year, and it really paid off. But, you know, it was not only the money. It was a really well-organized, well-thought-out effort. It makes a difference.\u201d\n\nBryan Thompson is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "The enrollment period for the federal health insurance marketplace closed Monday night, with higher enrollment than last year in Kansas and Missouri.
