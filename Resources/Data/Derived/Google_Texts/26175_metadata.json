The sisters have tried to negotiate with the administration, and frankly its response has shown a total misunderstanding of faith.\u201d\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns who provide care for the elderly living in poverty, sued the Obama administration in order to attempt to gain an exemption from an Obamacare mandate requiring them to provide contraceptive and abortifacient drugs in their employee health plans. Catholic teaching forbids the use of these drugs, and thus Little Sisters have argued that providing them would violate their conscience and First Amendment rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided Monday to send the Little Sisters\u2019 case back to the lower courts. According to Fox News, while the case is reconsidered, the Sisters \u2014 one of 37 separate petitioners in the consolidated case of Zubik v. Burwell \u2014 will not face fines for refusing to comply with the mandate.\n\nRyan reiterated his call for the Obama administration to rescind their demand that the sisters comply with the mandate.\n\n\u201cThankfully, we got some good news from the Supreme Court yesterday, when it sent the case back to the lower courts,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly, the court does not believe that the government has done a good enough job protecting religious liberty. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the administration to eliminate this burden once and for all.\u201d\n\nRyan said that although religious liberty is under assault, he is optimistic that it \u201cis going to make a comeback, because there is a growing need for faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people think faith is just an odd, colorful mask for the ugly face of intolerance,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI am not saying we should feel put upon. I mean, saints were thrown to the lions. By that standard, we have it easy. What I am saying is, we have to advocate for our faith. And we should defend religious liberty not just on material grounds \u2014 that is, because people of faith do good things, like give to charity or volunteer. We should also defend it on spiritual grounds \u2014 that is, because living out our faith gives us joy.\u201d\n\nRyan also addressed the impact his Catholic faith has had on his own life.\n\nWhat people of faith understand is there is more to life than what we can see and hear. And there is nothing more life-changing than coming to know the Lord. Once you realize that there is a God, and He is good and He loves you \u2014 not just humanity at large, but you the person \u2014 you realize that you are not alone. You are not just a body. You are body and soul. And life is not just a tale \u201cfull of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d Life is full of meaning. That is why prayer is so important. It is the hotline to heaven.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why we object when government restricts religious liberty: When faith is ruled out of bounds, then happiness itself is put out of reach,\u201d he added.\n\n.@SpeakerRyan takes the stage at @NatCathPrBrkfst pic.twitter.com/MwdysHjNbx \u2014 Kate Scanlon (@kgscanlon) May 17, 2016\n\nRyan concluded his remarks by asking those in attendance to \u201cPlease pray for me and all our elected officials that we may be instruments of God\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nSister Constance Veit of the Little Sisters of the Poor also addressed the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast, telling those in attendance that she is thankful for the ruling and has faith the case will be resolved positively because God \u201cwill not abandon us.\u201d\n\nVeit attended the State of the Union Address in January as Ryan\u2019s guest earlier this year.\n\nMeet my #SOTU guests Sr. Veit & Sr. Marguire.
