The NSA has relied on that provision to justify its bulk, warrantless collection of U.S. phone records, which include \u201cmetadata\u201d about which numbers people call and when, but not the actual content of their conversations.\n\nTo prevent those provisions from lapsing, which intelligence officials say would handicap the government's ability to track terrorists, some lawmakers have sought a way to extend them while also reforming the NSA program.\n\nThe new bill, called the USA Freedom Act, would effectively end the NSA\u2019s phone records collection.\n\nInstead, it would require agency officials to obtain the records from private phone companies after securing a court order. It would also add a new panel of experts to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, allow U.S. tech companies to disclose more about the information they are forced to hand over to the government and impose limits on the FBI\u2019s use of \u201cnational security letters,\u201d which is one way the government obtains companies\u2019 records.\n\n\u201cIt enhances civil liberties protections, increases transparency for both American businesses and the government, ends the bulk collection of data, and provides national security officials targeted tools to keep America safe from foreign enemies,\u201d the four House lawmakers said.\n\nIn a fact sheet circulated among lawmakers, backers touted the bill as a stronger version of legislation that easily passed the House last year.\n\nWhile last year\u2019s bill could have allowed for the NSA to request records in categories as large as an entire area code, the new bill narrows that \u201cspecific selection term\u201d that agents can use for searches. It also gives companies more ways to report about government orders they receive and forces the government to disclose more information.\n\nLast year, a stronger NSA reform bill backed by Leahy and others came just two votes shy of overcoming a procedural hurdle in the Senate, in a major setback for critics of the spy agency.\n\nThe new legislation would renew three expiring portions of the Patriot Act until December 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cthe product of intense and careful negotiations,\u201d Leahy said in a statement. \u201cThe USA Freedom Act is a path forward that has the support of the administration, privacy groups, the technology industry \u2014 and most importantly, the American people.\u201d\n\nLawmakers were originally scheduled to both introduce the legislation and move it through the House Judiciary Committee last week. However, concerns from senior Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee forced a delay.\n\nNow that it has apparently received the Intelligence panel's blessing, however, the legislation could move quickly to the House floor.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee plans to consider it Thursday morning, the panel announced on Tuesday.\n\nStill, it could meet opposition both from hawks concerned about weakening American security and from civil libertarians who oppose reauthorizing the Patriot Act without more sweeping changes.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union quickly came out against the bill, saying it does not go far enough.\n\n\u201cThe disclosures of the last two years make clear that we need wholesale reform. Congress should let Section 215 sunset as it\u2019s scheduled to, and then it should turn to reforming the other surveillance authorities that have been used to justify bulk collection,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the group\u2019s deputy legal director.\n\nOther civil liberties groups are split over their support.\n\nLast week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellPuerto Rico debt relief faces serious challenges in Senate Overnight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Trump outlines \u2018America First\u2019 energy plan MORE (R-Ky.) unveiled legislation to reauthorize the law without making any changes.\n\nWhile critics of the NSA\u2019s powers criticized McConnell's move, it attracted a fair amount of support among hawkish members of the Republican Party.\n\nSen.
