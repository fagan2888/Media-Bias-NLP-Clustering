They particularly resent de Blasio saying publicly that he has told Dante, his mixed-race, 16-year-old son, who sports an afro, to take special care in any police encounter.\n\nThe problem for the NYPD\u2019s conservative supporters is that championing the NYPD slowdown conflicts with their longtime support of the principle that grew out of the Boston police strike \u2014 namely, government employees responsible for public safety never have a right to strike or play fast and loose with the law.\n\nThe Boston police strike began in a year of widespread labor unrest in America. Seattle had undergone a general strike earlier in the year, and with World War I at an end, the underpaid and overworked Boston police let it be known that they wanted to join Samuel Gompers\u2019 American Federation of Labor (AFL). When 19 of them took the lead in joining the union, they were immediately fired; in sympathy a thousand police then walked off the job.\n\nThe reaction of city and state authorities was to call in state troops, and in short order the strike was put down. Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell even told his students that if they volunteered for police duty, the university would schedule makeup exams for any test they missed. For Calvin Coolidge, then the governor of Massachusetts, it was not, however, enough to thwart the striking Boston police. He also insisted that they could not get their old jobs back, and in a ringing telegram that won him national attention, he declared, \u201cThere is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.\u201d\n\nAs the historian Amity Shlaes has pointed out in her recent, admiring biography of Coolidge, the telegram and tough stance made Coolidge a national figure. He won a permanent place for himself in conservative circles. Ronald Reagan admired Coolidge so much that as president he replaced the portrait of Harry Truman that hung in the Oval Office with that of Coolidge. More important, he followed Coolidge\u2019s Boston-police example to the letter when, in 1981, striking air traffic controllers refused his orders to go back to work. Reagan fired all the workers who disobeyed his order, even though the firings made the nation\u2019s airports less safe for many years. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit and negotiate with a union that\u2019s in violation of the law,\u201d Reagan declared. \u201cGovernment . . . has to provide without interruption the services which are government\u2019s reason for being.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "95 years ago, striking cops lost public sympathy \u2014 and a national hero was made by standing up to them.
