Growth, a strong product cycle and a bigger stock buyback. That\u2019s according to FBR & Co. analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nMr. Ives, in a research note Wednesday, maintained his buy rating on the stock, but lowered his price target to $150 from $175. He also lowered his forecasts for total iPhone shipments in a research note.\n\nMr. Ives joins a host of analysts who have recently downgraded their views on Apple\u2019s shares in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Cowen & Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri cut his 12-month price target on Apple shares to $130 from $135. Last week, at least five other analysts lowered their price views amid what they see as indications of underwhelming iPhone sales.\n\nHe expects the release of the iPhone 7 to be a make-or-break moment for the company. \u201c[The] iPhone 7 product cycle \u2026 will dictate the future growth story at Apple.\u201d\n\nThe weaker-than-expected iPhone 6s demand could be good for iPhone 7, as Apple could benefit from some pent-up consumer demand for the product. Yet over the near-term that expedted weakness could cause Apple to hit some speed bumps.\n\nBeyond the next iPhone, Mr. Ives said that new initiatives and products are also important for the company and its future growth: \u201cWe believe management\u2019s laser focus on growth opportunities (e.g., streaming, augmented reality, Apple Watch, auto, etc.) beyond these core devices highlights the entrepreneurial drive that is alive and well at this large technology stalwart, a key ingredient to the company\u2019s recipe for success.\u201d\n\nStill investors will be watching whether and how they deliver on those new product lines.\n\nFinally, Mr. Ives said investors will be closely eyeing Apple\u2019s cash and what it does with it, particularly its overseas cash. \u201c[W]e believe a stepped-up $75 billion to $100 billion buyback would be music to ears of investors given this growing cash hoard.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s shares rose 1% Wednesday, but its shares have slid in the past month and are down nearly 2% this year.\n\nApple did not return requests for comment.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "What do Apple Inc. investors want this holiday season?
