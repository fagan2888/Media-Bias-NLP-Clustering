Another game-planning Tuesday went by with the Broncos\u2019 coaching staff half-thinking they would have Welker for their next game Sunday at Seattle and half-thinking not.\n\nTo be fair, Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll had to half-plan to defend Welker and half-not. Not that anyone around Denver feels sorry for Carroll and the Seahawks.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, league management and the players union were closing in on a reaching agreement on a revised drug policy, according to an NFL source. The new policy would feature testing for illegal performance-boosting, human growth hormone.\n\nThen again, ratification of the revised drug policy has been expected the past two weeks. It got so close Friday, the NFL Players Association had its 32 team union representatives vote to approve the league\u2019s revised drug policy \u2014 ordinarily a final step to an agreement.\n\nBut now it appears a deal is imminent, which means Welker\u2019s four-game suspension would be reduced to the two games he already has served because his infraction for testing positive in the offseason for an amphetamine would shift from the zero-tolerance, performance-enhancement program to the substance-abuse jurisdiction which essentially places first-time violators on probation.\n\nWelker has been training in Denver and is ready to join the Broncos at Dove Valley on a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nHe suffered a concussion in the Broncos\u2019 third preseason game on Aug. 23 but he was cleared two weeks ago by an independent doctor for a return to full football activities, including contact.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Wes Welker to be reinstated Wednesday, says NFL source", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Wes Welker to be reinstated Wednesday, says NFL source", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/16/broncos-wes-welker-to-be-reinstated-wednesday-says-nfl-source/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140903__wes-welker-broncos-090314ep1-2.jpg", "height": 473}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140903__wes-welker-broncos-090314ep1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-16T22:08:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:47:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Broncos\u2019 slot receiver Wes Welker is expected to be reinstated from his suspension by 8 a.m. Wednesday, according to an NFL source.\nCoaches across the league no doubt wish the NFL and players union could have finalized their revised drug policy sooner rather than later.\nAs of Tuesday night, league management and the players union were closing in on a reaching agreement on a revised drug policy, according to an NFL source.\nThen again, ratification of the revised drug policy has been expected the past two weeks.\nWelker has been training in Denver and is ready to join the Broncos at Dove Valley on a moment\u2019s notice."}
