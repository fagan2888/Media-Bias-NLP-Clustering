(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)\n\nTHE BIG IDEA:\n\nPHOENIX\u2014Bernie Sanders is unaccustomed to being heckled by protesters. The self-identified democratic socialist was caught off guard here Saturday when African-American and Latino activists jeered him at Netroots Nation. Sanders\u2019 inability to control the audience \u2013 he tried to shut them up and then he tried to yell over them \u2013 underscores his broader struggle to expand his appeal and highlights why his summer surge is unlikely to last.\n\nThe huge crowds Sanders draws are overwhelmingly white, and polling consistently shows that virtually all of his support comes from whites. After Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two contests on the calendar, Latinos and African-Americans represent a massive share of the Democratic primary electorate in the next two: Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nThe senator\u2019s standard stump speech \u2013 a call for political revolution \u2013 does not include much specifically aimed at Latino or African-American voters. Asked specifically what he\u2019s done for black Americans Saturday, he cited his vote for Obamacare. Asked to offer concrete proposals on what he\u2019d do to help blacks if elected, he initially responded: \u201cWe\u2019re going to transform the economic system so we create millions of new jobs.\u201d The generalities only made the protesters angrier. \u201cI want Bernie Sanders to say my name,\u201d they chanted as the senator tried to speak. The event went so off the rails that the moderator abruptly ended it 15 minutes early. \u201cOkay, good,\u201d said a peeved Sanders. He then skipped a scheduled meeting with black activists.\n\nSign up to get The Daily 202 in your e-mail inbox\n\nSanders aides\u2019 point out that he attended the March on Washington, endorsed Jesse Jackson Jr.\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign and has a 100 percent rating from the NAACP. \u201cBlack lives, of course, matter,\u201d Sanders told the crowd here. But if Sanders cannot bring African-Americans into his coalition, his support in the nominating contest will be decidedly limited.\n\nSTRUGGLING TO SCALE UP\u2014Will the Summer of Sanders be followed by the Fall of Sanders? One of his own strategists mused on that question to a Boston Globe reporter. \u201cAlready the Sanders campaign infrastructure is creaking under the weight of the unexpected interest in his candidacy,\u201d reports Annie Linskey, who traveled with the senator on his weekend campaign swing. \u201cTens of thousands of bumper stickers were on back order. Venues for rallies need to be changed multiple times as the RSVPs pile high \u2026 He revels in this relative lack of professional help. To make his point, he briefly commandeered an interview with a reporter last week in Washington. \u2018Ask me who my campaign finance director is,\u2019 he said over coffee in a Senate cafeteria. \u2018We don\u2019t have one. Ask me who my pollster is,\u2019 he said. \u2018We don\u2019t have one.\u2019 He said he writes his own direct mail.\u201d\n\nWatch a 13-minute clip of Sanders\u2019 give-and-take with the hecklers in Phoenix on YouTube:\n\n\n\n\n\nWEAK ON IMMIGRATION\u2014Sanders helped kill comprehensive reform in 2007, siding with labor over Latinos. Some Latino activists have complained that Sanders does not talk about the issue as much as Hillary Clinton, something else that will prevent him from forming an enduring and viable bulwark of support. At the town hall, moderator Jose Antonio Vargas (an undocumented immigrant who formerly wrote for The Washington Post) pressed Sanders on his vote opposing the 2007 immigration bill, which Clinton supported. Sanders explained that, while he backs a pathway to citizenship, he worries about a flood of cheap labor entering the country and taking jobs from blue-collar Americans. Back then, he spoke about his \u201cstrong support\u201d for \u201csecuring our borders\u201d and \u201cto hold employers accountable for hiring illegal immigrants.\u201d But he voted for the 2013 immigration bill that passed the Senate after getting money to help affected workers.\n\nSOFT ON GUNS\u2014The National Rifle Association played a pivotal role getting Sanders elected to the House. David A. Fahrenthold reports on the front page of today\u2019s Post that the NRA actively opposed the reelection of a Republican incumbent after he sponsored an assault weapons ban: \u201cAs a candidate in 1990, Sanders won over gun rights groups by promising to oppose one bill they hated \u2014 a measure that would establish a waiting period for handgun sales. In Congress, he kept that promise. The dynamic served as an early demonstration that, despite his pure-leftist persona, Sanders was at his core a pragmatic politician, calculating that he couldn\u2019t win in rural Vermont without doing something for gun owners.\u201d Amazing quote: \u201cBernie Sanders is a more honorable choice for Vermont sportsmen than Peter Smith,\u201d Wayne LaPierre, who was \u2014 and still is \u2014 a top official at the national NRA wrote members that year.\n\nSanders supporters see him as a modern-day Robin Hood. (Photo by Charlie Leight/Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 FIRST LOOK \u2014 The first ad from the Chris Christie super PAC focuses on the New Jersey governor\u2019s opposition to the Iran deal. America Leads will put $1.1 million behind the spot in New Hampshire between tomorrow and August 6, including an ad buy on Boston TV and a strong digital component. The 30-second ad shows Christie at a town hall meeting in Sandown, New Hampshire. \u201cThis president is allowing Iran, the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, to have a glide path towards a nuclear weapon,\u201d the Republican tells the crowd. \u201cA strong American military is not built to wage war; it is built to prevent war. I am the only candidate who has actually been responsible for fighting terrorism and has prosecuted terrorists and put them in jail. And if I become president, we\u2019re going to protect the homeland, not lower our defenses against them.\u201d\n\nThe group, led by former Republican Governors Association executive director Phil Cox, reported raising $11 million last week. America Leads has also reserved $2.8 million worth of airtime during the three months leading up to next February\u2019s New Hampshire primary.\n\nThis is part of a broader strategy to \u201clet Christie be Christie\u201d and go positive from the start. With a cameraman at every town hall, the super PAC is developing a library of footage of the governor taking on every issue out there so that when an issue moves to the forefront, like Iran, they can quickly get up on the air with Christie in his own voice saying where he stands. \u201cChristie\u2019s persona and authenticity lend itself to this kind of approach,\u201d a strategist for the group explained. Watch the 30-second spot here:\n\n\n\n\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign floated details of a revamp in capital-gains tax rates that she will propose later this week. The Wall Street Journal reports on its front page that her plan \u201cwould hit some short-term investors with higher rates \u2026 to prod companies to put more emphasis on long-term growth.\u201d The paper says the details of the plan are being finalized, but she \u201cwould create a sliding scale with at least three new rates that change depending on how long an investment is held.\u201d And there\u2019s a nod to the Elizabeth Warren wing: \u201cThe Clinton campaign hasn\u2019t ruled out taxing such investments at the regular income-tax rate.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Cuba\u2019s embassy in Washington officially reopened at midnight after being closed for five decades. There will be a flag raising ceremony later this morning with 500 guests, including a 30-member delegation of Cubans. The foreign minister is scheduled to meet with John Kerry later today. Kerry is slated to go to Havana next month to raise our flag over the U.S. Interests Section.\n\n\u2014 Greek banks reopened this morning after being closed for three weeks, \u201cbut new austerity taxes meant that most everything was more expensive \u2014 from coffee to taxis to cooking oil.\u201d The Associated Press reports from downtown Athens that \u201cpeople queued up in an orderly fashion as the banks unlocked their doors at 8 a.m., but restrictions on most transactions remained. The daily cash withdrawal limit stayed at 60 euros ($65) but the government added a weekly limit of 420 euros ($455).\u201d\n\nCustomers at a bank branch in Athens this morning.

Some lawmakers, including top Democrats, express frustration that the U.N. Security Council gets the chance to vote on the deal this week, signaling the international community\u2019s intention to dismantle the sanctions against Iran before Congress votes on it. (NYT) Members of both the Ku Klux Klan and Black Panthers protested at the South Carolina state house on Saturday, but then local churches gathered peacefully on the grounds Sunday to pray for peace in the state. (The State) Mitsubishi apologized for using U.S. prisoners of war as forced labor in mines during World War II, the first such apology by a Japanese company. (BBC) The widow of Eric Garner and hundreds of protesters rallied to call on federal prosecutors to indict the white police officer who put the black New York City man in a fatal chokehold exactly a year ago, per the New York Post.\n\nPOWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS:\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, 91, was discharged from a Maine hospital yesterday after falling at home and fracturing a bone in his neck last week. Scott Walker said he does not know whether being gay is a choice: \u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion on every single issue out there \u2026 I don\u2019t know the answer to that question.\u201d (CNN) Rick Perry came out against the Boy Scouts of America\u2019s decision to allow openly gay leaders: \u201cI believe that scouting would be better off if they didn\u2019t have openly gay scoutmasters.\u201d (NBC\u2018s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d) Rand Paul apparently threatened to filibuster the highway bill in a bid to defund Planned Parenthood. Ron Paul, breaking with his son, endorsed the Iran deal in a column posted on his institute\u2019s web site.\n\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n\u2014 \u201cAngry protesters in Chattanooga: When\u2019s the government going to do something?\u201d by Greg Jaffe and Thomas Gibbons-Neff: \u201cThe attack in Chattanooga, and the raw anger it has provoked here, illustrate the increasingly daunting odds that U.S. counterterrorism agencies face in an era marked by surging Islamist propaganda and a proliferation of disparate, self-radicalized, one-off threats. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have launched sweeping initiatives aimed at shoring up their ties to Muslim communities across the country\u2026But in many ways the bureau is working against itself. Arrests of suspects accused of planning travel to Syria, sting operations and expanded surveillance have at times alienated the Muslim communities that security agencies depend on for cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cCalifornia drought makes quest for water a consuming grind,\u201d by Eli Saslow: \u201cFor a few days now, they had been without running water in the fifth year of a California drought that had finally come to them. First it had devastated the orchards where Gamboa and his wife had once picked grapes. Then it drained the rivers where they had fished and the shallow wells in rural migrant communities\u2026 \u2018Come live your California dream in this cute ranchette!\u2019 the real estate listing had read, but now the ranchette was another California house with no running water. In a county where half of all residents depend on well water, their well was the 1,352nd to go dry.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\n\u2014 ZIGNAL VISUAL: TRUMP\u2019S TIPPING POINT CAME SATURDAY. \u201cIt was only a matter of time before Donald Trump crossed the kind of line he did on Saturday, when he questioned the heroism of Sen. John McCain, a Vietnam War POW,\u201d Dan Balz writes in this morning\u2019s paper. \u201cThe question now is whether Candidate Trump is immune from the laws of political gravity or soon will be isolated and regarded as an object of scorn or curiosity rather than of presidential seriousness \u2026 Many Republicans said Sunday that they think his attack on McCain (R-Ariz.) marks a turning point for Trump the politician.\u201d Here\u2019s a great graphical representation from our partners at Zignal Labs of what a difference one day can make in presidential politics\u2013\n\nThis is the word cloud of Trump-related mentions on Friday:\n\nAn analysis shows that the conversation about Trump was actually more positive than negative Friday:\n\nBut, by the end of the day Saturday, there was a 15-point swing in sentiment as Twitter turned on Trump:\n\nAnd this word cloud shows the extent to which the McCain comments totally overshadowed everything else:\n\nNO APOLOGY: Trump has an op-ed in today\u2019s USA Today defending himself. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he replied yesterday when asked on ABC if he owes McCain an apology. Speaking to Martha Raddatz, he repeatedly accused McCain \u2014 who still bears the physical scars from the torture he was subjected to during more than five years in a North Vietnamese prison camp \u2014 of having \u201cdone nothing\u201d for veterans.\n\nMore analysis from Balz on why the Trump comment is so significant: \u201cTrump\u2019s candidacy for the GOP nomination is a knot of contradictions. He disparages the Affordable Care Act but has called for a universal national health-care program. He calls himself pro-life after earlier saying he was pro-choice. He wants to expand Social Security benefits. He has repeatedly mocked his opponents in the most personal ways. Could someone like that unite the Republican Party or the country? Such questions have been avoided, along with those of temperament and judgment. What happened Saturday could give license to his rivals and his critics to subject his candidacy \u2014 what he says and how he says it, where he stands vs. where he once stood \u2014 to the kind of scrutiny he has largely escaped.\u201d McCain will make his first comments about the insult on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\n\n\u2013WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT:\n\nPicture of the day:\n\nJohn Kasich does a walk-through at The Ohio State University, where he will kick-off his presidential campaign tomorrow:\n\nBernie Sanders posted this knowing shot from backstage at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Hall of Fame Dinner:\n\nTweets of the day:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) celebrated a special holiday:\n\nToday is #NationalIceCreamDay\u2026 or as I call it\u2013Sunday. Has to be dark chocolate! \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) July 19, 2015\n\nRep.

The push is intended to bring the Social Security Administration in line with laws regulating who gets reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is used to prevent gun sales to felons, drug addicts, immigrants in the country illegally and others.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Des Moines Register, \u201cIn Iowa, Walker aims for Broad Appeal,\u201d by Brianna Pfannenstiel: \u201cWalker told the Register he\u2019s counting on broad appeal to win over conservatives from every segment of the party, as well as independents and \u2018discerning Democrats,\u2019 to win Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses. \u2018Part of the reason we play well in Iowa is we don\u2019t just fit into one field,\u2019 he said. \u2018And this is consistent with how I\u2019ve won in Wisconsin. I do well with everything from the tea party to the so-called establishment, from social conservatives to independents.'\u201d\n\n\u2014 Los Angeles Times, \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s political director brings key lessons from her own (losing) campaign,\u201d by Evan Halper: \u201cLast year, Amanda Renteria returned home to California\u2019s Central Valley to run for Congress and got crushed. The race in the heavily Latino district exposed blind spots in Democratic strategy with Latino voters, who largely stayed home\u2026Now, as Clinton\u2019s political director, Renteria is putting the campaign\u2019s vast resources to work avenging the 2014 midterms, when Democrats were unable to mobilize the coalition of minority voters that had helped elect President Obama twice\u2026Clinton\u2019s massive Latino outreach machine is unprecedented for this stage in a primary. Most Latinos don\u2019t even know the name of Clinton\u2019s closest challenger for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according a new Univision poll.\u201d\n\n\u2014 BuzzFeed, \u201cCan Bill deBlasio turn Uber into the NRA?\u201c, by Ben Smith: \u201cSo will Bill de Blasio pry the Uber app from his constituents\u2019 cold dead hands? That is the experiment the New York mayor will start running on Tuesday, when he imposes a cap on the growth of what is one of the fastest-growing businesses in the world\u2026He is walking into a political buzzsaw: Uber has endless cash, real panic about getting capped in its biggest market, and every incentive to make an example of the high-profile New York mayor. The campaign is being run by David Plouffe, who once pulled off the rather impressive feat of persuading Democrats to hate the Clintons, and who immediately made it personal\u2026\u2019Mayor de Blasio\u2019s plan to stop Uber will cost 10,000 jobs, hurt underserved areas and make wait times for Uber cars skyrocket,\u2019 Plouffe told BuzzFeed in an emailed statement. \u2018With this view, New York City riders can see for themselves how much time this political payback to big taxi owners will cost them.\u2019\n\n\u2014 Wall Street Journal, \u201cDodd Frank Creators on Wall Street Reform, Five Years Later,\u201d by Victoria McGrane and Andrew Ackerman: \u201cWSJ: Do you feel confident that you can declare \u2018too big to fail\u2019 dead? [Ex-Sen. Christopher] Dodd: I think so. \u2026 For the first time, insisting at least four times a year that these regulators sit down together to look over the horizon and what\u2019s occurring, it\u2019s made a difference already\u2026.WSJ: How much success do you think the financial industry has gotten in watering down the congressional intent of Dodd-Frank? Dodd: Not much. I know people complain about [Democratic Massachusetts Sen.] Elizabeth Warren [who has criticized regulators for not implementing Dodd-Frank more forcefully]. Elizabeth cares about this stuff and she\u2019s not antibanking. I know sometimes the rhetoric can be rather excessive. That\u2019s not new to politics. But overall she\u2019s watching carefully what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m grateful to her for that.\u201d\n\nBUZZING AT THE CAPITOL:\n\n\u2014 The Associated Press, \u201cChristmas in the Capitol? Congress\u2019 to-do list grows,\u201d by Andrew Taylor: \u201cCongress\u2019 midsummer to-do list may take until Christmas to clear. At the top are maintaining the flow of highway funding, easing automatic budget cuts to the Pentagon and domestic agencies, renewing tax breaks and raising the debt limit. A misstep at any of several points could trigger a partial government shutdown \u2026 An eventual repeat of a government shutdown is a real possibility, though a short-term government-wide funding measure is likely in September and would buy time for negotiations.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reuters, \u201cCongress to examine FBI handling of Tennessee shooter,\u201d by Andrea Shalal: \u201cLawmakers will examine possible shortcomings in law enforcement or intelligence in the case of a Tennessee shooting that killed five servicemen, a top Republican said on Sunday, adding that the case may be linked to Islamic State. Rep. Mike McCaul, who heads the U.S. House of Representatives homeland security committee, told ABC\u2019s \u2018This Week\u2019 program the case highlighted growing concern about Internet-based directives from Islamic State leaders in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Hill, \u201cDems worry Iran deal may wilt in dog days of August,\u201d by Alexander Bolton: \u201cDemocratic lawmakers are holding back their support for President Obama\u2019s controversial nuclear deal with Iran, knowing the political dynamic surrounding it could change dramatically in the coming months. Political firestorms tend to erupt during the long, hot days of August, when lawmakers meet face-to-face with constituents in town-hall meetings that can quickly grow contentious. Pro-Israel and other political advocacy groups know this and plan to spend tens of millions of dollars over the next two months to build a firestorm of opposition to the deal.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Politico, \u201cDemocratic self-funder preps U.S. House run in Florida,\u201d by Marc Caputo: \u201cSelf-made multimillionaire Randy Perkins is becoming a Washington Democratic favorite to replace Rep. Patrick Murphy after the businessman met last week with party congressional-campaign honchos and said he\u2019d spend as much as $5 million of his own money on the race \u2026 Perkins, owner and founder of AshBritt Inc., a debris-removal service, isn\u2019t yet ready to announce his candidacy. But all signs point toward a bid for the 18th Congressional District, the South Florida swing seat Murphy\u2019s leaving to run\u201d for Marco Rubio\u2019s open seat.\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT\n\nNew bill would allow companies to fire unwed mothers. From the Huffington Post: \u201cIn the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in favor of same-sex marriage, Republicans are pushing legislation that aims to protect Americans who oppose these unions on religious grounds. But critics say the language is so broad, the bill creates a license to discriminate that would let employers fire women for getting pregnant outside of wedlock \u2026 This scenario isn\u2019t merely hypothetical. There are a number of recent cases where religious schools have fired unwed teachers for becoming pregnant.\u201d\n\nHOT ON THE RIGHT\n\nIn an IS training camp, children told: Behead the doll. From The Associated Press: \u201cThe children had all been shown videos of beheadings and told by their trainers with the Islamic State group that they would perform one someday. First, they had to practice technique. The more than 120 boys were each given a doll and a sword and told, cut off its head \u2026 It is part of a concerted effort by the extremists to build a new generation of militants, according to AP interviews with residents who fled or still live under IS in Syria and Iraq.\u201d\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\n\u2013What\u2019s happening today on the campaign trail: Jeb Bush will deliver a policy speech at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, about taking on federal power (\u201cMount Washington\u201d).
