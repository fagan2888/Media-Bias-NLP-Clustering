The victims included American, Chinese, Lithuanian, Nepali, Pakistani, Slovakian, and Ukrainian nationals, and the audacious attack shattered a rare sense of calm in Pakistan\u2019s northernmost corner, bewildering locals. Members of the Pakistani Taliban doggedly scaled the heights to the mountaineers\u2019 camp at an altitude of 15,000 feet and stormed the tents in the dead of night dressed as paramilitary police. One media outlet\u2019s coverage flashed a haunting image of vulnerability: an orange tent on the mountain slopes bathed in moonlight. I wound my way up through a land of glaciers, ibex, and snow leopards to the Khunjerab Pass\u2014one of the world\u2019s highest international border crossings. Five days later, I boarded a plane to Gilgit-Baltistan. I had set out to complete a journey I began 10 years ago: to traverse the mighty Karakoram Highway (KKH) connecting China and Pakistan. A decade earlier, I had traveled along the 800 mile-long KKH from Kashgar in China\u2019s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous region to the border with Pakistan. My travels became my college thesis\u2014an analysis of the relationship between China, Pakistan, and Xinjiang\u2019s restive Uighur Muslims in light of the traffic of militancy, drugs, and arms from Pakistan to Xinjiang. I argued that the KKH, a symbol of Chinese-Pakistani friendship, had proven to be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nNow I set out to complete the journey from the Pakistani side in a week-long trip by plane, car, and boat. Once again, I discovered how lofty international relations and local communities intersect on the KKH\u2014from tales of a \u201cnew Great Game\u201d between China and America and infrastructure woes along the Pak-China Economic Corridor, to remarkable strides for women\u2019s empowerment and development in communities keen to plug into China\u2019s prosperity. I wound my way up through a land of glaciers, ibex, and snow leopards to the Khunjerab Pass at 14,000 feet\u2014one of the world\u2019s highest international border crossings. All the while, I was shadowed by the murder on the roof of the world. *** I began my journey in Pakistan\u2019s capital, Islamabad. I was lucky. The flight to Gilgit is frequently canceled due to inclement weather; travelers can be stranded in the purgatory of Islamabad for days on end. As the plane taxied and took off past military hangars, a reminder of the ever-fuzzy line between Pakistan\u2019s civilian and military realms, the pilot pointed out the breathtaking convergence of three towering ranges that swiftly surrounded us: the Karakoram, the Hindu Kush, and the Himalayas. White knuckles gripping the seat, I alternated between awe and fear as the pilot deftly maneuvered among them, buffeted by unrelenting winds. As the plane reached cruising altitude, the pilot proceeded to outline the blood-stained route below: Abbottabad (where Navy SEALs killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011), Mansehra (where seven people were killed when gunmen attacked the office of an NGO in 2010), Babusar (where 22 Shiite Muslims were pulled off buses and shot in a sectarian hail of bullets in 2012), and Nanga Parbat, in its gory majesty. \u201cThese bastards are driving away our business!\u201d Upon landing in Gilgit, I walked past security officers wearing badges that stated \u201cBe Firm and Courteous.\u201d As we got on what my taxi driver called the \u201cChina Road,\u201d or KKH, his jaunty tone quickly hardened when talk turned to the mountaineers and the perpetrators. Tourism was the lifeblood of the region, and the incident had cast a pall for the foreseeable future on locals' livelihoods. \u201cThese bastards are driving away our business!\u201d the driver exclaimed.\n\n*** Despite the violence plaguing \u201cdown country,\u201d as the locals refer to the rest of Pakistan, Gilgit-Baltistan continues to draw tourists and mountaineers. Its stunning landscape boasts some of the world\u2019s tallest peaks, including the formidable K2, and extensive glacier coverage; in crossing one such glacier, I was struck by the dazzling interplay of ice, light, and time. The night sky is crystal clear given the altitude (and limited electricity), and the stars strewn across it seem tantalizingly within reach. While the terrain is largely hard and rocky, verdant valleys periodically arise along the KKH. Trees are filled with cherries, apricots, mulberries, and irascible magpies. Local treats include poppy soup and bur chapak, a flatbread stuffed with cheese and brushed with apricot oil. Driving north along the KKH from Gilgit, I arrived a couple of hours later in the village of Karimabad, which once served as the capital of the former princely state of Hunza. Theories of the ancestry of Hunza\u2019s inhabitants involve groups ranging from soldiers in Alexander the Great\u2019s army (popular but unlikely) to the White Huns of Central Asia, from whose name Hunza is derived. A magnificent 900-year-old fort in the neighboring village of Altit, with its Hindu Shiva Lingam and Buddhist carvings, attests to the region\u2019s mixed heritage. The Tibetan-style roofing supposedly traces to a Tibetan princess who married a local ruler. Today, the erstwhile rulers, or mirs, of Hunza are politically sidelined. Buffalos lord over the empty swimming pool in front of the current mir\u2019s bungalow in his absence. Gilgit-Baltistan\u2019s strategic location near China and India has decisively shaped its fate. On display in Baltit Fort is a centuries-old trade agreement between the ruler in Hunza and authorities in China, showcasing historic commercial links along a branch of the Silk Road that Pakistan has sought to revive. Conversely, Pakistan has tried to minimize Gilgit-Baltistan\u2019s connections with India, since the region was once part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir that India and Pakistan have bloodily contested since 1947. Islamabad bestowed a measure of self-governance on Gilgit-Baltistan in 2009, though its elected legislative assembly has little say over key industries such as minerals and tourism. \u201cWe are sitting on a population time bomb in Pakistan.\u201d The raucous politics of down country do occasionally trickle up to Gilgit-Baltistan, complicating questions of identity. Slogans from the national elections in May marked the walls along the KKH\u2014ranging from those of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a party that holds sway at the opposite end of the country, in the port city of Karachi, to the All Pakistan Muslim League of former President Pervez Musharraf, who is held in some regard for building the Karakoram International University in Gilgit. Some use the term \u201cPunjabi\u201d\u2014the majority ethnic group in Pakistan\u2014as a catchall for anyone from down country, with hints of disdain for their unruliness and a sense of being culturally and politically distinct from them. Others\u2014those who served in the army, for example\u2014evince great pride in being Pakistani. More important than belonging to the Pakistani nation for many in Gilgit-Baltistan is belonging to the Ismaili community, which follows a branch of Shia Islam led by Prince Karim Agha Khan. (When the wealthy, Western Europe-based spiritual leader had last visited the region, conducting part of his trip by helicopter, followers had carved messages of welcome into the surrounding mountains). Members of the Ismaili community donate a portion of their earnings to the Agha Khan Development Network (AKDN), which has been empowering women in a country where their education and advancement has lagged substantially behind that of men. As one AKDN official told me, \u201cWe are sitting on a population time bomb in Pakistan. We need mothers who can train their sons and we need to unlock the potential of half the country\u2019s population.\u201d\n\nCIQAM, a vocational program in Altit that trains women in carpentry, land surveying, electrical work, and design and drafting, represents real progress\u2014though the resulting changes to social norms are at times creating divisions within households and marriages. The services of trainees are now employed, for example, in constructing furniture for one of Pakistan\u2019s leading hotel chains, the AKDN-owned Serena Hotel. AKDN and other organizations also offer educational services, resulting in a reported literacy rate of around 90 percent in Hunza compared to the national average of under 55 percent. When a friend and I visited one of the schools in Altit, we were invited to address an intent group of middle school students sitting cross-legged on the roof, engrossed in a talent show. My friend exhorted them to focus on their education and recalled an oft-cited saying of the Prophet Muhammad: \u201cSeek knowledge even as far as China.\u201d \u201cIn your case,\u201d my colleague joked, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to go too far!\u201d As AKDN and foreign donors have provided services that the Pakistani state has largely failed to deliver, some in Gilgit-Baltistan and down country have grown concerned about, as one tour guide told me, a \u201cparallel state\u201d in the region. Locals described in hushed tones the omnipresence of Pakistan\u2019s feared intelligence service given the area\u2019s high geopolitical profile. More questions and conspiracy theories swirled following the attack on the mountaineers at Nanga Parbat. It\u2019s the kind of cloak-and-dagger meddling with which locals are all too familiar. *** Once upon a time, Gilgit-Baltistan was center stage in the so-called \u201cGreat Game\u201d between the British Empire and Czarist Russia, which came within mere miles of each other in the upper reaches of the subcontinent. Famously memorialized in Rudyard Kipling\u2019s classic Kim and revitalized in Peter Hopkirk\u2019s The Great Game: On Secret Service in High Asia, the phrase \u201cGreat Game\u201d has entered the local lexicon. Kipling and Hopkirk\u2019s works are displayed in Karimabad\u2019s bookstores. And now, a \u201cNew Great Game\u201d is afoot in the region, as a high school student, a tour guide, and a journalist put it in separate conversations with me. The players this time around: America and China.\n\nI resumed my journey on the KKH pondering this New Great Game, and China\u2019s ancient shadow over the region. The KKH, after all, is just a modern manifestation of a branch of the Silk Road that long connected China with the subcontinent. In the seventh century, the Chinese monk Xuanzang famously traversed this route on his pilgrimage to India to study Buddhism. Building a road on such treacherous terrain and at so high an altitude is a legendary feat of engineering in its own right. With ties cemented in common hostility toward India, China and Pakistan jointly constructed the highway over three decades, completing the project in 1978, at the cost of not just treasure but also blood (900 lives were lost). Today the KKH is hailed as a symbol of China and Pakistan\u2019s \u201call-weather\u201d friendship; a Pak-China Friendship Tunnel burrowed in the mountains drives home the point. \u201cThe stony silence of Khunjerab was broken by mellifluous sound of spaces.\u201d This close relationship has occasionally given China pause; In the 1990s, for instance, Beijing periodically closed the KKH to demand that Islamabad get serious about preventing the highway from becoming a conduit of drugs, arms, and militancy for China\u2019s restive Xinjiang region. But the highway has aroused greater concern in Delhi and to some extent in Washington. India views China\u2019s push into South Asia through large-scale infrastructure projects such as the KKH as an alarming and unwarranted intrusion into its regional sphere\u2014let alone one in an area to which it lays claim. Analysts in the United States have emphasized the importance of China\u2019s toehold in Pakistan both in Gilgit-Baltistan in the north and in Balochistan in the southwest, where Beijing has financed and operates the Gwadar Port. These moves are perceived to be part of China\u2019s larger effort to expand its reach and influence beyond its borders, at America\u2019s expense. Listen closely, and you can hear the rumblings of the New Great Game. For Pakistan, however, the KKH represents the promise of jumpstarting its economy by plugging into China\u2019s. The same week that I was traveling along the KKH, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was in Beijing touting a Pak-China Economic Corridor through upgrades to the KKH\u2014a \u201cgame changer\u201d that would rapidly bolster anemic trade relations. Three speed bumps for the plan were apparent as I rode along the KKH itself, however. The first is security, given a steady uptick in attacks on Chinese nationals in the area, including at Nanga Parbat. (One prevailing theory in Hunza at the time of my visit was that the timing of the attack against the mountaineers at Nanga Parbat, right before Sharif\u2019s visit to Beijing, suggested that the Americans were out to undermine Chinese-Pakistani relations.)\n\nThe second is economics. Local traders along the KKH expressed concern about Chinese goods flooding the market and China benefitting disproportionately from the economic cooperation; Pakistani fruit, for instance, cannot be readily exported to China because of quarantine restrictions, whereas Chinese fruit can freely enter Pakistan. Nonetheless, many saw the Chinese market as a tremendous long-term opportunity. One trader had just returned from Kashgar, where the Chinese government was setting up a mall and offering Pakistani businessmen rent-free space for three years to sell their wares. Others pined for Chinese tourism, noting the mere trickle of Chinese tourists in the region relative to their size and proximity. Yet perhaps the biggest impediment to the envisioned corridor, as readily apparent on the KKH, is Mother Nature. An hour north of Hunza, the highway abruptly vanishes. It lies beneath Attabad Lake\u2014a body of water created by a landslide in 2010 that dammed the Hunza River and wiped out entire villages. Goods going between Pakistan and China on the KKH are now loaded onto boats, which take roughly 45 minutes to cross Attabad; when we made our way across the sparkling blue lake, a beautiful floating graveyard, Chinese Kunlun brand tires were headed down country. Evidence of Chinese influence is everywhere along the KKH\u2014from road signs with messages such as \u201cQuality Is Life\u201d and \u201cSafety Weighs Greater Than Mountains\u201d to Chinese items on restaurant menus. Crews from China\u2019s Road and Bridge Construction Company, some dressed in fatigues, were hard at work. Their metallic camps off the KKH are cordoned off, and security details now shadow them in the wake of several incidents targeting the 10,000 Chinese nationals working on projects throughout Pakistan, from the Gwadar Port to the Gomal Zam Dam. Given the security and language barriers, \u201cPak-Cheen dosti\u201d (Pakistan-China friendship) is on thin air at 14,000 feet, and the Chinese units remain aloof from locals. When I asked one crew in rusty Mandarin to move its steamroller so we could make our way to the border, the site manager shot off a list of grievances\u2014from stomach sickness to a disdain for Pakistanis who could not build their own roads. All-weather friends, it seems, is all well and good in the temperature-controlled halls of Islamabad and Beijing. Relationships exposed to the elements day in and day out are a different story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My travels along the China-Pakistan border", "author": "Ziad Haider", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "My travels along the China-Pakistan border", "title": "Murder on the Roof of the World", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/Exhibit_18_Final_Shot/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/murder-on-the-roof-of-the-world-br-my-travels-along-the-china-pakistan-border/282494/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcee5\"", "article_summary": "All the while, I was shadowed by the murder on the roof of the world.\nOn June 22, 2013, murder occurred on the \u201croof of the world.\u201d Ten mountaineers were killed at the foot of Nanga Parbat\u2014the world\u2019s ninth-tallest peak, located in Pakistan\u2019s Gilgit-Baltistan region on the border with China where some of the world\u2019s tallest mountain ranges converge.\n*** Despite the violence plaguing \u201cdown country,\u201d as the locals refer to the rest of Pakistan, Gilgit-Baltistan continues to draw tourists and mountaineers.\nMy travels became my college thesis\u2014an analysis of the relationship between China, Pakistan, and Xinjiang\u2019s restive Uighur Muslims in light of the traffic of militancy, drugs, and arms from Pakistan to Xinjiang.\nI had set out to complete a journey I began 10 years ago: to traverse the mighty Karakoram Highway (KKH) connecting China and Pakistan."}
