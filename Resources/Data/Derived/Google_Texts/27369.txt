Limoneira Co. has invested in a Chilean packinghouse as its first overseas venture.

The Santa Paula agribusiness said it paid $1.75 million to own a 35 percent interest in Rosales S.A., a packing, marketing and sales business in La Serena, Chile, through its wholly owned Chilean subsidiary, Limoneira Chile SpA.

Rosales handles mostly lemons and sells to Asian markets, Limoneira said. The sale will provide Limoneira with equity income and allow it to make 50 cents per carton on the business's Asian lemon sales. The two elements should bring in an estimated $200,000 to $300,000 per year, according to Limoneira.

The agribusiness said it has had a long-standing relationship with Rosales and the deal allowed it to enter the Chilean agriculture market. It also aligns with Limoneira's goal to become a global, year-round lemon supplier.

"Along with expanding our participation in the growing global lemon business, this investment also enables Limoneira to better evaluate future potential investment opportunities in Chile's vast, productive agricultural properties," said Alex Teague, Limoneira senior vice president.
