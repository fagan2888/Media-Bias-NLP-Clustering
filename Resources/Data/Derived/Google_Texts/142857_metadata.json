Three decades later, the Democrats\u2019 aim is far from perfect, but nobody really doubts that it\u2019s the Republican Party, today, that can\u2019t shoot straight, unless it\u2019s shooting itself straight in the foot. Donald Trump\u2019s serial triumphs, the flat-footedness of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d forces, and the hope, openly expressed by otherwise sober-minded adults, for a brokered bloodletting at the Republican National Convention, in July\u2014it has all come to look like an elaborate, if unwitting, act of self-sabotage. The Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider an Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, too, has the feel of a trap that the G.O.P. set and sprung for itself. As soon as they started it, some Republicans appeared to regret the timing, which followed the news of Antonin Scalia\u2019s death as a foot on a gas pedal follows a green light. Even the instigators\u2014the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the rest of the Senate leadership\u2014have seemed eager to change the subject to something less contentious, like a bipartisan bill to address drug abuse. Within days, opinion polls suggested that the G.O.P. had miscalculated badly: according to the Pew Research Center, only thirty-eight per cent of Americans support the blockade.\n\nOn February 25th, Senator Harry Reid and other Democrats stood on the Supreme Court steps and scolded Republicans: \u201cDo your job.\u201d (There is, of course, a hashtag.) Politico is calling this a \u201cshame campaign,\u201d though it might, more accurately, be described as a \u201cSchadenfreude campaign\u201d: Democrats are having fun with this. At Reid\u2019s prompting, the White House said that it might nominate Governor Brian Sandoval, of Nevada, a Republican, to fill Scalia\u2019s seat, and Democrats like Nancy Pelosi claimed to be open to the possibility, plainly to make Republicans say no to one of their own. (They obliged. So did Sandoval, who withdrew his name from consideration.) Obama is now, according to reports, considering Jane Kelly, an Iowa judge on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, whom Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, once warmly praised. And last week the President summoned Grassley, McConnell, Reid, and Patrick Leahy to the Oval Office for a meeting about the Court. The discussion was brief, and the Republicans left the West Wing without speaking to reporters. Democrats, with cheerful indignation, went back to pressing the issue. \u201cIf any of us needed a reminder of just how important it is to take back the United States Senate and hold onto the White House just look at the Supreme Court,\u201d Hillary Clinton said.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t be clearer that Republicans are risking a backlash. Swing-state senators may be feeling it already, according to polls. In Ohio, where Rob Portman is up for re\u00eblection, and in Pennsylvania, where Pat Toomey will likely face a tough fight, three out of four voters disapprove of Senate Republicans\u2019 reflexive opposition to any Obama nominee. Why, then, is McConnell refusing to back down? Why is his Party touting the Court issue in fund-raising e-mails? Is this just sheer cussedness\u2014or, maybe, a show of deference to conservative interest groups that rely, for their victories, more on unelected judges than on Congress? Or is it possible that, appearances aside, the Majority Leader has a strategy here? He has always been more of a survivor than a grand strategist, but, either way, McConnell seems to be the most confident man in an otherwise uncertain caucus, and now looks calm in his conviction that the Court fight won\u2019t hurt Republicans as much as most observers think\u2014and that it might even help them. He may be proven right.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s put to rest suggestions that McConnell will buckle, open his mind to a judicial moderate, or cut some kind of deal with the White House. This underrates McConnell\u2019s resolve (and overstates his capacity for embarrassment). He is almost certain to succeed in blocking Obama\u2019s selection, whoever he or she turns out to be, and regardless of what happens in the Presidential campaign. McConnell is not banking on the election of a Republican President. (Not one he can stand, at any rate. He has made clear his loathing of both Trump and Ted Cruz.) And if obstructing Obama kicks the can to a Hillary Clinton Administration, so be it: McConnell would not be playing this game of constitutional chicken if he thought a Clinton nominee would be measurably worse than one by Obama\u2014that is, assuming Obama himself is not Clinton\u2019s choice. (\u201cWhat a great idea,\u201d Clinton said in January, though the President has shrugged it off.)\n\nThere is no question that McConnell would regard a liberal Supreme Court majority as an affront to the Constitution and a mortal risk to the Republic; this is now the conservative catechism. But this Court fight, for McConnell, is ultimately less about who controls the Court or the White House than who controls the Senate. McConnell, presumably, prefers it to be himself and not Harry Reid. By moving hastily to block Obama, McConnell might have sacrificed the Senate\u2014if moderates align with Democrats and knock off Portman and others like him. Historically, though, Democrats have had a hard time sustaining interest in, or animus toward, the judiciary. The Court was a non-issue during the 2004 election, the first that followed Bush v. Gore; in 2012, two years after Citizens United v. F.E.C. helped usher in an era of (more) colossal corporate spending in politics, Democrats barely mentioned the Court. So McConnell is betting, not unreasonably, that the battle over Scalia\u2019s seat will do little for Democrats in the handful of states that will determine control of the Senate. It might even prove a fail-safe in the event of a Clinton Presidency. McConnell has told colleagues that this prospect only strengthens the case for a Republican Senate\u2014as a check on a liberal President. That pitch has the potential to unite Republicans at a time when they aren\u2019t united on much of anything else. It could also give anti-Trump conservatives a reason to vote in November.\n\nSo the battle has begun. Groups like Americans United for Life and the National Rifle Association have lined up behind McConnell; the Judicial Crisis Network, a combatant in all manner of court fights, is already running ads against Democrats. And the Republican base, far more than the public as a whole, supports the Senate\u2019s intransigence: Pew puts Republicans\u2019 approval at sixty-six per cent. Among conservative Republicans, it is five points higher still. That will increase in the months ahead, as the post-Scalia Court fails to deliver the results that Republicans had expected this term. In case after case, it will become more and more apparent that the Court\u2019s conservatives no longer have the votes to curb public-sector unions, for example, or to weaken the \u201ccontraceptive mandate\u201d in the Affordable Care Act. Just last week, the Court refused to block an E.P.A. limit on emissions from coal-fired power plants\u2014one more sign that a Scalia-free Supreme Court will, as Ted Cruz predicts, mandate \u201cunlimited abortion on demand\u201d and yield U.S. sovereignty to the United Nations. If Trump is a loser, then only the Senate, it follows, can save the country. Or, at least, only the Senate can save the Senate. And that\u2014in an otherwise dispiriting year\u2014might just be enough for Mitch McConnell.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "Jeff Shesol writes that the Senate Majority Leader appears certain that the Court fight won\u2019t hurt Republicans as much as most observers think.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "The Senate Majority Leader appears calm in his conviction that the Court fight won\u2019t hurt Republicans as much as most observers think.", "title": "Mitch McConnell\u2019s Sensible Supreme Court Strategy - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shesol-mcconnell-court-1200-630.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2016-03-08T14:33:44-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mitch-mcconnells-supreme-court-strategy", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Senate Majority Leader appears calm in his conviction that the Court fight won\u2019t hurt Republicans as much as most observers think.", "creator": "@JeffShesol", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/shesol-mcconnell-court-1200-630.jpg", "title": "Mitch McConnell\u2019s Sensible Supreme Court Strategy - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3176204\",\"title_alt\":\"Mitch McConnell\\u2019s Sensible Supreme Court Strategy\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/03\\/shesol-mcconnell-court-728-375.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2016-03-08T10:10:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T14:33:44-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3176204, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Antonin Scalia, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Election, Election 2016, Hillary Clinton, Mitch McConnell, Supreme Court, White House"}, "article_summary": "The Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider an Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, too, has the feel of a trap that the G.O.P.\nOn February 25th, Senator Harry Reid and other Democrats stood on the Supreme Court steps and scolded Republicans: \u201cDo your job.\u201d (There is, of course, a hashtag.)\nlimit on emissions from coal-fired power plants\u2014one more sign that a Scalia-free Supreme Court will, as Ted Cruz predicts, mandate \u201cunlimited abortion on demand\u201d and yield U.S. sovereignty to the United Nations.\nBut this Court fight, for McConnell, is ultimately less about who controls the Court or the White House than who controls the Senate.\nThere is no question that McConnell would regard a liberal Supreme Court majority as an affront to the Constitution and a mortal risk to the Republic; this is now the conservative catechism."}
