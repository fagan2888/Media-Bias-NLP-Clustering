Notably, it comes as an executive order about employment protections is being drafted at the White House and in the wake of last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in Hobby Lobby.\n\nWhile the debate isn\u2019t new, the method of raising the stakes of the debate on Tuesday was stark: Seven national organizations \u2014 including the ACLU and the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force \u2014 announced in three separate statements that they were withdrawing their support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act due to its current, broad religious exemption.\n\nThe lead sponsor of ENDA in the Senate, Sen. Jeff Merkley, told BuzzFeed in a statement that even he has \u201cconcerns\u201d about where things stand. Merkley\u2019s office said the senator continues to support the bill but that he is looking to make \u201cfixes\u201d going forward with regard to the religious exemption in the bill.\n\nOne of the key House co-sponsors, Rep. Jerry Nadler, told the Washington Blade that he thinks the religious exemption is too broad and will work to narrow it in the House.\n\nFor years, the religious exemption in ENDA has kept growing. In order to grab more moderate Republican support (and the Democratic holdouts) for the legislation that was first introduced in the mid-1990s, the religious exemption has been expanded enough that Sens. Orrin Hatch and John McCain, along with a handful of other Republicans, supported the bill when the Senate voted on it last year.\n\nHere is the religious exemption in the version of ENDA passed by the Senate this past fall:", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3384002, "userid": 315836}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Hobby Lobby, 2015, and President Obama...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
