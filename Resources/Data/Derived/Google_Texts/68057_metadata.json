Being a gadfly presidential flirt who just hovers around the edges of a campaign in order to soak up some attention is nice because there\u2019s no real incentive on the part of reporters to treat you all that seriously. But once you say those special words \u2013 \u201cI am a candidate for president\u201d \u2013 people suddenly start asking you policy questions and try to pin you down on thorny, controversial issues. And Carson, whose political identity and stardom are based entirely on his often outlandish attacks on President Obama, is hilariously unprepared to be an official candidate for the presidency.\n\nLast week, he sat down for an interview with CNBC\u2019s John Harwood who laid down a series of rakes for Carson to step on, and Carson trod upon them with palpable gusto. \u201cIt sounds as if your preferred alternative, both to Obamacare and to Medicare, is a system of self-reliance built around health savings accounts,\u201d Harwood said, referring to Carson\u2019s terrible healthcare plan. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s something you could make happen politically? Medicare is pretty popular.\u201d\n\nNow, Republicans aren\u2019t the biggest fans of Medicare, and their big dream is to one day privatize it. The price they pay for having this dream is withering political fire from Democrats who justifiably attack them for wanting to muck with a successful and popular entitlement program that benefits an electorally active segment of the population. Carson is putting it right out there and saying he wants to get rid of Medicare altogether and replace it with federally subsidized health savings accounts.\n\nAs Harwood intimated, that\u2019s a politically radioactive position. So what\u2019s Carson\u2019s justification for this radical change to healthcare policy? Quite literally, freedom. \u201cWhen people are able to see how much more freedom they will have, and how much more flexibility they will have, and how much more choice they would have, I think it\u2019s going to be a no-brainer,\u201d Carson said.\n\nI cannot wait for Carson to take this pitch down to The Villages and watch him explain to a gaggle of retirees how he\u2019s going to eliminate Medicare and replace it with freedom. It might impel him to rethink that \u201cno-brainer\u201d business.\n\nMoving on from health policy, Harwood asked Carson about some of the more colorful things he\u2019s said about Barack Obama in recent years.\n\nHARWOOD: Obama, you referred to him as a \u201cpsychopath.\u201d What did you mean by that? CARSON: I said he reminds you of a psychopath. HARWOOD: And? How? CARSON: Because they tend to be extremely smooth, charming people who can tell a lie to your face with complete \u2013 it looks like sincerity, even though they know it\u2019s a lie. HARWOOD: Do you think he\u2019s a liar? CARSON: Well, I think he knows full well the unemployment rate is not 5.5 percent. He knows that. He knows that people who are not well-informed will swallow it hook, line, and sinker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The neurosurgeon-turned-pundit who galvanized GOP activists is off to a brutal 2016 start VIDEO", "title": "Ben Carson should embarrass the GOP: How the Tea Party hero is making a complete dunce of himself", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The neurosurgeon-turned-pundit who galvanized GOP activists is off to a brutal 2016 start VIDEO", "title": "Ben Carson should embarrass the GOP: How the Tea Party hero is making a complete dunce of himself", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/11/ben_carson_should_embarrass_the_gop_how_the_tea_party_hero_is_making_a_complete_dunce_of_himself/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/ben_carson2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The neurosurgeon-turned-pundit who galvanized GOP activists is off to a brutal 2016 start VIDEO", "title": "Ben Carson should embarrass the GOP: How the Tea Party hero is making a complete dunce of himself", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/04/ben_carson2.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Ben Carson, CNBC, Gay Marriage, Health Savings Accounts, Marriage equality, Medicare, Medicare privatization, Obamacare, Republican Party, Same-sex marriage, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "HARWOOD: Obama, you referred to him as a \u201cpsychopath.\u201d What did you mean by that?\nMoving on from health policy, Harwood asked Carson about some of the more colorful things he\u2019s said about Barack Obama in recent years.\nCarson is putting it right out there and saying he wants to get rid of Medicare altogether and replace it with federally subsidized health savings accounts.\nHARWOOD: Do you think he\u2019s a liar?\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Ben Carson, CNBC, Gay Marriage, Health Savings Accounts, Marriage equality, Medicare, Medicare privatization, Obamacare, Republican Party, Same-sex marriage, Video, Politics NewsBen Carson has been an official candidate for the presidency for a week now, and already he\u2019s running into some difficulties."}
