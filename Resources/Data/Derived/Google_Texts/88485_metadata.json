John Kasich received a D grade in a new Cato Institute study of governors\u2019 fiscal policies, with Cato researchers repeating concerns Ohio\u2019s free-market think tanks have voiced for years.\n\nCato\u2019s latest Fiscal Policy Report Card on America\u2019s Governors, released Oct. 2, \u201cuses statistical data to grade the governors on their taxing and spending records \u2014 governors who have cut taxes and spending the most receive the highest grades, while those who have increased taxes and spending the most receive the lowest grades.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe report focuses on short-term taxing and spending actions to judge whether the governors take a small-government or big-government approach to policy,\u201d the publication states.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, both Republicans, tied for the top score at 78 and were among the four governors to receive an A in the 2014 report card. Kasich, meanwhile, tied Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder as the lowest-scoring Republican, at 44.\n\nHelped by tax cuts but hampered by higher spending, Kasich\u2019s score placed him lower than eight of 20 Democrat governors in Cato\u2019s analysis.\n\n\u201cGovernor Kasich\u2019s large income tax cuts should be celebrated,\u201d Nicole Kaeding, a Cato Institute budget analyst, said in an email to Ohio Watchdog. \u201cCutting taxes is an important step to fostering economic prosperity within a state. However, the large increases in spending in Ohio over the last several years are disappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Governor Kasich has cut some taxes, he has also supported increasing other taxes like the severance tax on oil and gas production,\u201d Kaeding said. \u201cThis sort of tax increase would move Ohio in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nThe Cato report noted Kasich\u2019s support for the Obamacare Medicaid expansion as a concern, but Medicaid expansion was not one of the variables used in calculating governors\u2019 scores.\n\nOpportunity Ohio and The Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions, Ohio\u2019s two free-market think tanks, have sharply criticized Kasich\u2019s support for Obamacare and called on him to pair tax cuts with state spending cuts.\n\nOpportunity Ohio President Matt Mayer referenced a July 2013 white paper that found the state budget increased by more than 20 percent since Kasich took office in 2011.\n\n\u201cAs we showed with our \u2018When the Lines Cross\u2019 report, Governor Kasich\u2019s budgets increase spending and only balance because of higher revenues,\u201d Mayer explained in an email to Ohio Watchdog. \u201cWhen revenues drop during the next downturn, Ohio will face large deficits again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe fully expect Governor Kasich to continue his tax shifting push to cut personal income taxes by raising sales, severance, CAT and other taxes and fees,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nKasich has indicated a severance tax hike as one of his priorities for a second term.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m talking to Democrats early on about coming over and helping me out on some other issues \u2014 for example, taxing the big oil companies on this severance tax,\u201d the governor said in a Sept. 29 interview on Cleveland\u2019s WTAM 1100.\n\nOpportunity Ohio has produced a three-part video series sharing the stories of Ohioans who could be negatively affected by a severance tax hike, which Kasich has pushed as a funding source for a statewide income tax cut.\n\nThe Buckeye Institute has called for leadership on municipal income tax reform. In late 2013, municipal tax reform proposals in the Republican-dominated Ohio House were replaced with what Americans for Tax Reform, National Taxpayers Union and others described as \u201ca phony reform bill.\u201d\n\nBuckeye Institute analysts have consistently advocated more aggressive income tax cuts while advising caution in state spending, despite increasing tax revenues.\n\n\u201cWhat looks good today as we climb out of the economic hole Ohio fell into during the late 2000s may look less sunny when the next downturn hits,\u201d Greg Lawson wrote in a January 2014 Buckeye Institute release.\n\nData sources for the 2014 Cato report card include National Association of State Budget Officers, National Conference of State Legislators, state budget documents, Tax Foundation, and news articles, the Cato report explains.\n\nAfter reviewing policies proposed or enacted since 2012, Kaeding and tax policy director Chris Edwards assigned scores on a 100-point scale to each governor based on a total of seven spending, revenue and tax rate variables.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio Gov.
