There are also giant Third Reich iron eagles bearing swastikas on the wall, next to Nazi posters. And yes, some of its customers are wearing military uniforms and Nazi armbands.\n\nBut this is definitely NOT a Nazi-themed place. Nope, not at all.\n\nThe owner wants to make this very clear, once for all.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning I have said that the SoldatenKaffee is not a Nazi cafe. This cafe\u2019s theme is World War II,\u201d Henry Mulyana declared during a press conference he organized for the cafe\u2019s reopening last Saturday.\n\nOf course, you could be forgiven for any confusion. The establishment is named after a German military cafe in WWII\u2019s occupied Paris. Giant Nazi flags and Waffen SS propaganda grace its red walls. Customers can order \u201cNazi goreng\u201d (a revisited version of traditional Indonesian fried rice dish \u201cnasi goreng\u201d) served on swastika-motif china, by a waiter wearing an SS uniform.\n\nThe SoldatenKaffee (Soldier\u2019s cafe) first opened in 2011.\n\nThen it attracted the attention of the English-language Jakarta Globe, and subsequently the international media. The story sparked global outrage. The cafe\u2019s owner received death threats and was summoned by local authorities to explain his motives.\n\nAt the time, he argued he didn\u2019t idolize Hitler and had just chosen a theme that he thought would attract customers.\n\nStill, he also claimed there was no proof the Nazis were responsible for the Holocaust. \u201cControversy will always exist, depending on from what side we\u2019re looking from. The way I see it, the Nazis didn\u2019t commit slaughter,\u201d he told the Jakarta Globe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Its owner insists the Hitler portrait, Nazi posters and swastikas on the wall shouldn't be cause for offense VIDEO", "author": "Marie Dhumieres", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Its owner insists the Hitler portrait, Nazi posters and swastikas on the wall shouldn't be cause for offense VIDEO", "title": "Nazi-themed cafe reopens in Indonesia", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/nazi_themed_cafe_re_opens_in_indonesia_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/2.-Indo-Nazi-cafe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Its owner insists the Hitler portrait, Nazi posters and swastikas on the wall shouldn't be cause for offense VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/2.-Indo-Nazi-cafe.jpg", "title": "Nazi-themed cafe reopens in Indonesia", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Nazi-themed cafe reopens in Indonesia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GlobalPost, Indonesia, Nazis, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8697\"", "article_summary": "The establishment is named after a German military cafe in WWII\u2019s occupied Paris.\nThis cafe\u2019s theme is World War II,\u201d Henry Mulyana declared during a press conference he organized for the cafe\u2019s reopening last Saturday.\n\u201cFrom the beginning I have said that the SoldatenKaffee is not a Nazi cafe.\nThe cafe\u2019s owner received death threats and was summoned by local authorities to explain his motives.\nAnd yes, some of its customers are wearing military uniforms and Nazi armbands."}
