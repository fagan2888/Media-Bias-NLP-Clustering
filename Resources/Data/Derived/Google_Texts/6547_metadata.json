We're going to go from Obamacare to Hillarycare. Single payer, socialized medicine in this country. Those are big, big differences. Plus, his approach to the world is a much more muscular approach, much more support for the military.\"Trump will meet with Ryan on Thursday, and Giuliani said that he thinks everyone should hold back on their attacks until after that happens, including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who vowed over the weekend to help Ryan's primary opponent to win the Wisconsin House seat.\"We should stop fighting amongst ourselves,\" said Giuliani. \"Sarah should pull back . . . Paul Ryan is an imminently reasonable man and Donald Trump and Paul Ryan have no personal history.\"The men do have some policy disagreements, Giuliani admitted, but he said he also doesn't always agree eye-to-eye with other Republicans on policy himself.Further, he said he doesn't agree with Palin that Ryan's career is over, and he thinks Palin isn't interpreting Ryan's intentions correctly.\"I think I know Paul better than Sarah does,\" said Giuliani. \"If he were running, he would have run this time. I think Paul is one of these guys in politics, I wish we had more of them, who's very principled. This is what he believes in.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Giuliani, Third-Party, Candidate, Give, Hillary, White House", "pubdate": "2016-05-09T14:46:19", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Bringing an outside candidate like Mitt Romney into the presidential race would be a huge mistake for Republicans, as it would be the same as handing the election to Hillary Clinton, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Monday.", "title": "Giuliani: Third-Party Bid Would Give Hillary the White House", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Giuliani-Third-Party-Candidate-Give/2016/05/09/id/727927/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=cb39cca7-355e-43fc-91a7-0f9010bff3a0&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Giuliani-Third-Party-Candidate-Give/2016/05/09/id/727927/", "description": "Bringing an outside candidate like Mitt Romney into the presidential race would be a huge mistake for Republicans, as it would be the same as handing the election to Hillary Clinton, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Monday.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Giuliani: Third-Party Bid Would Give Hillary the White House"}, "epoch": 1462805179, "keywords": "Giuliani, Third-Party, Candidate, Give, Hillary, White House", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-05-09T14:46:19"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Giuliani-Third-Party-Candidate-Give/2016/05/09/id/727927/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Bringing an outside candidate like Mitt Romney into the presidential race would be a huge mistake for Republicans, as it would be the same as handing the election to Hillary Clinton, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Monday."}, "article_summary": "Paul Ryan is an imminently reasonable man and Donald Trump and Paul Ryan have no personal history.\nSarah Palin , who vowed over the weekend to help Ryan's primary opponent to win the Wisconsin House seat.\n\"I can't see how you could be a Republican and want Hillary Clinton to be president of the United States.\n\"I think I know Paul better than Sarah does,\" said Giuliani.\nI think Paul is one of these guys in politics, I wish we had more of them, who's very principled."}
