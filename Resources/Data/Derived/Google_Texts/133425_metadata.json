They are \u201castonishingly excellent.\u201d\n\nTrump is not just physically fit. \u201cHis physical strength and stamina are extraordinary.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump to Cruz \u2013 Nobody Likes You\n\nTrump won\u2019t just be healthy if he wins the White House in 2016, concluded Dr. Harold Bornstein. No, it\u2019s better than that. \u201cIf elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the fact that the letter reads as though it was dictated by Trump himself, it\u2019s obviously absurd to attempt to compare Trump\u2019s health to that of long-dead chief executives. And pretty hard to believe that a puffy, red-faced 69-year-old Trump is healthier than the basketball-playing Obama of 2008, much less the fitness fanatic George W. Bush of 2000.\n\nSocial media immediately erupted with ridicule, but there is a serious issue beneath the surface.\n\nRelated: Trump Rises on a Perfect Storm of Public Fear\n\nA clean bill of health for Trump is vital because, should he continue leading the Republican primary polls, the issue of his age will inevitably come to the fore. Most people aren\u2019t aware of it, but if he were elected, Donald Trump would be five months shy of his 71st birthday on the day of his inauguration, making him the oldest first-term president ever elected.\n\nRonald Reagan currently stands as the oldest person to enter the Oval Office for a first term, and he was 69 at the time, just a few weeks away from his 70th birthday. In the modern era, no other president has taken office at age 65 or older, and only four \u2014 Truman, Ford, Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush \u2014 have been over 60.\n\nIf Trump weren\u2019t Trump, you would expect the issue of age to be more of a factor in the GOP primary than in the general election. A number of Republican candidates challenging Trump are in their 40s and 50s. Should Trump win the nomination, his likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, would be only about 16 months younger than him, making any suggestion that age is an issue treacherous for both candidates.\n\nThat risk aside, it can hardly be an accident that Trump\u2019s doctor referred specifically to the candidate\u2019s \u201cstrength and stamina\u201d in the letter. On the campaign trail, Trump has constantly hammered Clinton for not having the strength and stamina necessary to do the job of president.\n\nConsidering how little he has been affected so far by statements and behavior that would have doomed other candidacies, Trump may have the chutzpah to make age an issue in an election where he is the oldest person running.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump may have the chutzpah to make age an issue in an election where he is the oldest person running.", "title": "Why Donald Trump Is Making an Issue of His \u2018Astonishingly Excellent\u2019 Health", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/14/Why-Donald-Trump-Making-Issue-His-Astonishingly-Excellent-Health", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12142015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/14/Why-Donald-Trump-Making-Issue-His-Astonishingly-Excellent-Health", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12142015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Donald Trump may have the chutzpah to make age an issue in an election where he is the oldest person running.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "If Trump weren\u2019t Trump, you would expect the issue of age to be more of a factor in the GOP primary than in the general election.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has constantly hammered Clinton for not having the strength and stamina necessary to do the job of president.\nRelated: Trump Rises on a Perfect Storm of Public FearA clean bill of health for Trump is vital because, should he continue leading the Republican primary polls, the issue of his age will inevitably come to the fore.\nShould Trump win the nomination, his likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, would be only about 16 months younger than him, making any suggestion that age is an issue treacherous for both candidates.\n\u201cHis physical strength and stamina are extraordinary.\u201dRelated: Trump to Cruz \u2013 Nobody Likes YouTrump won\u2019t just be healthy if he wins the White House in 2016, concluded Dr. Harold Bornstein."}
