Three storm enthusiasts from Georgia are hoping for a chance this weekend to fly small unmanned aircraft into a Kansas tornado.

The Salina Journal reports Warren Causey, Nolan Lunsford and Bret Bouthiller started the Sirens Project more than a year ago with the goal of flying unmanned planes into a tornado.

They say the aircraft allows them to remain a safe distance from a tornado and fly the planes into the heart of the storm to collect data.

Bouthiller says the aircraft can be launched from a mile or more away, and the transmitters have a range of at least five miles. Most storm chasers get much closer than that, which he says is ridiculous.

The National Weather Service is predicting possible severe weather in the state this weekend.
