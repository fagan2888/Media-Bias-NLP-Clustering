STOCKHOLM (AP) â€” Meg Rosoff has been named the winner of the 5 million kronor ($615,000) Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award for literature aimed at children and young adults.

A 59-year-old Boston native living in London, Rosoff's novels include "How I Live Now" (2004), "Just in Case" (2006) and "What I Was" (2007). She has won numerous awards and her work has been translated into more than 20 languages.

The Lindgren prize jury on Tuesday said that Rosoff's "novels speak to the emotions as well as the intellect. In sparkling prose, she writes about the search for meaning and identity in a peculiar and bizarre world."

The annual award is named after Swedish writer Astrid Lindgren, creator of the Pippi Longstocking book series. It will be presented at a ceremony on May 30.
