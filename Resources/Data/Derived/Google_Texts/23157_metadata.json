The arrangement, two part-time trauma centers, meant the system could not be recognized by the American College of Surgeons.\n\nReviewers recommended last year that the Nebraska Medical Center should explore the option of operating trauma independently.\n\nOfficials said a nationally-recognized trauma center will better meet the needs of Omaha residents and surrounding communities.\n\n\"Although the trauma system we've used for the last 20 years is functional, we think we have an obligation to provide something more,\" said P.J. Schenarts, MD, trauma medical director at the Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nAlegent Creighton Health, which was notified of the plan Wednesday morning, said it also plans to create a full-time trauma center at its hospital at 30th and California streets.\n\nThat means, should everything go according to plan, there will be two full-time trauma centers in Omaha starting on Aug. 1.\n\nFor the Nebraska Medical Center, a certification process will be performed by the American College of Surgeons in order for the Nebraska Medical Center to achieve official Level 1 trauma center verification status.\n\nFurther details of Alegent Creighton Health's plan have not been released.\n\nMayor Jean Stothert, Fire Chief Bernie Kanger and Police Chief Todd Schmaderer released a joint statement Wednesday.\n\n\"The decision by NMC to have a 24/7 Level 1 Trauma Center is a positive step that will benefit the entire city. Since the current agreement between UNMC and Alegent Creighton will be in effect until August 1, 2014, there will be no changes in how the Omaha Fire Department delivers EMS services at this time.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 12 Mar 2014 22:21:57 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "Nebraska Medical Center on Wednesday said it's ending the practice of sharing trauma service responsibility with Alegent Creighton Health Creighton University Medical Center.", "title": "Two full-time trauma centers planned for Omaha", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/trauma-service-expanding-in-omaha/24936400", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/24949120/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/5i3u8yz/-/img-Two-trauma-centers-planned-for-Omaha.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/trauma-service-expanding-in-omaha/24936400", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/24936400", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/24936400", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/24936400"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/24936400", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/24936400", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "keywords": "local omaha news, breaking nebraska news, live omaha alerts", "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "news_keywords": "local omaha news, breaking nebraska news, live omaha alerts", "description": "Nebraska Medical Center on Wednesday said it's ending the practice of sharing trauma service responsibility with Alegent Creighton Health Creighton University Medical Center."}, "article_summary": "Since 1993, the Nebraska Medical Center has worked with Alegent Creighton Health Creighton University Medical Center in a combined trauma system.\nFor the Nebraska Medical Center, a certification process will be performed by the American College of Surgeons in order for the Nebraska Medical Center to achieve official Level 1 trauma center verification status.\nNebraska Medical Center on Wednesday said it's ending the practice of sharing trauma service responsibility with Alegent Creighton Health Creighton University Medical Center.\nSchenarts, MD, trauma medical director at the Nebraska Medical Center.\nThat means, should everything go according to plan, there will be two full-time trauma centers in Omaha starting on Aug. 1."}
