CUMBERLAND, Maine — Greely Middle School was briefly evacuated Thursday morning because of a bomb threat, according to MSAD 51 Superintendent Jeff Porter.

Porter said the threat was found written on a wall in one of the school’s common areas. Staff and students were relocated to Greely High School for about an hour while Cumberland Center police swept through the building.

Porter said no explosives were discovered, and students and staff went about their business after the building was deemed to be safe.

The superintendent added that the school conducted a drill a couple of weeks ago to prepare for such a situation, and students and staff handled Thursday’s situation perfectly.

Police are investigating the incident.
