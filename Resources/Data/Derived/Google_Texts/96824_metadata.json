Gelabert then took his own life.\n\nSanchez-Monteagudo\u2019s 17-year-old son said he didn\u2019t see his mother get shot in the head, but he watched in horror as his father stood over Sanchez-Monteagudo\u2019s lifeless body and shot her five more times inside the shop at 49th Street and Bergenline Avenue.\n\nThe 36-year-old mother of three had voiced her fears numerous times that the 39-year-old Gelabert would try to kill her, friends and family said. She had a temporary restraining order against Gelabert from May 14 to Oct. 11.\n\nSanchez-Monteagudo\u2019s son, mother and her employer, Truc \u201cJoe\u201d Dinh, told The Jersey Journal that Sanchez-Monteagudo had applied for a permanent restraining order against Gelabert in October, but it was denied.\n\n\u201cThe judge smiled at her while she was crying, after she told him \u2018it\u2019ll be your fault if my kids and I die,\u2019\u201d said Sanchez-Monteagudo\u2019s teen son, who didn\u2019t want to be identified for this story.\n\nMultiple attempts to access court records at the Hudson County Administration Building were re-directed to trial court administrator Gerald A. Buccafusco, who was out of the office yesterday, according to HCC Family Division manager Deidra Carvin.\n\nThe murder-suicide leaves the ex-couple\u2019s three children \u2014 they also have a 9-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl \u2014 without parents.\n\nSanchez-Monteagudo served her husband divorce papers two weeks prior to the incident, according to Tony Castro, the son of the godfather of the couple\u2019s second child.\n\nMonteagudo said she had forbid her daughter from marrying Gelabert before they left Cuba, but that her daughter was \u201cbasically forced\u201d to sign the marriage license.\n\n\u201cI looked into the family and found that they were no good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe family had a really big drinking problem.\u201d\n\nThe 17-year-old, his grandmother and Dinh, the owner of the nail salon, painted Gelabert as violent, out-of-control and obsessive. \u201cHe would beat his mom, get in fights with his siblings,\u201d Sanchez-Monteagudo\u2019s mom said.\n\nSanchez-Monteagudo\u2019s son yesterday showed a three-inch scar on his arm that he got when his dad threw a plate at him and stitched it up himself. The boy also has a scar on his face that was caused by his dad.\n\nIn a video Gelabert recorded on his cell phone, Gelabert is seen brandishing two guns, playing with them and then posing with them as he smiled into the camera.\n\nDinh, the owner of the nail salon, said that law enforcement officials knew Sanchez-Monteagudo was the victim of domestic violence for years, but that \u201cnobody listened.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was begging, but the law didn\u2019t protect her. She screamed with her voice and heart, but nobody listened,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the people in West New York knew, West New York police knew he had a domestic violence record, but nobody did nothing.\u201d\n\nWest New York Police Director Robert Antolos said there was at least one report of domestic violence between Sanchez-Monteagudo and Gelabert, but he could not provide additional information without permission from the Hudson County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which refused to grant that permission.\n\nDinh said that Gelabert would have killed the other four people in the salon if the gun he used had not jammed.\n\nDinh said he screamed at the 17-year-old to lock himself into the bathroom at the far end of the salon. That\u2019s when Gelabert turned his gun on Dinh and the other two customers in the salon. That\u2019s when the gun jammed, Dinh said.\n\nBefore anyone could stop him, Gelabert ran to the back of the salon, where his son had shut himself inside the bathroom.\n\nThe teen was trying to dial 911, but couldn\u2019t because his hands were shaking so violently, he said. Stunned, he even forgot to lock the door, he said yesterday.\n\nWhen Gelabert opened the door a crack, the boy quickly shut it and locked it, he said.\n\nAt that point Dinh screamed at Gelabert, diverting his attention.\n\n\u201cI felt strong, I wanted to fight,\u201d said Dinh, who at 5-foot-2 was dwarfed by the 6-4 Gelabert. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared.\u201d\n\nGelabert fired a bullet into the ceiling, knocked Dinh into a mirror and then pistol-whipped him, said Dinh, who was sporting fresh stitches in the back of his head yesterday.\n\nDazed, Dinh found himself staring down the barrel of Gelabert\u2019s gun. But like before, the gun jammed, Dinh said, and Gelabert fled down Bergenline Avenue.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "west-new-york", "title": "Woman shot dead in WNY nail salon feared for her life: son", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Woman shot dead in WNY nail salon feared for her life: son\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/12/woman_shot_dead_in_wny_nail_sa.html\", \"image_url\": \"\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11863860\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-21T08:00:57Z\", \"author\": \"Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"west-new-york\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "description": "The woman who was shot by her estranged husband at a West New York nail salon had been abused by him for nearly two decades, her mother, 17-year-old son and long-time employer said yesterday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, December 21, 2013,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"\", \"author_name\": \"jclin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11098115\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The woman who was shot by her estranged husband at a West New York nail salon had been abused by him for nearly two decades, her mother, 17-year-old son and long-time employer said yesterday.", "title": "Woman shot dead in WNY nail salon feared for her life: son", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/12/woman_shot_dead_in_wny_nail_sa.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, December 21, 2013,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "The woman who was shot by her estranged husband at a West New York nail salon had been abused by him for nearly two decades, her mother, 17-year-old son and long-time employer said yesterday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b66\"", "article_summary": "The woman who was shot by her estranged husband at a West New York nail salon had been abused by him for nearly two decades, her mother, 17-year-old son and long-time employer said yesterday.\nSanchez-Monteagudo, who had been living with her children in Teaneck since June, was shot dead by her husband, Jose Leonel Martinez Gelabert, Wednesday afternoon at the nail salon where she worked.\nBefore anyone could stop him, Gelabert ran to the back of the salon, where his son had shut himself inside the bathroom.\nDinh said that Gelabert would have killed the other four people in the salon if the gun he used had not jammed.\nThat\u2019s when Gelabert turned his gun on Dinh and the other two customers in the salon."}
