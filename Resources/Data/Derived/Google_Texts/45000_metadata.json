(Photo: The Courier-Journal )Buy Photo\n\nJim Segrest, a lifelong Louisville resident, community preservationist, amateur historian and a man whose name became synonymous with the Butchertown neighborhood, died Saturday at his Frankfort Avenue home. He was 73.\n\nSegrest grew up on a 500-acre farm in Valley Station and lived in his grandmother\u2019s home in Old Louisville before moving to Butchertown in 1968. He was president of the Butchertown Neighborhood Association in the 1980s and then again from 2001 to 2008. Over the years Segrest bought and renovated 18 Butchertown homes and fought to preserve the rest of the neighborhood.\n\nSegrest was an integral part of making Butchertown what it is today, current neighborhood association president Andy Cornelius said.\n\n\u201cJim was a man who deeply cared about preservation and the historical significance of not only Butchertown, but Louisville in general,\u201d he said.\n\nSegrest was mentally strong but had been struggling physically following a stroke he suffered last year, Cornelius said.\n\nSegrest lived in a large brick home built around 1796, the oldest in Butchertown, called Linden Hill. He had owned the home for 22 years and helped establish it as a local landmark \u2014 the commonwealth installed a state highway historical marker in 2011 to recognize the home\u2019s roots in \u201cEarly Butchertown\u201d and former Linden Hill owner Col. Frederick Geiger, a veteran of the Revolutionary War.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for Segrest supporting him and plugging his family into the community, Cornelius said he and his wife would have never stayed in the neighborhood as long as they did. \u201cHe was just an amazing mentor and connector in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a wonderful man.\u201d\n\nFellow Butchertown resident and longtime friend Keith Kemble, said the same. He and his wife found their home when they came to an art fair in the neighborhood, one that probably wouldn\u2019t have taken place if not for Segrest.\n\n\u201cHe spearheaded the renaissance of the neighborhood,\u201d Kemble said. \u201cI\u2019d say he was pretty much responsible for breathing new life into one of Louisville\u2019s most historic neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nKemble has lived in Butchertown for 36 years and he\u2019s been friends with Segrest for 35. Without him, Butchertown would be a much different, less livable place today, Kemble said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thankful for Jim and all the good things he did for our neighborhood,\u201d he said.\n\nA visitation for Segrest will be held Wednesday at Calvary Episcopal Church, 821 S. Fourth St., from 4 to 5:45 p.m. His funeral service will be at 6 p.m. at the church.\n\nReporter Mark Boxley can be reached at (502) 582-4241 or on Twitter at @Boxleyland.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1gAxVEg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Jim Segrest, a tireless Butchertown preservationist, died Saturday at his home.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Jim Segrest, a tireless Butchertown preservationist, died Saturday at his home.", "title": "Louisville\u2019s Butchertown mainstay Jim Segrest dies", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/04/06/louisvilles-butchertown-mainstay-jim-segrest-dies/7388325/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jim Segrest, a tireless Butchertown preservationist, died Saturday at his home.", "title": "Louisville\u2019s Butchertown mainstay Jim Segrest dies", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/40d7ec1f8257cffec333bb1fe716a58e0aae191a/c=0-218-1000-1218&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/06/titlejimsegrest.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Cornelius", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Cornelius", "title": "Louisville\u2019s Butchertown mainstay Jim Segrest dies", "author": "Mark Boxley", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d572d2532b4f8ee5cfb3a98dd00da819e443bd3/c=0-51-1000-1384/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/06/titlejimsegrest.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e2e7c8d11edf4a97f870278a5ab7bef921c7be5/c=0-218-1000-1218/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/06/titlejimsegrest.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/676e9de5a6d763f3a222ddd57e93a6ef0ff9386f/c=0-342-1000-1092/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/06/titlejimsegrest.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/20cf31ab41828e0c481af98062809595ae6cdaad/c=0-436-1000-998&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/06/titlejimsegrest.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-06T16:34:47-04:00", "shorthed": "Butchertown mainstay Segrest dies", "articleid": 7388325, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/63a55e25eed4f396b064aee2338b5959abf80a5b/c=0-436-1000-998/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/06/titlejimsegrest.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/869f5789f3e7cfdcf1e7029f904497313308ede7/c=96-0-903-1435/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/06/titlejimsegrest.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb708\"", "article_summary": "He was president of the Butchertown Neighborhood Association in the 1980s and then again from 2001 to 2008.\nBuy Photo Jim Segrest in front of the porch of Linden Hill, his home at 1607 Frankfort Ave. 2001 file photo.\nSegrest lived in a large brick home built around 1796, the oldest in Butchertown, called Linden Hill.\nSegrest was an integral part of making Butchertown what it is today, current neighborhood association president Andy Cornelius said.\nOver the years Segrest bought and renovated 18 Butchertown homes and fought to preserve the rest of the neighborhood."}
