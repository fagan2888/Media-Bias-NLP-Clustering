The former pediatric neurosurgeon, already enduring widespread ridicule for his theory that ancient Egyptian pyramids were grain silos built by the biblical patriarch Joseph \u2013 contrary to all historical evidence \u2013 was slammed Thursday and Friday by suggestions that he had fabricated key elements of his life story.\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that in interviews with multiple people who knew Carson in his childhood, none was able to confirm the violent temper that he claims to have overcome in his youth, or the specific story he has told about once attempting to stab someone.\n\nRelated: Trump Can\u2019t Keep his Multibillion Dollar Pentagon Programs Straight\n\nOn Friday, Politico got the Carson campaign to admit that the candidate\u2019s claim to have been offered a full \u201cscholarship\u201d to the United States Military Academy at West Point was not correct.\n\nFor the Carson campaign, it has been a rough couple of days, and according to Scott Sobel, president of the crisis consulting firm Media and Communications Strategies, he\u2019s not doing a particularly good job of handling it.\n\nSobel said he happened to have a television on with the volume down when Carson appeared Thursday night, and even with no sound, he could tell that the candidate was struggling. \u201cWatching his body language last night, it appeared that he was pulling stories out of the air,\u201d said Sobel. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t looking the people interviewing him in the eye.\u201d\n\nRelated: Who Will Hillary Clinton Choose as Her Running Mate?\n\nCarson is in a particularly tricky spot, Sobel said, because his stock in trade is the impression he has tried to cultivate as a no-nonsense truth-teller who doesn\u2019t get rattled. But in an interview with CNN last night about the network\u2019s inability to verify some of his descriptions of his childhood, Carson came across as angry and defensive.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going to overcome these contradictions about his past he has to show consistency in his demeanor,\u201d Sobel said.\n\nSobel compared Carson to a boxer who has just taken a blow to the head. The right strategy is to protect yourself \u2013 to go into the clinch and prevent your opponent from landing any more punches until you can clear the cobwebs out.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re constantly being hit, you\u2019re not going to recover from that. I would take a deep breath and get out of the limelight for a day or two certainly, otherwise there is blood in the water,\u201d Sobel said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re going to make mistakes in how you respond and you don\u2019t have time to develop a thoughtful strategy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ryan Gets up to Speed with a Highway Bill Victory\n\nHowever, according to Eric Dezenhall, author of Glass Jaw: A Manifesto for Defending Fragile Reputations in an Age of Instant Scandal, Carson\u2019s strategy has at least an outside chance of working. \u201cThis is a strange election season in that the old rules of thumb go right out the window when the electorate\u2019s primarily goal is to express anger, not elect a president,\u201d Dezenhall said via email.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to survive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 fabrication because the subtext is the fabricator saying to the public, \u2018I think you\u2019re dumb enough to believe this nonsense and the electorate hates to have their intelligence insulted.\n\n\u201cA lot of why we support certain candidates is due to what\u2019s called \u2018narratives of ascent,\u2019 their personal stories. That\u2019s the case with Carson. No one seriously believes that brain surgery qualifies someone for the presidency, but voters like his story, which is why this has the potential to be so damaging. If your narrative of ascent is bogus, what else have you got?\u201d\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton May Be the Biggest Winner from the Blowout October Jobs Report\n\nThere are two things going for Carson though, Dezenhall argued.\n\nFirst, he said, at least with regard to the West Point story, \u201cThe misrepresentation isn\u2019t exactly a whopper. It\u2019s not like he said he was a Navy SEAL and he just wasn\u2019t. What he appears to have done is inflate the technical nature of the offer he was allegedly given by West Point. People can quibble about the details, which may serve him well.\u201d\n\nSecond, Dezenhall said, \u201cCarson\u2019s supporters may see current news reports as an effort by a biased media to dredge up something that falls short of being a kill shot to knock off a candidate they don\u2019t like. There\u2019s something to be said for Carson smashing back on this basis and seeing what happens. If we\u2019ve learned anything this political season, it\u2019s that the brazen counterattack seems to be working better than the groveling denial.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Has the respected brain surgeon irretrievably damaged his \u201cnarrative of ascent\u201d by embellishing stories about his background?", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Ben Carson Can Survive His Current Crisis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/06/Here-s-Why-Ben-Carson-Can-Survive-His-Current-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/06/Here-s-Why-Ben-Carson-Can-Survive-His-Current-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Has the respected brain surgeon irretrievably damaged his \u201cnarrative of ascent\u201d by embellishing stories about his background?", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "What he appears to have done is inflate the technical nature of the offer he was allegedly given by West Point.\nFirst, he said, at least with regard to the West Point story, \u201cThe misrepresentation isn\u2019t exactly a whopper.\nFor the Carson campaign, it has been a rough couple of days, and according to Scott Sobel, president of the crisis consulting firm Media and Communications Strategies, he\u2019s not doing a particularly good job of handling it.\nSobel compared Carson to a boxer who has just taken a blow to the head.\nIt took less than 24 hours after Ben Carson took over the polling lead in the Republican presidential nomination race for the wheels to start coming off his campaign."}
