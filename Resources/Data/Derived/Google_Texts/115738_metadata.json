Rivlin, a former vice chair of the fed who is now at the Brookings Institution, has battled her share of budgetary shenanigans over the years \u2013 she served as director of the Office of Management under Bill Clinton, and was the founding director of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\u201cUsing the Fed\u2019s capital as a pay-for is a new low in budgetary gimmickry,\u201d she said in an interview Tuesday. There were other signs of mounting tension between Congress and the Fed -- now being led by Bernanke\u2019s successor, Janet Yellen.\n\nRelated: How the New Ways and Means Chief Will Dole Out Your Tax Dollars\n\nWithin a day of assuming the reins of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee last week, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) told Roll Call he intends to press ahead with his proposal to create a bipartisan commission to study the Fed\u2019s monetary policy and make recommendations for fundamental change.\n\nBrady, a former chair of the Joint Economic Committee and harsh critic of the Fed\u2019s soft-money policies, has long sought creation of a Centennial Monetary Commission that would evaluate \u201calternative monetary regimes\u201d and \u201crecommend a course for monetary policy going forward.\u201d\n\nBrady said he would also try to pass another proposal that would dramatically shrink the Fed\u2019s legislated responsibility. Currently, the Fed is obligated to pursue a dual mandate aimed at both controlling inflation and moving the economy towards full employment. The conservative free-market Texas Republican is advocating a change that would give the central bank the single mandate to contain inflation.\n\n\u201cAt best, the Federal Reserve may temporarily increase the level of employment through monetary policy, but such efforts risk the possibility of price inflation and increased business cycle volatility in the future,\u201d Brady and other co-sponsors said in introducing the \u201cSound Dollar Act of 2015\u201d earlier this year.\n\nRelated: Why Main Street\u2019s Big Job Gains Could Really Rattle Wall Street\n\nLast week, House Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling, another Texas Republican, lectured Yellen during a hearing on the Fed\u2019s supervision and regulation of the financial system. Hensarling complained that the Fed had been granted \u201cvast, new sweeping regulatory powers\u201d by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation overhaul despite its contribution to the last financial crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Fed must not be allowed to shield its vast regulatory activities from the American people and congressional oversight by improperly cloaking them behind its traditional monetary policy independence,\u201d Hensarling said.\n\nFor sure, it\u2019s not just the Republicans clashing with the Fed. Last September, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA.) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) called for Congress to investigate the New York Federal Reserve Bank following the release of secret recordings showing how the central bank allegedly was going easy on firms it was responsible for regulating. Then in February, Warren complained to Yellen during a hearing that the Fed\u2019s general counsel, Scott Alvarez, had gone too far afield of Fed policy by publicly advocating for major changes to the Dodd-Frank law.\n\nFor decades, the Fed has been a frequent target for Republican and Democratic lawmakers, especially in times of economic turmoil and crisis. Bernanke helped the Obama administration steer the economy away from a cliff at the height of the financial crisis, but subsequently came under attack on Capitol Hill for exercising too much power and autonomy.\n\nRelated: Global Trade Is Falling to Recession Levels\n\nIndeed, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) \u2013 a fiery libertarian and father of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, proposed abolishing the Fed altogether. He persuaded nearly two-thirds of the House to co-sponsor a measure requiring detailed congressional audits of the Fed that he claimed would prove that \u201cit\u2019s the Fed that has caused all the mischief\u201d in the economy, The New York Times reported in 2009. Rand Paul subsequently picked up his father\u2019s idea for a tough Fed audit.\n\nWhile those low-interest, \u201ceasy-money\u201d policies initiated by Bernanke and carried on by Yellen have generally drawn strong support from populists and liberal Democrats, Republicans like Brady have complained that the Fed has mistakenly focused too much attention on job creation and not enough on the potential for a return to an inflationary economy.\n\nRivlin, the former Fed vice chair, said that in some ways it\u2019s difficult to know just how much to worry about Congressional threats to the Fed\u2019s independence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how seriously to take this,\u201d she said, pointing out that both parties have a long history of railing at the Fed when it suits them politically.\n\n\u201cSome of these problems with the Fed seem to me to arise from the perception that they\u2019ve kept interest rates too low for too long, which is sort of the opposite of the populist hostility you used to find to high interest rates.\n\nRelated: The 10 Cheapest and Costliest Cities for Homes\n\n\u201cTraditionally there has been an element of the Democratic party that thought the Fed was in cahoots with bankers for keeping interest rates too high. Now we have this interesting switch.\u201d\n\nThe last time she was called to testify on Capitol Hill, she said, she faced Republican criticism that the Fed was \u201cbeing very mysterious and not transparent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all \u2013 I think that\u2019s code for \u2018We think interest rates are too low.\u2019 And that translates into \u2018The Fed is emphasizing employment too much and not worrying about inflation.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d she added, \u201cthere is no inflation.\u201d\n\nRivlin said that she expects the sound and fury on Capitol Hill will result in little significant change in how the central bank operates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant to be under attack but I don\u2019t think it affects the deliberations on monetary policy,\u201d she said, \u201cThough, if it were to result in some kind of real interference with the independence of the Fed in making monetary policy it would be quite serious.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve always believed it\u2019s mostly bluster. Congress doesn\u2019t want to make monetary policy. It\u2019s too hard. It\u2019s also controversial and they would be drawing all that controversy to themselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Federal Reserve has long prided itself on its independence from Congress and the White House in setting monetary policy, so it must have come as a shock when Republican-controlled House voted at the last minute last week to dip into the Fed\u2019s reserve capital surplus account for $16.3 billion to help fund a $325 billion multi-year highway and transportation bill.", "title": "Looks Like Congress Can\u2019t Stand the Idea of an Independent Federal Reserve", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/Looks-Congress-Can-t-Stand-Idea-Independent-Federal-Reserve", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-imf-yellen_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/Looks-Congress-Can-t-Stand-Idea-Independent-Federal-Reserve", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-imf-yellen_2.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Federal Reserve has long prided itself on its independence from Congress and the White House in setting monetary policy, so it must have come as a shock when Republican-controlled House voted at the last minute last week to dip into the Fed\u2019s reserve capital surplus account for $16.3 billion to help fund a $325 billion multi-year highway and transportation bill.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Congress doesn\u2019t want to make monetary policy.\nThere were other signs of mounting tension between Congress and the Fed -- now being led by Bernanke\u2019s successor, Janet Yellen.\nand Sherrod Brown (D-OH) called for Congress to investigate the New York Federal Reserve Bank following the release of secret recordings showing how the central bank allegedly was going easy on firms it was responsible for regulating.\n\u201cUsing the Fed\u2019s capital as a pay-for is a new low in budgetary gimmickry,\u201d she said in an interview Tuesday.\nThe conservative free-market Texas Republican is advocating a change that would give the central bank the single mandate to contain inflation."}
