With high-income earners facing higher tax rates this year, there may be even more incentive to maximize donations in order minimize the payment to Uncle Sam.\n\nThe affluent aren\u2019t the only Americans who give their earnings back to the community. In fact, middle-class Americans give a higher percentage of their income to charities than the rich, according to a study last year by the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Households that earn $50,000-$75,000 give an average of 7.6 percent of their discretionary income to charitable causes, while households making more than $100,000 gave just 4.2 percent.\n\nDonors need to make sure that they\u2019re maximizing their charitable deductions, and ensure that a charity makes the best possible use of their money. Here\u2019s how to stretch your donor dollars as much as possible:\n\nDo good for yourself (and your taxes)\n\nIn general, you need to itemize your deductions in order to deduct giving on your taxes. One exception: The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended through 2013 the ability for someone aged 70 1/2 years or older to transfer up to $100,000 from an IRA to a charity tax free, says James Osborne, president of Bason Asset Managmenet in Lakewood, Colo.\n\nAny donation worth more than $250 requires a letter from the organization that includes a description of the item or the amount of cash and whether you received anything in return for the donation. (If you did receive a gift or service, you\u2019ll need to subtract its value from the amount you contributed.)\n\nRELATED: TAX TIPS: 3 CHARITABLE DEDUCTION TRAPS TO AVOID\n\nNon-cash donations are receiving higher scrutiny these days. \"People over-value the junk they leave at the Salvation Army,\" saysCPA Robert Seltzer of Los Angeles. You can claim only the reasonable market value you might realize by selling something used; that\u2019s generally a fraction of what you paid for it.\n\nA good rule of thumb for valuing goods is 20 percent of its original value, but that number can vary. Antiques or up-to-date tech equipment will likely retain more of its value. Many charities have programs where you donate an old vehicle. But unless the charity retains the vehicle for a substantial time frame and uses the car, your write-off is limited to the amount the charity gets for selling the car. Any non-cash donation of more than $5,000 requires an independent appraisal in order to be claimed on your tax return.\n\nAnother way to save on your taxes is by donating stocks that have gained significant value, , says CPA Steven Hirsch or Mineola, N.Y.-based Cohen Greve & Company. If you\u2019ve held the stock for at least a year, not only will you get a nice tax deduction, you also avoid paying the capital gains taxes you would have paid if you sold the stock at a profit. (If you give a stock that has depreciated to a charity, you\u2019re not allowed to take the capital loss.)\n\nIf you own a business, instead of giving gifts to clients and vendors, consider making charitable donations in their names. Gifts are limited to $25 per person per gift, but the entire qualified contribution to an IRS-registered 501(c)(3) charity would be deductible.\n\nChecking the charity\n\nAside from the tax benefits, you\u2019ll want your money to go to a good cause and be well used. First step is to find a good potential match.\n\nRELATED: HOW TO MAXIMIZE TAX BREAKS ON CHARITABLE GIVING\n\n\"What are you passionate about?\" says non-profit consultant Dani Robbins. It's not enough to say \"kids,\" she says. Do you want to support kids with disabilities, at-risk kids, or scholarships for high school students going into a particular field? Be specific.\n\nSeltzer suggests concentrating your money; since all charities have a cost to acquire and process a donation, the more organizations you split a fixed amount among, the more money eaten up in administration and processing.\n\nIn the same spirit, donate directly to a charity's site or send a contribution rather than giving the money to a fundraiser. For-profit fundraising firms hired by nonprofits often keep the majority of donations for themselves.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got a good candidate, make sure the organization\u2019s tax-exempt status is up-to-date by searching the IRS\u2019 database of exempt organization. Next, you\u2019ll want to get a sense of how much of your donations actually goes to the cause you\u2019re trying to support, versus the charity\u2019s costs for fundraising and overhead.\n\nFinally, look up the organization on GuideStar.org to evaluate its reputation and effectiveness, and use CharityNavigator.org to find ratings on financial effectiveness and strength as well as charity to donors. A search on the Better Business Bureau will also give you a sense of whether there have been any donor complaints against the organization.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donors need to make sure that they\u2019re maximizing their charitable deductions, and ensure that a charity makes the best possible use of their money.
