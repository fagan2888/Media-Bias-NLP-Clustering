Bush.\n\n\"Republican governors, mayors and members of Congress support Ex-Im, and whatever the rhetoric of presidential contenders, so do actual presidents,\" Fratto said.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign, then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) said on the campaign trail that Ex-Im was \u201clittle more than a fund for corporate welfare.\" But as president, he has urged lawmakers to reauthorize its charter.\n\n\u201cThis is a program in which we help to provide financing to sell American goods and products around the world. Every country does this,\u201d Obama said at a press conference in August 2014. \u201cWe will lose business and we will lose jobs if we don't pass it.\u201d\n\nDan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action, a Tea Party group critical of Ex-Im, said that the recent remarks from top-tier potential Republican 2016 candidates shows the growing opposition to the bank.\n\n\u201cThe question for congressional Republicans is whether they\u2019re willing to undercut a growing consensus among potential 2016 candidates that the Export-Import Bank isn\u2019t worth saving,\" Holler told The Hill.\n\n\"It will be difficult for the eventual Republican nominee to campaign against corporate welfare if party leaders in Congress are doing the bidding of K Street,\" Holler said.\n\nMost lawmakers in Congress support its reauthorization, arguing that it helps U.S. businesses make inroads into emerging markets where the private sector won't finance projects.\n\nSupporters of the bank have ripped the Ex-Im critics for supporting an \"isolationist\" economic agenda that they say is out of touch with how global economics works.\n\nRep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), a prominent supporter of Ex-Im on the House Financial Services Committee, criticized Walker in a tweet. \"So now, @GovWalker wants to eliminate @EximBankUS? The more @ScottWalker talks, the more he exposes his complete lack of fiscal competence,\" she tweeted Saturday\n\nThere are several bills that have already been introduced or will be introduced in Congress to reauthorize the Bank.\n\nAnd while a reauthorization bill would likely pass the Senate, it's unknown whether such a bill would pass the House.\n\nHouse Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has adamantly made the case against the Bank's reauthorization, saying it puts taxpayers at risk and only helps big businesses like Boeing.\n\nHensarling, whose panel has jurisdiction over a reauthorization bill, hasn't said whether he will move a bill through his panel.\n\nA senior House staffer to a Republican member said that \"the more people learn about Ex-Im, the more they recognize it for what it is: the same old Washington way of rigging the system to favor the politically connected.\" \"Subsidies and favoritism are not the keys to economic growth,\" the staffer said. \"Any Republican who hopes to win in 2016 must support a positive, pro-growth agenda \u2014 not continued corporate welfare like Ex-Im.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz have all targeted the Export-Import Bank.", "description": "Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz have all targeted the Export-Import Bank.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz have all targeted the Export-Import Bank.", "title": "GOP contenders line up to blast Ex-Im", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/234225-potential-2016-gop-candidates-take-turns-hammering-ex-im", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/exportimportbank_022215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-28T19:18:31-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-28T19:18-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/234225-potential-2016-gop-candidates-take-turns-hammering-ex-im", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-28T16:39-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "author": "Kevin Cirilli", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T16:39:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T19:18:31-05:00"}, "keywords": "Export-Import Bank, 2016,Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/234225-potential-2016-gop-candidates-take-turns-hammering-ex-im", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz have all targeted the Export-Import Bank.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP contenders line up to blast Ex-Im"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP contenders line up to blast Ex-Im"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd109a\"", "article_summary": "\"Republican governors, mayors and members of Congress support Ex-Im, and whatever the rhetoric of presidential contenders, so do actual presidents,\" Fratto said.\n\"Any Republican who hopes to win in 2016 must support a positive, pro-growth agenda \u2014 not continued corporate welfare like Ex-Im.\"\nRep.
