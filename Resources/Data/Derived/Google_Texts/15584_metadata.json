The statue is stationed in front of Jacksonville Landing, a prominent tourist complex in downtown Jacksonville.\n\nRepresentatives from Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office were unavailable for comment at the time of publication.\n\nThe head was placed sometime Monday evening and crews used a crane to remove it before 7:30 a.m., according to Russell Colburn of WJAX-TV.\n\nRecently, renewed efforts to replace Jackson\u2019s image from the $20 bill have gained media attention. Support for Harriet Tubman has been popular, and Wilma Mankiller particularly popular with Native Americans.\n\nThe city of Jacksonville was named after President Jackson in 1832.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A fake Indian head was found early Tuesday on a statue of Andrew Jackson in Jacksonville, Florida.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "smoya-smith", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/03/someone-put-fake-native-american-head-lap-andrew-jackson-160954", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/news4jax_3.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Someone Put a Fake Native American Head on the Lap of Andrew Jackson"}, "abstract": "A fake Indian head was found early Tuesday on a statue of Andrew Jackson in Jacksonville, Florida.", "dc": {"title": "Someone Put a Fake Native American Head on the Lap of Andrew Jackson"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/03/someone-put-fake-native-american-head-lap-andrew-jackson-160954", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Andrew Jackson, Trail of Tears, Jacksonville, Florida, Trail of Tears, Sheena Louise Roetman", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 3}, "dcterms.date": "2015-07-03T18:55-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Someone Put a Fake Native American Head on the Lap of Andrew Jackson"}, "article_summary": "A fake Native American head was found early Tuesday in the lap of a statue of Andrew Jackson in Jacksonville, Florida.\nSupport for Harriet Tubman has been popular, and Wilma Mankiller particularly popular with Native Americans.\nThe head was placed sometime Monday evening and crews used a crane to remove it before 7:30 a.m., according to Russell Colburn of WJAX-TV.\nThe city of Jacksonville was named after President Jackson in 1832.\nIt\u2019s also unclear how exactly the head was placed on the statue since shrubbery and a chain link fence surround the statue, according to CBS 47 WJAX-TV, and Jackson\u2019s lap is approximately 15 to 20 feet high."}
