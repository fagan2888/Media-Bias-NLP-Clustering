(Photo: Tom Spader/Staff Photographer)Buy Photo\n\nFREEHOLD TOWNSHIP \u2013 If you take the time to read it, you can see the future of health care unfold in a 242-page binder that is sitting on the conference table in John T. Gribbin\u2019s office at CentraState Medical Center.\n\nIt spells out the rules of a new Medicare program that penalizes hospitals for not providing high-quality care for patients who get elective knee and hip replacement surgery. It is supposed to go into effect in January. And putting it into practice is a nightmare.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s a good direction for all of us, but it\u2019s enormously complicated to do,\u201d said Gribbin, CentraState\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nCentraState Healthcare System includes the Shore\u2019s last remaining independent hospital, and Gribbin wants to keep it that way.\n\nSince joining the hospital in 2000, Gribbin has shifted its course, making up for a decline in revenue from acute care that\u2019s provided in the hospital with new revenue from outpatient services, senior living facilities and health and wellness programs.\n\nThe medical center\u2019s annual revenue rose from $270.1 million in 2012 to $281.9 million in 2013, according to Moody\u2019s, which gives it a bond rating of Baa1 \u2013 moderately risky \u2013 and a stable outlook in its most recent report.\n\nBuy Photo John Gribbon, CEO of CentraState Medical Center, said he has no plans to merge the Freehold Township hospital with larger rivals. (Photo: Tom Spader/Staff Photographer)\n\nNot like its neighbors\n\nIt has bucked the trend. With the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, rewriting the rules of the industry, CentraState\u2019s competitors Meridian Health and Barnabas Health both have announced recent mergers that would create giant health care networks that own every hospital in Monmouth and Ocean counties except CentraState.\n\nDriving the consolidation are looming changes like the upcoming Medicare program. Rather than pay fees for individual services, insurers are beginning to pay a set amount for the entire care. Hospitals will need to deliver the service efficiently. And they will need more consumers, said Mark Claster, president of Carl Marks & Co., a New York investment firm.\n\nIt will be a challenge for CentraState. \u201cIf the cost of care exceeds what you\u2019re being paid, the hospital bears the cost,\u201d Claster said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to gain population so when there are those outliers that run amok on cost it gets spread over a much wider base.\u201d\n\nGribbin, 63, lives in Millstone with his wife, Debi.\n\nHe sat down with the Asbury Park Press recently and explained what\u2019s next for CentraState, what it will take to slow down health care costs (hint: not technology), and how the new Medicare program is a sign that the industry has just begun a generational change. The interview was edited for space.\n\nYour competitors have announced plans to merge. Is CentraState next?\n\nThat\u2019s what everybody wonders. No, we have no plans to merge. I think it\u2019s important for people to understand that our leadership here understands very well that independence does not mean isolated. They\u2019re very different concepts. The form that we pursue and look for are effective partnerships and services the community needs. These can be provided through a variety of methods. Merger is only one of these methods. What you\u2019re trying to do, and the way we approach it is, the issue is not the organization\u2019s structure. The issue is the scale and relevancy. In other words, how do you create the scale you need that provides the resources you need to grow?\n\nBy merging?\n\nThe research literature shows in markets where there\u2019s high concentration, prices go up. That\u2019s what happens. It\u2019s not always the answer. It works for some places. Some places need to have a big brother or to have someone to take them under their wing. This is not a condemnation of merger activity, but it\u2019s not right for everybody in every situation.\n\nAt CentraState Medical Center in Freehold Township, nurses Regina Kemper (left) and Polly Hay route patients to one of three adult treatment areas or a pediatric emergency department in this file photo. (Photo: PHOTO COURTESY OF CENTRASTATE MEDICAL CENTER)\n\nHow do you control costs if merging isn\u2019t the answer?\n\nYou control costs by doing good care management, having strong analytics so you understand what you\u2019re managing, and you have strong relationships with your medical community and getting them on board. There\u2019s clearly money that could be pulled out of the health care system. There\u2019s no debate about it. New Jersey is particularly onerous. ... You\u2019ve heard the term \u2018bending the cost curve?\u2019 There are five ways to bend the cost curve. Four of them come out of the hospital. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nReduce admissions, reduce readmissions, reduce duplicate testing, reduce emergency room use. The fifth one is pharmaceutical use, and half of that comes out of the hospitals, too.\n\nIs it weird being an executive trying to make less money?\n\nWe have to figure out a way to make this transition and make it such that this resource for the community remains on the other end. It\u2019s going to happen. There\u2019s no question, it\u2019s very schizophrenic now. I can\u2019t think of an industry that works harder to make less money. And that\u2019s the schizophrenia that\u2019s occurred in American medicine.\n\nDespite the mergers, health care employment in New Jersey is as high as ever.\n\nI\u2019ll give you a scenario. Here\u2019s another way we differ. In other industries, technology is a substitution for labor. Right? In health care, technology creates demand for labor. When I first got into business, take radiology. It\u2019s a good example. We had an X-ray technician. One job. And that person did basically everything in the department. Today, there are no less than five separate, not transferable, skills in radiology.\n\nNurse Kathleen Dempsey readies one of CentraState\u2019s pediatric emergency department rooms for a young patient in this file photo. (Photo: PHOTO COURTESY OF CENTRASTATE MEDICAL CENTER)\n\nShouldn\u2019t it make workers more efficient?\n\nThat is a great debate in health care, and candidly, it\u2019s questionable. I will tell you this: I don\u2019t think any hospital would survive without it now. In that sense, yes. But IT (information technology) in medicine creates demands that we\u2019ve never dealt with in the past. Now you can say that wasn\u2019t very good in the past; we should have been documenting things that we weren\u2019t. That\u2019s an argument. And today the computer forces you to document. But that\u2019s also time that we didn\u2019t spend in the past. Now we have to spend it. ... So you add all these things together, I don\u2019t see health care employment going down.\n\nWhat if the cost of care was more transparent?\n\nI can give you a list of charges. You just don\u2019t know which will apply to you until your physician finishes. And that\u2019s a dilemma for all of us. I think that\u2019s not going to be solved until we figure out ways to do things like bundled care for some of that. (Providers would receive one payment for the entire treatment \u2013 from the surgery to the rehabilitation \u2013 instead of a payment for each service). That binder right there is the regulations published by Medicare to force hospitals into a bundled product for total joint replacements, hips and knees.\n\nWill that start to slow costs down?\n\nYes, I think it will. I think it will. But it\u2019s a very, very difficult transition. It\u2019s just not easy to do. Just the logistics of it. just measuring and doing it are very, very difficult. And it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a methodology out there that you can plug and play. You\u2019ve got to build some of these systems, build relationships. You\u2019re dealing with multiple parties. ... But I think it\u2019s a good direction for us to move in. I\u2019m not against that whatsoever. It\u2019s a good direction because I think it will enhance transparency. And I think it will take some cost out of the system. And I think it has the potential to improve care.\n\nHow long will this transition take?\n\nI think the process we\u2019re in is generational, in all candor. I really do.\n\nMichael L.
