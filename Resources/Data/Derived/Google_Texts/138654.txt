The 25-year-old son of Michael Jordan is hoping to leverage the power of his father's legendary brand to create his own lasting legacy.

Marcus Jordan, heir to the six-time NBA champion's throne, plans to open a retail boutique called the Trophy Room in the spring of 2016, at a location yet to be determined.

"I have been around Jordan brand apparel my entire life," Jordan told CNBC in an interview. "The way the culture is shifting is a great opportunity," he said. Jordan referred to the tremendous growth of the Jordan brand since his father's retirement more than a decade ago. The brand pulled in nearly $3 billion in U.S. sales in 2014, and helped make Jordan senior an estimated $100 million last year.

Jordan's second son, Marcus, graduated with a degree in hospitality management from the University of Central Florida, where he says he learned many of the skills to open his own boutique. A few years ago, he and his brother Jeffrey launched a website venture called Heir-Jordan.com, which never took flight.

When it comes to his inspiration, he says it came from his own family's trophy room in his childhood home in Chicago.
