If you’re tired of the brain-numbing, never-ending, get-nowhere political debates you witness every day on cable news, then permit us to submit a solution: A new show called No, You Shut Up, airing on Fusion and hosted by Paul F. Tompkins, wherein the comedian tackles our country’s most pressing issues by debating with puppets. That’s right. With the help of Jim Henson Company characters like Senator Galapagos the Tortoise, Yerd Nerp the Alien, Hot Dog the Talking Hot Dog – among others – Tompkins helps Americans live a more thoughtful existence.

In fact, you should check out the below video, wherein Tompkins and his trusted panel debate the problems with Obamacare and the Healthcare.gov website. And be sure to tune in to No, You Shut Up nightly on Fusion at 9:30 pm ET. Go here to see if you get Fusion in your area.
