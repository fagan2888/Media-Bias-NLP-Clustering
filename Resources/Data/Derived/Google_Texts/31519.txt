After a notoriously bad start, the Obama administration is looking for a strong finish to Obamacare open enrollment on Monday. The federal HealthCare.gov marketplace now works well for the 36 states it serves. But problems persist in about half of the states that built their own exchanges.

"As you start to look across the 14 states ... certainly you have some states that get an 'F' grade, some that are in the 'D' category," said Rick Howard, a research director at Gartner who specializes in government IT.

Among those states that did not make the grade: Hawaii, Massachusetts and Vermont. They were three of four states that chose CGI to build their exchangesâ€”the same contractor blamed for problems with HealthCare.gov. All three experienced many of the same problems as the federal exchange, including missed deadlines and faulty software that resulted in poorly functioning websites.

Massachusetts' Health Connector officials fired CGI last week, after delaying payments on its $69 million contract with the firm. Vermont's Health Connect has also withheld payments. In Hawaii, officials are calling for an investigation into the $200 million in federal grants spent in developing the exchange and enrollment programs.

CGI has said it "worked tirelessly to deliver."
