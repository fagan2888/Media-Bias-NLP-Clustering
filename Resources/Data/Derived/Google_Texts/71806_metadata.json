James Lankford is pressuring the Department of Homeland Security to change language used in a U.S. citizens exam.\n\n\u201cIt is my understanding that the answer choice \u2018freedom of worship\u2019 has been used since 2008, when [the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services] was advised that the word \u2018worship\u2019 was more inclusive than the word \u2018religion,\u2019\u201d Lankford, R-Okla., wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson today.\n\nNot only is \u2018freedom of worship\u2019 inconsistent with the text of the amendment proposed 226 years ago today, [but also] saying that \u2018freedom of worship\u2019 is more inclusive than \u2018freedom of religion\u2019 flies in the face of a pillar upon which our entire nation was founded.\n\nLankford was referring to a decision by the Department of Homeland Security to list \u201cfreedom of worship\u201d instead of \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d as a basic American right listed in the civics test that all immigrants must take to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, and using the same language in accompanying study materials.\n\nAlthough the dispute is over just one word, Lankford, co-chairman of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, argues the difference is substantial.\n\n\u201cThe freedom of religion is much more than just the freedom of worship,\u201d he said. \u201cWorship confines you to a location. Freedom of religion is the right to exercise your religious beliefs\u2014it is the ability for Americans to live out their faith or to choose to have no faith at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe freedom of religion is much more than just the freedom of worship,\u201d said @SenatorLankford.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to The Daily Signal the \u201cfreedom of worship\u201d text was adopted on October 1, 2008, following a multi-year \u201credesign effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the redesign of the naturalization test, [the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services] consulted several scholars and experts in the fields of American history and political science to ensure civics items and answers developed for the redesigned test were accurate,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201c[The Office of Citizenship] was advised that the word \u201cworship\u201d was more inclusive than the word \u2018religion.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Lankford requested the naturalization test and its corresponding materials are \u201cimmediately\u201d changed \u201cto correctly show that Americans have the right to the free exercise of religion.\u201d\n\nAs of May, the Department of Homeland Security had said it has no \u201cimmediate plans\u201d to revise test items.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
