Check out tomorrow for Part 2 as he discusses the current presidential candidates, the GOP Debate, Donald Trump and much more!\n\nCongratulations Mr. Root on your new book, The Power of Relentless: 7 Secrets to Achieving Mega Success, Financial Freedom, and the Life of Your Dreams! Can you give us an overview of your book, and maybe just one of the seven secrets?\n\n\u201cThe Power of Relentless\u201d is the answer to what\u2019s missing in the Republican Party and the conservative movement. Think about it. Can you even imagine being so weak-willed that you could win in a massive, historic landslide and yet be too timid, or frightened, or cowardly, or self-destructive to take advantage of it? Well that\u2019s exactly what just happened to the GOP. We won last November in such a big way\u2026such a historic sweep\u2026such a repudiation of Barack Obama\u2026that we should be dominating the agenda in Washington, DC.\n\nObama should be facing impeachment. Obamacare should be defunded. Obama\u2019s amnesty for illegal immigrants should be defunded. Certainly it should not even be up for conversation, without a wall (or virtual wall controlled by drones) first being built to secure the border. Planned Parenthood should be defunded. Obama\u2019s EPA regulations should be neutered. Taxes and massive regulations should be gutted. Obama\u2019s agenda should be in shambles. Obama should be hiding deep inside the White House- embarrassed to show his face after a public drubbing like he took. Yet the opposite has happened. Obama lost badly, yet he\u2019s in total control.\n\nHe never lost a step. He never lost confidence. He never let us see him sweat. He disregarded it all, stayed true to his agenda, and just kept on attacking\u2026and winning. He\u2019s gotten everything he ever wanted in the months since he lost in a massive landslide. And the GOP has gotten nothing. That\u2019s \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS!\u201d Obama understands it. The GOP doesn\u2019t.\n\nThis book isn\u2019t even a political book. It was written as a business and personal development book. It was written for anyone to apply to their career, or business, or personal goals- to achieve extraordinary success. This book is a roadmap to success. This book is a gameplan for stopping Obama dead in his tracks and taking back America.\n\nStop bringing a knife to a gunfight. This isn\u2019t badminton with Muffy at the country club. This is a war for the future of America. Obama understands that. Start defending your principles, capitalism, American Exceptionalism and Judeo Christian values. Stop whining and giving us excuses for your failure. Start fighting like your country and your family\u2019s future depends on it\u2026because they do. That\u2019s \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS.\u201d\n\nWhat three takeaways would you like readers to leave with after reading your book?\n\nFirst, leadership. I base my life on the last 12 hours of my mother\u2019s life. Those last 12 hours were the model for my life. All of the remarkable success in my life has come after I experienced those last 12 hours.\n\nMy mom and dad died 28 days apart in 1992. 28 days after my dad\u2019s funeral, my mom\u2019s doctor called with the bad news. He said, \u201cShe fell into a coma earlier today, we rushed her to the hospital, her brain is dead, there is no brain activity of any kind, we have disconnected life support. Her heart will stop beating in a few seconds. She\u2019s gone. Don\u2019t rush home. We don\u2019t want another tragedy in your family. There\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d\n\nBut my sister grabbed the phone from the doctor and whispered, \u201cRush home. You and I both know mom. She won\u2019t die until you get here. Rush home.\u201d\n\nI rushed to the airport to catch the red eye from LA to New York. I walked into my mother\u2019s hospital room 12 hours after that phone call. My sister had held her hand all night saying, \u201cDon\u2019t die, Wayne is on the way. Don\u2019t die, Wayne will be here.\u201d And when I walked into the room, I heard the most amazing sound- \u201cBeep\u2026beep\u2026beep.\u201d Her heart was still beating on that monitor. The doctor said it was impossible, but mom made the impossible, possible.\n\nI told her I loved her and thanked her for her heroism. Then I said, \u201cMom what you did was amazing, but now its time to let go.\u201d And her heart monitor stopped at that moment. She was gone.\n\nHow did she know I was on the way, if her brain was dead? How did she know to hold on, if her brain was dead? How did she know I was at her bedside, if her brain was dead? How could she do all this if medical science reported her as brain dead?\n\nThe answer is \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS.\u201d The answer is heart, spirit, will. My mom proved if your heart is big enough, it doesn\u2019t even matter if your brain is dead.\n\nThat\u2019s leadership. If you could bottle my mom\u2019s last 12 hours\u2026if you could bottle the fight and faith in my mom\u2026if you could bottle her spirit\u2026if you could bottle her heart\u2026and put that in a leader\u2026would you follow him or her? Would you believe in them? Would you have faith through thick and thin? Would you follow them through hell? That\u2019s a true leader. That\u2019s a George Washington. That\u2019s an Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s a Ronald Reagan. That\u2019s \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS.\u201d\n\nThis book should be required reading for every GOP politician, officeholder and leader in the country. Don\u2019t tell me America can\u2019t be saved. Don\u2019t tell me Obama can\u2019t be stopped. Don\u2019t tell me Obamacare can\u2019t be defunded. Nothing is impossible- if you believe\u2026if you have faith\u2026if you have heart\u2026if you\u2019re a leader\u2026if you understand \u201cThe Power of RELENTLESS.\u201d\n\nNeed I say more? This book is the perfect marriage of Mike Tyson and Mother Teresa. With a little Donald Trump and the Energizer Bunny thrown in for good measure. This book teaches you how to master others and master your career, but only by first mastering yourself.\n\nMike Tyson once said, \u201cEveryone has a plan, until they get punched in the face.\u201d This book is your perfect plan for what to do when you get punched in the face. You get back up, laugh at the other guy, then you hit back\u2026harder. You hit the other guy with a KNOCKOUT PUNCH. This book features 7 secrets to unimaginable success. And as a bonus, a one-of-a-kind, 12-step program for building a foundation of rock solid faith\u2026and a balance of body, mind, spirit and soul.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique perspective and a unique combination of who I am- a lifelong Reagan Republican-conservative\u2026a natural born killer in the business world (learned on the mean streets of New York)\u2026and a Jew turned evangelical Christian.\n\nTell us a little more about yourself!\n\nFavorite movie?\n\nA tie between \u201cBraveheart\u201d and \u201cAct of Valor\u201d\n\nFavorite TV Show?\n\nA tie between \u201cChicago P.D.\u201d and \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d\n\nFavorite food\n\nSteaks or Asian food (Chinese, Thai, Sushi)\n\nFavorite Bands?\n\nU2, Rolling Stones, Guns & Roses, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Frank Sinatra\n\nFavorite politician ever?\n\nRonald Reagan and Winston Churchill\n\nWhere do you get your news from?\n\nMy favorite sites are DrudgeReport, FoxNews, TheBlaze, Newsmax, Breitbart, PersonalLiberty, ZeroHedge, and of course my own site ROOTforAmerica.com\n\nIf you could meet any person, dead or alive, who would it be?\n\nA tie between Jesus Christ and Moses\n\nWhat do you do for fun?\n\nI love to work out in my home gym (2 hours per day, 7 days per week), morning walks, hiking, skiing, swimming and playing football with my sons, gun shooting, watching NFL and college football and I love nice cars!\n\nWhat books influenced your political philosophy and outlook on life?\n\nThe Conscience of a Conservative, by Barry Goldwater\n\nThink and Grow Rich, by Napolean Hill\n\nThe Power of Positive Thinking, by Rev.
