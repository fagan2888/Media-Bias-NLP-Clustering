New Mexicoâ€™s health insurance exchange is launching an advertising campaign to make small businesses and individuals aware they can buy health coverage through the online shopping center.

Exchange officials said Tuesday that radio ads are starting this week and 34 billboards are going up statewide. Television ads are to air in about two weeks.

The exchange (www.bewellnm.com) will begin enrolling New Mexicans next month for coverage that starts in 2014.

More than 80,000 uninsured New Mexicans are expected to obtain insurance through the exchange next year.

The state is launching a New Mexico-run exchange for small businesses to shop for coverage for their employees, but individuals initially will enroll through a federally operated exchange for the next year.

Tax credits will be available to some consumers to reduce premium costs.
