Others may have been covered by employers under tighter new rules on who must be covered.\n\n\"The survey findings show that uninsured adults ages 18 to 64 gained coverage across all age, gender, race and ethnicity groups,\" the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which helped pay for the study, said in a statement.\n\nThe Obama administration says just under 7 million people signed up for private insurance, often with federal subsidies, on the new exchanges over the past year. They expect 9 million to do so this year. So far, 765,000 people have signed up this year, about 300,000 of them in the last week of November, and about half are new enrollees.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Obamacare enrollment mistake 0:46 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\n\u2014 Maggie Fox", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 10 million people got covered by health insurance over the past year, bringing the rate of uninsured down from 17.7 percent to 12.4 percent.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/obamacare-deadline/obamacare-bump-10-million-got-health-insurance-survey-shows-n260951", "type": "article", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_21/458261/140521-spanish-obamacare-1720_2f772e1d80f84de752412aac57b9ed13.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "More than 10 million people got covered by health insurance over the past year, bringing the rate of uninsured down from 17.7 percent to 12.4 percent."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "More than 10 million people got covered by health insurance over the past year, bringing the rate of uninsured down from 17.7 percent to 12.4 percent.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_21/458261/140521-spanish-obamacare-1720_2f772e1d80f84de752412aac57b9ed13.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare Bump: 10 Million Got Health Insurance, Survey Shows - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-03", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/obamacare-deadline/obamacare-bump-10-million-got-health-insurance-survey-shows-n260951", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health Care,Health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1af\"", "article_summary": "More than 10 million people got covered by health insurance over the past year, bringing the rate of uninsured down from 17.7 percent to 12.4 percent, a new survey shows.\nThe data from the left-leaning Urban Institute shows 10.6 million people gained health insurance between September 2013 and September 2014, thanks in large part to new health insurance exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid in 27 states plus Washington, D.C.
