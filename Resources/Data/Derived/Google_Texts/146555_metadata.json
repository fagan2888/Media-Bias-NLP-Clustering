Mattie, also an associate professor of management at Quinnipiac, said that while the number of people who have health insurance has increased because of what has become known as Obamacare, the number of doctors available to treat them has not.\n\n\u201cIn the past, people who were uninsured might have avoided going to a doctor completely or gone to a hospital emergency,\u201d she said. \u201cNow these people have a method to get appropriate health care, they are looking for convenience, which is what these clinics provide.\u201d\n\nWhile getting an appointment with a doctor who is general practitioner might take weeks and require the patient to take time off from work, walk-in clinics offer prompt service, Mattie said. But she warned that people should not expect certain types of services that are available in hospital emergency rooms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got chest pains or some other real medical emergency, you should got to an emergency room,\u201d she said. \u201cWalk-in clinics are for things like strep throats and other minor ailments.\u201d\n\nGreenwich-based ASAP Urgent Care is one of the types of urgent care companies that is benefitting from the reformed health care system.\n\nThe company, which was founded by a group of doctors, opened its first clinic in Hamden at 2165 Dixwell Ave. in November. Since then, it has opened a clinic in Madison and the grand opening of its new center, at 195 Cherry St. in Milford, was Wednesday.\n\nA fourth center is expected to open in North Haven later this spring, according to company officials\n\n\u201cGetting sick isn\u2019t convenient, but getting better should be,\u201d Traver Hutchins, ASAP Urgent Care\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a statement.\n\nASAP Urgent Care doesn\u2019t have a waiting room or a receptionist: Patients are greeted by a concierge in the lounge where they can listen to music and enjoy a beverage. Children have their own private play area.\n\nASAP Urgent Care also offers annual physical exams and other health screenings needed for work, school or sports, as well as travel vaccinations and prescriptions and a number of basic lab screenings.\n\nAll of the companies centers are open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., except on Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nCall Luther Turmelle at 203-789-5706.
