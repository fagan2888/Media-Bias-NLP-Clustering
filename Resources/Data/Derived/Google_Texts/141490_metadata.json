The vote will test Senate Democrats\u2019 allegiance to the president and add urgency to the calls for Mrs. Clinton to finally weigh in.\n\nBy remaining mum, however, Mrs. Clinton hopes to have it both ways. She has voiced general support for the left\u2019s anti-free trade views while not overtly offending the White House or business interests \u2014 potential campaign donors \u2014 who back the deal.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing it very smart. There\u2019s no pressure on her. She can do what she wants when she wants,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic campaign consultant who formerly advised President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe unions and liberals will forgive her for any transgressions and get behind it if she becomes the nominee, because she\u2019ll be the only option for keeping a Democrat in the White House, said Mr. Sheinkopf.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great position to be in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was a credible candidate against her in the Democratic primary who could play this off against her, it would be different. She would then have to say what her position is. But she doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nVeteran Democratic campaign strategist Joe Trippi agreed.\n\n\u201cAt this point there isn\u2019t much of a downside either way within the Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of her current opponents within the party have enough traction to pose a real challenge as of now. So she is free to do what she thinks is right or what she thinks better positions her against the Republicans.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state so far faces only token opposition in the Democratic primary race.\n\nShe captured 60 percent in a poll released last week of likely Iowa Democratic Caucus participants. Her closest competitor, Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders, got 15 percent in the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\nMrs. Clinton enjoyed a similar lead among likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, a neighbor of Mr. Sanders\u2019 home state.\n\nMr. Sanders has repeatedly attempted to make the trade deal an issue, stressing his opposition and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s conspicuous silence on the issue when he announced his White House run April 30.\n\nWhen pressed Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS to say why he\u2019s a better candidate than Mrs. Clinton, TPP was the first issue raised by Mr. Sanders.\n\n\u201cI am strongly opposed to that trade agreement because I think it follows in the footsteps of other disastrous trade agreements which have cost us millions of jobs,\u201d he said, later adding that it was one area where he and Mrs. Clinton \u201cdiffer.\u201d\n\nThe other \u201cdisastrous\u201d trade deals he referred to include the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which was signed by President Bill Clinton, with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s full support. When she ran for president in 2008, Mrs. Clinton took a dimmer view of the trade deal and said it needed to be fixed.\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who is expected to enter the race this month, mocked Mrs. Clinton for not taking a stance on TPP \u2014 with a reference to her book \u201cHard Choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard Choices?\u201d he said in an email to supporters. \u201cNope. To me, opposing bad trade deals like TPP is just common sense.\u201d\n\nFormer Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee is the only potential Democrat for president who has come out firmly in favor of the trade deal.\n\nMany on the left have interpreted Mrs. Clinton\u2019s silence as tacit approval. After all, she was a chief proponent of the trade deal when she ran the State Department for Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cTPP will lower barriers, raise standards and drive long-term growth across the region,\u201d she said in 2012. \u201cIt will cover 40 percent of the world\u2019s total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment.\u201d\n\nTeam Clinton tried to walk back her position with a statement when the fast-track bill was introduced last month.\n\n\u201cAny new trade measure has to pass two tests: First, it should put us in a position to protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home. Second, it must also strengthen our national security,\u201d it said.\n\nLast week, after Mrs. Clinton took an aggressive stance on immigration that included backing a path to citizenship for illegals and expanding Mr. Obama\u2019s deportation amnesty, a Hispanic advocacy group pressed her to be just as courageous in opposing TPP.\n\nA small group of activists from Presente.org rallied outside a Clinton campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton wants the Latino vote. But in order to win it, she needs to offer specifics. And she needs to start by detailing her recently announced immigration platform and also by taking a stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major trade pact that will have a major effect in increasing migration,\u201d said Arturo Carmona, executive director of Presente.org.\n\n\u201cTrade agreements like the TPP have a disastrous effect on Latino families across the U.S., but the impact it has in uprooting Latin American families cannot be understated,\u201d Mr. Carmona told The Washington Times.\n\nDid the Clinton campaign respond?\n\n\u201cNot yet, but the pressure is up and real,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As calls intensify for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to take a stand on a major trade deal that has split her party, she's wagered that she can ignore them, and campaign veterans say it's a safe bet.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As calls intensify for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to take a stand on a major trade deal that has split her party, she\u2019s wagered that she can ignore them, and campaign veterans say it\u2019s a safe bet.", "title": "Hillary Clinton, comfortable in 2016 front-runner status, silent on Asia trade deal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/11/hillary-clinton-comfortable-in-2016-front-runner-s/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/11/HillaryClinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/11/HillaryClinton.jpg", "description": "As calls intensify for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton to take a stand on a major trade deal that has split her party, she's wagered that she can ignore them, and campaign", "card": "summary", "title": "Hillary Clinton, comfortable in 2016 front-runner status, silent on As"}, "Author": "S.A.
