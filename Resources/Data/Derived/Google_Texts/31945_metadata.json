Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, would require that abortion-clinic medical directors and doctors have admitting privileges at Florida hospitals or that they have patient-transfer agreements with hospitals within a 30-minute drive.\n\nThat is more-stringent than current law, which applies to clinic medical directors. That law says medical directors must have admitting privileges at hospitals or have transfer agreements with hospitals \"within reasonable proximity\" of the clinics.\n\nHospital admitting-privilege issues have touched off abortion political battles in other states. Supporters say such proposals help ensure patient safety, while critics contend the requirements are designed to make it harder to provide abortions.\n\nState Rep. Mike Hill, R-Pensacola Beach, has filed a bill (HB 1) that would go further than Stargel's proposal. It would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of clinics.\n\nBoth bills are filed for the 2016 legislative session, which starts in January.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Calling it the \"Women's Health Protection Act,\" a Senate Republican last week filed a bill that would increase hospital-related requirements for doctors", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/proposal-more-rules-abortion-clinic-docs", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201501/abortion.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Calling it the \"Women's Health Protection Act,\" a Senate Republican last week filed a bill that would increase hospital-related requirements for doctors", "title": "Proposal: More Rules For Abortion Clinic Docs"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 192, "dc": {"title": "Proposal: More Rules For Abortion Clinic Docs"}, "nid": 12450, "datePublished": "2015-10-26", "story_id": 451890099, "keywords": "abortion bill, abortion restrictions, Florida Legislature", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3b3\"", "article_summary": "That is more-stringent than current law, which applies to clinic medical directors.\nIt would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of clinics.\nThat law says medical directors must have admitting privileges at hospitals or have transfer agreements with hospitals \"within reasonable proximity\" of the clinics.\nState Rep.
