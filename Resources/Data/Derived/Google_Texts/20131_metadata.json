The other nine players were treated and released, along with the coach. A woman who answered the phone at the coach\u2019s home Saturday said he was not going to talk about the accident.\n\n\u201cThis is the most traumatic event that NCTC has had in its 90 years of history,\u201d North Central Texas College president Brent Wallace said at an emotional news conference Saturday in Gainesville, Texas, about 60 miles south of the crash site on Interstate 35.\n\nThe four players killed were identified by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol as Meagan Richardson, 19; Brooke Deckard, 20; Katelynn Woodlee, 18, and Jaiden Pelton 20. The women all were from small north Texas towns near the campus.\n\nIt was not clear why the northbound 18-wheel tractor-trailer lurched across the median into the southbound lanes. Police said they would investigate the accident as if it were a homicide.\n\nThe Highway Patrol identified the driver as Russell Staley, 53, of Saginaw, Texas. Capt. George Brown, spokesman for the patrol, said there are no charges pending against Staley.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Four Texas softball players killed in bus crash", "title": "Four Texas softball players killed in bus crash", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/27/four-texas-softball-players-killed-in-bus-crash/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_A4_ND28CRASHp1.jpg", "height": 410}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_A4_ND28CRASHp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T18:08:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:15:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca8de\"", "article_summary": "The four players killed were identified by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol as Meagan Richardson, 19; Brooke Deckard, 20; Katelynn Woodlee, 18, and Jaiden Pelton 20.\nThe women all were from small north Texas towns near the campus.\nA north Texas community college brought in counselors to comfort grieving students Saturday and canceled athletic competitions after four women\u2019s softball players were killed when an 18-wheel truck veered into oncoming traffic on an interstate and crashed into the side of their team bus.\nThe Highway Patrol identified the driver as Russell Staley, 53, of Saginaw, Texas.\nA woman who answered the phone at the coach\u2019s home Saturday said he was not going to talk about the accident."}
