To do so, they need to focus on the critical issues of patient engagement, interoperability and feedback loop measurement.\n\nIt isn't going to be easy, though. The mHealth app market is still primarily consumer-facing, and wearables are fighting their way through questions of accuracy and reliability. What's more, those markets are still dominated by single-function devices and solutions, which cater to limited populations. To gain favor with providers, those apps and devices must become multi-functional.\n\nAnd they can't be siloed. Albaiti pointed out that too many new products are focused on doing everything from beginning to end, when they should be looking to integrate with other platforms. Mobile health solutions need to be interoperable, he said.\n\nAlbaiti's keynote, delivered to a crowded room of providers, academics, consultants, vendors and developers, touched on a wide range of topics, with the overriding theme that mHealth as a term is becoming outdated. Comprised primarily of three categories \u2013apps, connected devices and wearables \u2013 the industry as a whole is moving closer to the \"Health Internet of Things.\"\n\nWhile connected devices have seen the most growth and success for providers, wearables and apps will eventually move to the fore as technology improves. In time, he said, mHealth will reach beyond predictive analytics and take on prescriptive analytics \u2013 figuring out what's going to happen and taking steps to solve or improve it.\n\nAdd interoperability to that equation, and you get a health system that's working together to solve issues in real time, and head off crises before they occur.\n\n\"We're working toward knowing who the patient is, knowing where they are and knowing what really matters,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the raft of apps, connected devices and wearables become part of the Health Internet of Things providers will gain the ability to not only predict health events but also take steps to avoid them.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "As the raft of apps, connected devices and wearables become part of the Health Internet of Things providers will gain the ability to not only predict health events but also take steps to avoid them.", "title": "Prescriptive analytics on the mHealth horizon", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/prescriptive-analytics-mhealth-horizon", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/business_analytics_data.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-12T16:36:05-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/prescriptive-analytics-mhealth-horizon", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/business_analytics_data.jpg"}, "description": "As the raft of apps, connected devices and wearables become part of the Health Internet of Things providers will gain the ability to not only predict health events but also take steps to avoid them.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Prescriptive analytics on the mHealth horizon"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-12T14:54:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-12T16:36:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca14c\"", "article_summary": "In time, he said, mHealth will reach beyond predictive analytics and take on prescriptive analytics \u2013 figuring out what's going to happen and taking steps to solve or improve it.\n\"We're working toward knowing who the patient is, knowing where they are and knowing what really matters,\" he said.\nThe mHealth app market is still primarily consumer-facing, and wearables are fighting their way through questions of accuracy and reliability.\nWhile connected devices have seen the most growth and success for providers, wearables and apps will eventually move to the fore as technology improves.\nComprised primarily of three categories \u2013apps, connected devices and wearables \u2013 the industry as a whole is moving closer to the \"Health Internet of Things.\""}
