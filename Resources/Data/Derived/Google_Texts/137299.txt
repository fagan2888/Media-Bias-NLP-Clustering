ATLANTA — Fighting for a division title even with a losing record, the Atlanta Falcons knew they couldn’t afford another defeat.

Not after the New Orleans Saints won earlier in the day.

Led by Julio Jones, the Falcons came up with the matching victory Sunday to stay tied for first in the anemic NFC South.

Nothing weak about this showing by Atlanta, which got a career day from Julio Jones, piled up 500 yards of offense and cruised to a 29-18 victory over the punchless Cardinals (9-3), who suddenly find themselves in a bit of desperation mode.

“When we play consistent football, we can put that type of performance out there,” said Falcons coach Mike Smith, who relieved some of the heat on his job a week after taking the blame for poor clock management in a loss to Cleveland on the final play.

Jones hauled in 10 passes for 189 yards and a touchdown. Matt Ryan completed 30-of-41 for 361 yards with two scores. Matt Bryant set a career high with five field goals, though most of them weren’t much longer than extra points.

The Falcons (5-7) dominated against a team that had given up fewer than 300 yards in each of its four previous games.

“These are the type of games you’ve got to win in November and December in order to play in January,” Ryan said.

Arizona still leads the NFC West after its second straight loss, but now by only one game over defending Super Bowl champion Seattle. More troubling for the Cardinals, they had gone more than 11 quarters without an offensive touchdown until a meaningless late score.

Asked about his team’s struggles, coach Bruce Arias said, “Each man has to look in the mirror and find that answer.”

Steven Jackson broke off a 55-yard run on the Falcons’ opening possession to set up Ryan’s 1-yard touchdown pass to Levine Toilolo on fourth-and-goal.
