They're amazingly diverse. They have well-defined senses of taste and smell. They often travel in groups. They work really well with olive oil.\n\nOne other way fish are like us? They're also shedding cells, constantly. But while humans' cells generally slough off into air, the fishy ones end up in water. This leads to what one scientist refers to, accurately if somewhat horrifyingly, as \"a soup of cells\" in the sea. The ingredients of said soup? \"Skin, damaged tissues, and ... body wastes.\"\n\nThe mixture is technically called eDNA, and you'd be forgiven for thinking that the \"e\" stands for \"ewwwww.\" (It actually stands for \"environmental.\") And while you may prefer not to think about the stuff when planning your next beach vacation, eDNA could prove to be wonderfully useful. For science!\n\nTraditionally, when researchers have needed to take censuses of the marine life populating particular areas, they've had to do it the old-fashioned way: by going out and sampling, netting animals or simply cataloguing them in their habitats. This is inefficient for obvious reasons. And eDNA\u2014all that coded genetic material, just rolling in the deep\u2014could obviate the need for it.\n\nTo test that potential, researchers at the University of Washington recently put eDNA sampling techniques to use. For that, they turned to a nicely concentrated source of that maritime genetic material: the enormous Open Sea Tank at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which houses 13,000 live fish within 1.2 million gallons of water. From those contents, they extracted just two pint-sized glasses of water. (The researchers said, in retrospect, that their sample could have been smaller.) To zero in on vertebrate DNA, the researchers used a set of \"primers\"\u2014molecular probes\u2014that were designed by another group the year before they conducted their study.", "article_metadata": {"description": "And now scientists are using it to take a census of the sea.", "author": "Megan Garber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "And now scientists are using it to take a census of the sea.", "title": "There's All This Fish DNA in the Water", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/01/Sampling_Monterey_Bay_Aquarium/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/theres-all-this-fish-dna-in-the-water/283212/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca94e\"", "article_summary": "One other way fish are like us?\nThis leads to what one scientist refers to, accurately if somewhat horrifyingly, as \"a soup of cells\" in the sea.\nBut while humans' cells generally slough off into air, the fishy ones end up in water.\nTo zero in on vertebrate DNA, the researchers used a set of \"primers\"\u2014molecular probes\u2014that were designed by another group the year before they conducted their study.\nFrom those contents, they extracted just two pint-sized glasses of water."}
