Jeff Davis cruising in his police vehicle and grooving to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cShake It Off\u201d was an instant hit on Friday. The video was shared nearly 2,000 times in less than 24 hours from the department\u2019s Facebook page and drew positive feedback from around the world.\n\nThe goal of the video is to show a different side of police to counter negative perceptions of law enforcement, Dover Police Cpl.. Mark Hoffman said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to humanize police officers. People tend to look at us as robots with uniforms and gun belts so we wanted to a show a lighter side of our force,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to see police in that light.\u201d\n\nThe video was shot as part of the Dover Police Department\u2019s social media community outreach. To celebrate reaching 10,000 Facebook followers, the department launched a series called \u201cDash Cam Confessionals,\u201d debuting with Davis\u2019s rendition of \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\n\nHoffman suggested \u201cShake It Off\u201d and Davis was more than happy to oblige. He already knew the words, thanks to his 10-year-old daughter, a Taylor Swift fan.\n\n\u201cWhen you drive around in a car all the time listening to Taylor Swift you get to know all the words and like her songs,\u201d the 19-year veteran of the force told CNN.\n\nIn the video, Davis appears to pause periodically for passing vehicles. In reality, the video was shot in a secluded parking lot in Dover.\n\n\u201cIt was fun thing, a nice thing to do with everything that\u2019s going on with police. With all the negative publicity it\u2019s nice to show a positive side of police,\u201d he said.\n\nJudging by the response so far, he thinks it\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cI think people are liking the fact of seeing police in a different view.\u201d\n\nTM & \u00a9 2015 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
