How has that man, Abd al-Malik al-Houthi, become one of the most powerful figures in the nation?\n\nAnsar Allah was founded in the early nineties in Yemen\u2019s northern province of Saada. Then known as the Believing Youth, residents of Saada had grown tired of the meddling influence of their neighbor to the north, Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe Houthis are Zaydis, a sect of Shia Islam prominent in northern Yemen, and the rapid spread of Wahhabism throughout the country had begun to worry community leaders.\n\nIn the post-9/11 world, the Houthis grew more and more concerned with the relationship then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh was fostering with the United States. Already wary of foreign influence in Yemen, the Houthis began making their grievances known in the capital Sanaa.\n\nTensions between the burgeoning political movement and Saleh reached a head in 2004 when the government sent troops into Saada to arrest the then leader of the Houthis, Hussein al-Houthi. During that attempted arrest, al-Houthi was killed by government forces and an insurgency was launched against the president and his network of powerful sheikhs and generals.\n\nThe Houthi transformation\n\nMembers of the Houthi Shiite group watch a televised speech by the leader of Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, as they attend the annual Eid al-Ghadir festival in Sanaa, Yemen, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2014.

In Sanaa, Saleh sought to represent the Houthis as remnants of the Zaydi Imamate of the early and mid-20th century, where decedents of the Prophet Mohammed ruled with impunity in a religious monarchy.\n\nBut in spite of the carnage inflicted upon Saada in six years of war, the Houthis endured. In November 2009, in what the Yemeni military code-named \u201cOperation Scorched Earth,\u201d fighting between the Houthis and Yemeni security forces spilled into Saudi Arabia.\n\nBy January, the Saudis had had enough of the Houthis \u2014 they agreed to a truce and Abd al-Malik and his fighters withdrew back to Saada and relinquished the territory they had seized from Saudi Arabia, land that was historically Yemeni.\n\nAs popular protests calling for the ouster of President Saleh broke out across Yemen in 2011, al-Houthi saw another opportunity. Leaving their weapons behind, the Houthis joined the youth protesters in the capital.\n\nWhen their nemesis \u2014 the president \u2014 stepped down from his 34-year-reign, the Houthis sought further inclusion in the government, morphing into a political organization \u2014 one that happened to command tens of thousands of some of the most hardened fighters in the entire region.\n\nAs Yemen attempted to recover from nearly two years of political turmoil, the Houthis had an opening to assert themselves as more than just religious revivalists with a penchant for staying alive in the face of impossible odds.\n\nWith Yemen\u2019s revolutionary youth totally marginalized, the country\u2019s usual suspects battled for control of the post-Saleh political landscape. The Houthis represented an alternative to the old guard of the Saleh era and their influence began to expand in the capital. In 2012, banners emblazoned with the Houthi war cry, or sarkha, began making regular appearances in the capital.\n\n\u201cGod is great, death to America, death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews, victory for Islam,\u201d the Houthi sarkha reads.\n\nAs their influence grew, Houthi fighters began pushing out of Saada and into other provinces north of Sanaa. In two years, the Houthis had seized large swaths of Amran and al-Jawf. By the end of last year, the fringe religious insurgency that once faced starvation and extinction had arrived at the doorstep of Yemen\u2019s capital.\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nA Houthi Shiite rebel holds a weapon while on patrol following dawn prayers attended by supporters of the rebels on the first day of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, or Feast of the Sacrifice, in Sanaa, Yemen, Saturday, Oct. 4, 2014. Muslims around the world celebrated Saturday to commemorate the willingness of the prophet Ibrahim \u2013 or Abraham as he is known in the Bible \u2013 to sacrifice his son in accordance with God\u2019s will, though in the end God provides him a sheep to sacrifice instead. Muslims slaughter sheep, cattle, and other livestock, and give part of the meat to the poor.

Houthi checkpoints began to dot the city. Even more curious, Yemenis began to accuse the Houthis of cooperating with their one-time nemesis, Ali Abdullah Saleh. As part of a 2011 Saudi-brokered agreement, Saleh relinquished power but maintained immunity and freedom to remain within Yemen.\n\nOften dismissed as mere conspiracy theories, many western leaders refused to believe that Saleh was cooperating with Houthi leaders \u2014 after all, that would have completely undermined their diplomatic efforts to negotiate Saleh\u2019s ouster from power in 2011.\n\nBut in November, the United Nations placed sanctions on Saleh as well as two Houthi leaders and accused the former president of conspiring with the Houthis to sabotage the stability of the fledgling government.\n\n\u201cAs of fall 2012, Ali Abdullah Saleh had reportedly become one of the primary supporters of violent Houthi actions in northern Yemen,\u201d read a statement issued by the United Nations last year.\n\nBy January, skirmishes began breaking out at various checkpoints throughout the city. The Houthis took Ahmed Bin Mubarak, a close aide to Hadi, into their custody. By Monday morning, fighting between the Houthis and government forces had spread across the city.\n\nWhen the Houthis seized control of the presidential palace, many assumed that coup was underway.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Abd al-Malik al-Houthi addressed the nation to condemn corruption and foreign influence. He reassured Yemenis that what was taking place was not a coup and that Hadi was still the president.\n\nThe Houthis\u2019 intentions remain unclear but their power and influence seem virtually unstoppable. Al-Houthi has now set his sights on Marib \u2014 home to a great deal of Yemen\u2019s oil and electricity infrastructure. But Marib\u2019s Sunni tribesman stand in his way.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hadi and al-Houthi agreed to yet another peace deal in which both parties pledged to uphold the previous peace deal. Hadi will remain president but Yemen\u2019s true power brokers are continuing to operate unchecked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The past week has seen heavy fighting in the capital Saana, where the Houthis have gained almost complete control.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jeb Boone", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The past week has seen heavy fighting in the capital Saana, where the Houthis have gained almost complete control.", "title": "The Rise Of The Houthis: A Brief History Of Yemen's New Power Brokers", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/rise-houthis-brief-history-yemens-new-power-brokers/201512/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP202396382242.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-07T11:55:12-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The past week has seen heavy fighting in the capital Saana, where the Houthis have gained almost complete control.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP648662479682.jpg", "title": "The Rise Of The Houthis: A Brief History Of Yemen's New Power Brokers", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "Yemen", "published_time": "2015-01-24T05:00:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-07T11:55:12-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Hadi will remain president but Yemen\u2019s true power brokers are continuing to operate unchecked.\nThe Rise Of The Houthis: A Brief History Of Yemen\u2019s New Power BrokersThe past week has seen heavy fighting in the capital Saana, where the Houthis have gained almost complete control.\nAlready wary of foreign influence in Yemen, the Houthis began making their grievances known in the capital Sanaa.\nAs popular protests calling for the ouster of President Saleh broke out across Yemen in 2011, al-Houthi saw another opportunity.\nA Houthi Shiite rebel poses for a picture as he guards a street in Sanaa, Yemen."}
