He played on Larry Walker Field as a kid. Walker, as Morneau put it during Friday\u2019s conference call, showed him that it was possible to be a big leaguer. He and Walker are friends as Walker served as his hitting coach in the World Baseball Classic. Morneau would like to don No. 33 as a tribute to Walker. It\u2019s likely that the Rockies will retire Walker\u2019s number at some point, though Todd Helton is expected to be the first, according to owner Dick Monfort\u2019s wishes last September.\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s easy to see this happening. Morneau could wear it until it is taken out of circulation.\n\n\u201cThe only reason I wouldn\u2019t is if I didn\u2019t feel like it was right. As far as No. 33 I don\u2019t know if anyone has ever worn it since Larry. If the team was going retiring this year or next, I wouldn\u2019t do it. Obviously, it\u2019s the number I would like. It would be a good way of saying thank you to Larry. It would be a tribute,\u201d Morneau said.\n\nMorneau also was a hockey goalie like Walker. Morneau\u2019s favorite player? Patrick Roy. He went to an Avs game on Tuesday and is hoping to meet Roy this spring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic that I ended up where Larry played and where Patrick was a star and is coaching,\u201d Morneau said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado Rockies,Justin Morneau,Larry Walker,Patrick Roy", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Justin Morneau definitely has a number he'd like to wear for the Rockies, and it traces to his childhood.", "title": "Justin Morneau wants to wear No. 33 as tribute to Larry Walker", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2013/12/13/justin-morneau-wants-to-wear-no-33-as-tribute-to-larry-walker/16145/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/12/justin-morneau.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Justin Morneau definitely has a number he'd like to wear for the Rockies, and it traces to his childhood.", "title": "Justin Morneau wants to wear No. 33 as tribute to Larry Walker", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2013/12/13/justin-morneau-wants-to-wear-no-33-as-tribute-to-larry-walker/16145/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/12/justin-morneau.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Justin Morneau definitely has a number he'd like to wear for the Rockies, and it traces to his childhood."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4b8\"", "article_summary": "He grew up in British Columbia idolizing Larry Walker.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ironic that I ended up where Larry played and where Patrick was a star and is coaching,\u201d Morneau said.\nHe played on Larry Walker Field as a kid.\nJustin Morneau definitely has a number he\u2019d like to wear for the Rockies, and it traces to his childhood.\nWalker, as Morneau put it during Friday\u2019s conference call, showed him that it was possible to be a big leaguer."}
