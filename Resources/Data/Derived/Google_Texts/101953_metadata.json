By 2018, half of all Medicare payments are expected to go to value-based care models.\n\nMerritt Hawkins noted this transition is still in its early stages and healthcare organizations have a ways to go to reach that goal.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nForbes: Doctors Send $1.6M A Year To Hospitals Despite Value-Based Care Push", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "medium": "news", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-finance,healthcare-hospital-admin,healthcare-policy-reg", "description": "Healthcare", "category": "News Post", "title": "Hospitals reap $1.56M from doctors as CMS pushes value-based care", "pub_date": "apr 13, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-13T22:34:28", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, April 13, 2016, 10:34 PM", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/e6/e9/e6e941b51496bd4712b0f31d567dc662.jpg", "news_keywords": "Finance,Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-04-01T22:34:28", "teaser": "<p>Demand for healthcare services and utilization are up,&nbsp;especially for&nbsp;specialists, whose average hospital-related business grew to $1.6 million this year.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-13", "sailthru.description": "Demand for healthcare services and utilization are up,\u00a0especially for\u00a0specialists, whose average hospital-related business grew to $1.6 million this year.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Demand for healthcare services and utilization are up,\u00a0especially for\u00a0specialists, whose average hospital-related business grew to $1.6 million this year.", "title": "Hospitals reap $1.56M from doctors as CMS pushes value-based care", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hospitals-reap-156m-from-doctors-as-cms-pushes-value-based-care/417316/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Fotolia_47012170_Subscription_Monthly_M_vb7DISu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/ec/7e/ec7e3c13a069a7375e8b6add6c535857.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a2d\"", "article_summary": "Dive Brief:Despite efforts to move to value-based care, doctors are bringing in more dollars for hospitals than anytime in the recent past, according to a new Merritt Hawkins analysis.\nRecommended ReadingForbes: Doctors Send $1.6M A Year To Hospitals Despite Value-Based Care Push\nBy 2018, half of all Medicare payments are expected to go to value-based care models.\nHowever, the Obama administration has made the shift away from fee-for-service medicine toward value-based care a hallmark of its healthcare reform program.\nThe findings come as CMS is pushing the healthcare industry to adopt value-based models of care."}
