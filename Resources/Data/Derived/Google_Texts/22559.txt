Healthcare Reform: Minus the Misinformation, Motives & Myths

KPCW continued its series of community forums to discuss timely topics to citizens of the Wasatch Back. Each forum is broadcast live on-air and posted on our website afterwards so listeners can inform themselves on the topic.

This year, with the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act, KPCW partnered with Summit County's hospital, the Intermountain Park City Medical Center, to provide "Healthcare Reform: Minus the Misinformation, Motives and Myths".
