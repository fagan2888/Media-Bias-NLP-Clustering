Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) has, for the third consecutive Congress, proposed the Empowering Patients First Act, a comprehensive alternative that addresses some of the main issues current facing the American healthcare system, including cost and access to quality healthcare.\n\nPrice\u2019s approach to healthcare is unique. He spent nearly 20 years working in private practice as an orthopedic surgeon and he takes seriously the commitment doctors make to patients and their families.\n\nUnited Liberty talked with Price about the Empowering Patients First Act on Friday at his district office in Roswell, Georgia.\n\nPatients should be in control of their healthcare decisions\n\nOne of the most frequent criticisms of Obamacare is that it gives Washington and insurance companies more control over the healthcare system. Price, who has served in the House since 2005, explained that his approach to healthcare differs from Obamacare because it would put crucial healthcare decisions back in the hands of patients.\n\n\u201cPatient-centered to me means that patients and doctors are making medical decisions, not government, not Washington, D.C., not even insurance companies,\u201d Price told United Liberty. \u201cIt ought to be patients and families and doctors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President continuing to state over and over that Republicans have no alternatives, they haven\u2019t put anything forward, is not only disingenuous on his part, it\u2019s outright deceitful,\u201d he declared. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve seen now is Obamacare through the implementation phase, through the sign-up phase, and now we\u2019re seeing the construct of what it\u2019s going to be like for the American people. And it\u2019s not going to be good.\u201d\n\nPrice explained that his opposition to Obamacare is because the law \u201cviolates every single principle that [doctors] hold dear when it comes to healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s affordability, it\u2019s raising costs, whether it\u2019s accessibility, it will decrease and is doing so the ability of folks to get even minimal healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cQuality, it\u2019s decreasing quality. Responsiveness or innovation, it is violating those principles. And then it\u2019s limiting the choices of the American people.\u201d\n\nAddressing the cost of healthcare\n\nPrice recognizes that the cost of healthcare is a very serious issue that must be addressed. But Obamacare doesn\u2019t address this. In fact, he explained that the law actually adds more costs through expensive mandates and bureaucracy.\n\nUnlike Obamacare, the Price\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t have any mandates, meaning that the so-called \u201cessential benefits,\u201d which are partly responsible for higher health insurance premiums, would be nixed. What\u2019s more, there is no individual mandate to purchase coverage, yet another fundamental difference in approach.\n\n\u201cWhat we recommend through the Empowering Patients First Act, HR 2300, is to say that look, you gotta get everybody covered, you can\u2019t have folks out here walking around without health insurance, the system doesn\u2019t work when they\u2019re not covered,\u201d Price noted. \u201cBut they need to be covered with insurance that they want, not that the government forces them to buy or tells them that they must buy under penalty of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way that we do that is through the tax code,\u201d he explained, equating later it to a \u201ccoupon\u201d for whatever health plan an individual wants. \u201cTax deductions, tax credits, refundable tax credits, advanceable refundable tax credits, so that every single American has the financial feasibility and opportunity to purchase coverage, again, that they want for themselves and their family, not that the law is telling them they must purchase.\u201d\n\nPrice also recognizes that there are some Americans who are priced out of the insurance market because they have a preexisting condition. His proposal would allow those people to pool together to help keep healthcare costs down.\n\nThe Empowering Patients First Act would also reduce the cost burden on taxpayers to the tune of $2.34 trillion over the next 10 years, according to a dynamic score of the legislation by Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Stephen Parente of American Action Forum.\n\nPrice spokesperson Ellen Carmichael told United Liberty that they have requested a score from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan fiscal analysis and research arm of Congress, but haven\u2019t heard back. It\u2019s worth noting that Holtz-Eakin served as director of the CBO from 2003 to 2005.\n\nDecoupling insurance from employment\n\nMost Americans are used to receiving health insurance benefits through their employer, a practice currently encouraged by the government through generous tax deductions. But free market advocates have criticized the employer-based system because it\u2019s take healthcare decisions out of patients\u2019 hands and hides the true cost of coverage.\n\nPrice also sees this as a problem.\n\n\u201cWe ought not have a system where if you change your job or you lose your job, you lose your health coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, between 60% and 65% of the American people get their health coverage through their employer. If they changed their job or they lose their job, they ought not have to get a different kind of health coverage when they move to the next job that they have.\u201d\n\nFor young people, the Georgia Republican explained, this could mean anywhere from 12 to 15 different employers in their lifetime and, under the current system, 12 to 15 different healthcare plans.\n\n\u201cThe way that we solve that is very simple, we make it so everybody owns their own coverage regardless of who\u2019s paying for it \u2014 so it\u2019s like a pension plan, it\u2019s like a 401(k) plan,\u201d Price said. \u201cIf you change your job or you lose your job, you simply take your health coverage with you and plug it in there.\u201d\n\nPrice contends that the employer-based system isn\u2019t responsive to patients because, ultimately, they don\u2019t own their health plans. Insurers don\u2019t look at them as their customers, rather they treat the employer or third-party administrators as the customer. But if patients were left in control of their heath insurance, insurers would be responsive to their concerns.\n\n\u201cWhen you own it, then they know you\u2019re the customer,\u201d Price explained, \u201cthat means that they want to be responsive to you and what it sets up is a system that\u2019s much more patient-centered than insurance-government-employer-centered.\u201d\n\nA new, unique approach to tort reform\n\nRepublicans have frequently pointed out that medical malpractice lawsuits is one of the areas that are driving up healthcare costs. This came out during the congressional debate over Obamacare after a CBO report found that enacting tort reform would reduce the federal budget deficit by $54 billion. Unfortunately, no real steps were taken to end medical lawsuit abuse.\n\nPrice, however, takes this issue head-on in the Empowering Patients First Act, and does so through a very unique approach.\n\n\u201cPeople get confused. They think that lawsuit abuse reform is simply to help decrease the costs for the doctors and hospitals to purchase malpractice coverage. That\u2019s not it at all, that\u2019s a minimal amount,\u201d Price explained. \u201cThe real big cost driver in healthcare is the practice of defensive medicine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the things that I did as a physician, it\u2019s the things that every single doctor in this country does to make certain that if they\u2019re ever called into a court of law for a malpractice case, that they can honestly look the judge and the jury in the eye and say I don\u2019t know what you wanted me to do, because I did everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen in fact everything is rarely necessarily to either diagnosis or treat a problem. That\u2019s the practice of defensive medicine.\u201d\n\nA 2010 Jackson Healthcare study found that defensive medicine costs Americans up to $850 billion each year \u2014 approximately a quarter of all healthcare spending in the United States \u2014 and that 92% of surveyed physicians practiced defensive medicine in the preceding 12 months.\n\n\u201cThis is $800 billion of wasted money in our healthcare system,\u201d Price noted. \u201cYou talk about driving up the cost of healthcare for every single American and health coverage for every single American, this is it. It\u2019s the largest cost driver in healthcare, and Obamacare does nothing to decrease those costs.\u201d\n\nThe Empowering Patients First Act would require the federal government to enter into a contract with a \u201cqualified physician consensus-building organization\u201d to \u201cdevelop best practices guidelines for the evaluation and/or treatment of medical conditions.\u201d These guidelines would be used to determine whether a doctor who is the subject of a medical malpractice lawsuit acted appropriately in diagnosing and treating a patient.\n\n\u201cIf the patient wants to take a physician or a hospital to court, then they ought to be able to do so. We ought not limit that at all. That\u2019s a right that is guaranteed in our Constitution,\u201d Price said. \u201dBut we ought to make it so that if the doctor does the right thing, it has to be a higher standard. You have to have clear and convincing evidence that they didn\u2019t do what they were supposed to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a lawless administration\u201d\n\nIn discussing Obamacare\u2019s top-down approach to healthcare, United Liberty suggested that the law was \u201cone step below\u201d a socialized healthcare system, sort of knocking those who have glossed over control the law gives to the federal government.\n\nBut the Georgia congressman had an interesting take on it in terms of the administration\u2019s unilateral delays and changes to the law, which include delays of the employer mandate and an \u201cadministrative fix\u201d for canceled health plans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not certain that it\u2019s even one step below because of the dictates and the mandates in the program, and the manner in which the President has treated this program, that is to make up the rules as he goes along,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt is even, I would suggest, worse than a socialized program because it\u2019s not even accountable to the legislative branch that passed it in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a lawless administration as it related to healthcare and continues to put in place things that the American people simply don\u2019t want,\u201d he added.\n\nIf you interested in learning more about Rep.
