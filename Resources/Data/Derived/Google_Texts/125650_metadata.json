They found that administrative costs accounted for more than 25 percent of total U.S. hospital expenditures \u2014 far ahead of the pack.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by just how big the differences have grown. The U.S. is in another league than every other country,\u201d said Dr. David Himmelstein, the study\u2019s lead author and a professor at the City University of New York\u2019s School of Public Health.\n\nHimmelstein and his colleagues also found that countries operating under a single-payer health system, such as Canada and Scotland, had the lowest administrative spending, and calculated that the U.S. could save $150 billion a year if it had a system like theirs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re pulverizing all this money on something that does not make people better.\u201d \u2013 Economist Uwe Reinhardt\n\nBased on Medicare Costs Report data from 2011, hospital administrative spending in the U.S. amounted to $667 per capita \u2014 more than double what the Netherlands and England spend.\n\nIn the Netherlands, administrative costs consumed just 19.8 percent of hospital budgets \u2014 compared to 25.3 percent in the U.S. \u2014 and in England, just 15.5 percent.\n\nIn a phone interview, Himmelstein said American hospital administrative costs have doubled over the last decade. \u201cWe anticipate that they\u2019ll continue to go up because we\u2019re continuing to pursue health policies that stimulate administration,\u201d he added.\n\nUwe Reinhardt, a health economist and professor at Princeton University, sees high hospital administrative costs as a moral question. \u201cYou\u2019re pulverizing all this money on something that does not make people better \u2014 doesn\u2019t improve their health,\u201d he said.\n\nReinhardt, who said he had once believed the new federal health law would lower administrative costs, now thinks Obamacare has become too challenging and complex, especially with the addition of navigators and health exchange administrators.\n\n\u201cI think the administration of the American health system has outpaced our ability to cope with it. Even the best IT people cannot cope with it anymore,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cObamacare, if anything, adds to the administrative overhead.\u201d\n\nSo, does having higher administrative costs result in better patient care in the U.S.?\n\nAccording to the study\u2019s authors, the answer is no. They cited previous research that found no significant relationship between higher administrative costs and better care in the U.S.\n\nAs for potential solutions, Himmelstein, who is a cofounder of Physicians for a National Health Program, says he is in favor of switching to a single-payer health-care system. He believes the new federal health law is steering the country in the wrong direction: \u201cIt moves us to more private insurance when expanding Medicare would have been much more efficient,\u201d he says, adding that the law created another layer of insurance bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cThe U.S., of course, has a very complex system where there are multiple payers paying different prices for different health care services,\u201d says Dylan Roby, an assistant professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. \u201cThe findings probably are indicative of the fact that we have a very complex and fragmented system.\u201d\n\nRoby, however, says that he thinks switching to a single-payer system isn\u2019t necessarily the only solution or even the best option.\n\n\u201cI think there might be some sort of solution between what we have now and single payer that is still somewhat market-driven and that may come out of the ACA, if there\u2019s political support for it,\u201d he said.\n\nAlvin Tran is a doctor of science student at the Harvard School of Public Health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study finds that American hospital administrative costs significantly outpace those in other developed countries.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A new study finds that American hospital administrative costs significantly outpace those in other developed countries.", "title": "We\u2019re No. 1, Not In A Good Way: Highest Hospital Administrative Costs", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/us-highest-hospital-administrative-costs", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/09/paperwork1-620x321.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/us-highest-hospital-administrative-costs", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/09/paperwork1-620x321.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "We're No. 1, Not In A Good Way: Highest Hospital Administrative Costs"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-08", "date": "Mon, 08 Sep 2014 10:13:46 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42c1\"", "article_summary": "1, Not In A Good Way: Highest Hospital Administrative CostsBy Alvin TranGuest ContributorWhen it comes to hospital administrative costs, a new Health Affairs study finds, our country is No.\nIn a phone interview, Himmelstein said American hospital administrative costs have doubled over the last decade.\nThey found that administrative costs accounted for more than 25 percent of total U.S. hospital expenditures \u2014 far ahead of the pack.\nUwe Reinhardt, a health economist and professor at Princeton University, sees high hospital administrative costs as a moral question.\nIn the study, researchers analyzed hospital accounting data to compare administrative costs across eight countries: Canada, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Scotland, the United States and Wales."}
