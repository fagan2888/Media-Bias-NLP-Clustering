Especially some of those running for office.\n\nIn research by Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican strategist who studies the attitudes of young voters, in cooperation with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 58 percent of the young people surveyed understand that it is cheaper to pay to prevent an unplanned pregnancy than to pay for the consequences of one.\n\nA bit of connect-the-dots reasoning that seems to have escaped so many of their elders.\n\nAnd two-thirds of these 18- to 24-year-olds recognize that access to birth control enables women to complete their educations and launch their careers.\n\n\"The data is in line with what I have long suspected,\" said Ms. Anderson, founder of Echelon Insights and herself a young Republican. She was selected by Time as one of \"30 Under 30 Changing the World\" in 2013.\n\n\"Young voters are more complicated than people give them credit for. They are Republicans. That means they are fiscally conservative and they believe in limited government. But they believe that birth control can have a very positive effect.\"\n\nThe young Republicans surveyed supported the Supreme Court decision allowing Hobby Lobby to opt out of providing birth control for its employees, she said, not because they dislike birth control or think it is immoral, but because they disapproved of the government's reach.\n\n\"They believe there should be a religious exemption [to the Affordable Care Act mandate]. They believe there should not be a government mandate without an extremely compelling reason. And they set a very high bar for that mandate.\"\n\nWhy is there such a disconnect between these young Republicans and their most conservative political leaders, who seem to want to conflate birth control and abortion so that a safe tool for family planning becomes an act of infanticide?\n\n\"They need to understand that being against birth control, or being perceived as against birth control, will put them at a political disadvantage with young voters, particularly young Republican voters,\" said Ms. Anderson, who believes Republican politicians often make the mistake of treating the issue of birth control as if it were the third rail.\n\n\"They are afraid to talk about it,\" she said. \"They feel uncomfortable weighing in on the issue. Instead of being positive about birth control when asked, they feel like they are being led into a trap.\"\n\nShe points to the campaign of newly elected Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado. He was being pummeled by incumbent Mark Udall for his position on birth control and was forced to repudiate his support for the state's \"personhood\" initiative, which would effectively ban certain forms of birth control. He also published this in an opinion piece in the Denver Post:\n\n\"[The Pill] is safe, reliable, effective, and presents very few risks or complications for the more than 10 million women who use it.\" He also called for its sale over the counter.\n\nJust about every woman has used or will use a form of birth control at some point during her child-bearing years. There is widespread agreement that birth control is morally acceptable. And certainly its use in preventing an unintended pregnancy would dovetail with the call by so many for personal responsibility.\n\nBut birth control has become tangled in politics, primarily because of the ACA's mandate that employers provide it for free to their women employees. Many who dislike the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and a majority of young Republicans in this survey dislike it \u2014 chose to focus on this part of the law.\n\nThe result is that birth control \u2014 and a woman's ability to plan for pregnancy \u2014 is the subject of extreme political speech instead of a quiet discussion between a woman and her doctor, as it should be.\n\nSusan Reimer's column appears on Mondays and Thursdays.
