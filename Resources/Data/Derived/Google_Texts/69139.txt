Hereâ€™s some good bar trivia: Washington D.C. was the hottest place in the United States for a few hours on Monday afternoon.

At noon, D.C. posted a temperature of 89 degrees, though it felt closer to 96 degrees when factoring in humidity.

The next-hottest city, Waycross, Ga., posted a temperature of 85 degrees.
