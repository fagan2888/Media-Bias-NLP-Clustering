Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has been ruffling feathers since his arrival in Washington this year. Including some on his own side of the aisle.

In fact, according to a new profile in GQ magazine, the Texas senator has earned the intense dislike of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)

“He f***ing hates Cruz,” an adviser to Sen. McCain told GQ’s Jason Zengerle. “He’s just offended by his style.”

But it appears that the contentious relationship cuts both ways. Cruz has his own words for the senior Arizona senator.

“I don’t know a conservative who didn’t feel embarrassed voting in 2006 or 2008,” Cruz said. “I think the Republican Party lost its way. We didn’t stand for the principles we’re supposed to believe in.”

Recall that McCain mocked Sens. Cruz and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) after the Kentucky senator’s 13-hour filibuster over the White House’s drone policy, referring to the two senators and those who agree with them as “wackobirds.”

More recently, McCain has criticized Cruz for his efforts to defund Obamacare, suggesting that attempts to do away with President Barack Obama’s health care law are “not rational.”

“I can tell you that in the U.S. Senate, will not repeal or defund Obamacare. We will not,” McCain told CNN. “And to think we can is not rational.”
