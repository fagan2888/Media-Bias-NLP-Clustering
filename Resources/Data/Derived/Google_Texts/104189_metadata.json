None,\u201d said Bacig, a University of Minnesota-Duluth professor in the program for 27 years.\n\nHLC president Barbara Gellman-Danley bent, but she didn\u2019t break on implementing the controversial accreditation rule in September 2017.\n\n\u201cNot to disappoint you, but we do not have the authority, as staff individuals, to walk out of here and change a policy,\u201d Gellman-Danley told the legislators and crowd. \u201cNot that I\u2019m suggesting we should. But I will tell you, we are here to hear what you have to say and share that information.\u201d\n\nThe largest of seven U.S. college accreditation organizations, HLC ensures instructional quality control by accrediting colleges and universities in 19 states, including Minnesota.\n\nNearly 25,000 Minnesota high school students earned more than 200,000 college credits in the dual enrollment courses in 2014, saving their families nearly $39 million in college tuition. Some 2,000 high school teachers trained by the University of Minnesota and state university system participate in the College in the Schools program.\n\n\u201cThese teachers are not professors, they are not asked to teach our entire curriculum,\u201d said Timothy Johnson, University of Minnesota distinguished professor of political science and law and longtime director of the department\u2019s CIS program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking them to teach one class, to teach it very well, and to do it both substantively, and pedagogically, to the highest level possible.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota Legislature has appropriated $8.6 million to fund the popular dual enrollment option. It\u2019s not clear how many Minnesota high school teachers fail to meet the standard. But a Minnesota Association of School Administrators survey found that just 33 of 193 high school teachers in 31 rural districts would qualify.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that your ruling does not take into account Minnesota\u2019s history of success, nor the stringent requirements that Minnesota has placed on its high school teachers teaching concurrent enrollment already,\u201d said Sen. Carla Nelson, R-Rochester.\n\nYet HLC maintains that 62 percent of high school teachers in the program nationwide already meet the requirement. Gellman-Danley put the onus on Minnesota colleges\u2019 and universities\u2019 apparent failure to flag the issue with high schools, leading up to the June decision to codify a long-standing expectation.\n\n\u201cWe wrote everybody in higher education, give us the input in the states, and we got the input,\u201d Gellman-Danley told legislators. \u201cAnd it\u2019s OK, but your communication was, let\u2019s say, louder after that implementation period, after it had been passed.\u201d\n\nSome participants suggested an exemption for Minnesota\u2019s teacher training programs, similar to teaching assistants at the college level. If not, teachers and students from around the state warned of a disproportionate impact on rural schools.\n\n\u201cPresently, Windom Area high school students are able to graduate with up to 43 college credits, which are currently being offered through seven of our faculty members,\u201d said Aniessa Sebring, a Windom Area High School math teacher without a master\u2019s degree. \u201cIf this proposal is upheld, it will allow our school to only offer eight college credits, and only one of our staff members would be able to teach classes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will graduate this spring with 31 college credits,\u201d said Natalie Resch, a Windom Area High School senior. \u201cThis will save my family approximately $15,000 just for my education.\u201d\n\nOne critic raised the specter of a congressional investigation. Yet a Twin Cities legislator warned his colleagues against piling on the HLC.\n\n\u201cWhether we like it or not, no matter what we pass, they [HLC] can do whatever they want,\u201d said Rep. Jason Isaacson, DFL-Little Canada. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to listen to us. So having an adversarial relationship with them does us no good.\u201d\n\nWhile holding firm on the 2017 deadline, HLC will work with colleges and universities rather than revoke accreditation. Gellman-Danley said the review process gives high schools and their higher education partners, effectively, twice as long to adapt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking everybody to say this is four years out, but that\u2019s a practical reality,\u201d Gellman-Danley said. \u201cIt can be four years out.\u201d\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Higher Learning Commission wants high school teachers offering college-level classes to get master\u2019s degrees.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Higher Learning Commission wants high school teachers offering college-level classes to get master\u2019s degrees.", "title": "Should Some High School Teachers Have to Have a Masters?
