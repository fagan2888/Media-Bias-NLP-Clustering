Kathie Lee Gifford expressed gratitude for the overwhelming support and condolences she has received over the loss of her husband as she returned to TODAY on Monday, her first time back as co-host since Frank Gifford’s death.

“I want to thank everybody for your love, and your texts and your tweets. Just the outpouring has been extraordinary,” she said. “It’s a heck of a way to find out how loved you are. Believe me, my family and I got great strength and comfort from it.”

Frank Gifford died on Aug. 9 from natural causes, and the tributes to the football legend have been “extraordinary,” said Kathie Lee, who said her husband would have loved each one.

“We laughed up to the very end. I just want everybody to know that this is a man who was at complete peace in his life,” she said. “He might have been the happiest, most content person in the world at this point in his life.”

Kathie Lee noted that Frank was born during the heart of the Great Depression and grew up in severe poverty, sometimes eating dog food as a child and “grateful to have it.” He lived in 29 places as a child as his father moved around looking for work.
