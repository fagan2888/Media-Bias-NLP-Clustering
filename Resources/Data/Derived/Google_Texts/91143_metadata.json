For example, Mercy Medical Center and UnityPoint Health-St. Luke's Hospital, both located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, have long relied on volunteers to keep their facilities running smoothly and to act as support systems for patients.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- see study announcement\n\n- read the study abstract\n\nRelated Articles\n\nVolunteers help hospitals improve the patient experience\n\nAdvisory councils help hospitals boost patient engagement, satisfaction\n\nComparative effectiveness needs patient perspective\n\n3 ways providers can drive patient engagement\n\nHow providers can engage, empower patients\n\nHospitals step up assessment, treatment of patients' emotional needs\n\nThe link between compassionate care and patient satisfaction", "article_metadata": {"description": "As hospitals across the United States compete to promote\u00a0patient-centered care, a new\u00a0study\u00a0by Johns Hopkins Medicine shows that simple steps such as proactive nursing rounds are among a handful of best practices that are most likely to give patients a positive hospital experience.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As hospitals across the United States compete to promote\u00a0patient-centered care, a new\u00a0study\u00a0by Johns Hopkins Medicine shows that simple steps such as proactive nursing rounds are among a handful of best practices that are most likely to give patients a positive hospital experience.", "title": "Proactive nurse rounds among the best practices in patient-centered care", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/proactive-nurse-rounds-among-best-practices-patient-centered-care/2015-08-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,johns hopkins,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Centered Care,Patient Experience,Patient Satisfaction,rounding", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "Patient-centered care includes everything from safer and timelier care to patient satisfaction with the level of attention and amenities.\nAs hospitals across the United States compete to promote patient-centered care, a new study by Johns Hopkins Medicine shows that simple steps such as proactive nursing rounds are among a handful of best practices that are most likely to give patients a positive hospital experience.\nThe study, published in the August issue of the journal Medical Care, was based on 52 responses to questionnaires and letters sent to CEOs and medical personnel of top-ranked or most improved hospitals for patient experience.\n\"Everyone involved at the hospital, all the way up to top leadership, has to place a high priority on the needs of patients and their families.\"\n\"It's not just about getting the physicians involved, or the nurses,\" said lead study author Hanan Aboumatar, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a member of the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality, in a statement."}
