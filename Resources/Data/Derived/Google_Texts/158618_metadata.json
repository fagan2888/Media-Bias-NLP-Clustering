Bulbs are your answer. Their trouble-free nature and early welcome of spring explains their popularity. No need to be an expert gardener, either: The few rules of selecting and planting are a snap. Purchase, dig, drop, water, and wait \u2014 that\u2019s bulb planting in a nutshell.\n\nBulbs are underground storage units for seasonal growth. All the nutrients the flowers require are stored neat and tidy in these small plant organs. The group of plants most gardeners collectively call \u201cbulbs\u201d also includes other categories \u2014 corms, tubers, rhizomes, and tuberous roots. They are further classified by their hardiness and time of bloom.\n\nSelection\n\nYou get what you pay for. Bargain bulbs won\u2019t give you the best display of bloom and years of enjoyment.\n\nLook for firm, plump, healthy bulbs in the garden center. They should feel solid when you handle them, with no soft spots or sour odors. It\u2019s OK if they have lost their papery cover.\n\nRead the package. If they are labeled \u201ctop size,\u201d then they are the largest commercially available size, producing more or bigger flowers, with \u201cwow\u201d factor. If you\u2019re naturalizing (planting in drifts so bulbs multiply), then it\u2019s economical to purchase smaller bulbs \u2014 they catch up in size in a season or two anyway. Some bulbs are just plain smaller to begin with, like Greek anemone (windflower), winter aconite (buttercup) and galanthus (snowdrops).\n\nIf purchasing by mail order, inspect upon arrival and plant soon. If you can\u2019t plant right away, put them in a dry spot (indoors, 40-50 degrees) with good air circulation and keep the bag open (mesh is best).\n\nLocation\n\nPlant where you can see them. Select a sunny location (but it doesn\u2019t have to be sunny all year). Under or near deciduous trees works fine. Avoid planting the earliest bloomers near walkways that get shoveled.\n\nSequence blooming from late winter through fall. Start out with snowdrops, aconites, scilla, crocus, dwarf iris and chionodoxa. Follow with daffodils, tulips, hyacinths and camissia. Tulips and daffodils have the broadest range of bloom times; look for early, mid or late varieties. Eremurus or foxtail lilies are head-turners, rising to 3 to 7 feet, blooming late spring to early summer. Include some of the showy flowering alliums that bloom mid to late summer along with dahlias, cannas, caladiums and gladiolas.

Winter flowering refers to bulbs forced to bloom out of season; they are planted for winter enjoyment \u2014 paper whites and amaryllis are the most common and easy to plant. With more planning and preparation tulips, crocus daffodils and hyacinths can be forced for your indoor centerpiece early next year if potted this fall.\n\nSome tulips only last a year or two, so they should be treated like annuals. Other types will perennialize and come back if they are happy in their location and not disturbed. Read the package or paperwork near the bin and look for these repeaters \u2014 species tulips, Kaufmannia or Greigii tulips, giant Darwin hybrid tulips and Fosteriana, also called Emperor tulips.\n\nWhy all the names for daffodils? The whole genus is Narcissus. Daffodil is the common name; they are larger-flowered. Jonquil is a species name within the genus, usually smaller and fragrant.\n\nBooks, magazines and online sources can elaborate on bulb design principles. They all say that more is better. Plant in masses or drifts through the perennial and shrub beds and rock gardens. You can play with varying heights adding depth and interest or plant a solid color and variety or repeat the bulbs and colors throughout the landscape. The only rule is to plant what you like and what reflects your style and expression.\n\nPlanting\n\nSeptember and October planting gives bulbs plenty of time to establish before the ground freezes. Some gardeners push it to November with good results, but that all depends on our weather and soil conditions (don\u2019t plant in frozen or wet soil).\n\nSoil preparation is important for bulbs. They want loose, amended, well-draining soil. Use a phosphorus or balanced fertilizer (5-10-5) in the planting hole. Bone meal isn\u2019t recommended unless you have soil pH that is under 7 \u2014 pH is determined by a soil test.\n\nYou don\u2019t need special tools. The basics work \u2014 trowel, garden fork or shovel. Bulb planters that cut round holes work best in loose soil, while bulb augur attachments for drills are effective for smaller bulbs. A dibble helps poke holes for little bulbs like crocuses.\n\nDepth is three to four times the height of the bulb, pointy side up. If in doubt on what side is up, lay on its side. Plant 2 inches deeper for sandy soils.\n\nFor large areas, plant lots of bulbs to make an impact. For ease of planting remove enough soil to accommodate all the bulbs. Add fertilizer and amendment in the entire area. Scatter the bulbs or place in groups, not in a perfect row.\n\nLabel your bulb plantings or make a drawing so you don\u2019t disturb the bulbs come spring.\n\nWater after planting and water through the fall and winter (every 3-4 weeks) if it\u2019s dry.\n\nMulch the bulbs with a 3-inch layer of organic matter after a hard frost to maintain moisture and prevent the soil from freeze/thaw cycles which can uproot the bulbs.\n\nSquirrels and mice like bulbs, especially tulips, crocus, lilies and chionodoxa, but not daffodils, hyacinths, alliums, puschkinias and fritillarias. Keep them away by enclosing bulbs with \u00bd-inch hardware cloth boxes or dip the bulbs in a liquid repellent product like Ropel before planting. Remove the scent of bulbs by cleaning up all shed papery skins.\n\nEdible Bulbs\n\nFall planted garlic generally yields larger bulbs due to the longer growing season. Try both hard-neck and soft-neck types for variety in taste. Once you grow your own garlic, you\u2019ll have planting stock for years to follow since you can your plant recently harvested bulbs. Check local garden centers or mail order for planting stock. Avoid planting garlic from grocery stores; many are treated with growth inhibitors to prolong storage.\n\nEach individual garlic clove on the bulb is planted (2-3 inches deep, 6 inches apart). The clove will grow into one full bulb when harvested next spring in late June or early July. Keep this easy math in mind when you order on line or purchase bulbs from a local garden center. You may only need one or two bulbs to plant.\n\nPlanting cloves in part shade is OK in the fall, just as long as the area starts getting more sun after the winter solstice. You can tuck them anywhere in the landscape if you have good soil, sun and no competition from other plant roots. Just remember where they are planted so you can water them through the winter.\n\nShallots have a mild onion flavor and are as easy to plant and grow as garlic, but fall plantings won\u2019t grow well in colder zones. Plant in Zone 5 or warmer, 1-2 inches deep, 6 inches apart.\n\nAfter planting, mulch both garlic and shallots with a 3-inch layer of shredded leaves (renew through the winter) and water if moisture or snow cover is scarce.\n\nDenver gardener Betty Cahill writes at http://gardenpunchlist .blogspot.com/", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "How to plant bulbs (and which to choose)", "title": "How to plant bulbs (and which to choose)", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/11/how-to-plant-bulbs-and-which-to-choose/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150911__20150912_C2_FE12AHBULBSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150911__20150912_C2_FE12AHBULBSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-11T17:34:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:49:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Once you grow your own garlic, you\u2019ll have planting stock for years to follow since you can your plant recently harvested bulbs.\nPurchase, dig, drop, water, and wait \u2014 that\u2019s bulb planting in a nutshell.\nAvoid planting garlic from grocery stores; many are treated with growth inhibitors to prolong storage.\nYou may only need one or two bulbs to plant.\nMore http://www.ext.colostate.edu/ptlk/1013.htmlFall bloomers are often forgotten but should be on more lists to plant in late summer \u2014 autumn crocus and colchicums."}
