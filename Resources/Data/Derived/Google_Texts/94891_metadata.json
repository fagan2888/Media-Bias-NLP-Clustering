But the biggest thing is that parents are serving their kids too much pizza,\u201d said Dr. William Dietz, one of the study\u2019s authors and the director of the Sumner Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University.\n\nThe researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which tracked the diets of more than 11,000 children and teenagers. Researchers gauged how many children eat pizza in the United States, how often they eat it, and how much they eat when they do.\n\nPizza, pretty alarmingly, is the second leading source of calories in the diets of America\u2019s children, trailing only grain desserts, such as cookies and other carb-laden sweets.\n\nOn any given day, roughly 20 percent of all children 2 to 11 and adolescents 12 to 19 eat pizza. And when they do, they eat a lot of it. On the days children eat pizza, they eat roughly 400 calories\u2019 worth, according to the study. For teenagers, it\u2019s upwards of 600 calories.\n\nAll that is pretty problematic, according to Dietz, largely because kids don\u2019t tend to balance out the pizza slices with salads, vegetables, and other more nutritional foodstuffs. Days on which children and teenagers eat pizza are not only associated with considerably higher intakes of both saturated fat and sodium, but also, quite simply, with more food: On average, children consume 84 extra calories on the days they eat pizza, while adolescents consume an extra 230 calories.\n\n\u201cWhen you eat extra calories and don\u2019t compensate for it at another point of the day or week, it can lead to weight gain and even obesity,\u201d Dietz said.\n\nThere is a silver lining. Pizza consumption is still too high by nutrition standards, but it\u2019s lower than it used to be. Consumption fell by roughly 25 percent between 2003 and 2010, according to the study. Much of that has dip has come at dinner time, where it\u2019s fallen by 40 percent for children and about 33 percent for teenagers.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the decline has come on the heels of a growing concern over obesity, especially among the country\u2019s youth, health narratives which demonize carb intake, or an organic shift away from pizza.\n\nBut the drop in pizza consumption, while significant, hasn\u2019t been big enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive trend,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not quite there yet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the appeal of pizza. It\u2019s cheap. Parents can buy a lot of pizza for not a lot of money, and serve what\u2019s left over later, spreading pies out over more than a single meal. It\u2019s convenient. You can buy pizza from a chain, a mom and pop store, or a grocery freezer. And it\u2019s universally loved. The estimated 3 billion pizzas eaten each year in the United States is a testament to the food\u2019s unparalleled popularity.\n\nGiven how much the country loves pizza, what\u2019s to be done? Dietz suggests smaller serving sizes and healthier toppings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not suggesting that kids avoid pizza altogether,\u201d said Dietz. \u201cBut when parents serve it it\u2019s important that they understand it\u2019s extremely caloric. They should serve smaller pizzas, or at least smaller slices. They might also want to serve it with vegetables instead of sausage on top.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/shutterstock_86172844.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf90c\"", "article_summary": "Researchers gauged how many children eat pizza in the United States, how often they eat it, and how much they eat when they do.\nOn the days children eat pizza, they eat roughly 400 calories\u2019 worth, according to the study.\nOn any given day, roughly 20 percent of all children 2 to 11 and adolescents 12 to 19 eat pizza.\nThe researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which tracked the diets of more than 11,000 children and teenagers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not suggesting that kids avoid pizza altogether,\u201d said Dietz."}
