But following the morning skate at the First Niagara Center, where Colorado will face the Buffalo Sabres on Friday night, Avs coach Patrick Roy said there is no time table for Varlamov\u2019s return to the lineup.\n\nVarlamov has missed 13 games over three stretches with the same injury.\n\nGametracker: Colorado Avalanche vs. Buffalo Sabres\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the opposite than the last time, which means he\u2019s going to be less on the ice, more in the gym,\u201d Roy said. \u201cLast time we did a lot of ice, not much gym. Now he\u2019s doing a lot in the gym and hopefully that will solve that problem.\u201d\n\nVarlamov\u2019s replacement, rookie Calvin Pickard, is definitely not a problem for the Avs. Following his 47-save, 1-0 overtime loss at Pittsburgh on Thursday, Pickard\u2019s goals-against average lowered to 2.27 (10th in the NHL) and his save percentage increased to .934 (third).\n\nBut as Roy previously said, Pickard will likely be returned to the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League when Varlamov is activated from injured reserve. The Avs want Pickard to continue to play, and not serve as Varlamov\u2019s backup.\n\nTOUT VIDEO: Semyon Varlamov at morning skate\n\nUnfortunately for Pickard, he might be spending the holidays in Cleveland, because he\u2019s exempt from the NHL roster freeze that began Friday night and continues to Dec. 27. Roy said his \u201cemergency call-up\u201d status could lead to his demotion to the minors.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not part of our objective as we speak,\u201d Roy said.\n\nThe Avs play at Detroit on Sunday and host St. Louis on Tuesday. After that, their next game is Dec. 27 against visiting Chicago, which could mark Varlamov\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cThe way Pickard has been playing, we don\u2019t feel the pressure to push on (Varlamov), and even if we felt the pressure of pushing on him, we would not,\u201d Roy said.\n\nBased on Roy\u2019s comments after the game in Pittsburgh, the Avs are not happy with the work ethic of third-string goalie Reto Berra, who is in the first year of a three-year contract extension paying him $1.45 million annually. Berra is not likely to take his salary to Lake Erie and, with Pickard/Varlamov as the big-league starters, he might only play in off-the-bench fashion.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche will continue to lean on goalie Calvin Pickard as Semyon Varlamov nears return", "title": "Avalanche will continue to lean on goalie Calvin Pickard as Semyon Varlamov nears return", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/avalanche-will-continue-to-lean-on-goalie-calvin-pickard-as-semyon-varlamov-nears-return/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141209__avs-pickardp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141209__avs-pickardp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T13:44:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:41:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3f6\"", "article_summary": "The Avs play at Detroit on Sunday and host St. Louis on Tuesday.\nBUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov again practiced with the team Saturday morning and appears close to returning from his latest groin injury.\nThe Avs want Pickard to continue to play, and not serve as Varlamov\u2019s backup.\nGametracker: Colorado Avalanche vs. Buffalo Sabres\u201cWe\u2019re doing the opposite than the last time, which means he\u2019s going to be less on the ice, more in the gym,\u201d Roy said.\nNow he\u2019s doing a lot in the gym and hopefully that will solve that problem.\u201dVarlamov\u2019s replacement, rookie Calvin Pickard, is definitely not a problem for the Avs."}
