His theme was social progress through government action. \u201cWhat President Johnson understood was that equality required more than the absence of oppression,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt required the presence of economic opportunity. . . . A decent job, decent wages, health care \u2014 those, too, were civil rights worth fighting for. . . . He understood that government had a role to play in broadening prosperity for all those who would strive for it.\u201d\n\nThe summit also marked the beginning of a string of semi-centennial commemorations of Johnson\u2019s legislative achievements. The events will rehabilitate LBJ\u2019s image in the coming years and present him as a champion of progress and social justice \u2014 equal rights for black Americans, economic relief for the nation\u2019s poor.\n\nThe purpose of such an image for LBJ would be to supplant his better-known reputation as the president who escalated the war in Vietnam and declined to seek a second term. But now, as NPR plainly declared, \u201cthere\u2019s an effort underway to reassess the 36th President of the United States and to put some of the focus back on an issue that improved the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nThat effort, it turns out, is largely one of the media themselves. In \u201cHow LBJ Saved the Civil Rights Act,\u201d a long piece for The Atlantic, Michael O\u2019Donnell casts Johnson as the tireless and courageous hero of the bill: \u201cDays after Kennedy\u2019s murder, Johnson displayed the type of leadership on civil rights that his predecessor lacked and that the other branches could not possibly match.

Kevin Williamson outraged liberal media in a 2012 piece in which he attacked \u201cthe popular but indefensible belief that the two major U.S. political parties somehow \u2018switched places\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis protecting the rights of black Americans, a development believed to be roughly concurrent with the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the rise of Richard Nixon.\u201d Williamson contended that LBJ\u2019s motive for championing civil rights wasn\u2019t to fulfill the founding creed but to reorganize the Democratic party\u2019s political base.)\n\nBut the point of the LBJ celebrations this year and next is not to canonize Johnson as defender of black Americans.

In his remarks at the summit Tuesday, Jimmy Carter lamented that \u201cwe\u2019re pretty much dormant now. We accept self-congratulations about the wonderful 50th anniversary \u2014 which is wonderful \u2014 but we feel like Lyndon Johnson did it and we don\u2019t have to do anything anymore.\u201d The feeling was echoed by Representative John Lewis (D., Ga.), a veteran of the civil-rights movement, who scolded today\u2019s youth for their lack of concern. \u201cYou\u2019re just too quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to make some noise.\u201d\n\nBut noise about what, exactly? A perusal of the summit\u2019s program offers some clues, with panel discussions on whether gay marriage is a civil right, whether amnesty for illegal immigrants is a civil right, and where the struggle for women\u2019s rights now stands (\u201cWomen: How High Is the Glass Ceiling?\u201d). From that, one could be forgiven for having the impression that the current struggle for civil rights is primarily about expanding the definition of rights, recasting them as government-conferred benefits, and pushing for more-robust federal action to secure them. As the president said, it\u2019s not enough anymore to have an absence of oppression; we must be doing something to make Americans more equal, to create an economy in which \u201csuccess is shared.\u201d\n\nIn its defense of the Affordable Care Act, the White House has lately been employing the rhetoric of civil rights and equality rather heavy-handedly. On April 1, the administration announced that 7.1 million people had enrolled in health coverage through the exchanges, exceeding the goal set by the Congressional Budget Office for the six-month enrollment period. In his remarks, the president not only declared the repeal debate to be over but also implied that the health-care law is now part of the long and inexorable progress of civil rights. \u201cIn the end, history is not kind to those who would deny Americans their basic economic security,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody remembers well those who stand in the way of America\u2019s progress or our people.

In this reading of Johnson\u2019s legacy, to oppose the current administration\u2019s policy agenda \u2014 whether it be ACA subsidies or a higher minimum wage \u2014 is retrograde and pessimistic. At worst, it might even be oppressive, but it\u2019s at least lazy and unambitious. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps easy to conclude that there are limits to change . . . and we\u2019d be better off if we roll back big chunks of LBJ\u2019s legacy, or at least if we don\u2019t invest too much of our hope in our government,\u201d the president said Thursday. \u201cI reject such thinking.\u201d\n\nAnd little wonder. Trusting government to solve big problems, to make progress, has been the cornerstone of the Obama administration\u2019s domestic agenda. The president\u2019s insistence on progress via government power is a glimpse of the teleological conundrum of modern progressivism: One can never stop because the work is never done. No matter how close to that Hegelian end point you get, you never quite get there \u2014 which means, practically speaking, that you can never stop enlarging the power and scope of government as the primary means to achieve equality and social justice.\n\nIt also means we\u2019re going to be hearing a lot about LBJ for the next couple of years.\n\n\u2014 John Daniel Davidson is a senior health-care-policy analyst at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and a 2013 Lincoln Fellow of the Claremont Institute.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "LBJ & Civil Rights, Revised", "sailthru.author": "John Daniel Davidson", "description": "On Thursday in Austin, Texas, President Obama delivered the keynote address at the LBJ Presidential Library\u2019s Civil Rights Summit marking the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Johnson \u201cgrasped like few others the power of government to bring about change,\u201d the president said.\n\nWith the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Great Society, LBJ tried to use that power for good. In this reading of Johnson\u2019s legacy, to oppose the current administration\u2019s policy agenda \u2014 whether it be ACA subsidies or a higher minimum wage \u2014 is retrograde and pessimistic. At worst, it might even be oppressive, but it\u2019s at least lazy and unambitious. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps easy to conclude that there are limits to change\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and we\u2019d be better off if we roll back big chunks of LBJ\u2019s legacy, or at least if we don\u2019t invest too much of our hope in our government,\u201d the president said Thursday. \u201cI reject such thinking.\u201d\n\nAnd little wonder. Trusting government to solve big problems, to make progress, has been the cornerstone of the Obama administration\u2019s domestic agenda. The president\u2019s insistence on progress via government power is a glimpse of the teleological conundrum of modern progressivism: One can never stop because the work is never done. No matter how close to that Hegelian end point you get, you never quite get there \u2014 which means, practically speaking, that you can never stop enlarging the power and scope of government as the primary means to achieve equality and social justice.\n\nIt also means we\u2019re going to be hearing a lot about LBJ for the next couple of years.\n\n\u2014 John Daniel Davidson is a senior health-care-policy analyst at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and a 2013 Lincoln Fellow of the Claremont Institute.", "card": "summary", "title": "LBJ & Civil Rights, Revised, by John Daniel Davidson, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Fri, 2014-04-11 04:00", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "LBJ & Civil Rights, Revised", "keywords": "John Daniel Davidson", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "LBJ & Civil Rights, Revised, John Daniel Davidson, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "John Daniel Davidson, Politics, Nation, World"}, "article_summary": "And that\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act represents.\u201dThat\u2019s also, presumably, what the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act and the Great Society programs represent.\n\u201cWhat President Johnson understood was that equality required more than the absence of oppression,\u201d the president said.\nA decent job, decent wages, health care \u2014 those, too, were civil rights worth fighting for.\nWith the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Great Society, LBJ tried to use that power for good.\nWhether it\u2019s increasing the minimum wage, combating income inequality, or passing immigration reform, contemporary progressives consistently tie their legislative agenda to a narrative about the struggle for civil rights."}
