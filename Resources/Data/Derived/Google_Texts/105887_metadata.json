Those would be the still missing back-end systems, but this report flagged by Jeryl from Houston suggests that it might not make much difference. Novitas, which provides the payment systems for Medicare, is so far behind in its payments to one Houston hospital that its employees have stopped getting paid. ABC\u2019s local affiliate reports on the situation:\n\nDozens of employees at a hospital in northeast Houston have had to make it through the holidays without getting paid for weeks. The CEO of Saint Anthony\u2019s Hospital on Little York is blaming a new Medicare payment contractor for his payroll problems. Nearly 150 employees, ranging from doctors to nurses and administrators, haven\u2019t been paid in nearly a month, and the CEO says it\u2019s not his fault. \u2026 The hospital is strapped for cash not because its not making money, but because Leday says a new Medicare payment facilitator named Novitas Solutions is taking too way long to pay out Medicare claims to the hospital. Leday says he\u2019s owed nearly $3 million in payments from Medicare and can\u2019t make payroll.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that problems have arisen in Novitas\u2019 payment systems, Jeryl reminds us:\n\nNovitas also runs the south-central region\u2019s Medicare website which was launched just two days before the October 1 launch of Healthcare.gov. As THE WEEKLY STANDARD reported on December 19, that site has experienced problems reminiscent of Healthcare.gov\u2019s troubles, and the site will not be fully operational until well into 2014.\n\nThe White House keeps insisting that their ObamaCare system has just experienced \u201cglitches,\u201d which will all get smoothed out shortly. However, the Medicare system used to be able to pay providers until Novitas got involved, and it\u2019s possible that the hospital might have to cease operations for lack of staff. They certainly might choose not to accept Medicare assignments in the future, and I doubt that the issue is limited to St. Anthony\u2019s in Houston.\n\nJust imagine what will happen when Novitas brings its payment-systems expertise to private insurers looking for subsidies to cover premiums for ObamaCare enrollees. Will insurers wait weeks and months to get those premiums \u2014 or will they dump their enrollees for non-payment? Stay tuned.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The wages of incompetence.", "title": "Video: Healthcare.gov contractor forcing hospital to miss payroll \u2014 for weeks", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/02/video-healthcare-gov-contractor-forcing-hospital-to-miss-payroll-for-weeks/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-02T13:31:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-02T13:12:42+00:00"}, "keywords": "Medicare, Novitas, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ae6\"", "article_summary": "The CEO of Saint Anthony\u2019s Hospital on Little York is blaming a new Medicare payment contractor for his payroll problems.\nNovitas, which provides the payment systems for Medicare, is so far behind in its payments to one Houston hospital that its employees have stopped getting paid.\nThose would be the still missing back-end systems, but this report flagged by Jeryl from Houston suggests that it might not make much difference.\nABC\u2019s local affiliate reports on the situation:Dozens of employees at a hospital in northeast Houston have had to make it through the holidays without getting paid for weeks.\nNearly 150 employees, ranging from doctors to nurses and administrators, haven\u2019t been paid in nearly a month, and the CEO says it\u2019s not his fault."}
