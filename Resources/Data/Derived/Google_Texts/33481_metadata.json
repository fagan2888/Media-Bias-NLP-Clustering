The co-host of \"Fox & Friends\" is leaving the Fox News morning show to spend more time with her three children, the AP reports.\n\nThe conservative former co-host of \"The View\" will remain on the Fox set through December 22, three days before Christmas. She initially joined Fox in September of 2013.\n\nWe here at The New Civil Rights Movement will miss Hasselbeck, and thank her for providing us with a wealth of material with which to push back against her conservative agenda \u2013 or just plain ignorance \u2013 along with some surprising moments of support for equality. But mostly for the former.\n\nIt was just one year ago that Hasselbeck and Fox sent out this tweet...\n\n2014 has been a year full of things we don\u2019t want to see in the New Year. What are YOU over? Comment with #OverIt2014 pic.twitter.com/FjE8C989d3 \u2014 FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) December 30, 2014\n\n...which of course all but implored others to adopt the #OverIt2014 hashtag for far more interesting uses, like this:\n\nOver .@FoxNews pretending to be a \"news organization\" and not a racist sexist homophobic xenophobic conservative PR machinery. #OverIt2014 \u2014 shubhankar.c (@monkeypreneur) December 31, 2014\n\nSurprisingly, we owe Hasselbeck thanks for voicing support of same-sex marriage way back in 2010, and for transgender kids in 2012. Thank you, Elisabeth.\n\nWe'll miss French TV mocking Fox News' \"Barbie and Ken\" for false reporting on Paris.\n\nWe won't miss Hasselbeck's claim that Obamacare is causing \"many\" pregnant elderly women to lose their doctors, or her insistence that there be a citizenship test voters must pass before they can be allowed to vote.\n\nWe will miss Hasselbeck slamming Bristol Palin for attacking President Obama's comments supporting same-sex marriage, and for slamming Michele Bachmann for basically dismissing an 8-year old over same-sex marriage.\n\nBut we won't miss Hasselbeck laughing at the suggestion the message of the video showing Ray Rice assaulting his then-fianc\u00e9 is \"take the stairs.\"\n\nOr that calling out racists \"undermines racism.\" Or asking if making anti-gay bakers obey the law really is \"freedom?\"\n\nYes, it's been a wild ride, but Elisabeth Hasselbeck at least has given us the opportunity to expose lies and falsehoods and ridiculous ways of thinking. And for all that, and more we sincerely say thanks, Elisabeth, and best of luck.\n\nImage via FOX & Friends/Twitter", "article_metadata": {"Description": "After just two years, Elisabeth Hasselbeck is leaving Fox News' \"Fox & Friends.\" Here's why, and a look back...", "Title": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck Quits Fox News", "csrf-token": "QTKlvXXJcRLRtDGYnCQ9ZNqZAa9HR4vZHYvtHdz6w+U=", "twitter": {"description": "After just two years, Elisabeth Hasselbeck is leaving Fox News'", "creator": "davidbadash", "image": {"src": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thenewcivilrightsmovement/pages/14916/meta_images/original/fox_overit_2a.jpg?1448308610"}, "title": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck Quits Fox News", "site": "@newcivilrights", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The New Civil Rights Movement", "description": "After just two years, Elisabeth Hasselbeck is leaving Fox News' \"Fox & Friends.\" Here's why, and a look back...", "title": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck Quits Fox News", "url": "http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/elisabeth_hasselbeck_quits_fox_news", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thenewcivilrightsmovement/pages/14916/meta_images/original/fox_overit_2a.jpg?1448308610", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "jP8OBaknsLrLrUReRa1iFj24dVZU6CQhTstvxQf6Mo8", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After just two years, Elisabeth Hasselbeck is leaving Fox News' \"Fox & Friends.\"\nThe co-host of \"Fox & Friends\" is leaving the Fox News morning show to spend more time with her three children, the AP reports.\nHere's why, and a look back...Change the conversation, change the worldShare thisSaturday Night Live won't have Elisabeth Hasselbeck to mock for much longer.\nYes, it's been a wild ride, but Elisabeth Hasselbeck at least has given us the opportunity to expose lies and falsehoods and ridiculous ways of thinking.\nBut we won't miss Hasselbeck laughing at the suggestion the message of the video showing Ray Rice assaulting his then-fianc\u00e9 is \"take the stairs.\""}
