Vending machines spit out all kinds of crazy items these days from cupcakes and live crabs to lettuce and mashed potatoes, but a new vending machine in Tennessee may top them all.

The five-story, glass vending machine in Nashville dispenses used cars from online auto retailer Carvana. The company rolled out a smaller and less stunning model in Atlanta in 2013, and it plans to expand the concept to other cities, according to a report in The Tennessean.

Customers who have selected a vehicle online to test-drive or purchase place an oversized coin into the machine. It begins to spin before grabbing the car and delivering it to the consumer.

While it may sound gimmicky, the online process cuts down on labor and real estate costs at the dealership, saving car buyers more than $1,500 per vehicle, Carvana co-founder Ryan Keeton told The Tennessean. Customers also have the option of having the car delivered to them.

“I think what we’re trying to create is a fun way to pick up your car that is also metaphorically representative of what we are as a brand,” he told the paper. “It’s fun, it’s easy, it’s automated, and the customer is in control.”

Carvana has promised $200 to out-of-town customers for airfare and transportation to and from the vending machine.

While the vending machine may be grabbing headlines, Carvana’s primary business model allows customers to quickly and easily purchase used vehicles online. The site promises that users can complete a purchase within half an hour.
