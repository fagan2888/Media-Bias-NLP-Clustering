That is only possible here,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\nFiorina said the American people feel they are losing their sense of \u201climitless possibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we lose that sense of limitless possibility, we are losing the core of who we are,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\nShe said that America is in desperate need of \u201ccitizenship and leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am reminded when I think about our federal government, I am reminded of the difference between management and leadership,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\nManagers are people who do the best they can within the existing system. There are managers in business, there are managers in politics, and there are managers in life. They do they best they can within the existing system.

And now we need the leadership and the citizenship to reimagine our government.\n\n\u201cAll of our problems are solvable,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of our wounds are self-inflicted. We have everything that we need because all we need is citizenship and leadership,\u201d she continued.\n\nFiorina cited the scandal at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs hospital as an example of broken government, calling it a \u201cstain on our nation\u2019s honor.\u201d\n\nAsked by an audience member what sets her apart from her GOP rivals, Fiorina cited \u201cexecutive decision making,\u201d which she described as \u201cmaking tough calls in tough times, with high stakes for which you\u2019re prepared to be held accountable,\u201d and her track record as CEO of a $90 billion business.\n\n\u201cAnd I look a little different, too,\u201d she joked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina said America is in need of leaders rather than managers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina said America is in need of leaders rather than managers.", "title": "Former CEO Carly Fiorina Says America Needs a Leader", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150418_CarlyFiorina.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1G6jBD9"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina said America is in need of leaders rather than managers.", "title": "Former CEO Carly Fiorina Says America Needs a Leader", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150418_CarlyFiorina.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-04-18T22:28:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Carly Fiorina, New Hampshire, 2016, GOP, first in the nation, fitn"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3684\"", "article_summary": "Leaders, leaders are people who do not accept what is broken just because it\u2019s been that way for a very long time.\nNASHUA, N.H.\u2014Former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina said America is in need of leaders rather than managers during a speech at the First in the Nation Summit in New Hampshire today.\nShe said that America is in desperate need of \u201ccitizenship and leadership.\u201d\u201cI am reminded when I think about our federal government, I am reminded of the difference between management and leadership,\u201d Fiorina said.\nWe have everything that we need because all we need is citizenship and leadership,\u201d she continued.\nThere are managers in business, there are managers in politics, and there are managers in life."}
