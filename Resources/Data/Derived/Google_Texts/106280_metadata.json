The National Safety Council puts the annual price tag of these accidents at some $4 billion \u2014 and that\u2019s before you and me have to start paying for all these people\u2019s Obamacare.\n\nTragically, the rates of death and injury are even higher among Hispanics, according to the government, especially those newly arrived who do not speak English and, for some reason, cannot obtain legal drivers licenses.\n\nThese harrowing figures do not include horrific accidents like the one that left Jill Tarlov brain dead in Central Park while shopping for a birthday present for her daughter.\n\nSEE ALSO: Onerous ATF rules threaten to put gun dealers out of business\n\nSpeed demon bicyclist Jason Marshall described the bike-on-pedestrian collision as \u201can unavoidable accident.\u201d\n\nYes, unavoidable if you are whistling along at a murderer\u2019s clip in the wrong lane riding a racing bike with triathlon-style \u201caerobars\u201d described in local press accounts as \u201cbrakeless.\u201d Yes, in that case, it is probably safe to call such a horrific accident \u201cunavoidable.\u201d\n\nThe woman should have known better, right?\n\nAnd witnesses reported that Mr. Marshall heroically shouted, \u201cGet out of the way! Get out of the way!\u201d before plowing into Ms. Tarlov, according to local press accounts.\n\nNow, I am honestly torn about whether or not it is time for the government to finally to ban bicycles for good.\n\nFull Disclosure: I do not currently own a bicycle. But that is because I live in a city where I am stripped of my Constitutional right to bear arms and as a result am unable to protect my property.\n\nOver the past decade, I have lost count of the number of bikes that have been stolen from my front yard, off my front porch, out of my garage and even out of my locked back-courtyard.\n\nBut I digress. We are talking about bicycle control, not guns.\n\nOf course, bike rights are not specifically protected under the Constitution, but surely that is only because the Founders had not yet thought of them. I don\u2019t even think they had the unicycle back then, which, by the way, is one of the most dangerous of all the cycles.\n\nAs a rule, I don\u2019t usually favor government solutions to human errors, but something must be done about these reckless lunatics on their wicked fast bikes whipping through traffic, pedestrians and strollers at breakneck speeds killing innocent people.\n\nMaking the speed fiends even more loathsome is their sense of entitlement to the roads, sidewalks, medians \u2014 really any place they wish to kill people. And screaming \u201cGet out of the way!\u201d does not win you any responsible citizenship awards.\n\nAnd worse, still, is the fact that these cycling chain menaces are fueled by a false sense of self-worth that they are somehow saving the planet by not driving cars.\n\nLook, I get it. Bikes don\u2019t kill people. People kill people. Which reminds me of a few good slogans bike enthusiast might find useful during this debate.\n\n\u201cBikes save lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen bikes are outlawed, only outlaws will have bikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBike control is having both hands on the handlebars.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf God did not make men equal, Ignaz Schwinn did.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnforce the bike laws already on the books!\u201d\n\nAnd, my absolute favorite: \u201cAll my bikes combined have killed fewer people than Ted Kennedy\u2019s car.\u201d\n\nExcept, I can\u2019t be sure of that any more since all my bikes have been stolen and who knows who is riding them these days.\n\nIf only the government hadn\u2019t taken away my right to have a gun.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com, or on Twitter at @charleshurt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the senseless killing of a mother walking through Central Park last week by a madman on a bicycle, it is high time that society take a hard look at what is sure to be a thorny issue: Is it finally time to ban bikes once and for all?", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With the senseless killing of a mother walking through Central Park last week by a madman on a bicycle, it is high time that society take a hard look at what is sure to be a thorny issue: Is it finally time to ban bikes once and for all?", "title": "HURT: It\u2019s time for bicycle sense in America", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/23/hurt-its-time-for-bicycle-sense-in-america/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/16/bicycle-buffer-zonesjpeg-0c25c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/16/bicycle-buffer-zonesjpeg-0c25c.jpg", "description": "With the senseless killing of a mother walking through Central Park last week by a madman on a bicycle, it is high time that society take a hard look at what is sure to be a thorny issue: Is it finall", "card": "summary", "title": "HURT: It\u2019s time for bicycle sense in America"}, "Author": "Charles Hurt", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Bikes don\u2019t kill people.\nGet out of the way!\u201d before plowing into Ms. Tarlov, according to local press accounts.\nMaking the speed fiends even more loathsome is their sense of entitlement to the roads, sidewalks, medians \u2014 really any place they wish to kill people.\n\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com, or on Twitter at @charleshurt.\nFull Disclosure: I do not currently own a bicycle."}
