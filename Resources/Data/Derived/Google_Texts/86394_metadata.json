God is present. God is with us. God shows up\u2014not with a parade but with the whimper of a baby, not among the powerful but among the marginalized, not to the demanding but to the humble. From Advent to Easter, the story of Jesus should teach us that God doesn\u2019t need a mention in our pledge or on our money or over the loudspeaker at the mall to be present, and when we fight like spoiled children to \u201ckeep\u201d God in those things, we are fighting for idols. We\u2019re chasing wind.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 42 percent of Americans said they wanted stores to greet customers with \"Merry Christmas,\" while 46 percent said it doesn't matter. About 12 percent preferred \"Happy Holidays.\"\n\nHuffington Post's Executive Editor Rev. Paul Raushenbush suggested that the rise of \"Happy Holidays\" reflects a willingness to embrace America's increasing diversity.\n\nFor a long, long time Christianity was dominant in the United States and represented the civic religion of the country. But America is about the people who are here now, and that is a much more diverse group. And that's good! It is time to stop insisting that everything revolves around us. Instead, let's join the wider circle of the many traditions that make up our country. Besides, any Christian knows that Christmas is not about displays in shopping malls, or capitols, or schools, it is about a spiritual event that we honor most in our families and our homes.\n\nChristmas in Bethlehem Christmas in Bethlehem\n\n1 of 21 Mideast Israel Palestinians Christmas Greek Orthodox priests take part in the Christian Orthodox Christmas Eve celebrations at the Church of the Nativity, traditionally believed by Christians to be the birthplace of Jesus Christ, in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Monday, Jan. 6, 2014.(AP Photo/Nasser Nasser) Share this slide:\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s that time again.\n\nLast week, Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-12-09 14:07:54 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "It\u2019s that time again.\n\nLast week, Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly", "title": "Are You Being Persecuted This Christmas?
