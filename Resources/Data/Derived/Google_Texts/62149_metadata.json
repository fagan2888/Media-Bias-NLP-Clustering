Rick Scott. After spending more than $70 million of his own money in 2010, Scott\u2019s re-election effort could reportedly top $100 million.\n\nFormer Gov. Charlie Crist, the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic nomination \u2013 though he previously served in the office as a Republican \u2013 aims to keep up as best he can.\n\nCrist has been raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars in the two months since launching his campaign, much of which is coming from health-care and law-related donors.\n\nBut with such vast sums piling up on both sides, what\u2019s in it for the candidates, exactly?\n\nFlorida\u2018s chief executive office only pays $130,000 a year, so it can\u2019t be the paycheck.\n\n\u201cFrom an economic perspective, it\u2019s irrational,\u201d Sean D. Foreman, former president of the Florida Political Science Association, told Watchdog.org.\n\nAccording to records from the Florida Department of Management Services, Scott isn\u2019t remotely interested in directly recouping his political investment from taxpayers. His official salary is just 12-cents a year. You read it right: 12-cents a year.\n\n\u201cSome people get involved for the power or the prestige, but others get involved to shape policy to fit their own ideology,\u201d Foreman said. \u201cScott probably feels that rather than spend his money backing other candidates, he should take a shot himself.\u201d\n\nTo that end, the expensive gamble has paid off. The wealthy pro-business Republican rode a tea party wave to victory by opposing the Affordable Care Act, and has since implemented a low-tax, economic growth agenda centered on jobs.\n\nNow, Scott wants another four years to remake Florida in his image. And he\u2019s willing to dig deep into his own pockets to do it, spending roughly $38 per vote to match his former winning total of 2.6 million.\n\nCrist, on the other hand, will be spending other people\u2019s money.\n\n\u201cCrist doesn\u2019t have great wealth but has the ability to raise money because people have confidence that he\u2019s a vessel to invest in to carry forth their own political agendas,\u201d Foreman said.\n\nOnce a Republican, then independent and now Democrat, Crist is professing political convictions contrary to those on which he previously campaigned .\n\nStill, most candidates win by spending other peoples\u2019 money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\u201cMost candidates, according to our data, don\u2019t spend large sums of their own money, although there are certainly exceptions,\u201d said Russ Choma, an investigative reporter with the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nOnly a few self-financed candidates have scored high office in recent years, Florida\u2019s Scott and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg are two.\n\nBut there are other reasons why some seek relatively low paying political jobs.\n\n\u201c\u2026 The benefits of the job go way beyond salary,\u201d Dean Stansel, Associate Professor of Economics at Florida Gulf Coast University told Watchdog.org. \u201cIn addition to fringe benefits, for some people there\u2019s also a large benefit to being in a position of authority\u201d.\n\nThat includes being in the spotlight, Stansel said. \u201cIt makes them feel more important.\u201d\n\nCampaign cash aside, to win elections candidates need votes, which is something Florida tea party groups say could be a problem for the incumbent Scott, despite his vast wealth and willingness to spend lavishly on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cOverall, Scott has worked out pretty well for Florida,\u201d Paula Helton, an activist with the Gainesville Tea Party, told Watchdog.org. \u201cBut we\u2019re not as enthusiastic as we were in 2010.\u201d\n\nHelton points to Scott\u2019s embrace of the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act as a major betrayal. It ranks right up there with the lack of access granted to tea party groups once Scott was elected by a 1.2 percent margin, she said.\n\n\u201cWe feel shut out, and he can\u2019t win without us, \u201d said Helton. \u201cWe vote, we get others to vote, and we do it with very little money. (Scott\u2019s) money can\u2019t win an election by itself.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Scott\u2019s $100 million campaign pledge, Helton was unimpressed.\n\n\u201cThat seems like a low figure for important elections these days,\u201d she said.\n\nContact William Patrick at wpatrick@watchdog.org or follow Florida Watchdog on Twitter at @watchdogfla Like Watchdog.org?
