The two companies expect to report top-line pharmacokinetic, safety, and biomarker data by the fourth quarter and believe CR845 could address a large pain market where prescription abuse remains a large concern.\n\nNow what: While moving forward with any compound is a positive for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, we should also keep a number of things in context. First, the initial results from oral CR845 were extremely early stage. Even when we get additional data by the fourth-quarter it's going to be geared more toward biomarkers and safety than actual pain-reducing efficacy. In other words, it's probably not a good idea to get too excited about its potential just yet.\n\nAlso, investors should consider that Cara's pipeline isn't particularly deep. The company anticipates initiating a phase 3 registration trial for CR845 in IV form as a treatment for post-operative pain this year, just began dosing CR845 in tablet form for acute and chronic pain, and is testing CR701, a chronic pain compound in preclinical studies. That is the entire scope of Cara's current pipeline, yet the company is nearing a $400 million valuation. With the Food and Drug Administration so particular about pain med abuse potential I would much rather avoid a company like Cara until it has a product on pharmacy shelves and steady revenue streaming in.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:38", "description": "Cara Therapeutics shares soar after providing an update on an early-stage study for its lead compound, CR845.
