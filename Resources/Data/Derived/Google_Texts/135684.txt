Santa Barbara-based Beneflex Insurance Services recently acquired Newbury Park-based Insurance Dimensions.

Beneflex helps small- and medium-sized companies in the tri-county region navigate Affordable Care Act compliance and other issues regarding employee benefits. It acquired Insurance Dimensions on Oct. 1 to increase its client base throughout Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and benefit from owner/operator Aline Roberts’ 30-plus years of experience, the company announced on Nov. 9.

“Aline (Roberts) has achieved her success through strong client partnerships, outstanding customer care and exemplary advisory services, which makes her a perfect fit for Beneflex,” Beneflex CEO Dan Cattaneo said in a statement.

Insurance Dimensions will continue its operations in Newbury Park in addition to the Beneflex corporate office in Santa Barbara.

Beneflex’s revenue grew 96 percent between 2009 and 2012, to $3.2 million in 2012. That landed the company at No. 3317 on the Inc. 5000’s list of fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. in 2013.
