A new poll reports that 70 percent of Americans expressed outright anger at the direction the country is headed and 53 percent don’t think President Obama is doing his job satisfactorily.

According to the CNN/ORC poll:

30 percent of Americans are “very angry” about the way things are going in the country.

38 percent are “somewhat angry” about the way things are going in the country.

Just under a third of those polled expressed “no anger” at all.

According to CNN polling director Keating Holland, the number of “very angry” Americans is in line with the 2010 mood of the nation just before Republicans regained control of the House.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds similar sentiments among likely voters.

Via The Washington Post:

Six in 10 say they cannot trust the government in Washington to do what is right — the same as a year ago in the aftermath of the government shutdown and the botched rollout of the federal Web site for the Affordable Care Act. With multiple crises confronting the country — including the spread of Ebola in West Africa and cases here at home, as well as threats from Islamic State militants — a majority now says the government’s ability to deal with big problems has declined in the past few years. Among those who say this, more — by 3 to 1 — blame Obama and the Democrats rather than Republicans in Congress.

That’s good news for a GOP looking for a net gain of six seats needed to control the Senate following the 2014 midterms.
