PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — The head of Independence Blue Cross is moving up, taking over as Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Dan Hilferty will spend two years as Chairman of the Board overseeing the 36 different Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies across the country. He says those companies provide health insurance for one third of all Americans, so he’ll have a big part in possible changes that may be made to the Affordable Care Act, or Obama Care.

“It needs to be tweaked at the very least as we move along, in my role as Chairman of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. I’ll have the opportunity to lead that effort, to have input with the current administration, the next administration, congress and other policy makes across the country.”

The last time the Chairman of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Board of Directors was from Philadelphia was in the 90’s.
