However practical, the pastor\u2019s goal ran up against a town\u2019s strict limitations on the size of signs, the number that can be posted and for how long.\n\nThe town officials of Gilbert, Ariz., however, don\u2019t impose those same restrictions on political and ideological messages or on signs put up by homeowner associations.\n\nOn one hand, it\u2019s a small-town dispute over signage. On the other, the squabble raises a concerning question: Does government have the right to censor the type of content citizens promote?\n\nThat question warrants the attention of the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Reed v. Town of Gilbert.\n\nGood News Presbyterian Church rents space in various places for weekly services in Gilbert. Because the church changes locations regularly, Pastor Clyde Reed promotes his services with cardboard signs posted on the lawn of the latest site.\n\nReed must adhere to Gilbert\u2019s sign regulations, which the town says were designed to promote \u201coptimum conditions for serving sign owners\u2019 needs and respecting their rights to identification while balancing the aesthetic interests of the community.\u201d\n\nUnder the town\u2019s sign code, residents can post an unlimited number of political signs up to 32 square feet in size. Signs with ideological messages can be up to 20 square feet, displayed indefinitely and unlimited in number.\n\nThe church\u2019s signs, along with signs for other non-profit, event-related activities can be only six square feet in size, displayed for no more than 14 hours and are limited to four per property.\n\nThe town says it intended these restrictions to provide churches and other non-profits with a reasonable window to direct the community to and from their events.\n\nBut for Reed, the limitations mean he can\u2019t begin advertising a 10 a.m. service until 8 p.m. the night before. By then, it\u2019s dark, and the chances of residents seeing his signs are slim.\n\nReed\u2019s lawyer, David Cortman, is affiliated with Alliance Defending Freedom, an organization that seeks to protect the religious rights of individuals. Cortman says the town\u2019s sign code is a form of discrimination that allows the government to decide what speech is more valuable and thus granted greater protection under the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cSpeech discrimination is speech discrimination.\u201d -David Cortman, @AllianceDefends\n\n\u201cSpeech discrimination is speech discrimination,\u201d Cortman says in a press release on the case. \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be permitted to place severe restrictions on religious speech while allowing greater exposure for the speech of others in similar circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview with The Daily Signal, Michael Hamblin, a lawyer for the town of Gilbert, dismisses the accusation. Hamblin says the town\u2019s restrictions don\u2019t violate the First Amendment, pointing to a key difference:\n\nPolitical signs are allowed to be in the right-of-way longer, and that\u2019s by state law. Those are encouraging people to vote. This sign is not general advertising; it\u2019s directions for a particular event.\n\nHamblin says he is confident the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the town, as did the District Court of Arizona and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. But, he adds, \u201ceven if it doesn\u2019t, the town will be happy to receive any guidance that the Supreme Court has.\u201d\n\nCortman will make oral arguments for Reed and his church before the Supreme Court, Jan. 12, in Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The pastor of this church thinks town officials are imposing tougher requirements on him than on politicians and others that use temporary signs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The pastor of this church thinks town officials are imposing tougher requirements on him than on politicians and others that use temporary signs.", "title": "How a Sign Dispute Made It All the Way to the Supreme Court", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141218_GoodNewsChurch.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-26T02:11:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1wijD2L"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The pastor of this church thinks town officials are imposing tougher requirements on him than on politicians and others that use temporary signs.", "title": "How a Sign Dispute Made It All the Way to the Supreme Court", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141218_GoodNewsChurch.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "founding principles,religious liberty", "published_time": "2014-12-24T03:01:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-26T02:11:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "gilbert, supreme court, supreme court 2015, reed. v town of gilbert, pastor reed, Good News Church"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6a4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSpeech discrimination is speech discrimination.\u201d -David Cortman, @AllianceDefends\u201cSpeech discrimination is speech discrimination,\u201d Cortman says in a press release on the case.\nHamblin says he is confident the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the town, as did the District Court of Arizona and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThat question warrants the attention of the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Reed v.
