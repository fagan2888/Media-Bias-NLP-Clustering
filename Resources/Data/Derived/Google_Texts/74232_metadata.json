The minority leader, Congressman Bob Michel of Illinois, although popular, was far less strident than Gingrich.\n\nGingrich crafted a plan to take over the House of Representatives in the next election \u2014 1994 \u2014 around a very clear \u201cContract with America.\u201d\n\nGingrich won, and history was changed forever. Clinton fought back behind the vitriolic counter attacks against Gingrich by Louisiana lawyer and lobbyist James Carville, equally vitriolic.\n\nThe nastiness goes on, some 20 years later.\n\nCan civility and bipartisanship be re-found today? The answer is yes, but it will take leadership from both parties \u2014 and yes, even fringe \u201cparties\u201d like the tea party and its counterparts on the left.\n\nThere have been examples of leadership since 1994, but most of it has hardly been discernible.\n\nFormer U. S. Sen. Richard Lugar, a proven Republican conservative from Indiana, offered to work with President Obama on selected legislation but was quickly targeted by the tea party and lost re-election.\n\nArch-conservative Orrin Hatch, the senior Republican senator from Utah, reached across the aisle to help his longtime friend, Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, with problems of a personal nature and was criticized by some in his party.\n\nAnd during the height of bickering about the Affordable Care Act, veteran Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine sent positive signals to both sides about the need for cooperation and bipartisanship.\n\nCloser to home, former U.S. Sen. and Florida Gov. Bob Graham has teamed up with an equally outstanding politician \u2014 conservative Republican Lou Frey of Orlando \u2014 to create an initiative to \u201cre-create\u201d civility and bipartisanship in Florida and across the country.\n\nThe national Concord Coalition has been doing the same thing with modest success to date.\n\nRecently, an \u201codd couple\u201d if there ever was one \u2014 former President Clinton and former President George W. Bush \u2014 created a project to train new leaders, with an emphasis on civility and bipartisanship.\n\nWill it work?\n\nNot for some time, and not unless bold and courageous leaders among all the parties step forward in support.\n\nRobert W.
