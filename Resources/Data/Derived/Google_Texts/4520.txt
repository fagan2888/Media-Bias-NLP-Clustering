More importantly, in a year when terrorism and Middle East conflict are major campaign issues, it is bad political strategy and bad policy to shun a former admiral who was in charge of the Navy's counterterrorism unit and commanded an aircraft carrier battle group in the Persian Gulf after 9/11. As Republican presidential candidates make bellicose demands for carpet-bombing and the use of torture, Sestak can show why such positions harm our standing in the world and support our enemies.

Finally, Sestak knows how to be a leader. Democrats in Congress could use effective leaders.

McGinty would build on Obama's gains

As a teenager in 2008, I was inspired by then-Sen. Barack Obama's message of hope and change. I stepped up to join his presidential campaign then and again in 2012, reenergized by his tireless efforts to bring our country out of the Great Recession and to expand Americans' access to health care.

Last week, Obama and Vice President Biden announced their support for Katie McGinty for Senate. Biden said her voice "is sorely needed . . . to advocate for equal pay for women, a raise in the minimum wage, college affordability, and a quality education for every child."

The stakes are too high to sit out this race. This year's election will give Pennsylvanians a critical opportunity to pick a senator who will put the needs of hardworking residents above all else.

There is no endorsement I respect more than that of Obama. We deserve a leader who will defend and build on the work of our president and vice president to expand opportunity.
