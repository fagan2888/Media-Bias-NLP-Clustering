(Photo: .)\n\nHealth plans that offer coverage of doctors and hospitals outside the plan\u2019s network are getting harder to find on the insurance marketplaces, according to two analyses published last week.\n\nTwo-thirds of the 131 carriers that offered silver-level preferred provider organization plans in 2015 will either drop them entirely or offer fewer of them in January, an analysis by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found. Those cutbacks will affect customers in 37 states, including Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, according to the foundation.\n\nBut the analysis shows the impact will be strongest in Indiana, where they will be no preferred provider organization plans (PPOs). The effects will be less pronounced in Ohio and Kentucky, where the number of PPOs will drop by roughly a quarter, according to the analysis.\n\nSilver plans pay 70 percent of medical costs, on average, and consumers pay 30 percent. They are the most popular plan sold on the marketplaces.\n\nPPOs typically offer coverage for doctors and hospitals that aren\u2019t in the plan\u2019s network, but require consumers to pay a larger share of the cost. In contrast, health maintenance organizations, which make up roughly half of the plans offered on the exchanges, generally don\u2019t cover any care provided outside the plan\u2019s network. Other types of policies, such as point-of-service and exclusive provider organization plans, make up a relatively small proportion of plans sold on the marketplace.\n\nAnother analysis by Avalere Health of the 37 states that use the federal marketplace also documented a steady decline in PPO plans. In 2014, the year the exchanges began operation, 39 percent of plans on the federal marketplace were PPOs. In 2015, the figure dropped to 35 percent, and next year will decline again, to 27 percent.\n\nResearch has shown that low premiums are the number one priority for consumers when they\u2019re shopping for plans on the marketplace.\n\nEven so, \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for consumers to know what, if any, access they have to providers outside the network,\u201d says Katherine Hempstead, who directs the Johnson foundation\u2019s research on health insurance coverage.\n\nLast year, many insurers shrunk the networks of providers in the plans that they sold on the marketplace. However, even if the networks were narrow, most people who shopped for marketplace plans had access to PPO plans with some level of out-of-network coverage if they wanted it. Only New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia had no PPO plans available in 2015, according to the Johnson foundation.\n\nIts state-by-state analysis only tracks what happened to existing PPO plans and doesn\u2019t take into account new carriers that may offer new PPOs next year. Their numbers don\u2019t appear to be significant, Hempstead says.\n\nNext year, unless new insurance carriers pick up the slack, in at least a half-dozen states (including Indiana) there may be no silver-level PPO plans available on the marketplace, according to the study.\n\nKaiser\u2019s Michelle Andrews was the lead reporter for this story.\n\nABOUT KAISER\n\n.
