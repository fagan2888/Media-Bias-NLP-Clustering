They are focused on cutting through the cloud of distortion perpetuated by the Culture of Death.\n\nPro-abortion radicals on the other hand have been trying to challenge these laws in the courts and the court of public opinion to no avail. Now they are attempting to eviscerate these pro-life laws with one piece of federal pro-abortion legislation, S.B. 1696.\n\nThe stated purposed of this extremist pro-abortion legislation is to \u201cput an end to these restrictions.\u201d It specifically states that it would apply to all laws or regulations enacted before or after this bill passed at any level of government. In other words, it would put an end to pro-life laws at both the federal and state levels.\n\nProponents of this legislation testified today before the Senate Judiciary Committee that this bill would strike down over 200 pro-life laws. 200 pro-life laws is a conservative estimate. When looking at the specific provisions of this law it could nearly eviscerate all pro-life laws around the country \u2013 laws that are saving the lives of mothers and babies alike.\n\nIf passed, this new measure would give legal cover to deadly abortionists like Kermit Gosnell. Gosnell was convicted of monstrously murdering babies born alive after botched abortions and contributing to the death of women through his unsanitary and dangerous moneymaking abortion \u201cpractice\u201d.\n\nUnder the deceptive cloak of \u201cWomen\u2019s Health Protection,\u201d this legislation would do anything but. As my ACLJ colleague David French so aptly noted, this legislation should be more appropriately named \u201cThe Kermit Gosnell Enabling Act of 2014.\u201d\n\nEach provision of this proposed legislation is an abortion lobbyist\u2019s dream and opens up a Pandora\u2019s Box of deadly pro-abortion public policy, giving abortionists an endless ability to challenge any restriction on their cash-cow industry. Make no mistake. This bill has little to do with women and everything to do with protecting abortionists and the abortion industry while undercutting nearly every pro-life gain made across the nation in recent years.\n\nThis bill is chock-full of pro-abortion code words and euphemisms to hide its true intent but has enough legal teeth to do real damage in court. It deserves to be unpacked line by line in plain English.\n\nIt literally lists a plethora of pro-life laws (both federal and state) that would be categorically deemed \u201cunlawful\u201d if this legislation passed.\n\nFirst, the bill lists a number of specific types of laws that would be banned: 1) laws that require abortionists to follow \u201cspecific medical procedures\u201d; 2) any \u201climitation\u201d on an abortionist \u201cdelegat[ing] tasks\u201d to non-medical personnel; 3) any \u201climitation\u201d on abortionists proscribing dangerous drugs to be administered without supervision; 4) any \u201climitation\u201d on an abortionist\u2019s ability to \u201cprovide abortion services via telemedicine\u201d; 5) any regulation of an abortionist\u2019s office, equipment, or staff, and any requirement that an abortionist have hospital admitting privileges at a nearby hospital should something go wrong while committing an abortion; 6) any laws that require ultrasounds or other medically informative tests before an abortion, or any law that requires a waiting period between visits to obtain an abortion; OR 7) essentially any regulation of the \u201ctraining\u201d required for committing an abortion.\n\nBanning any regulation of abortion by \u201ctelemedicine,\u201d literally phoning it in, is supposed to protect women\u2019s health? That\u2019s asinine.\n\nYet this laundry list of specific laws is not the heart of the bill. The bill\u2019s nuclear provision would eviscerate nearly every remaining pro-life law regarding abortion on the books at the federal, state, or local level.\n\nThe law would make essentially any restriction on abortion illegal if it \u201csingles out abortion services\u201d or makes \u201cabortion services more difficult to access.\u201d In other words, if a law lists abortion among things to be regulated or even if it doesn\u2019t mention it but the language of the law could somehow be construed to limit abortion, that law would be stricken from the books.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t broad enough, the law goes on to provide an unbelievably expansive definition of what it means to make abortion \u201cmore difficult to access.\u201d Any regulation of abortion would be considered making it \u201cmore difficult to access,\u201d and thus an unlawful restriction, if it: A) \u201cinterferes\u201d with how the individual abortionist feels is best to commit the abortion (not generally accepted medical practice, but that abortionist\u2019s own subjective opinion); B) causes any \u201cdelay\u201d in obtaining the abortion (not excessive delay, any delay); C) could potentially \u201cincrease\u201d the cost of abortion or require \u201ctravel, childcare, or time off work\u201d; D) might require extra office visits; E) could lead to the closing of any abortion clinics in the State; F) imposes abortion related criminal or civil penalties (i.e. any laws aimed at making what Gosnell did killing babies born alive after botched abortions illegal would be unlawful); OR G) makes abortion \u201cmore difficult to access,\u201d not just by itself, but as a \u201ccumulative impact\u201d when \u201ccombined\u201d with other regulations.\n\nIf these overly broad and near categorical ban on any limitations whatsoever on abortions weren\u2019t enough for the pro-abortion proponents of the bill, there are a few more specific targets of this legislation. It would make unlawful: 1) any ban on abortion, for any reason, prior to \u201cfetal viability\u201d (as determined by the individual abortionist committing the abortion, not an objective medical definition); 2) any ban post viability when, in the opinion of the individual abortionist committing the abortion (not generally accepted medical opinion, but the opinion of that abortionist), it would effect the life or \u201chealth\u201d of the mother, including psychological health (i.e. abortion code for any reason whatsoever); 3) any \u201crestriction\u201d that would limit the ability to obtain an \u201cimmediate abortion\u201d when the particular abortionist committing the abortion feels it would pose a risk to the \u201chealth\u201d of the mother to wait (again \u201chealth\u201d meaning any reason whatsoever); OR 4) any restriction on sex selection, race selection, or other forms of discriminatory abortions.\n\nA note on \u201chealth\u201d exceptions: this phrase is commonly used by pro-abortion proponents not as one might naturally think of as health, physical health, but as a massively vague and expansive definition of health including psychological health, essentially allowing doctors to claim that if the woman would be sad or not like the way her body feels during a pregnancy that that would constitute a \u201chealth\u201d issue. Further, the determination of \u201chealth\u201d is left to the subjective whim of each individual abortionist and not a matter of accepted medical opinion. Thus, there would basically be no limit on abortion that could withstand scrutiny.\n\nAccording to the bill\u2019s own language the only abortion related laws in the county not impacted by this legislation are \u201claws regulating physical access to clinic entrances, requirements for parental consent or notification before a minor may obtain an abortion, insurance coverage of abortion, or [the federal ban on partial-birth abortion].\u201d But the bill goes on to specifically state that \u201cCongress should address [these] through separate legislation.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to mitigate negative reaction to this radical measure, proponents of this legislation may attempt to point to language in the bill allowing restrictions of abortion if they are similar to those imposed on other \u201cmedically comparable procedures.\u201d Yet, the abortion industry has essentially cordoned off abortion from every other regulated area of medicine, claiming that it is different than other procedures. It\u2019s a misnomer; there is no similar medical procedure \u2013 no other medical procedure that terminates life. Despite this language, the bill would clearly ban all pro-life laws that require abortion clinics to comply with regulations of surgical medical centers. This then becomes an essentially meaningless phrase by the plain meaning of the rest of the bill.\n\nFinally, the only exception or defense that could save any of these pro-life laws is to prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d (an unbelievably high legal standard) that the law \u201csignificantly advances\u201d the safety of abortion or women\u2019s health and that that advance cannot be achieved by a less restrictive means, giving abortion on demand without apology the highest protected status in constitutional law \u2013 a fundamental right \u2013 something that even the most liberal interpretation of Roe v. Wade does not achieve. While the proponents of this measure claim they are merely codifying the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions regarding limitations on abortion, this is nothing but a boldfaced lie.\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly and specifically held that states not only have an interest in protecting women\u2019s health but also have an interest in protecting the lives of the unborn.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Roe itself stated:\n\nWe repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches term and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes \u201ccompelling.\u201d\n\nThis legislation ignores and would obliterate the \u201canother important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life\u201d language as if it never existed, drastically altering the current state of abortion jurisprudence and ushering in a brave new world of unregulated abortion practice in America.\n\nThis is dangerous, deceptive, and deadly.\n\nThis disastrous bill should have no chance of passing Congress. Even the pro-abortion U.S. Senate knows better than to try something this extreme. If and when this receives a vote in the Senate, we\u2019ll be watching to see which members, especially those who claim to be pro-life or at least not pro-abortion, vote for this radical advancement of the Culture of Death.\n\nThey will be held accountable to America\u2019s pro-life majority.\n\nThis article is crossposted on Red State.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ)", "language": "en-us", "og": {"site_name": "American Center for Law and Justice", "description": "Over the past few years, numerous states have followed the will of the people to increase protections for women and unborn children by enacting...", "title": "Extreme Pro-Abortion Senate Bill Would Eviscerate Over 200 Pro-Life Laws in America | American Center for Law and Justice", "url": "http://aclj.org/obamacare/extreme-pro-abortion-senate-bill-would-eviscerate-over-200-pro-life-laws-in-america", "image": "http://media.aclj.org/fs/rtxx0l6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@aclj", "image": {"src": "https://7676076fde29cb34e26d-759f611b127203e9f2a0021aa1b7da05.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/fs/rtxx0l6.jpg"}, "description": "Over the past few years, numerous states have followed the will of the people to increase protections for women and unborn children by enacting...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Extreme Pro-Abortion Senate Bill Would Eviscerate Over 200 Pro-Life Laws in America | American Center for Law and Justice"}, "google-translate-customization": "b9e3cfed32f5d748-542d1652bc3059d9-gd4d1c5bb4fc58f82-8", "revisit-after": "1 day", "article": {"section": "ObamaCare", "published_time": "2014-07-15T21:27:52.000Z"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "description": "Over the past few years, numerous states have followed the will of the people to increase protections for women and unborn children by enacting..."}, "article_summary": "Now they are attempting to eviscerate these pro-life laws with one piece of federal pro-abortion legislation, S.B.\nProponents of this legislation testified today before the Senate Judiciary Committee that this bill would strike down over 200 pro-life laws.\nThese pro-life laws are aimed at limiting unregulated and dangerous abortions and ensuring that unborn children are given even a fighting chance at life.\n200 pro-life laws is a conservative estimate.\nIn other words, it would put an end to pro-life laws at both the federal and state levels."}
