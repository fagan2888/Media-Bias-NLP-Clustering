The Bill of the Century is the title of Clay Risen\u2019s smart and stirring new history of the struggle to pass it, and one can\u2019t really argue with that.\n\nYet the law\u2019s significance lies as much in the battles that were waged over whether and how to enforce it as in the ways it changed American society for the better. In 1964, James J. Kilpatrick, a popular syndicated columnist, declared in National Review, \u201cThis precious right to discriminate underlies our entire political and economic system\u201d and warned of perils to come. Fierce opposition to implementing the CRA was largely responsible for Lester Maddox\u2019s election as governor of Georgia in 1966 and for George Wallace\u2019s capture of 46 electoral votes two years later. Meanwhile, millions of whites from Southern and border states moved away from cities lest they and their children have to share public spaces and schools with black people.\n\nAll over the country, flashpoints emerged over Title VII of the Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on race, religion, sex, or national origin. Right after the law was passed, as Nancy MacLean describes in her indispensable book, Freedom Is Not Enough, workers of different races and both genders began putting it to the test. Grievances from black painters, Mexican-American postal workers, and white airline stewardesses flooded into the offices of the new Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which the 1964 Act had created. During the EEOC\u2019s first year, women lodged more complaints related the \u201closs of jobs due to marriage or pregnancy\u201d than to any other issue related to sex discrimination (as it was then called). The National Organization for Women, founded in 1966, first made a name for itself when it petitioned the EEOC to ban want ads segregated by gender.\n\nTitle VII also enabled federal courts and politicians to claim that \u201caffirmative action\u201d\u2014a term JFK first used in a March 1961 speech\u2014was needed to redress historic inequalities. Anxiety over quotas, set-asides, and preferences burned through the rest of the twentieth century, fueling the triumphs of conservatives like Ronald Reagan and Jesse Helms, who maintained they were just forms of \u201creverse discrimination.\u201d Nevertheless, affirmative action gradually opened up jobs in the professions and better-paid crafts to individuals from \u201cprotected groups\u201d who seldom had been able to gain them before.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "It was what came after that changed everything", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "It was the battles that came after it that really defined its impact.", "title": "The Civil Rights Act Was Not As Important As You Think", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2b51bd8f6d3feaa29390d301dc9e4518115089c1.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/116563/civil-rights-act-was-less-important-what-came-after", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2b51bd8f6d3feaa29390d301dc9e4518115089c1.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "The Civil Rights Act Was Not As Important As You Think", "description": "It was the battles that came after it that really defined its impact.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/2b51bd8f6d3feaa29390d301dc9e4518115089c1.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Civil Rights Act Was Not As Important As You Think\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/116563/civil-rights-act-was-less-important-what-came-after\",\"section\":\"Milestones\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-11T18:12:47.000Z\",\"post_id\":116563,\"author\":\"Michael Kazin\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Milestones\",\"Politics\",\"Culture\",\"Civil Rights Act\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Milestones", "published_time": "2014-02-11"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8f8\"", "article_summary": "The Civil Rights Act was the most important legal step to combat inequality taken in the United States since the three Reconstruction amendments were added to the Constitution in the 1860s.\nTitle VII also enabled federal courts and politicians to claim that \u201caffirmative action\u201d\u2014a term JFK first used in a March 1961 speech\u2014was needed to redress historic inequalities.\nAll over the country, flashpoints emerged over Title VII of the Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on race, religion, sex, or national origin.\nGrievances from black painters, Mexican-American postal workers, and white airline stewardesses flooded into the offices of the new Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which the 1964 Act had created.\nThe National Organization for Women, founded in 1966, first made a name for itself when it petitioned the EEOC to ban want ads segregated by gender."}
