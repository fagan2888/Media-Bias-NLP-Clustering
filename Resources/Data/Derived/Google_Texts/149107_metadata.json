The fund is supposed to be used when employees, like border patrol agents, work overtime to respond to emergencies, according to a new report by the Office of Special Counsel which was submitted to the White House and Congress.\n\nThe OSC called the abuse a \u201cprofound and entrenched problem\u201d within the department and said it found that six different offices had abused the fund including four within Customs and Border Protection, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe abuse is so typical that whistleblowers say some employees routinely claim more than their \u201cstraight eight,\u201d with two hours of overtime every day. Some employees have used the fund to boost their pay by up to 25 percent each year without actually working overtime. Government managers even use the \u201ccandy bowl\u201d as a perk to recruit new employees.\n\nRELATED: AGENCY WORKERS BILL TAXPAYERS FOR BMWs\n\n\u201cThese are not border patrol guys chasing bad guys who can\u2019t stop what they are doing and fill out paperwork for overtime. We are not questioning that,\u201d Caroly Lerner, special counsel at the OSC told The Post. \u201cThese are employees sitting at their desks, collecting overtime because it\u2019s become a culturally acceptable practice.\u201d\n\nOne of the whistleblowers that sparked the investigation, Jose Rafael Ducos Bello, a former supervisor for Customs and Border Protection, told The Post that he thinks at least 27 employees at the Commissioner\u2019s Situation Room within the CBP, increased their pay by a collective $696,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pickpocketing Uncle Sam,\u201d Ducos Bello said. \u201cEmployees will sit at their desks for an extra two hours, catching up on Netflix, talking to friends or using it for commuting time.\u201d\n\nIn response to the report, DHS officials said that abuse of the funds would not be tolerated and they are ordering a department-wide review of how the funds are used.\n\n\u201cDHS takes seriously its responsibility to ensure proper use of taxpayer funds,\u201d said spokesman Peter Boogaard said in a statement. \u201cWhile many frontline officers and agents across the department require work hour flexibility, often through the use of Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (AUO), misuse of these funds is not tolerated.\u201d\n\nRELATED: GOVERNMENT WASTES MORE THAN YOU THINK\n\nHowever, the same problem was uncovered five years ago when two CBP offices in Washington State were taking unearned money from the fund. At the time, the agency had assured the special council\u2019s office that it would end the abuse.\n\n\"The lack of progress in implementing plans first outlined five years ago raises questions about the agency\u2019s willingness or ability to confront this important problem,\u201d Lerner said in a letter to the White House on Thursday.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only abuse of taxpayer dollars discovered at the DHS.\n\nEarlier reports show a spate of abuses that have undermined the trust taxpayers have in the department, which has wasted millions of dollars.\n\nHere is just a sample of the abuses:\n\nHomeland Security Spent $700,000 on Useless Software\n\nDHS Still Doesn\u2019t Have Oversight Over Its Border Security Program\n\n$4.5 million FEMA Contracts Were Questionably Spent\n\nDHS to Spend $300 Million on Troubled Radiation Detectors\n\nAgency Spends Millions Purging Fake Cyber Threat\n\nTSA Wasted $1 Billion on Screening Program", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DHS workers have stolen about $8.7 million in unearned overtime every year.", "title": "DHS Workers Pocket $8.7M of Unearned Overtime a Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/01/DHS-Workers-Pocket-87-M-Unearned-Overtime-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/2533099_HiRes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/01/DHS-Workers-Pocket-87-M-Unearned-Overtime-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/2533099_HiRes.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DHS workers have stolen about $8.7 million in unearned overtime every year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Workers have stolen about $8.7 million from it each year by claiming unearned overtime from the Administratively Uncontrolled Overtime fund.\nSome employees have used the fund to boost their pay by up to 25 percent each year without actually working overtime.\n\u201cDHS takes seriously its responsibility to ensure proper use of taxpayer funds,\u201d said spokesman Peter Boogaard said in a statement.\nThe abuse is so typical that whistleblowers say some employees routinely claim more than their \u201cstraight eight,\u201d with two hours of overtime every day.\nRELATED: AGENCY WORKERS BILL TAXPAYERS FOR BMWs\u201cThese are not border patrol guys chasing bad guys who can\u2019t stop what they are doing and fill out paperwork for overtime."}
