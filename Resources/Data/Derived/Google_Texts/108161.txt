The township’s school district has failed its own report card, passing only two of five components considered important for successful classrooms, according to a state review.

The state Department of Education graded Lakewood, which is overseen by a state monitor, with scores of 60 percent in instruction and programs, 48 percent in fiscal management and 44 percent in governance.

A score of 80 percent in the Quality Single Accountability Continuum, or QSAC, is the threshold that separates high-performing schools from districts that must plan for and implement improvement efforts, said Rich Vespucci, a DOE spokesman.

“QSAC reports are important because they give a clear picture on how well schools are following state and federal education laws and regulations on a daily basis,” Vespucci said.

Lakewood received scores of 85 percent in operations and 80 percent in personnel as part of the evaluation, conducted during the 2013-14 school year, according to the findings.

Superintendent Laura Winters said she and a team of administrators, teachers and Board of Education members are working on developing a plan that will identify strategies for meeting requirements, identify who will be responsible for accomplishing the actions and list the evidence the district will use to evaluate how well it is doing. The findings, however unimpressive, actually reflect some improvement.

Lakewood’s score of 60 percent in instruction and programs is actually an improvement from the 2010-11 school year, when it received a score of 46 percent, Vespucci said.

“The District Improvement Plan will be submitted to the Department of Education for review after the Feb. 11, 2015, Board of Education meeting,” Winters said. She provided no further details.

Board of Education President Ada Gonzalez could not be reached for comment.

In April, the state appointed a fiscal monitor, Michael Azzara, to Lakewood. The district avoided the grounds for a state takeover. In a district with a state monitor, a takeover is possible if there are scores below 50 percent in the four categories besides fiscal management, according to state documents.

The state conducts the test every three years, Vespucci said.

Lakewood’s 2013-14 results are down from the 2010-11 school year in several categories: the district previously received a 88 percent score in fiscal management and a 67 percent score in governance, Vespucci said.

The district’s performance in the QSAC examination is expected to be reviewed during the Board of Education’s meeting at 7:30 p.m. today at Lakewood High School, 855 Somerset Ave.
