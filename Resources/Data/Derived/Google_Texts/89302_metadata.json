Bloomberg News\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center\u2018s Commission on Political Reform has spent the past year assembling a \u201cblueprint\u201d for electoral changes and congressional reforms to encourage greater citizen engagement in the political process.\n\nIt should, however, be no surprise that a report from a Washington organization headed by former members of Congress would take a decidedly insider view of what needs to be done to reform our politics and would offer, by its own admission, only \u201cincremental\u201d reforms.\n\nThe most detailed part of the plan deals with congressional rules changes. The suggestions may be a step in the right direction\u2013former Senate majority leaders Trent Lott and Tom Daschle wrote about some of their proposals here Tuesday\u2013but very few would engage or even interest the average voter.\n\nThe central problem with the commission\u2019s tepid recommendations is evident in the name of the report: a \u201cBipartisan Blueprint to Strengthen Our Democracy.\u201d That leaves out the 40% of voters who don\u2019t identify with either major party. A far more apt name for what\u2019s needed to reform our political process would be a Non-Partisan Agenda for Political Transformation.\n\nMost of the people who participated in this effort are former Republican and Democratic officeholders and staff members who have thrived in the current system. But most Americans think the two parties and Washington\u2019s insider culture are responsible for our political dysfunction. The latest Gallup poll found Congress\u2019s approval rating at a measly 7%.\n\nHere is one example of where Tuesday\u2019s report gets it wrong: In calling for redistricting reform to address gerrymandered, uncompetitive legislative districts, the report says \u201ca good redistricting process is one that has the support of the legislators and voters of both parties.\u201d\n\nMost voters would say a good redistricting process takes power away from partisan politicians interested in ensuring their own reelection and gives it to Republican, Democratic and independent voters. The successful California Citizens Redistricting Commission is an example of such an effort, adopted through a ballot initiative, not by the legislature.\n\nTo be fair, the Bipartisan Policy Center has some good proposals, including adopting open primaries for all registered voters, eliminating caucuses and conventions to select candidates, expanding voter access through online voter registration, and extending early voting in all states.\n\nBut in too many instances the recommendations exclude or dismiss the concerns of the very voters the project aimed to engage in the political process.\n\nLinda Killian is a journalist and a senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center.
