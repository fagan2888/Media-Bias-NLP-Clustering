It is a busy one.\n\nPresident Obama heads to New York on Tuesday morning to address world leaders just hours after opening a new front in the war against Islamic extremists with an aerial barrage in Syria. But unlike with previous armed conflicts, he will be seeking support, not permission. (Russia would say no, anyway.)\n\nThe president stayed out of sight on Monday night even as the Pentagon confirmed the first strikes inside Syria against the terrorist group known as the Islamic State. He had told the nation in a speech Sept. 10 that he had authorized such strikes, but he left it to military commanders to decide when and where to open the air campaign. The White House said only that he was kept updated on the operation.\n\nSo his trip to New York for three days of meetings with presidents and prime ministers at the United Nations General Assembly meeting will present Mr. Obama with his first chance to talk publicly about the airstrikes.\n\nThe president will in effect be presenting his peers with a fait accompli and asking them to individually stand by his decision, even though he does not have an invitation from Syria\u2019s government to use force inside its borders against the terrorist group.\n\nWhile in New York, Mr. Obama will also seek to pass a Security Council resolution calling on all nations to prosecute those who travel abroad to join terrorist organizations or help finance them. And he will meet with Haider al-Abadi, the new Iraqi prime minister, whom Mr. Obama hopes to make a strong ally in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nNew Scrutiny for the Secret Service\n\nThe Secret Service is about to experience some of the toughest questioning it has ever faced in the wake of Friday\u2019s White House breach. Its director, Julia Pierson, is scrambling to defend her agency \u2014 and her own performance.\n\nIn an exclusive interview to be published later Tuesday, Ms. Pierson describes the mood Sunday night as 700 agents and officers gathered in New York to prepare for the start of the United Nations General Assembly meeting. It had been just two days since an intruder jumped the White House fence and got through the North Portico doors before being tackled.\n\nShe said she urged her employees to ignore second-guessing from critics: \u201cWe need to be fully vigilant professionals, although we are in the media again.\u201d She exhorted them to \u201cmake sure we\u2019re focused.\u201d\n\nBut will she be able to hold off calls for changes in practices and personnel? A string of controversies (some involving agents and prostitutes) and security lapses has exposed the Secret Service to withering criticism. And Friday\u2019s fence-jumper could produce calls for more sweeping changes. Already, a House hearing into the matter has been set for next Tuesday.\n\nRepresentative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, promises to be rigorous. \u201cWe have a lot of good men and women, but their leadership has some serious questions to answer,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the last five years or so, their luster of elite protection has lost its shine.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael S. Schmidt\n\nU.S. Plans for Climate Change, With No Guarantees\n\nAt 1 p.m. before the United Nations on Tuesday, President Obama will present his blueprints for confronting climate change.\n\nBut as he nears the twilight of his term, a reality is sinking in. Most of the work will have to be done by Mr. Obama\u2019s successor. Or maybe the president after that. Or the president 20 years from now.\n\nAnd there is also no guarantee that what the administration proposes Tuesday will be enacted, given a reluctant Congress, or that what is enacted will be enough to hold off the worst climate changes.\n\nGina McCarthy, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will be front and center at the gathering. She will not only be traveling to New York with the president, but will also be sitting directly behind him as he addresses world leaders. In the face of a resistant Congress, Mr. Obama has used the agency to push through new policies, including a sweeping effort to curtail coal.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cThis is not a talking point,\u201d said Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the E.P.A. \u201cThe U.S. is using the E.P.A. to show its leadership internationally.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Coral Davenport\n\nWhat We\u2019re Watching Today\n\nJeb Bush may be mulling a run for president in 2016, but for the moment he\u2019s trying to get Republican candidates for the Senate elected. On Tuesday night, he\u2019ll headline a big-ticket fund-raiser for Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, Dan Sullivan and Monica Wehby in Tampa, Fla., paying a favor to some potential political allies.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has waned as a campaign issue, but HealthCare.gov is being overhauled, and a new enrollment season is on the horizon. At 1:35 p.m., Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell will share the latest on the law in a speech at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe Clinton watch continues. Curious what matters to Chelsea Clinton when it comes to measuring economic prosperity? At 9:30 a.m., she\u2019ll be moderating a conversation on the subject at the Clinton Global Initiative conference in New York.\n\nTales of the House Supply Closet: \u2018The Tie of Shame\u2019\n\nThe two ugliest ties in Washington are stored in a House supply closet with markers, Post-it notes and VHS cassettes of past proceedings.\n\n\u201cI like to call the pink one \u2018the tie of shame,\u2019 \u201d said Laura Reed.\n\nOver the years, Ms. Reed and her colleagues at the House Press Gallery have lent the silk ties out to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of reporters who have lacked the appropriate attire to chat with members in the Speaker\u2019s Lobby downstairs. Often the reporters ask if there are other options. There are not.\n\nThe Eagle brand pink tie has a kaleidoscope pattern and is mottled with blue cornflowers and a stain that could be chocolate, salsa or dried blood. (\u201cThat\u2019s new,\u201d observed Ms. Reed.) The vastly more popular choice is paisley blue, made by Tommy Hilfiger, and split at the seams to reveal a foam stuffing. \u201cIt has seen better days,\u201d she said.\n\nHow many is not entirely clear. Ric Andersen, who sits in front of the closet and has worked at the House for 15 years, said the ties predated him. \u201cNobody knows where they came from,\u201d he said.\n\nUnlike the \u201cumbrella of shame\u201d that is also stored in the gallery (yellow, with the word shame written in red), no reporter has tried to steal the House neck wear.\n\n\u201cThe ties,\u201d Ms. Reed said, \u201calways come back.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jason Horowitz\n\nOur Favorite Reads From Elsewhere\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reports says Britain is ready to join the United States in the attack in Syria.\n\nXinhua, the Chinese news agency, warns the United Nations against making Beijing bear the brunt of climate change recommendations. \u201cSuch a claim is untenable,\u201d it says.\n\nPravda\u2019s view of American policy in Ukraine: \u201cThe Lunacy of Sanctions and the Psychosis of U.S. Exceptionalism.\u201d\n\nJustice Elena Kagan officiated her first same-sex wedding. The ceremony in Maryland marked the union of her former law clerk and his husband.\n\nDaniel Larison of The American Conservative says Hillary Rodham Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be paying much of a price politically within her own party for being reliably hawkish.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140923072408, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Obama, Barack", "org": "Secret Service", "keywords": "Obama Barack,United States Politics and Government,Secret Service,Syria,Uncategorized", "description": "President Obama heads to New York on Tuesday morning to address world leaders just hours after opening a new front in the war against Islamic extremists with an aerial barrage in Syria.
