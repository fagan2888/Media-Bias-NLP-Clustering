UNDATED (WSAU-Wheeler News) U-S Senator Ron Johnson has asked a federal appeals court to revive his lawsuit against part of the Affordable Care Act.

Green Bay District Judge William Griesbach ruled a few weeks ago that Johnson did not have the legal standing to file suit over Obamacare. Johnson asked the Seventh Circuit Appeals Court in Chicago to overturn that ruling. The Wisconsin Republican says the health care reform law treats members of his own staff differently. That's because lawmakers and their official staffers are required to use the federal purchasing exchanges for their coverage. Staffers who are not considered "official" still get their previous employee benefits.

Johnson said the law forced him to choose which staff members are official and which are not. He also said he was being forced to take part in a program he believes is illegal -- and he looks bad to voters because some of his staff get health care subsidies that the general public doesn't get.

Judge Griesbach said Johnson's beliefs about Obamacare and concerns about his image to voters are irrelevant as far as the lawsuit goes.
