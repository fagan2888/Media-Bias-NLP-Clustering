One particular piece, written and drolly illustrated by one Lloyd Gola, left a particular impression on me. It was entitled \u201cMiddle Class Poverty Is \u2026 ,\u201d and laid out a number of humorous scenarios typical of the recession-ridden American middle class of the mid-1970s. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of \u2018Inner City Poverty\u2019 and \u2018Appalachian Poverty\u2019 and \u2018Old Age Poverty,\u2019\u201d the subtitle proclaimed. \u201cAnd yet, millions of our citizens are being inflicted with another type of poverty. We\u2019re referring, of course, to the great American Middle Class \u2026 working \u2026 paying bills and taxes \u2026 and somehow, just about making it through from payday to payday!\u201d According to the article, the symptoms of \u201cMiddle Class Poverty\u201d included:\n\n\u201cHiding inside your $30,000.00 house because you don\u2019t have the money to pay the paper boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cReceiving compliments from your friends on your antique furniture \u2026 and you never even knew you owned any antiques.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting a moonlighting job at your local gas station, and hoping none of your neighbors show up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatching the President on TV announcing that the recession is over \u2026 the same day you were canned.\u201d\n\n\u201cEncouraging your daughter and her fianc\u00e9 to elope.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelping your working wife clean the house on Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving to wait to read the latest best-seller until it comes out in paperback.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot being able to scream at your kid to get a haircut because you can\u2019t spare the three bucks.\u201d\n\nSymptoms of the Slide\n\nWhile the prices seem positively quaint by today\u2019s standards, the symptoms have a very familiar ring, although many middle-class families in 2014 probably wish they could make ends meet merely by picking up extra part-time work at a gas station or convenience store. The \u201970s were a decade of economic and financial turmoil that led to significant declines in the American standard of living, especially for a middle class only recently flush with the fruits of the booming 1950s and \u201960s. But those hard economic times, which also saw the Vietnam War, Watergate, and the Carter presidency, have been surpassed by the political and economic tumult of the new century.\n\nAlthough the American economy appears to be in sluggish recovery these days, at least in contrast with the havoc wrought by the recent recession, the long-term trends are clear: The American middle class has been in unmistakable long-term decline since at least the 1970s, and the rising generation can expect to enjoy a significantly lower standard of living and financial well-being than its immediate predecessors.\n\nThe existence of a large, vibrant middle class is pivotal to maintaining a free society, for it is the middle class that furnishes all of the new business startups \u2014 some of which become Walmarts and Amazon.coms \u2014 and that provides the lion\u2019s share of employment thanks to the myriad small businesses that keep the Main Street economy up and running. Every great Fortune 500 corporation began in some middle-class garage, basement, warehouse, or mom and pop storefront. With a vibrant middle class and economic freedom, society will progress and anyone can accumulate capital. Without a middle class, society will revert to feudalism, in which all the wealth is controlled by a few oligarchs and no one not born into privilege can aspire to rise above his lowly station.\n\nIn times of relative plenty, like the great financial boom of the 1980s and \u201990s, the overall trend isn\u2019t obvious to many people, because the masters of the modern fiat currency-driven economy have perfected the art of concealing economic weakness with what former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan termed \u201cirrational exuberance.\u201d This has meant that asset values have soared even in the face of fundamentals that would have once elicited great concern \u2014 the vertiginous rise in public and private indebtedness, the relentless growth of government controls and regulations, and the continuation of rates of taxation at the local, state, and national level that far exceed those levied by the worst European despots of only a few generations past. Add to that the ruinous cost of endless warfare and empire maintenance on six continents and four oceans, and no sober observer can fail to wonder why the American economy, and the middle class with it, has not collapsed irretrievably already.\n\nYet in defiance of common sense and decades of dire warnings and despite the debts, regulations, and taxes that continue to mount, the techno-wizards of Silicon Valley continue to push forward the high-tech revolution of the 21st century, stock values continue to rise, advances in science and medicine continue apace, and, in general, the long-forecast economic, social, and political meltdown seems nowhere in sight.\n\nBut because we have come to equate material prosperity and technological advances with standard of living, without regard for the cost of purchasing them, we sometimes ignore subtler, longer-term trends that do indeed suggest that America, and in particular, her enormous middle class, is under great threat.\n\nEconomic growth as measured in ways that are directly meaningful to average Americans is perhaps best encapsulated by the so-called standard of living, which in 1980 \u2014 less than two generations ago \u2014 was the highest in the world. In every metric associated with standard of living \u2014 home ownership, number of TV sets, and number of cars per household, for example \u2014 the United States of America was the undisputed world leader, the standard that all other nations strove to emulate. This was particularly impressive considering that the United States 34 years ago had only a few years earlier extricated itself from a ruinous military adventure in Southeast Asia, and had endured years of economic malaise that included several severe recessions, an oil embargo, and persistent double-digit inflation. Just around the corner lay another debilitating recession that would continue to dampen hopes and economic prospects well into Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term in office. Yet American prosperity \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 continued to surge well into the 1990s, with that most reliable of all economic statistics \u2014 median household income \u2014 reaching an all-time, inflation-adjusted high around 1999.\n\nThen, something happened. From 1999 to the present, median household income has been in more or less steady decline, creeping downward in the early years of the last decade before plummeting like a wounded dove from 2007 to 2011. Today, median household income stands at roughly 1997 levels, with no realistic prospects for a return to the salad days anytime soon. The handwriting on the wall has finally become legible for even the economically illiterate.\n\nBut in reality, much of the growth in the median household income \u2014 and the soaring standard of living it fueled for several decades \u2014 came at an unremarked social price: the arrival of the two-income family as the new socio-economic standard. The years from 1960 through the 1990s were characterized by the massive entry of married women into the full-time work force, and the near-total abandonment of the traditional one-income family model with a stay-at-home mother and a large number of children. The fertility rate in the United States in 1960 was roughly 3.8 children per woman, whereas today it is little more than half that \u2014 around 2.1. Moreover, prior to the 1970s, most working women sought professions \u2014 such as teaching \u2014 that allowed them to enter and leave the labor force in order to stay at home and care for children. But beginning in the 1970s, women began to think primarily in terms of a career and only secondarily of motherhood and homemaking as important life objectives. They flooded into graduate schools and professional degree programs such as business, law, and engineering, which had previously been mostly a \u201cman\u2019s world\u201d; that same generation then became one half of the \u201cpower couple\u201d generation of the 1980s onward, where two middle-class, white-collar incomes became the new standard. And as women\u2019s participation in the workforce ballooned, family size shrank correspondingly, as two-income professional couples had less time and interest in raising large numbers of children.\n\nThese are trends that must be taken into account for an honest appraisal of the American standard of living. Fifty years ago, a single professional (or even blue-collar) income was sufficient to buy a house, support a family, put children through college, and save for an eventual well-earned retirement. Today, two professional incomes are barely sufficient to do the same \u2014 and indeed, for many dual-income households, are proving increasingly insufficient.\n\nAnd there is another hidden factor that tells a very bleak tale indeed: household debt, particularly household consumer credit debt, which includes credit card debt, auto loans, student loans, and all other types of consumer debt except for home mortgages. This figure was practically zero in 1950, a time when Americans, recently chastened by the Great Depression, insisted on living within their means, and lending standards were much stricter than they are today. Nowadays, the total household consumer credit debt is around $13 trillion, or 112 percent of total disposable income and 77 percent of nominal GDP (by way of comparison, these same figures in 1980 were about $1.3 trillion, 68 percent, and 47 percent, respectively).\n\nNot Quite Picture Perfect\n\nThe picture of America\u2019s standard of living \u2014 and of the vitality of the pivotal middle class \u2014 is certainly more complicated than a few statistics can possibly convey, but several trends are unmistakable. For one thing, the standard of living by any metric has declined somewhat since the late 1990s, although it is impossible to say whether that trend is merely the by-product of the stock market crash in 2000 compounded by the Great Recession, and may be reversed if America returns to an economic boom comparable to the \u201980s and \u201990s. For another thing, there can be no doubt that, in terms of technology and creature comforts, America has made great advances in the last 60 years or so since the postwar economic boom of the 1950s and early \u201960s. Enormous progress has been achieved in areas such as medicine, food production, transportation, communication, and information technology, with today\u2019s wonder drugs, modern jet planes, Internet, satellite networks, and personal computers being the stuff of visionary science fiction back in the mid-20th century. Modern homes and automobiles are brimming over with once-unimaginable conveniences and luxuries, and ordinary Americans now have within their grasp opportunities for travel, education, entertainment, and careers once beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest.\n\nBut all of this has been purchased at considerable social and economic cost. Whereas the typical American household in the early 1950s was free of debt aside from a home mortgage (and those were typically paid off by early middle age, when 30- and 40-something couples celebrated by burning the mortgage note), Americans nowadays face rather different prospects. Today, even Americans who use credit cards responsibly still face the formidable barrier of student debt, which recently surpassed credit card debt as the number one source of household indebtedness aside from mortgages. Housing costs, meanwhile, have gone stratospheric, with the vast majority of middle-class families looking forward to still servicing mortgage debt into their retirement years (a fact that never seems to come up when overeager economists argue for policies that will \u201cre-inflate\u201d the real estate markets).\n\nAdditionally, the households finding it necessary to accumulate such debts aren\u2019t old-fashioned single-income households with the father driving a milk truck or running a local store. They are households raking in high five or six figure incomes from husband and wife each holding white-collar professional jobs, who typically sport baccalaureate and even postgraduate-level educations. And to top it off, they are rearing fewer children than their parents and grandparents. In a word: American middle-class households are getting far, far less bang for their buck than was the case a half-century ago, forced into the two-income regime and deep into debt to finance a standard of living that \u2014 technological improvements aside \u2014 is now significantly inferior to that of two decades ago.\n\nAnd other factors are contributing to the slow erosion of America\u2019s middle-class standard of living. One of them is the remarkable decline in affordable healthcare, which has been paralleled by a precipitous drop in health insurance standards. When I was a boy in the 1970s, the same large university that employs me today employed my father. But the health insurance benefits provided in those days were truly remarkable. There were no HMOs, so my father could go to any medical practitioner he wanted and receive full coverage. My orthodontic and dental care was fully covered, as were pharmaceuticals. The monthly premium for a family of five was a nominal amount, and working for just about any white-collar employer conferred comparable benefits. But today, the same employer charges this author nearly $200 per month for health insurance (for a family of three) that is diluted by significant deductibles and all types of surprise expenses that the insurer more or less arbitrarily decides not to cover in full. For example, an ear operation for a family member last year cost around $500 out of pocket. Other medical expenses over the past few years have cost several thousand more in expensive drugs and treatments for life-threatening conditions that the insurance company simply refused to cover in full \u2014 procedures that, a generation ago, would have been completely covered for a premium costing a fraction of what it does today. Basic dental is covered (a rarity among today\u2019s employer-provided health plans), but not major dental surgery, such as root canal work \u2014 all things that were covered a generation ago. And my current health plan is considered a gold standard health plan compared with what most people are paying (indeed, under ObamaCare, are now compelled to pay) for premiums with deductibles in the thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAll of this is a drearily familiar litany of latter-day middle-class economic woes, which many Americans are becoming conditioned to accept, because they are not old enough to remember how different things once were. Most so-called middle-class families today are in debt five or six figures, working night and day (if they are fully employed at all) not to miss the mortgage, car, and credit card payments. Levels of personal savings are near an all-time low ebb, with millions of households living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nNor have things improved greatly since the official end of the Great Recession. The profligacy of the boom years has dissipated, and Americans are rediscovering their grandparents\u2019 frugal ways. But that frugality is being offset by an unprecedented expansion of federal government power, resulting in steeply higher tax rates and a blizzard of new regulations designed to control and micromanage the American economy \u2014 including small business \u2014 like never before.\n\nThere is, for example, the enormous new federal bureaucracy that is Obama\u00adCare, which has for the first time created full-blown federal government healthcare in the United States \u2014 a mere stone\u2019s toss away from the single-payer socialized medicine that leftist Utopians such as President Obama hope to bring about. Tens of millions of Americans have already seen the cost of their health insurance premiums rise, sometimes by several hundred percent, as a direct consequence of the new impositions that ObamaCare has visited on the insurance sector. Millions more had their insurance policies cancelled outright in the run-up to the New Year, when the first wave of ObamaCare controls and restrictions came into force. And more pain is on the way, as larger employers begin hiking health insurance rates. ObamaCare, all the glib assurances of the president and his supporters notwithstanding, has already been revealed as \u2014 among many other things \u2014 a massive tax hike on Americans, especially the middle class, at a time when they could least afford it.\n\nPresident Obama, during his first term \u2014 following a precedent set by his predecessor \u2014 instituted massive bailouts of banks and other giant corporations deemed too large or too important to fail. These included, we now know, infusions of cash to a number of foreign corporations, including European banks, all underwritten by the American taxpayer. And the bailout of big banks and financials continues \u2014 in the form of near-zero \u201cstimulus\u201d interest rates, which have driven the run-up in stocks and other asset prices that have benefited ultra-wealthy bankers, hedge fund managers, and others of America\u2019s wealthiest. During the same period, of course, near-zero interest rates have ruined savings for the middle class, for whom traditional interest-paying accounts such as CDs, savings accounts, and money market accounts have little remaining attraction.\n\nAdd to all of this last year\u2019s January tax hike (technically, a repeal of several years of tax relief) in FICA withholdings, and the creation of gargantuan new government controls over the financial and insurance sectors (in the name of reining in the excesses of unfettered capitalism, naturally), and we are confronted with a veritable toxic brew of new taxes, regulations, controls, exactions, and wealth extraction that appears designed to prevent the American middle class from ever regaining its lost vitality and, indeed, hasten its demise.\n\nPolicy of Poverty\n\nAll of which prompts the question: How can American policymakers, from the president on down, possibly be so foolish?\n\nTo understand why so-called \u201cliberals\u201d appear to be acting so egregiously against the interests of all but the wealthiest fraction of Americans, it is important to understand the ideological and organizational pedigree of the modern American Left. What we now style the \u201cleft wing\u201d of politics \u2014 that portion of organized power sympathetic with the goals and ideology of socialism, welfarism, and kindred \u201cisms\u201d dedicated to the enlargement of government power to serve secular Utopian aims \u2014 did not exist in America at the time of its founding. In Europe it birthed the monstrous convulsion known as the French Revolution, and French revolutionaries, especially one Citizen Genet, who served as Revolutionary France\u2019s ambassador to the United States during George Washington\u2019s presidency, attempted to introduce their doctrines in the United States in the late 18th century. With the failure of the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon, the leftist revolutionary movement went underground in Europe, eventually coalescing in the communist movement, whose chief propagandist was Karl Marx. Marx, in his influential Communist Manifesto, published in 1848 (Europe\u2019s calamitous \u201cyear of revolutions\u201d) and soon introduced to America by Stephen Pearl Andrews, set forth a program to advance the cause of communism in his famous \u201cten planks,\u201d many of which have been enthusiastically embraced by the United States and the rest of the free world. To hasten the arrival of communism, Marx recommended (among other things) the creation of \u201ca heavy progressive or graduated income tax\u201d (plank #2), \u201ccentralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly\u201d (plank #5), and \u201cfree education for all children in public schools\u201d (part of plank #10).\n\nAnd against whom or what was Marx\u2019s program directed? As nearly every high-school civics student knows, Marx held the \u201cbourgeoisie\u201d responsible for the alleged ills of capitalism, a social class frequently assumed to be the ultra-rich elites.\n\nIn reality, Marx portrayed the bourgeoisie (cognate with \u201cburgher,\u201d a term for members of the urban mercantile class in early modern Europe) to be what we would now call entrepreneurs and business owners large and small, the very backbone of the middle class (as well as the entrepreneurial upper class such as today\u2019s dot.com billionaires). Contrary to popular conception, Marx was not particularly egalitarian; he despised the bourgeoisie for disrupting the old European feudal system:\n\nThe bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \u201cnatural superiors,\u201d and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \u201ccash payment.\u201d It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. [Emphasis added.]\n\nMarx\u2019s beef was not with Europe\u2019s feudal aristocrats but with the power of the free market to allow anyone to accumulate capital, revolutionize commerce, and found enterprises that would provide employment for others (Marx\u2019s woebegone proletariat). He objected to all levels of entrepreneurial activity and job creation, not merely that of the handful of super-rich \u201crobber baron\u201d types who became the foils of American leftism in the latter half of the 19th century:\n\nNo sooner is the exploitation of the laborer by the manufacturer, so far, at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.\n\nThe lower strata of the middle class \u2014 the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants \u2014 all these sink gradually into the proletariat.\n\nInexplicably, Marx rails against the way in which international trade and other features of bourgeois society act to improve standards of living and to promote peace and understanding:\n\nThe bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilization. The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians\u2019 intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate.\n\nMarx\u2019s program advocates nothing more than a return to feudalism and serfdom, disguised by modern political jargon. His intense hostility toward material progress, free trade, and commerce, and toward the power of free market capitalism to allow men to accumulate wealth other than by inheritance and privilege, has characterized Marxism and leftism ever since. In the Manifesto we recognize many elements of the anti-capitalist narrative still being recited by leftist politicians and their supporters. In press conferences, in congressional debate, in State of the Union addresses, in news analysis, and in college classrooms everywhere, we constantly hear of the need to curb the growth of the economy by shackling the free markets, of the putative vicious exploitation of the working class by predatory capitalists, and of ruthless exploitation of resources by runaway consumerism. More subtly, we hear echoes of Marx\u2019s derisive caricatures of the upwardly mobile bourgeoisie in the snide criticisms of American middle-class taste and sensibilities by self-assured intellectual elitists, who sneer at the values of small-town America (aka \u201cflyover country\u201d) and decry the ignorance of the \u201cmaterialistic\u201d middle class.\n\nThe reason for this reflexive hatred, as much in our day as in Marx\u2019s, is that the privileged elites \u2014 the aristocrats, the intellectuals, the political class and their hangers-on, and the financial elites in cahoots with government interests \u2014 view the middle class as a vast pool of potential competitors. As long as anything resembling a middle class exists, with something like a free market to energize it, no band of elites can have perfect control over a nation\u2019s resources. As Marx himself lamented, the bourgeoisie, with their spirit of innovation, will constantly be improving upon the means of production, leading to constant progress.\n\nThere is every reason to believe that much of the decline of the American middle class is being deliberately engineered, a fact that America\u2019s elites occasionally acknowledge. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker \u2014 the last Fed chairman to tighten rather than loosen the reins on the money supply \u2014 admitted in 1979 to a congressional committee that \u201cthe standard of living of the average American has to decline. I don\u2019t think you can accept that\u201d \u2014 this, allegedly, in the name of combatting inflation, a malady that men such as Volcker (and more modern counterparts such as Ben Bernanke) have created thanks to the power of central banks such as the Federal Reserve to pump unlimited amounts of new money into the economy.\n\nAs to recently departed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, his policies during his tenure as head of the Fed have drained wealth from the middle class and lavished it on his cronies in high finance. As billionaire hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box last fall, \u201c[The Fed\u2019s easy money policy] is fantastic for every rich person. This is the biggest redistribution of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the rich ever.\u201d\n\nThe game plan also calls for America\u2019s standard of living to be harmonized with that of the rest of the world. Back in 1953, Rowan Gaither, chairman of the Rand Corporation and president of the Ford Foundation, told Norman Dodd, an investigator who worked on behalf of Congressman B. Carroll Reese\u2019s Special Committee on Tax-Exempt Foundations\n\nWe operate here [in the Ford Foundation] under directives which emanate from the White House.... The substance of the directives under which we operate is that we shall use our grant making power to alter life in the U.S. so that we can comfortably be merged with the Soviet Union\n\nWhile the Soviet Union has ceased to exist, Gaither\u2019s prediction appears to be approaching fulfillment regarding not only its successor state, Russia, but a number of other of the world\u2019s largest nations. In varying degrees, other parts of the world, especially among the leaders of the former Third World and communist countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 for example), have come increasingly to embody what journalist and commentator Fareed Zakaria has called \u201cthe rise of the rest,\u201d that is, the levelling of global standards of living so that formerly impoverished countries such as India, China, and Brazil are now approaching the United States and other Western nations in productivity and standard of living.\n\nOf course, \u201cthe rise of the rest\u201d has been due in part to liberalization of economic policies in many parts of the world, which have allowed such countries to create capital bases of their own. To the extent that this is the case, we should welcome the appearance of middle classes and of entrepreneurial activity, and the reduction of poverty in many parts of the world.\n\nBut it has also been due to deliberate hamstringing of the U.S. economy from within, as globalist elites who resent the success of America, and especially of her vibrant middle class, have tried to sabotage her progress \u2014 by gradual devaluation of the dollar thanks to the activity of the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank that enjoys monopolistic control of the money supply; by heavy taxation of income, capital gains, and other activities that otherwise would lead to much greater capital accrual in private hands; by the imposition of an unprecedented regime of controls on all economic activity; and by brainwashing generations of Americans, via a compliant and complicit media and public education system, to accept this state of affairs as normal and desirable. In other words, the program of Karl Marx and his latter-day ideological heirs is working precisely as advertised.\n\nAnd there can be no doubt that the current administration shares the Marxist hostility to progress \u2014 as witness, for example, Obama\u2019s stubborn refusal to authorize the construction of the Keystone pipeline to ship crude oil from the tar sands of northern Alberta to the refineries of Texas. Such a project would create thousands of new jobs and significantly reduce America\u2019s reliance on Middle Eastern oil, yet Obama \u2014 citing fatuous environmental scaremongering \u2014 has blocked the project at every pass. Meanwhile, our neighbor to the north continues to boom, and has now \u2014 along with a number of nations in Europe \u2014 significantly surpassed the United States\u2019 overall standard of living.\n\nOn index after index \u2014 measuring indicators as diverse as economic freedom, quality of life, and level of education \u2014 the United States is no longer at the top of the list, or even close. We no longer have the highest standard living in North America, let alone Europe or Asia. This would have been unthinkable only a few decades ago.\n\nThe United States is increasingly evolving into a sort of oligarchic feudalism, where the lion\u2019s share of the wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few thousand plutocrats, every aspect of daily life is supervised and regulated by government, and the middle class is evolving from a reservoir of entrepreneurial talent into a corps of underpaid, upwardly immobile managerial professionals increasingly resembling the nomenklatura of Soviet Russia and the former Eastern Bloc countries. And much of this is by design, urged on us by the enemies of freedom channeling Karl Marx and his \u201cspecter of Communism.\u201d\n\nTo rescue the foundering middle class \u2014 and the country as a whole \u2014 we need but use the same recipe devised by our Founding Fathers: limited government and a return to a free market economy. And it had better happen soon.\n\nSerfs, after all, do not make very effective reformers.\n\nThis article is an example of the exclusive content that's only available by subscribing to our print magazine.
