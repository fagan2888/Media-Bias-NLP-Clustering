But there is one thing we\u2019re reasonably sure of: The feds could learn a lot from the ways in which government, industry and environmentalists worked together in Colorado to craft strict yet reasonable regulations.\n\nSo far, indications are that the Colorado experience has made an impression on Washington.\n\n\u201cWe are very encouraged about the way the EPA is talking about working with states, industry and others,\u201d said Martha Rudolph, director of environmental programs for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\n\nOf course, there was not universal support for the Colorado rules. Some critics pointed to declining industry methane emissions and said voluntary reductions were working. However, overall emissions are expected rise 25 percent by 2020, according to White House figures.\n\nAt this point, the planned rules would apply only to new operations, which has drawn criticism from environmentalists. However, EPA officials have stated the intent is to include existing operations in the future.\n\nThe Obama administration is on the right track with efforts to reduce oil and gas industry methane emissions, and Colorado is a shining example of how to do it right.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Feds should follow Colorado\u2019s example on methane regulation", "title": "Feds should follow Colorado\u2019s example on methane regulation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/16/feds-should-follow-colorados-example-on-methane-regulation/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150116__20150119_Z00_OP19E_METHANEp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150116__20150119_Z00_OP19E_METHANEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-16T16:37:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:55:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration\u2019s planned new rules to reduce oil and gas industry methane emissions should sound familiar.\nSome critics pointed to declining industry methane emissions and said voluntary reductions were working.\nThat\u2019s because Colorado has been down this path, last year becoming the first state to restrict industry emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.\nThe Obama administration is on the right track with efforts to reduce oil and gas industry methane emissions, and Colorado is a shining example of how to do it right.\nOf course, there was not universal support for the Colorado rules."}
