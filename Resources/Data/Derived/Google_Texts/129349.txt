Barron’s Educational Series has reportedly apologized for comparing Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to the Ku Klux Klan in its test prep materials for Advanced Placement European History.

“It has been brought to our attention that Barron’s AP European History, 7th Edition by Seth Roberts and James Eder contains erroneous information that casts aspersions on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas,” the company kkk/” target=”_blank”>said in a statement Tuesday, The Daily Caller reported.

“In an attempt to draw a comparison between current-day politics in the U.S. and the French National Assembly during the French Revolution, the diagram on page 168 equates Clarence Thomas with the KKK, while labeling him as a ‘reactionary and/or fascist,’” the statement said.

Barron’s, which touts itself as the “leader in test preparation,” called the comparison “an unintentional error.”

“It was never our intention to malign Justice Thomas, nor to become embroiled in the right vs. left politics of the day,” the statement continued, according to The Daily Caller. “By way of an explanation, in the course of formatting the book, the diagram was condensed to fit on a single page. In doing so, some information was dropped and other information was combined, which changed the original meaning of the diagram.”
