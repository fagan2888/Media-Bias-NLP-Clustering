(RNN) - Winning numbers in the Powerball jackpot for $950 million were drawn Saturday: 32, 16, 19, 57, 34 and Powerball 13.

That's only $50 million away from $1 billion.

The last time someone won the jackpot was in October 2015.

This is the highest jackpot the Powerball has ever had. The previous record, $587.5 million, was split between two winners in 2012.

Each ticket costs $2, but the odds to win the jackpot is 1 in 292,201,338. There's a much higher chance of winning a $1 million prize at 1 in 11,688,053.

The Powerball lottery is played in all states except Alabama, Alaska, Mississippi, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.
