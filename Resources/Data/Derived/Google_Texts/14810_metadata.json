A recent study conducted by researchers from the University at Buffalo's School of Public Health and Health Professions has found that postmenopausal women with gum disease and history of smoking have a significantly higher risk for breast cancer.\n\n\"We know that the bacteria in the mouths of current and former smokers who quit recently are different from those in the mouths of non-smokers,\" Dr. Jo L. Freudenheim, distinguished professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Environmental Health at the university, said in a statement.\n\nFreudenheim and her colleagues gathered data from 73,737 postmenopausal women \u2014 none of which had been previously diagnosed with breast cancer \u2014 who enrolled in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Observational Study. The research team investigated the link between gum disease and breast cancer while keeping in mind that previous research has shown the effects of gum disease may vary depending on the patient\u2019s history with smoking.\n\nAfter diagnosing 26.1 percent of women from the study with gum disease, the researchers conducted an average of 6.7 years of follow-up research. By the end of the study, 2,124 of the women had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Among all women enrolled in the study, the risk for developing breast cancer was 14 percent higher in women with gum disease.\n\nJust as the research team predicted, smoking had a significant impact on breast cancer development. Women with gum disease who had also quit smoking within the past 20 years had a 36 percent higher risk for breast cancer. On the other hand, women with no history of smoking and those who quit more than 20 years ago had between a 6 and 8 percent risk for being diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, gum diseases can include anything from gum inflammation to a serious condition resulting in major damage to the soft tissue and bones that support teeth. Plaque \u2014 the result of bacteria, mucus, and other particles buildup on teeth \u2014 hardens with time and forms tartar.\n\nAs plaque and tartar go untreated, bacteria causes an inflammation of the gums known as gingivitis. If gingivitis is left untreated, it will result in periodontitis, or \u201cinflammation around the tooth.\u201d This buildup of bacteria could also help explain the link between gum disease and breast cancer. Although it will take further research to establish a causal link, the research team suspects that this bacteria also effects breast tissue.\n\nA pair of similar studies conducted by researchers from Harvard and Case Western Reserve University found that a specific strain of mouth bacteria that can result in both gum disease and colorectal cancer. The family of microbes, dubbed Fusobacteria, starts off in the mouth and is often associated with gum disease. They can also move through blood vessels before eventually reaching various areas of the intestinal tract, like the colon.\n\nSource: Genco R, LaMonte M, Freudenheim J, et al.
