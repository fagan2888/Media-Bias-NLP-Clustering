Pittsburgh has scored 30 points in five straight games, a franchise record.\n\nThe game \u2014 and potentially Cincinnati\u2019s season \u2014 turned on one interception. Stephon Truitt picked off Dalton\u2019s shovel pass in the first quarter, and Dalton broke his right thumb while making the tackle.\n\nHe will see a specialist on Monday and get a better idea how many weeks he will miss. Dalton wore a black cast on the hand.\n\n\u201cMentally I\u2019m fine,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate it happened at this point in the season. I\u2019m doing all right. There are a lot of people who are way worse off than I am.\u201d\n\nDalton has been one of the NFL\u2019s most durable quarterbacks, missing only half a game during his five seasons because of injury. He was leading the league in passer rating heading into the game.\n\nNow, the Bengals\u2019 chances are in the hands of a second-year quarterback from Alabama who missed all of his rookie season with a sore passing shoulder. McCarron threw a 66-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Green, who ran past cornerback Antwon Blake, but also threw a floating sideline pass that Gay returned for a touchdown and a 23-7 lead early in the second half.\n\nMcCarron, who had thrown only four passes in a mop-up role before Sunday, finished 22 of 32 for 280 yards with two touchdowns and a pair of interceptions that led to Steelers touchdowns.\n\nThe Bengals had the fewest injured players in the league heading into the game, but also lost tight end Tyler Eifert to a concussion in the first half. Eifert was leading the NFL in touchdown catches.\n\nThe Steelers have recovered from significant losses of their own \u2014 Roethlisberger missing time with a sprained knee, running back Le\u2019Veon Bell out for the season with a knee injury \u2014 and hit their stride in the last five games.\n\nRoethlisberger has been at his best. He went 30 of 39 for 282 yards with an interception as the Steelers protected a big lead in the second half. DeAngelo Williams ran for a pair of touchdowns, and Chris Boswell made field goals from 42, 47, 45 and 31 yards.\n\nThe Steelers had looked forward to the rematch in Cincinnati since the Bengals\u2019 16-10 victory in Pittsburgh on Nov. 1, one that ended with trash talking and tough feelings. The dislike bubbled out during warmups when players from both teams got into a brief shouting-and-shoving match at midfield.\n\nAlso, Bengals cornerback Adam \u201cPacman\u201d Jones \u2014 who was inactive with a foot injury \u2014 sent a profane tweet about Pittsburgh pregame.\n\nBy the fourth quarter, all the drama was gone. Bengals fans headed for the exits after Robert Golden picked off McCarron with 5:14 to go, leaving Steelers fans to twirl their Terrible Towels in celebration as Pittsburgh scored a clinching touchdown.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Andy Dalton breaks thumb in Bengals\u2019 33-20 loss to Pittsburgh", "title": "Andy Dalton breaks thumb in Bengals\u2019 33-20 loss to Pittsburgh", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/13/andy-dalton-breaks-thumb-in-bengals-33-20-loss-to-pittsburgh/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T15:08:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-13T15:08:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Stephon Truitt picked off Dalton\u2019s shovel pass in the first quarter, and Dalton broke his right thumb while making the tackle.\nAlso, Bengals cornerback Adam \u201cPacman\u201d Jones \u2014 who was inactive with a foot injury \u2014 sent a profane tweet about Pittsburgh pregame.\nAndy Dalton broke his right thumb while making a tackle on his interception, and the Pittsburgh Steelers roughed up backup AJ McCarron while pulling away to a 33-20 victory on Sunday that left the AFC North up for grabs.\nMcCarron threw a 66-yard touchdown pass to A.J.\nThe Steelers (8-5) rumbled with the Bengals during pregame warmups and then led the whole way, sending Cincinnati (10-3) to its first lopsided loss of the season."}
