But, he added, \"We have to start taking a look not just at Medicare and Social Security but every program we have out there, because the budgetary discipline that we've shown over the last 84 years has been horrible.\"\n\nThat should be music to Ryan's ears. The House Speaker has not only championed reductions in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but also endorses steep cuts to a number of other lifelines like food stamps, K-12 education, Pell Grants, and welfare.\n\nThere are other areas where Trump and Ryan can still find common ground. Take taxes. Last year, Trump released a detailed tax plan that would hand the wealthy nearly 40 percent of the benefits and just over 16 percent to the bottom three-fifths of the country, in the end costing the government nearly $10 trillion over a decade. That's not so different from changes Ryan has put forward himself. The tax cuts in his 2013 budget would have cost $6 trillion, and while there weren't as many details, it would have handed \"extremely large new tax cuts\" to the rich, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, while potentially requiring increases on families who made less than $200,000.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "Paul Ryan appears to already be pulling Donald Trump toward his own extreme positions, says ThinkProgress editor Bryce Covert.", "author": "Bryce Covert, ThinkProgress.org", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Paul Ryan appears to already be pulling Donald Trump toward his own extreme positions, says ThinkProgress editor Bryce Covert.", "title": "GOP power clash: Paul Ryan is making Donald Trump worse", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/12/paul-ryan-is-making-donald-trump-worse-commentary.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/05/12/103631375-ryantrump.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul Ryan appears to already be pulling Donald Trump toward his own extreme positions, says ThinkProgress editor Bryce Covert.", "title": "Paul Ryan is making Donald Trump worse", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/12/paul-ryan-is-making-donald-trump-worse-commentary.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/05/12/103631375-ryantrump.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Politics, Commentary, Politics, Paul Ryan, The Fed, Elections, US Economy, Central Banks, Republicans, Donald Trump, Janet Yellen, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-05-12T13:37:48-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2016-05-12T13:51:55-0400", "tag": "Janet Yellen"}, "pageNodeId": 103631339, "news_keywords": "Trump, Ryan, meeting, GOP nomination, election, president,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1d3\"", "article_summary": "That's not so different from changes Ryan has put forward himself.\nThere are other areas where Trump and Ryan can still find common ground.\nClovis said that Trump won't be championing any changes for now.\nThe House Speaker has not only championed reductions in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but also endorses steep cuts to a number of other lifelines like food stamps, K-12 education, Pell Grants, and welfare.\nBut, he added, \"We have to start taking a look not just at Medicare and Social Security but every program we have out there, because the budgetary discipline that we've shown over the last 84 years has been horrible.\""}
