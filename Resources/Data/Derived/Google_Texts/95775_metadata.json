Just two percent approve of the job Congress is doing. More than 90 percent want their Member of Congress to replace current House Speaker John Boehner.\n\n\u201cAfter four and a half years as Speaker, it\u2019s become crystal clear that grassroots conservatives are through being patient with John Boehner,\u201d David N. Bossie, president of Citizens United, said in a release. \u201cConservatives are clearly ready for new leadership in the U.S. House.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe next scheduled vote for Speaker of the House will occur after the 2016 Presidential elections. Republicans are widely expected to maintain their majority in the House.\n\nRepublicans reclaimed the House majority after the 2010 midterms elections, largely on opposition to ObamaCare and a failed economic stimulus package.\n\nSince Republicans took control of the House, the nation\u2019s total debt burden has grown almost 40 percent, rising from around $13 trillion in 2010 to $18 trillion today.\n\nThe Citizens United poll surveyed Conservative grassroots activists on their views of Congress and Speaker Boehner\u2019s leadership. Those surveyed reflect the views of the most political engaged conservatives around the country.\n\nThe complete lack of confidence in Speaker Boehner\u2019s leadership is likely to translate into political headaches for Republican Congressmen in districts nationwide.
