Trodel, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nBeginning Friday evening and ending the following Saturday night, this year\u2019s Yom Kippur falls on the earliest possible day according to the Hebrew calendar. The Day of Atonement is the holiest day of the year for the Jewish people, and it bears certain observances, including ceremonial fasting, prayers, and acts of repentance. Though couched in faith, the practice of fasting may indeed have deep scientific roots that highlight its value in lengthening life and boosting well-being.\n\nThe practice of eating moderate to large quantities of food for several days, then depriving the body for one or two, has come to be known as intermittent fasting. Specific interval ranges are still debated among researchers, but the vast majority of food experts often confer fasting\u2019s success, especially among lab rats and other test animals. Recent studies suggest intermittent fasting reduces overall calorie load and uses modest stress to strengthen cellular defenses.\n\nOne 2003 study found that mice exposed to a period of fasting developed healthier levels of insulin and glucose than the mice kept on a consistent calorie restriction. Headed by Mark Mattson, who sits as head of the National Institute on Aging's neuroscience laboratory and has long skipped breakfast and lunch on weekdays, the study found intermittent fasting resulted in greater sensitivity to insulin, thereby reducing the fasting mice\u2019s overall risk of diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt makes me more productive,\u201d the 56-year-old researcher told Scientific American of his own intermittent fasting habits. Perhaps the most popular fasting program is the 5:2 diet, which involves severe calorie restrictions for two non-consecutive days a week and normal eating for the remaining five days.\n\nWhile Mattson\u2019s research sits alongside other studies that have found fasting decreases stroke risk, staves off Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and prolongs life, other accounts of fasting paint it as something of a body destroyer, particularly for women.\n\nThe female health blog Paleo for Women addresses some of the concerns of Mattson\u2019s and others\u2019 studies, highlighting a potential gender bias that prefers masculinization among mice through fasting.\n\n\u201cMany women find that with intermittent fasting comes sleeplessness, anxiety, and irregular periods, among a myriad of other symptoms hormone dysregulations,\u201d wrote blog author Stefani Ruper, who goes on to analyze a separate study involving mice, also conducted by Mattson, that shows female mice become more masculine.\n\n\u201cThey stop ovulating and menstruating,\u201d Ruper wrote. \u201cThey become hyper-alert, have better memories, and are more energetic during the periods in which they are supposed to be sleep.\u201d\n\nHer ultimate conclusion is that intermittent fasting simply carries too many unknowns to reliably pursue as a diet. Mattson, meanwhile, remains convinced that the evidence points toward its success. Our ancestors seldom knew when the next meal would come, Scientific American notes, leading them to eat in prolonged meal-like sessions and essentially starve in the ensuing days. It\u2019s Mattson\u2019s belief this behavior has lasting effects today.\n\n\u201cIf he is right,\u201d Scientific American argues, \u201cintermittent fasting may be both a smart and smartening way to live,\u201d not to mention a viable diet program in the days surrounding the holy Day of Atonement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "yom kippur 2013, fasting, intermittent fasting, dietary program, lab rats, mice, calorie restriction", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One of Yom Kippur's observances is a day of fasting, a practice that many scientists have conferred as a viable dietary program the other 364 days out of the year.", "title": "Yom Kippur 2013: The Health Benefits Of Fasting (The Other 364 Days Of The Year)", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/yom-kippur-2013-health-benefits-fasting-other-364-days-year-256723", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/yom-kippur.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of Yom Kippur's observances is a day of fasting, a practice that many scientists have conferred as a viable dietary program the other 364 days out of the year.", "title": "Yom Kippur 2013: The Health Benefits Of Fasting (The Other 364 Days Of The Year)", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/yom-kippur-2013-health-benefits-fasting-other-364-days-year-256723", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/yom-kippur.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/yom-kippur.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-13T15:32:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T15:32:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One of Yom Kippur's observances is a day of fasting, a practice that many scientists have conferred as a viable dietary program the other 364 days out of the year."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd209e\"", "article_summary": "Recent studies suggest intermittent fasting reduces overall calorie load and uses modest stress to strengthen cellular defenses.\nPerhaps the most popular fasting program is the 5:2 diet, which involves severe calorie restrictions for two non-consecutive days a week and normal eating for the remaining five days.\nOne of Yom Kippur's observances is a day of fasting, a practice that many scientists have conferred as a viable dietary program the other 364 days out of the year.\n\u201cIt makes me more productive,\u201d the 56-year-old researcher told Scientific American of his own intermittent fasting habits.\nThe practice of eating moderate to large quantities of food for several days, then depriving the body for one or two, has come to be known as intermittent fasting."}
