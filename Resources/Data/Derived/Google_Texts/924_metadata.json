Cuccinelli is a strongly pro-life candidate who led one of the legal battles to try to head off Obamacare in court.\n\nLingamfelter wrote:\n\nAbout 25 minutes ago (7:24 PM 3 November) the Democratic Party of Virginia dropped a robo-call (that they said they paid for in the recording) at MY house to try to tell ME that Ken Cuccinelli supports Obamacare and public financing of abortion!!! Virginia, pa-leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzz understand that the party that wants Terry McAuliffe to be your governor will flat lie about anything! If you want proof that they will say ANYTHING to gain power over you and your life, you need go no further than the \u201crobo-lies\u201d they are sending around Virginia this Sunday evening. They are shameless in their tactics. (I guess they are trying to suppress GOP voters.) Folks, move this around. Virginians need to know what lengths the Democratic Party of VA will go to lie their way to victory. Disgusting. Again, we must expose this statewide\u2026let people know about this. They will say anything. It\u2019s all about power to them\u2026.\n\nUPDATE: Cuccinelli himself has now commented on the calls, via an email his campaign sent out to supporters:\n\nWe have the most energized group of grassroots supporters I\u2019ve ever seen in all of my years in office. Our momentum and excitement is contagious \u2013 Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats see that \u2013 and they\u2019re nervous. So nervous in fact, that they\u2019ve turned to desperate, outright lies to try to sway my hardworking and dedicated supporters. Early today, I was informed that the Democrats are calling the homes of my Republican supporters and telling them that I support Obamacare! That\u2019s right, Friend. Terry McAuliffe and his Democrat allies are trying to convince voters that I support Obamacare in order to trick them into voting against me! Of course we all know the truth \u2013 that I was the first Attorney General in the country to sue the federal government over Obamacare. I\u2019ve been busy fighting back against Obamacare for years, and what has Terry McAuliffe done? He said it didn\u2019t go far enough. Terry even stood by President Obama\u2019s side yesterday and celebrated Obamacare after news broke that the President lied to Americans, and millions lost their health insurance.\n\nThe calls may have been going on for awhile, as Virginia resident Shirley Widlacki wrote on twitter in early October that she received a similar robocall with false claims about Cuccinelli.\n\nDesperate empty suit @TerrMcAuliffe doing dirty robo-calls trying to scare conservs that Cuccinelli is really pro-abortion. #vagov #vagop \u2014 Shirley Widlacki (@patriotmom61) October 12, 2013\n\n\n\nThe Free Beacon newspaper reports the Democratic Party of Virginia id not respond to its request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrat Phone Calls Falsely Claim Cuccinelli Backs Obamacare, Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Democrats in Virginia are facing accusations of dirty tricks in the final hours of the very ugly gubernatorial campaign between pro-life Republican gubernatoria", "title": "Democrat Phone Calls Falsely Claim Cuccinelli Backs Obamacare, Abortion", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/04/democrat-phone-calls-falsely-claim-cuccinelli-backs-obamacare-abortion/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/KenCuccinelli3-190x126.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "democrat,phone calls,claim,cuccinelloi,obamacare,abortion,pro-life", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c7f\"", "article_summary": "Virginians need to know what lengths the Democratic Party of VA will go to lie their way to victory.\nOur momentum and excitement is contagious \u2013 Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats see that \u2013 and they\u2019re nervous.\nVirginia, pa-leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeezzz understand that the party that wants Terry McAuliffe to be your governor will flat lie about anything!\nTerry McAuliffe and his Democrat allies are trying to convince voters that I support Obamacare in order to trick them into voting against me!\nCuccinelli is a strongly pro-life candidate who led one of the legal battles to try to head off Obamacare in court."}
