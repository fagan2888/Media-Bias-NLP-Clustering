The spokesperson for the Henderson Police Department, Kathleen Richards, said that the commercial laundry company Angelica called the police at around 10 a.m. local time after laundry workers discovered the bodies in a laundry truck.

Richards said the hospital sent the two dead babies by mistake though it was unclear how the babies were mixed with the linen. She also said that detectives found no evidence of foul play but that the Clark County Coroner’s Office would investigate.

Richards declined to release a police report on the incident, saying the investigation is ongoing.

According to the hospital spokesperson Gretchen Papez, the mother of the children had suffered a miscarriage early in her pregnancy and arrived by ambulance to the hospital with the dead twins already wrapped in linens. According to reports, the babies were about four months along when the mother miscarried.

“After suffering a miscarriage at another location, the patient arrived via EMS with twin, early gestational, deceased fetuses. The fetuses had already been wrapped in linen prior to arrival at the hospital,” a hospital statement said.

Papez did not specify the time of birth or the gender of the babies, but did say that hospital officials are trying to determine how the mistake occurred.

“We are currently reviewing the situation to determine what occurred. However, the remains are currently in the hospital’s possession, and we are working with the family at this time,” Papez said.
