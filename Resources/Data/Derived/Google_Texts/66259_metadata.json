We brought the votes and the noise in 2012: 63 percent of us voted for him in Arizona. But the honeymoon is now officially over.\n\nYoung Americans were once the most enthusiastic supporters of \"Obamacare,\" but we are now the law\u2019s most ardent foes. The latest Harvard poll shows that 57 percent of people between 18 and 29 disapprove of this law \u2014 and only 13 percent of my generation \u201cdefinitely\u201d plans on signing up.\n\nWhat turned us against the law we once liked? Reality. When Obamacare finally came a-knockin\u2019 in October, our government gave us a choice between having our pockets picked and opting out. Guess which one we chose.\n\nIt was the right decision to make. At the end of the day, Obamacare hurts millennials more than it helps us. Just look at what it does to our wallets. After the exchanges opened, we found that the average premium for an average 27-year-old had increased dramatically in Arizona.\n\nThe increases weren\u2019t exactly chump change, either. In Arizona, they went up by 178 percent, according to the Wall Street Journal. That\u2019s an extra $89 every month. All told, we\u2019re now paying more than $1,600 a year.\n\nThat\u2019s a total rip-off. We\u2019re already struggling with an average of more than $35,000 in student loans, our average income is much lower than our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019, and our unemployment rate is more than twice the national average at nearly 16 percent. We need every extra penny we can save \u2014 and yet Obamacare fleeces us on a monthly basis.\n\nEither the White House hasn\u2019t noticed this inconvenient truth, or they\u2019re unwilling to admit that it exists. Either way, they\u2019re covering it up with a flashy new public-relations campaign. The best example is the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 recent competition that spent millions of dollars begging millennials to make positive videos and songs about Obamacare.\n\nHHS announced the winning entry last week \u2014 and it couldn\u2019t have been more out of touch. It was a catchy song that urged millennials to \u201cForget about the price tag\u201d and just sign up.\n\nYes, you read that right. The person who wrote those lyrics might be able to heed her own advice \u2014 she won $30,000 for her puff piece \u2014 but the rest of us aren\u2019t so lucky.\n\nOnce that tactic failed, the president reached out to us himself. The White House recently hosted a youth summit specifically targeted to 18-35 year-old activists (I\u2019m still waiting for my invitation). He told us that \u201cstuff that\u2019s worth it is always hard,\u201d and that \u201cat the end of the day\u201d we\u2019d \u201cthink it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment is nice, but what\u2019s more important is what the president left unsaid. The unspoken truth is that the exchanges won\u2019t be able to make ends meet without our money. The onus is on us to subsidize the system, regardless of whether we can afford it.\n\nThe president didn\u2019t tell us that. Instead, he looked into our eyes and told us that he knows better than us how we should spend our money and live our lives.\n\nHe must have forgotten that he was talking to the \u201cyoung invincibles.\u201d Treating us like children won\u2019t convince us to sign onto a bad deal. We\u2019re also smart enough to know that we have other options, like purchasing insurance from the private market that gives us the coverage we want at a price we can afford.\n\nAs for Obamacare, we\u2019re just not buying what the president\u2019s selling.\n\nEvan Feinberg is president of Generation Opportunity, a conservative non-profit.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Evan Feinberg", "description": "Obamacare is a rip-off for millennials,Evan Feinberg: Young Americans were once the most enthusiastic supporters of Obamacare, but we are now the law\u2019s most ardent foes.", "pubdate": "Fri Jan 24, 2014  1:27 PM", "creditline": "My Turn", "headline": "Obamacare is a rip-off for millennials", "section": "Opinions", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2tr6", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare is a rip-off for millennials"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Obamacare is a rip-off for millennials, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"account_id": 13115682, "title": "Obamacare is a rip-off for millennials", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/opinions/articles/20140125obamacare-rip-off-millennials-feinberg.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "description": "Evan Feinberg: Young Americans were once the most enthusiastic supporters of Obamacare, but we are now the law\u2019s most ardent foes."}}, "article_summary": "At the end of the day, Obamacare hurts millennials more than it helps us.\nYoung Americans were once the most enthusiastic supporters of \"Obamacare,\" but we are now the law\u2019s most ardent foes.\nWhen Obamacare finally came a-knockin\u2019 in October, our government gave us a choice between having our pockets picked and opting out.\nThe best example is the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 recent competition that spent millions of dollars begging millennials to make positive videos and songs about Obamacare.\nIt was a catchy song that urged millennials to \u201cForget about the price tag\u201d and just sign up."}
