This gives government officials authority to set standards for service, like minimum response times, and to switch EMS providers if they are unhappy with the service.\n\nIn Jefferson County, for example, the local government holds the zone but contracts all services to Gold Cross. The county does not run a single ambulance, but with the zone designation, has the authority to choose which ambulance company works in the county.\n\nCounty Administrator Adam Mestres said he is satisfied with the service provided by Gold Cross, but that the county would be somewhat trapped if a private company held the zone designation.\n\n\u201cIf we did not have the zone provider designation, then that means XYZ ambulance service would have it and if we no longer want to partner with XYZ, no one else could come in and work,\u201d Mestres said. \u201cIf we say \u2018we don\u2019t want ya\u2019ll anymore, we\u2019re going to bid with ABC company, they can say \u2018We own the zone and we don\u2019t want ABC here...Ideally it could create some type of monopoly.\u201d\n\nThe state began awarding zones to ambulance services in the 1970s to prevent multiple companies from rushing to a scene at once and causing chaos, said Wages. As zone provider, that service answers all 911 calls for EMS in an area and has the authority to contract services out to another ambulance company.\n\nColumbia County does not have an ambulance license and therefore is not eligible to be a zone provider. Gold Cross holds the zone for Columbia County and has had a contract there since 2001.\n\nPam Tucker, director of Columbia County Emergency and Operation Division, said she does not see a problem with the arrangement because of wording in the contract that in theory takes the zone away from Gold Cross if the partnership ends.\n\nAccording to the contract, Gold Cross\u2019 zone provider designation would terminate if the contract were to end or expire and the county would request the state reopen zoning for another provider in the area.\n\n\u201cWe would immediately put in a request for the state to open zoning so we could promptly get another ambulance service,\u201d Tucker said.\n\nHowever Mestres, former director of Aiken Rescue ambulance service, said he would still not be comfortable with a private company holding the zone even with that kind of wording.\n\nThe contract is an agreement between a local government and an ambulance service and in no way obligates a state agency to do anything.\n\n\u201cThe state might say \u2018I don\u2019t care what you have in your contract, we control what\u2019s zoned and what\u2019s not zoned,\u201d Mestres said.\n\nThe state will have the final say on who receives the zone in Augusta, but the majority of Augusta Commissioners who responded to requests for comment support the county having the zone.\n\n\u201cIf Augusta-Richmond County has to pay for it, we should be able to make our own decisions in what we want to do,\u201d said Commissioner Bill Lockett. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have our hands tied behind our back.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Wayne Guilfoyle said residents would be at risk if a private company held the zone and did not allow the county to decide which services came in to assist in the event of an emergency or natural disaster.\n\n\u201cIf we had a major catastrophe and the government had to bring in other ambulance services, (Gold Cross) can actually say \u2018no\u2019 at that point,\u201d Guilfoyle said. \u201cYou relinquish all control over any kind of ambulatory service.\u201d\n\nCommissioners William Fennoy, Alvin Mason and Corey Johnson also supported the county holding the zone. Mary Davis, Marion Williams and Donnie Smith did not respond to e-mails and voice mails requesting comment.\n\nCommissioners Joe Jackson and Grady Smith are in favor of Gold Cross holding the zone because they said Gold Cross officials are experts in the field and provide top notch service.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m on that gurney or that stretcher I want someone who knows what to do, when to do it and how to do it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf the county provides (the service) you don\u2019t know who in the hell is going to be pushing you.\u201d\n\nJackson also questioned the county\u2019s ability to invest money in purchasing ambulances and hiring more personnel if it were awarded the zone. However there are numerous counties in Georgia that hold the zone provider designation but contract the services out and do not run any ambulances themselves, according to Wages.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Metro, Latest News, Tracey McManus", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Gold Cross EMS is appealing a decision that made the Augusta Fire Department primary zone provider of amublance services in Richmond County.", "title": "State set to decide fate of Augusta ambulance service this month", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/metro/2014-01-04/state-set-decide-fate-augusta-ambulance-service-month", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/12965516.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe would immediately put in a request for the state to open zoning so we could promptly get another ambulance service,\u201d Tucker said.\n\u201cIf we had a major catastrophe and the government had to bring in other ambulance services, (Gold Cross) can actually say \u2018no\u2019 at that point,\u201d Guilfoyle said.\nThe contract is an agreement between a local government and an ambulance service and in no way obligates a state agency to do anything.\n\u201cWe feel that we\u2019ve done a great job and we have no reason to not be zone provider in Richmond County,\u201d Brogdon said.\nAs zone provider, that service answers all 911 calls for EMS in an area and has the authority to contract services out to another ambulance company."}
