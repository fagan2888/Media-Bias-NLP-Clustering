CHICOPEE, Mass. (WWLP) – The RiverBend Medical Group will soon become a part of Mercy Medical Center.

Daniel Moen of Trinity Health New England told 22News this will help them adapt to the ever changing healthcare industry, while also providing better care to patients, and streamlining their operations. “This is going to help us really thrive in that new environment we’re experiencing,” he said.

Dr. Richard Schuman, the President of RiverBend Medical Center told 22News the partnership will help them improve patient care. “With an integrated communication system, integrated medical records, that doctor taking care of you at the ER is going to know what happened, it’ll eliminate unnecessary, duplicate tests. We’ll be able to provide better care for you when you’re sick,” he said.

The agreement was announced on Tuesday, and is part of a newer trend in the healthcare industry – acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships.

Daniel Moen of Trinity Health New England said the increase in partnerships follows changes in the healthcare industry. “You see a lot of mergers, and other activity, acquisitions like this going on as a result of the Affordable Care Act, and other changes that are happening in healthcare right now. Now, we’re talking about caring for a population of patients over their lifetime, and over an entire range of services,” he said.

Patients shouldn’t notice any major changes at Mercy Medical Center or at RiverBend Health Group.

Practitioners will stay in the same locations, and offer the same services.
