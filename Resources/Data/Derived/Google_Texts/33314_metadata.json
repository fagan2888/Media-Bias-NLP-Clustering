They\u2019re consulting experts, holding hearings, and demanding action. Politicians across the spectrum are united in a common goal: exploiting the crisis to win the next election.\n\nWilliam Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky maneuver, because they don\u2019t know much about Ebola. But they know their shticks, and that\u2019s enough. With a tweak here and a twist there, they can shoehorn Ebola into their customary talking points. Here are the emerging favorites.\n\n1. The war on Ebola is like the war on terror. After an ugly decade in Iraq, some Republicans took a break to dabble in civil libertarianism. Now they\u2019re ready to get back to being the Daddy Party. President Obama is \u201cnot protecting our country and our families from Ebola,\u201d says Rep. Tom Cotton, the Republican Senate candidate in Arkansas. Cotton promises to \u201crebuild our military and keep your family safe and secure, whether the threat is terrorism or disease.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n3. Obama thinks Ebola is the JV. First he called ISIS the junior varsity of terrorism. Then he downplayed Ebola as a junior virus. Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Virginia, chides Obama for having discounted the risk of Ebola reaching the United States. So does Bobby Schilling, a Republican House candidate in Illinois. At Thursday\u2019s hearing, Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton sarcastically applauded Obama for leaving the campaign trail \u201cto finally focus on the crisis.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are delivering the same precooked talking points they used for Iraq and Syria for the Ebola crisis.\n\n4. We\u2019re on the case. Having ignored Ebola until it reached the United States, elected officials are scrambling to look as though they\u2019re on the ball. The first step is to say you\u2019ve talked to an expert. The number of politicians who claim to have spoken in the last week with Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is almost mathematically impossible. But if you can\u2019t get Frieden on the phone, go to Plan B. In a debate on Wednesday, Gardner told voters he had talked to a nurse. Wendy Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor of Texas, where the virus had arrived from Liberia, said she had talked to a county judge. Don\u2019t worry, said Davis: Everything\u2019s under control. That was two weeks ago. Oops.\n\n5. Screen all passengers. If Ebola is just like terrorism, the solution is obvious: airport security. At Thursday\u2019s hearing, Murphy portrayed Ebola carriers as infiltrators, noting that they could mask their fevers with ibuprofen to sneak through checkpoints. Republicans on the committee complained that screening 94 percent of passengers wasn\u2019t good enough: Everyone had to be checked. Democrats don\u2019t seem inclined to resist the GOP\u2019s demands. \u201cI don\u2019t think any measure is too extreme,\u201d says state Sen. Connie Johnson, the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Oklahoma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n6. Ban West Africans. Before the Ebola hearing, Republicans were clamoring for a ban on travel to the United States from the affected countries. Frieden and other health officials testified that this was a bad idea, in part because it could easily be circumvented (by stopping over in Europe), and it might force carriers to hide their symptoms. Republicans were unmoved. After the hearing, they went straight to the TV cameras and delivered precooked talking points they had imported from Iraq and Syria. With colleagues arrayed behind him, Upton called for a \u201cno-fly zone from that region of the world.\u201d\n\n7. Seal the border. It\u2019s the Republican answer to any questions about immigration. Why not use it for Ebola, too? Gillespie says Ebola and ISIS have made our \u201cporous Southern border\u201d a \u201cpublic health threat and a public safety threat.\u201d Sen. Pat Roberts, running for re-election in Kansas, says it\u2019s all one issue: \u201cEbola, ISIS, or whoever comes across the border\u2014the 167,000 illegals who are convicted felons\u2014that shows you we have to secure the border, and we cannot support amnesty.\u201d While we\u2019re at it, says Roberts, let\u2019s impose \u201ca quarantine on West Africa.\u201d\n\n8. Blame budget cuts. For Democrats, it\u2019s all about the spending. Colorado\u2019s Democratic Sen. Mark Udall says Gardner, his Republican challenger, tried to cut $770 million from the CDC budget, which would have impeded the agency\u2019s response to Ebola. Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic Senate candidate in Iowa, says his opponent, Republican Joni Ernst, \u201csupported a radical plan to shut down the federal government,\u201d which \u201cdramatically cut funding\u201d for the CDC and the National Institutes of Health. At Thursday\u2019s House hearing, Colorado Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette suggested that Congress\u2019 tight purse strings on NIH had prevented the agency from developing an Ebola vaccine. (Slate's Josh Voorhees says the timeline lends credence to this claim.) California Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman blamed Republicans for a complex chain of events that began with the 2011 fiscal standoff, led to across-the-board budget cuts, and ended with Ebola. \u201cThose who allowed that sequestration to happen by closing the government,\u201d said Waxman, are responsible for leaving the country \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\n\n9. Blame tax cuts. This adds another layer to the budget-cut lament. Warner says the road to ruin began with conservative activist Grover Norquist, who drafted a no-tax-increase pledge in 1986, which forced Republicans to swear off tax hikes, which led to a fiscal squeeze, which crippled the CDC and NIH, which blocked the Ebola vaccine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n10. Bureaucrats misspent the money. This is the Republican answer to any budget-cut complaint. Just look up the agency\u2019s projects, pick the ones that sound stupid, and claim that if the agency hadn\u2019t wasted money on them, it could have managed its obligations. Gardner\u2019s version in his Wednesday debate with Udall was classic: \u201cPerhaps the CDC should quit spending money on things like jazzercise, urban gardening, and massage therapy.\u201d\n\n11. Blame lack of insurance. Now that Republicans are blaming everything on Obamacare, it\u2019s easy to forget that Democrats used to blame everything on a lack of Obamacare. The sick Liberian who brought Ebola to the United States gives liberals an opening to revive this complaint. \u201cThe first Ebola patient showed up at the Dallas hospital with a 103 fever,\u201d Rep. Mike Michaud, the Democratic nominee for governor of Maine, pointed out in a debate Wednesday night. \u201cBecause he had no insurance, they gave him aspirin and sent him on his way. He [then] had contact with 50 other individuals.\u201d Michaud blamed all of this on Maine\u2019s Republican governor, Paul LePage, who stood six feet from Michaud and about 1,600 miles from Dallas. \u201cThe fact that this governor has vetoed not once, but five times, expansion [of Medicaid] under the Affordable Care Act\u2014that\u2019s reckless, it\u2019s wasteful, and it leaves us vulnerable.\u201d\n\n12. Blame neglect. When the other party controls the executive branch, it\u2019s easy to pin everything on them. Something bad happened\u2014Benghazi, Katrina, 9/11\u2014and the administration failed to stop it or manage it. But be careful. On Wednesday, Kevin Wade, the Republican Senate candidate in Delaware, tried to blame the Ebola mess on the absence of a confirmed surgeon general. The gambit backfired when his opponent, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, pointed out that Republicans had blocked Obama\u2019s nominee for the job because the nominee had called gun violence a public health issue.\n\n13. Politics stops at Ebola\u2019s edge. After 9/11, Republicans tried to shame Democrats into supporting President Bush without dissent. Now Democrats want the same fealty to Obama. The argument sounds like a sermon against gamesmanship\u2014let\u2019s \u201cput aside partisan differences,\u201d says Braley\u2014but it\u2019s barbed with an exploitative brand of patriotism. \u201cWhen we stand together, we\u2019re going to meet this challenge,\u201d Udall told voters during his debate with Gardner on Wednesday. \u201cThe virus is the enemy.\u201d Then he accused Gardner of endangering the CDC and undermining the war. Even the pleas to rise above politics are infected with politics. It\u2019s the virus we can\u2019t beat.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Thirteen ways Democrats and Republicans are exploiting the virus for political gain.", "fb-share": "Thirteen Ways Democrats and Republicans Are Exploiting Ebola for Political Gain", "sailthru.author": "William Saletan", "description": "Ebola has arrived in the United States, and our nation\u2019s leaders are wasting no time.
