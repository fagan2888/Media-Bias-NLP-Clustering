Officials say an early morning mobile home fire in Aurora on Friday that left a woman fatally injured was intentionally set.

The Aurora Fire Department did not immediately elaborate on the cause, only going as far as to call the blaze “incendiary.”

“Until an autopsy of the victim of this morning’s fire can be completed, no more information pertaining to the investigation will be released,” the department said on Twitter.

The fire began at about 6 a.m. on the 1800 block of North Carson Street, the fire department said.

Firefighters had the blaze under control soon after arriving on scene.

Fire officials initially said the victim, identified only as a woman, was taken to the hospital with injuries before announcing at about 7 a.m. that she had died.

Photos from the fire showed heavy damage to the affected home.
