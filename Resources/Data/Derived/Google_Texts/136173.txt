The Dallas Zoo recently welcomed a big-eared (and cute) baby eastern bongo, a species of antelope that is critically endangered in the wild.

Amara, which means “grace” in the Nigerian language Igbo, was born Nov. 6 to mother Hidaya and father Djembe and is the zoo’s first eastern bongo calf in six years. The 50-pound baby will eventually join the herd of four other eastern bongos in the river exhibit, zoo spokeswoman Lydia Jennings said in the zoo’s blog Dallas ZooHoo.

Amara has a chestnut coat with thin white lines and will eventually have tilted horns that can grow to be 40 inches long and are used for clearing brush out of the way in dense forests, she said.

“Antelope are generally very skittish, but bongo are one of the most easygoing,” mammal curator Keith Zdrojewski said in a statement. “They’re very laid-back, with personalities almost as big as they are.”

The calf is the zoo’s 24th since the start of a breeding program in 1975.

There are about 300 eastern bongo left in Association of Zoos and Aquariums zoos, but only about 100 remain in parts of Kenya’s mountain forests as a result of poaching, Jennings said.
