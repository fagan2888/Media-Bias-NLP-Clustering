Singer Katy Perry, known for her provocative and occasionally offensive performances, managed to pull attention away from Pharrell’s hat with her performance of “Dark Horse” at the 20214 Grammy Awards.

Perry, channeling an angsty teenager, emerged on stage in a wardrobe from Hot Topic (probably) with a broom that functioned as a stripper pole, and accompanied by a horse. Comics, actors and writers took to Twitter to comment on the spectacle:

THAT WAS PRETTY JOAN OF UNREMARKABLE — Molly Lambert (@mollylambert) January 27, 2014

Katy's performance was equal parts Wicked, CATS, War Horse, Spider-Man, and a strip club that Giuliani kicked out of Times Square. #Grammys — Vulture (@vulture) January 27, 2014
