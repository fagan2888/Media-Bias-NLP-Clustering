John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, in their Wall Street Journal op-ed last week, also committed the new congress to pursue \u201ca proposal to restore the traditional 40-hour definition of full-time employment, removing an arbitrary and destructive government barrier to more hours and better pay created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never really understood the case for this move, or why Republicans shouldn\u2019t just pass a repeal of the employer mandate in Obamacare rather than start playing around with its definition of the workweek.\n\nBasically, the employer mandate requires all employers with more than 50 workers to provide health coverage to full-time employees or pay a fine. But the law defined a full-time employee as someone working 30 hours or more, rather than the usual 40 hours or more. The idea was in part to encompass more employers and in part to limit the degree to which employers cut worker hours by putting the cut-off well below the number of hours that most workers put in\u2014employers are less likely to reduce a worker\u2019s load by 10 hours than by just 1 or 2 to avoid the mandate.\n\nAs Sherry Glied and Claudia Solis-Roman recently found, nearly 29 million employees of large firms work between 40 and 44 hours a week (and about 27 million of them work exactly 40 hours a week), while only about 3 million work between 30 and 34 hours a week and another roughly 4 million work between 35 and 39 hours a week for such firms. Even if you just look at workers not now offered employer coverage, this difference means that putting the cut-off for the employer mandate at 40 hours would likely put far, far more people at risk of having their hours cut than leaving it at 30 hours. That would make for a worse effect on workers and on the economy. So by setting the definition lower, Obamacare\u2019s architects were trying to mitigate the damaging effects of the employer mandate some, and by setting it higher Republicans would be worsening those effects.\n\nOf course, the effects on workers near the 30-hour cut-off are still unacceptable, just as Boehner and McConnell suggested. But the solution to that is not to punish far more workers but to lift the burden off of all of them by eliminating the employer mandate altogether. For these very reasons, the politics of doing so would also be better than the politics of just fiddling around with the law\u2019s definition of full-time work. The administration has already delayed the mandate and held off from applying it to firms with between 50 and 100 workers, and when the House voted last year to put off the implementation of the mandate, 35 Democrats joined Republicans to support the bill. Such a measure could plausibly get the handful of Senate Democrats it would need to survive a filibuster. It might even get signed by the president. Some Democrats might oppose it because it would expose them to the argument that they were relieving employers but not individuals of an Obamacare mandate, but that\u2019s just more reason for Republicans to support it, since they\u2019d want to repeal the individual mandate too and would benefit from a chance to press the Democrats on it.\n\nFor reasons of both policy and politics, it seems to me that a repeal of the employer mandate makes much more sense than an adjustment of its definition of full-time work. And that adjustment, quite apart from the appeal of other measures, seems likely to be worse than doing nothing.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Mon, 2014-11-10 16:48", "sailthru.author": "Yuval Levin", "news_keywords": "Yuval Levin, Politics, Nation, World", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "| National Review", "og": {"site_name": "National Review Online", "description": "Looking over what some Republicans had to say over the weekend about the early agenda of the new congress next year, I\u2019m struck by the frequent inclusion of a move to change Obamacare\u2019s definition of full-time work from 30 hours a week to 40.
