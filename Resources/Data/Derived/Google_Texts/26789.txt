A spokesman for the City of Wichita says they are monitoring the road situation because of overnight low temperatures below freezing and more precipitation could cause slick spots.

"We are going to be monitoring the weather. We expect that it is going to refreeze tonight and maybe [get] even more precipitation, we will have all trucks out continuing their passes through the streets," said Alan King of the City of Wichita.

King says that the cities 60 snow plows will be spreading salt and sand on the roadways in the daytime hours, hoping to prevent water on the roads from refreezing.

King wanted to remind residents of Wichita that the city does not treat residential neighborhoods or parking lots so those areas might be icy.

Many people were out in Wichita on Saturday, dealing with car windows covered with ice and wet roads.

"Slow it down and make sure that we allow plenty of stopping distance and understand that it may be slick so you are going to have to slow down," said one Wichita driver.

Another Wichita resident said "it was really slick, some people didn't want to get out or go anywhere cause [the] roads were getting really bad."

KAKE First Alert Meteorologist Blake Smith expects the Wichita area to continue to see drizzle throughout the night.
