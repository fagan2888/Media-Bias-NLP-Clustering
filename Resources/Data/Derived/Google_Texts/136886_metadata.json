Federal aid makes up about a third of the total state budget.\n\n\u201cThe budget of the United States government plays a considerable role in the finances of New York State and its local governments, as well as in the daily live of New Yorkers,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe $214 billion in taxes the state sent in 2013 to the federal government ranked third, behind California and Texas.\n\nNew York contributed $10,896 per capita in tax revenue to the federal budget \u2014 nearly a third more than the $8,319 national average. The state received about $9,885 per capita back.\n\nIt generated almost $120 billion in individual income taxes alone, which was 9.2% of the total for that tax collected by the federal government.\n\nNew York\u2019s per capita individual income taxes of $6,099 were 47% higher than the national average of $4,139, ranking New York sixth in the nation. Connecticut was first at $8,479.\n\nThere is some good news. The state will benefit from some changes, notably a larger federal Medicaid reimbursement because of Obamacare, DiNapoli said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "KENNETH LOVETT", "twitter": {"description": "New York gets only 91 cents in federal funding for every dollar it sends to Washington.", "title": "NY pays big in federal taxes, but doesn't get as much back", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pays-big-federal-taxes-doesn-back-article-1.2413779", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2386997.1444144091!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/newyork-elections-comptroller.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "New York state, federal taxes, new york taxes, new york state taxes, Thomas DiNapoli,", "parsely-author": "Kenneth Lovett", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "New York state, federal taxes, new york taxes, new york state taxes, Thomas DiNapoli,", "nydn_tags": "thomas dinapoli", "news_keywords": "New York state, federal taxes, new york taxes, new york state taxes, Thomas DiNapoli,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pays-big-federal-taxes-doesn-back-article-1.2413779", "parsely-title": "NY pays big in federal taxes, but doesn't get as much back", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-27T19:15:18-0400", "sailthru.title": "NY pays big in federal taxes, but doesn't get as much back", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-27T23:15:18", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2386997.1444144091!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/newyork-elections-comptroller.jpg", "description": "New York gets only 91 cents in federal funding for every dollar it sends to Washington.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "New York gets only 91 cents in federal funding for every dollar it sends to Washington.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "New York gets only 91 cents in federal funding for every dollar it sends to Washington.", "title": "NY pays big in federal taxes, but doesn't get as much back", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pays-big-federal-taxes-doesn-back-article-1.2413779", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2386997.1444144091!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/newyork-elections-comptroller.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "thomas dinapoli", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2386997.1444144091!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/newyork-elections-comptroller.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "KENNETH LOVETT", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "New York ranked 46th overall in the federal taxes it generated compared to the amount of funding it received from Washington, the reports shows.\nThe $214 billion in taxes the state sent in 2013 to the federal government ranked third, behind California and Texas.\nIt generated almost $120 billion in individual income taxes alone, which was 9.2% of the total for that tax collected by the federal government.\nNew York contributed $10,896 per capita in tax revenue to the federal budget \u2014 nearly a third more than the $8,319 national average.\nThe state will benefit from some changes, notably a larger federal Medicaid reimbursement because of Obamacare, DiNapoli said."}
