A necropsy revealed severe cerebral edema, or swelling, which appears to have been caused by \u201cencephalitis associated with a microscopic parasite.\u201d Molecular testing is expected to reveal further information about the parasite.\n\nMate to Rusty, the male panda who made a famed zoo-break last year, Shama had given birth to three cubs earlier this summer. Officials say the rest of the family is doing all right:\n\nShama\u2019s three cubs are now being hand-reared by experienced staff. Keepers are also hand-rearing a cub born to female Regan. Shama\u2019s three cubs are active and appear to be doing well, but one is considerably smaller than its siblings, and receiving treatment for pneumonia. As a precaution, all three cubs are receiving anti-protozoal treatment. Rusty, who was housed with Shama and the cubs until recently, is also receiving anti-protozoal treatment as a preventative measure. He appears to be doing well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 7-year-old female died following a sudden neurological disorder VIDEO", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The 7-year-old female died following a sudden neurological disorder VIDEO", "title": "RIP Shama: National Zoo euthanizes its beloved red panda", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/rip_shama_national_zoo_euthanizes_its_beloved_red_panda/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/14960535722_608675da19_z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 7-year-old female died following a sudden neurological disorder VIDEO", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/14960535722_608675da19_z.jpg", "title": "RIP Shama: National Zoo euthanizes its beloved red panda", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "RIP Shama: National Zoo euthanizes its beloved red panda", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, endangered species, National zoo, panda, Red Panda, Video, wildlife", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde44d\"", "article_summary": "Topics: endangered species, National zoo, panda, Red Panda, Video, wildlife, Sustainability News, NewsSad news from the Smithsonian National Zoo: 7-year-old Shama, a female red panda, died this past Saturday following a sudden neurological disorder.\nRusty, who was housed with Shama and the cubs until recently, is also receiving anti-protozoal treatment as a preventative measure.\nMate to Rusty, the male panda who made a famed zoo-break last year, Shama had given birth to three cubs earlier this summer.\nShama\u2019s three cubs are active and appear to be doing well, but one is considerably smaller than its siblings, and receiving treatment for pneumonia.\nOfficials say the rest of the family is doing all right:Shama\u2019s three cubs are now being hand-reared by experienced staff."}
