MetLife was designated a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) today. Steven A. Kandarian, MetLife chairman, president and CEO, immediately issued a statement saying the company “strongly disagrees” with the decision and said the company is “not ruling out any of the available remedies under Dodd-Frank to contest a SIFI designation."

The ruling, however, was stronger than the FSOC designation of Prudential Financial, which prompted objections from two FSOC members. In this case, the FSOC said in a statement that the vote was unanimous, “with one member voting present.” That, most likely, was S. Roy Woodall, Jr., an independent member of the board with insurance expertise. He voted to oppose Prudential Financial’s designation.
