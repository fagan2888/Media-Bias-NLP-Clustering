Jerrold Nadler, D-10, of New York.\n\nMenendez was also joined by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer, Weehawken Mayor Richard Turner, Bayonne Mayor Jimmy Davis, North Bergen Mayor and State Senator Nicholas Sacco, West New York Mayor Felix Roque, and Guttenberg Mayor Gerald Dracheff. Mark Albeiz was present on behalf of Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop. Hudson County Executive Thomas DeGise, Hudson County Sheriff Frank Schillari and Hudson County Freeholder Anthony Romano were also on hand.\n\nU.S. Rep. Albio Sires has also championed a ban tourist helicopter.\n\nFifteen minutes into the press conference, DeGise pointed out that nine helicopters had flown nearby, forcing several officials to pause and wait.\n\nHowever, \u201cStop the Chop\u201d advocacy group leader Brian Wagner thanked the helicopter industry for \u201cturning up the noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only Friday,\u201d he said. \u201cCome back tomorrow when there\u2019s two, three, four times the activity starting at 9 a.m.\u201d\n\nZimmer added that the quality of life has been severely diminished for those living and working along both sides of the Hudson.\n\n\u201cNew York didn\u2019t want them,\u201d she said. \u201cNew Jersey doesn\u2019t want them either.\u201d\n\nWith the help of New York and New Jersey state senators, local mayors and other county officials, Menendez has been working on a legislative solution for a full ban.\n\n\u201cFAA re-authorization laws last for a certain period of time and then lapse,\u201d he said.\n\nThe renewal of the law would take place early next year, where there will \u201cbe a new FAA law\u201d on tourism helicopters, Menendez said.\n\nIn a letter sent yesterday to the heads of the FAA and NJDOT, Menendez and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and Albio Sires asked the FAA to \u201cprovide guidance on additional authority needed to implement and enforce a ban on tour helicopters that present public nuisance and safety concerns.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hudson-county", "title": "Officials call for ban on tourist helicopters flying over Hudson River", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Officials call for ban on tourist helicopters flying over Hudson River\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/officials_call_for_ban_on_tour.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/08/15577764-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13601990\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-09T07:00:24Z\", \"author\": \"Amanda Eisenberg | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"hudson-county\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/08/15577764-small.jpg", "creator": "@aeis17", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Joined by a bi-state coalition of New York and New Jersey officials, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez called for a ban of Hudson River tourist helicopters yesterday morning."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, August 09, 2014,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/08/08/15577764-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"eisenbam\", \"author_nickname\": \"Amanda Eisenberg | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11745654\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Joined by a bi-state coalition of New York and New Jersey officials, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez called for a ban of Hudson River tourist helicopters yesterday morning.", "title": "Officials call for ban on tourist helicopters flying over Hudson River", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/officials_call_for_ban_on_tour.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, August 09, 2014,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Amanda Eisenberg | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "Joined by a bi-state coalition of New York and New Jersey officials, U.S. Senator Robert Menendez called for a ban of Hudson River tourist helicopters yesterday morning."}, "article_summary": "Hudson County Executive Thomas DeGise, Hudson County Sheriff Frank Schillari and Hudson County Freeholder Anthony Romano were also on hand.\nFor the past 18 months, Hudson County residents have been trying to work with helicopter operators based in lower Manhattan, the state\u2019s Dept.\nSenator Robert Menendez called for a ban of Hudson River tourist helicopters yesterday morning.\nThe renewal of the law would take place early next year, where there will \u201cbe a new FAA law\u201d on tourism helicopters, Menendez said.\nUnlike an airport, there\u2019s no limitation on the number of flights, Menendez said."}
