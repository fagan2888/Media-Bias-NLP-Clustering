They hope to lessen memories of the beginnings of HealthCare.gov \u2014 a launch in October so problem-ridden that many people were thwarted as they tried to sign up, compelling President Obama to apologize.\n\nBy early spring, when the first sign-up period ended, 5.4 million people had chosen health plans through the federal exchange and nearly 3 million more through 14 separate state-run marketplaces \u2014 more than anticipated. But uncertainty has lingered over how well people like their new health plans, how many are continuing to pay the monthly premiums, and what will happen in the fall once the second enrollment season opens Nov. 15.\n\nBut the rules proposed Thursday will not allow everyone to enroll automatically, and in fact may mask messy subtleties that could end up requiring many people to return to HealthCare.gov, after all, according to several health policy specialists.\n\nThe wrinkles stem, in part, from a main difference between the new federal insurance marketplace and routines elsewhere in the health-insurance industry. While renewing coverage each year is a common experience, the federal exchange has an added layer of complexity because the 2010 health-care law that created it also provided for the first time for Americans well into the middle class to receive federal tax credits to help them afford private insurance policies.\n\nAccording to federal figures, 87 percent of the people in the federal insurance marketplace are receiving subsidies. On average, the tax credits are $264 per month, lowering monthly premiums from $346 to $82. The amount of help families get depends on their income.\n\nUnder the proposed rules, the government will renew people\u2019s insurance with their subsidy intact only for consumers who gave permission for the insurance exchange to check their tax records to make sure their reported income is accurate. Federal officials said that about 100,000 applicants during the first sign-up period did not provide such permission, so their coverage would be renewed for the coming year without any subsidy. They will receive federal notices that they need to reapply if they want their subsidy to continue.\n\nIn general, federal health officials said, continuing people\u2019s current subsidies makes sense because customers in the insurance exchange must report through HealthCare.gov any changes in their incomes within a month of the change \u2014 so the subsidies should be up to date.\n\nBut Robert Laszewski, a consultant who has been critical of the law and has clients across the health-care industry, said that most people with this new insurance do not understand that they need to report income changes to the government. So, in practice, he said: \u201cVirtually everyone is going to have to go back to HealthCare.gov. This is auto-\n\nenrollment in spin only.\u201d\n\nRon Pollack, executive director of the consumer-health lobby Families USA, said the administration\u2019s plan could promote stability, diminishing \u201cchurn\u201d \u2014 people moving in and out of various health plans, which is common in public insurance programs such as Medicaid.\n\nIt is not yet clear how many of the health plans on the federal marketplaces this year will be offered for 2015, or how popular the remaining ones will be, because insurers around the country are in the midst of deciding which plans to offer and at what price. Under the proposed rules, if a plan disappears, consumers would automatically be assigned to the most similar other one offered by the same insurer. If the insurer dropped out entirely from the area in which someone lives, the consumer would be enrolled in the most similar plan available from a different insurer.\n\nPollack noted a possible drawback for consumers to letting HealthCare.gov renew them automatically: The government plans to send notices about this auto-enroll option in late summer or early fall, before the full set of insurance choices is available in many parts of the country. \u201cThey may not have information about other plans that could be selected,\u201d he said \u2014 a particular concern because early evidence suggests that new health plans coming into certain states\u2019 marketplaces may be less expensive than ones already available.\n\nIn a related enrollment decision, federal health officials recently told insurance-industry representatives said that one intended enrollment avenue that was unavailable last year, called \u201cdirect enrollment,\u201d would not be offered during the second enrollment period because the computer capacity will not be ready. In direct enrollment, customers can go to insurance agents and brokers to figure out their subsidies through the exchange and sign up for coverage.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, affordable care act, obamacare, health insurance, heath coverage, health insurance marketplaces, healthcare.gov, hhs, obama health care, fedearl insurance exchange,", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "New rules will try to spare many people to reapply -- but not everyone", "title": "How will the second year sign-up go for HealthCare.gov?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/hhs-sets-enrollment-rules-for-rules-for-year-two-of-obamacare/2014/06/26/ab739d1c-fd2b-11e3-b1f4-8e77c632c07b_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/the-fix/201405/Images/wonk1220.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@goldsteinamy"}, "description": "New rules will try to spare many people to reapply -- but not everyone", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/hhs-sets-enrollment-rules-for-rules-for-year-two-of-obamacare/2014/06/26/ab739d1c-fd2b-11e3-b1f4-8e77c632c07b_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, affordable care act, obamacare, health insurance, heath coverage, health insurance marketplaces, healthcare.gov, hhs, obama health care, fedearl insurance exchange,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "ab739d1c-fd2b-11e3-b1f4-8e77c632c07b"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad28\"", "article_summary": "In a related enrollment decision, federal health officials recently told insurance-industry representatives said that one intended enrollment avenue that was unavailable last year, called \u201cdirect enrollment,\u201d would not be offered during the second enrollment period because the computer capacity will not be ready.\nAccording to federal figures, 87 percent of the people in the federal insurance marketplace are receiving subsidies.\nThe wrinkles stem, in part, from a main difference between the new federal insurance marketplace and routines elsewhere in the health-insurance industry.\nIn direct enrollment, customers can go to insurance agents and brokers to figure out their subsidies through the exchange and sign up for coverage.\nBy early spring, when the first sign-up period ended, 5.4 million people had chosen health plans through the federal exchange and nearly 3 million more through 14 separate state-run marketplaces \u2014 more than anticipated."}
