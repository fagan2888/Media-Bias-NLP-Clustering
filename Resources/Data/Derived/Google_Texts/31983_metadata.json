Jeff Hood (Photo: WFAA)\n\nDENTON, Texas -- At 6 p.m. Tuesday, the Rev. Jeff Hood made his stand against the death penalty.\n\nAt the very moment Adam Ward was being put to death for a 2005 killing of code enforcement officer in Hunt County, the Denton resident, wearing his ministers' robe and stole, strode up to the police line keeping death penalty protesters back.\n\n\u201cI told them I was coming across, and they said, \u2018No, you're not,\u2019\u201d Hood said.\n\nHood spoke to News 8 Thursday after his release from jail. He is a spiritual advisor to several death row inmates. One of them was Juan Garcia, who was executed last fall for the 1998 robbery and killing of a Houston man.\n\nRev. Jeff Hood is led away in handcuffs after crossing a police line in Huntsville to protest a man being given the death penalty.

He says he felt it was something God was leading him to do.\n\nHe wore what he calls his \u201cprotest robe.\" This was not its first protest.\n\nRev. Jeff Hood shows us his \"protest robe.\" (Photo: WFAA)\n\nHe called his wife to let her know that he was going to go through with it. He began to pray and ask God to be with him. He said he kept hearing the last words of Jesus, \u201cLo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my feet started moving, I felt the spirit with me,\" Hood said. \"There was no question.\"\n\nOnce he crossed the line, he says the guard told him he was either going to turn back or to go jail.\n\n\u201cI said, 'I can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Hood said.\n\nRev.

He told him he was Baptist and a follower of Jesus.\n\nOnce he was booked and inside cell at the Walker County jail, he says began worshipping, praying, and singing spiritual songs. He says he specifically prayed for Ward.\n\nHe says he felt God speak to him, telling him, \u201cHe\u2019s OK. He\u2019s with you. You will get a chance to see him again one day.\u201d\n\nHood later learned that was about the time that Ward died.\n\nThe minister was released from jail about 1 a.m. Wednesday. He immediately drove to Austin, where he testified before a legislative committee about immigration issues.\n\nIt\u2019s not Hood\u2019s first arrest.\n\nIn 2015, he was arrested outside the White House at a rally of pastors protesting deportations and again at a Black Lives Matter rally in Dallas. He's been vocal in the quest for justice for Joseph Hutcheson, a man who died last summer in the lobby of the Dallas County jail.\n\n\u201cFor me, I count as a particular burden to keep doing this to show Christians that you can't follow Jesus -- you can't love your neighbor as yourself -- and keep on killing people,\u201d said Hood, who previously headed a social justice ministry at the Cathedral of Hope.\n\nJeff Hood kisses one of his children.

He plans to attend to pay his respects.\n\nCopyright 2016 WFAA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "At the very moment Adam Ward was&nbsp; being put to death for a 2005 killing of code enforcement officer in Hunt County , Rev.
