Officials with the Catholic Diocese of Wichita have met and feel confident it is now safe for the March for Life pilgrims who have been stranded in Washington, D.C. to travel home to the Diocese of Wichita.

After celebration of Holy Mass and a full hot breakfast, the buses will begin leaving Monday morning with scattered departures beginning at 9:15 a.m. from the hotels.

The buses will be traveling in pairs. At this point it is estimated that the first buses should begin arriving home sometime Tuesday afternoon.
