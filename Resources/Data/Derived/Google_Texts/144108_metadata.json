Some of the poetry played fast and loose with facts \u2014 even the National Weather Service described the rains as being \u201cof Biblical proportions\u201d (who knew their record-keeping went so far back?). Some viewers found that, while the raging, ravaging, torrential pictures painted by anchors were amazing, sometimes the information was read too quickly to note the boundaries of neighborhoods affected, minus map graphics. The sound of rushing water minus words was sometimes the most astounding.\n\nIn times of crisis, it\u2019s not easy to balance quick and clear, fact-based reporting with the more flowery descriptions inspired by dramatic events. Official word was: stay in, watch the news.\n\nNotes on the media deluge:\n\nKMGH and KUSA stayed with the story longest, delivering new information well after KDVR gave up and went with \u201cTMZ\u201d and KCNC gave in to \u201cThe Young and the Restless.\u201d\n\nLongtime Colorado broadcasters gave the best geographic reference points of road closures and what we were seeing in helicopter shots. Greg Moss was helpful in that respect. Among the more poetic standouts: Will Ripley and Kyle Clark of 9News. Steadfast in the field: Tyler Lopez and Lance Hernandez of 7News.\n\nSpeaking of helicopter shots, \u201cAirtracker 7\u201d and \u201cSky9\u201d are the same bird, part of the ongoing sharing arrangement, a cost-saving measure by the two stations. The need to keep airspace clear for search and rescue flights kept the chopper close to the Denver metro area, rather than conveying pictures of the hardest-hit areas.\n\nKellie Patterson survived a trial by fire (ie. water) in her first week on the air. Patterson, the new 7News morning anchor, more than held her own during extended hours of breaking news.\n\nAt a press conference, Gov. Hickenlooper noted the prevalence of personal media getting in the way, warning folks with cellphones to knock off the picture-taking in deadly circumstances. \u201cPeople have their media and want to get a better shot,\u201d he said, shaking his head.\n\nMeterologists worked overtime to give an idea of what was falling from the skies. \u201cAn inch or two an hour\u201d of rain, Dave Fraser said. Where Kathy Sabine clocked it at \u201ca year\u2019s worth of precip in two days\u2019 time.\u201d Which sounds wetter?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado,Colorado flood,Dave Fraser,Denver,flooding,Gov.
