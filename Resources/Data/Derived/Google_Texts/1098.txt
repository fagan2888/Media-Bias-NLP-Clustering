It was too much Quer'Derius Hunter for the Stratford Spartans on Friday evening as the Pope John Paul II High junior running back exploded for 123 yards and five touchdowns in a dominant second quarter to send the Knights on to a 59-34 victory in the two teams' season opener at the Jim Carrell Athletic Complex.

"The line was blocking perfect," said Hunter. "I just followed them to the hole."

Hunter, who only played in the first half, finished the game with 158 yards on 19 carries.

"Quer'Derius always runs hard," said PJP II head coach Jerry Joslin. "He had some good holes from the offensive line."

Once he was in the Stratford secondary, he continued to run aggressively, running over defenders and breaking tackles.

The Knights have switched to a zone-read offense this year, and it fits Hunter's style, he said.

"The new offense helps me get downhill quickly and get to open space where I can use my athleticism," said Hunter.

When Hunter was piling up the yards and touchdowns in the second quarter, his coaches told him to continue to run hard and keep encouraging the offensive line.

"I thought the second quarter there were a lot of good things that happened," Joslin said.

The Knights started the quarter trailing 6-0 after Stratford struck for a 51-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Josh Trueheart to Corey Simmons.

The extra-point kick failed.

Then the Knights' offense and Hunter got rolling.

A short punt set up the Knights at the Stratford 30 yard line. That led to Hunter's first touchdown, a 12-yard run with 10:37 left in the half.

Hunter followed that with touchdown runs of 12, 19, 11 and 3 yards. Along the way he had a 37-yard run that set up his second score.

The last score of the half, a 3-yard run by Hunter, was set up by a 39-yard pass completion from sophomore quarterback Ben Brooks to classmate C.J. Laws with 45 seconds left in the half.

Opening the second half with a 35-6 lead, the Knights started resting their offensive starters to get their young backups more experience. Stratford took advantage to score four second-half touchdowns, including a 92-yard scoring dash by Corey Simmons and a 45-yard interception return by Trevaughn Hatcher.

"We tried to get everybody in, but that's no excuse," Joslin said. "We've got to be able to tackle and control the clock. We're just trying to get better at the fundamentals of football."

PJP II was able to hold off the Spartans in the second half with a 9-yard touchdown run from sophomore Jermaine Mason, a 20-yard scoring dash from sophomore Jamaal Thompson, a 12-yard fumble return by sophomore Jordan Weems and a 38-yard field goal by junior Jackson Morris, who also put all 10 of his kickoffs in the end zone for touchbacks.

"My kicker had a good night," Joslin said.

Hunter was followed in rushing by Thompson, who gained 75 yards and a touchdown. The Knights rushed for 265 yards for the game.

Stratford was led by Simmons with 166 yards and one rushing touchdown on 11 carries.

Brooks threw for 130 yards on 7 of 10 passing. The Knights amassed 408 yards in total offense.

Mason led the JPII receivers with 55 yards on three catches.

The Knights travel to Fayetteville on Friday to face Lincoln County.

"We don't know much about them other than Lincoln County is always a tough, hard-nosed football team," Joslin said.
