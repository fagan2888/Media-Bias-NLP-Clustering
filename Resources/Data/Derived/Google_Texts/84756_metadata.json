It could pay for some renovations to a home, it could be used to consolidate credit card debt or for any number of things. It is also, according to experts, more than enough to fund multiple acts of terror.\n\nThe possibility that Farook and Malik may have funded their attacks solely through personal assets and credit appears to be part of a trend that sees terror cells moving away from reliance on overseas networks in favor of self-funding.\n\nLast year, in a detailed study of the funding sources for 40 European jihadi terror cells, the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment determined that the great majority were reliant on the members themselves to generate funds.\n\n\u201cJihadis who have plotted attacks in Western Europe most commonly relied on funding from the cell members\u2019 own salaries and savings,\u201d the study found. \u201cThe vast majority of the cells studied (90 percent) were involved in income-generating activities, and half of them were entirely self-financed.\n\nRelated: The West can Defeat ISIS \u2013 But What Comes Next?\n\n\u201cOnly one in four received economic support from international terrorist organizations such as al-Qaida. Over time, there has been a decline in the proportion of cells that receive support from organized terrorist groups and support networks, and a corresponding increase in cells that are self-financed through legal activities.\u201d\n\nThe report also confirmed that most of the cells were engaged in operations that could be funded for the price of a reasonably nice used car.\n\n\u201cFinally, jihadi terrorist attacks in Western Europe have generally been cheap, with three quarters of the plots studied estimated to cost less than $10,000. \u201c\n\nProsper, the lender that approved the loan to the two killers, pointed out in a statement to the media that it had followed all applicable requirements when processing the loan. \u201cAll loans originated through the Prosper platform are subject to all identity verification and screening procedures required by law, including US anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws. As part of our standard procedures, we also confirm that all loan funds are disbursed into a verified US bank account in the borrower's name. Like all Americans, Prosper is shocked and saddened by recent events in San Bernardino.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban Made Him and Easy Target \u2013 but Don\u2019t Count Him Out Yet\n\nBy all accounts, there wasn\u2019t any obvious reason why Farook and Malik would have triggered any warnings at Prosper or any other financial institution, since they weren\u2019t on federal watch lists.\n\nThe troubling thing here, if the loan was used to fund part of the attack, is how mundane the whole thing was. The fact is that anybody in the U.S. with a high enough limit on his or her visa card or a reasonably good credit score can gather the financial resources to fund a terrorist attack.\n\nFunding sources for the typical terror cell in Europe are \u201cremarkably ordinary,\u201d the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment found. And that\u2019s a problem for officials looking to protect the public, whose work to shut down terrorist organizations\u2019 access to the international financial system may have worked too well.\n\n\u201cThe decline in support from international terrorist organizations and support networks may partly be explained by the introduction of stricter financial controls and regulations that have made it more difficult for al-Qaida and its affiliates to raise money and transfer them to local cells,\u201d the report found. \u201cIn this respect, existing counter terrorist financing (CTF) measures may be considered a success.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why the Republican Party Is Terrified of Trump\n\n\u201cHowever, the recent development towards increased self-financing based on legal income sources is worrying from the perspective of prevention. Many European terrorist cells now raise the necessary funds through methods that are difficult to identify as being related to terrorism. \u2026 [I]t is important to recognize that terrorists are flexible and adapt to the policies imposed. There is a constant need for reassessment of countermeasures, taking into account how today\u2019s terrorists actually fund their activities.\u201d\n\nWhen terror can be funded by maxing out a couple of credit cards, though, it\u2019s hard to see what countermeasures might be effective.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The news about", "title": "How Terrorists Are Using Cheap Credit to Fund Their Attacks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/09/How-Terrorists-Are-Using-Cheap-Credit-Fund-Their-Attacks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/creditcards_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/09/How-Terrorists-Are-Using-Cheap-Credit-Fund-Their-Attacks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/creditcards_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The news about", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFinally, jihadi terrorist attacks in Western Europe have generally been cheap, with three quarters of the plots studied estimated to cost less than $10,000.\nMany European terrorist cells now raise the necessary funds through methods that are difficult to identify as being related to terrorism.\nIt is also, according to experts, more than enough to fund multiple acts of terror.\nThe troubling thing here, if the loan was used to fund part of the attack, is how mundane the whole thing was.\nIt could pay for some renovations to a home, it could be used to consolidate credit card debt or for any number of things."}
