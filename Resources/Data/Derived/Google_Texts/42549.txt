ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- Complaints have been popping up on the Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina Facebook page.



Many customers say they've called the company with issues to spend hours on hold, others say their bills for the December or January are incorrect. Some complain that they have yet to receive an insurance card from the company after paying this month's premium last month.



A spokesperson from BCBSNC apologized for the problems on Friday, saying the company has been experiencing an influx of calls over the last seven days.



The Affordable Care Act requires plans to be renewed before or by January, and anyone who waited until the last minute is now trying to get issues resolved.



The company said Friday that employees are now working overtime to sort through all of the complaints. BCBSNC suggested customers refer to the company's blog for tips on how best to resolve issues right now.



Among other suggestions, the blog says individuals should avoid calling on Mondays or around lunch time, that's when the call volume - and the hold times - are longest.
