TOPSHAM, Maine — The Topsham Hannaford issued a recall of ground beef purchased between 7 a.m. and 1:45 p.m. Saturday after metal shavings were found in the meat grinder.

The ground beef affected includes 90-, 85- and 73-percent fat ground beef, according to Chris Cromwell, who works in the store’s meat department.

He said employees discovered metal shavings in the grinder, and a recall was issued within minutes.

Apparently metal clips that close larger containers of ground beef fell off the bag and into the grinder, Cromwell said.

“We immediately pulled all the ground beef,” he said

On Saturday morning, Cromwell said several packages had been returned to the store, but no complaints had been taken.
