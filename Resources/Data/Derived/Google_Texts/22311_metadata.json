He would be sentenced to probation, stripped of his power as House speaker, resign from the Legislature and nearly lose his livelihood when the insurer for whom he was an agent dropped him.\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Harrell agreed to cooperate with any state and federal investigations into corruption in South Carolina government, prompting many to believe his conviction was the beginning of a new, more honest and transparent era at the Statehouse.\n\nExcept it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe Legislature didn\u2019t pass ethics reform so that lawmakers aren\u2019t policing their own conduct. No more indictments followed.\n\nAnd aside from being told by a House ethics panel last week that he owed the state about $113,000 for improperly using campaign funds to pay his defense attorneys, Harrell has stayed out of the public eye while quietly rebuilding his West Ashley insurance business as an independent agent.\n\nFor government watchdogs, like John Crangle of Common Cause and Ashley Landess of the South Carolina Policy Council, who pressured authorities into looking into Harrell\u2019s expenditures, it\u2019s been a frustrating year.\n\n\u201cI, like a lot of other South Carolinians, thought that there were going to be more heads to roll,\u201d Crangle said. \u201cAnd that Harrell was going to be the first of several corrupt politicians that were going to go down. But nobody has gone down yet.\u201d\n\nSaid Landess, \u201cBobby Harrell was far from the only one clearly using his office to benefit himself. The plea agreement suggested there was more to come. I don\u2019t think that alone was the driver of the expectation. We were told that there would be a broader investigation.\u201d\n\n\u2018Dropped the football\u2019\n\nA heavily redacted report released late last year by the State Law Enforcement Division indicated several other lawmakers were under suspicion.\n\nBut nothing happened until July, when state Attorney General Alan Wilson\u2019s office acknowledged in emails and letters that its investigation into corruption in state government had not progressed in the months following Harrell\u2019s conviction.\n\nIn August, Wilson\u2019s office handed off the part of the investigation involving lawmakers to 1st Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe, the same Democratic prosecutor who took over the probe and indicted Harrell last year.\n\nThat astounded Crangle, who questioned why it wasn\u2019t reassigned sooner.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on over there when the guy that is supposed to be conducting the investigation doesn\u2019t get the assignment for 10 months?\u201d Crangle said. \u201cSomebody dropped the football there.\u201d\n\nMark Powell, the attorney general\u2019s spokesman, dismissed Crangle\u2019s criticism, saying he is \u201cnot in a position to know what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Crangle has not bothered to meet with the Attorney General\u2019s Office in well over a year to discuss this matter, and how the legal process works,\u201d Powell said.\n\nWhile initially taken by surprise by the handoff, Pascoe has said he intends to move forward with the investigation after reviewing the evidence provided by SLED.\n\nNonetheless, Crangle is worried Pascoe, who is responsible for prosecuting a myriad of crimes in his jurisdiction, including several high-profile homicides, doesn\u2019t have the cash or the manpower to complete the investigation.\n\nHarrell declined to comment on his conviction or the ongoing investigation. He said he had moved on from his Statehouse life and was concentrating on his business.\n\n\u201cMy family and I are working hard and enjoying life these days,\u201d he said in a previous email from last month. \u201cThat\u2019s really all I have to say.\u201d\n\nLast week, he got pulled back in, however, when the House ethics panel hit him with an expensive judgment. Expecting his first grandchild\u2019s arrival, Harrell said he only found out about the meeting when he was called by reporters seeking comment.\n\n\u201cI am told the committee met and discussed my campaign disclosure reports,\u201d Harrell said in a written statement Tuesday. \u201cIn that meeting, the committee accused me of violating campaign laws, decided that I had done so, and took action. All of this was done without any notice to me of the meeting and without affording me the opportunity to be heard by the committee. This was a clear violation of my due process rights.\u201d\n\nIf you ask Landess, however, Harrell \u201cgot off very easy\u201d because the state\u2019s ethics laws are so weak. And the Legislature has done little to ensure none of it happens again, she said.\n\nThe only major bill that became law because of Harrell\u2019s case was one that restricted the ability of judges to block prosecutors from using grand juries as investigative tools. The House also passed a series of ethics-related bills early on during the 2015 legislative session, but they all died in the Senate. And the Senate\u2019s omnibus reform bill died, as well.\n\nHouse Speaker Jay Lucas, R-Hartsville, declined to comment for this story.\n\nGov. Nikki Haley has also made ethics reform a cornerstone of her second term, but has failed to get a majority behind her as well.\n\n\u2018Weak excuse for reform\u2019\n\nLandess was happy to see them fail.\n\n\u201cEvery one of those bills was a weak excuse for reform,\u201d Landess said. \u201cWhat legislators were trying to do was ... create the appearance of reform while at the same time giving themselves loopholes. The entire ethics act is a sham, a disgrace, clearly written to protect the most powerful politicians.\u201d\n\nLandess said she and other organizations will continue to push for reforms that will clean up the state. She added that the public is more aware than ever about the concentration of power in Columbia.\n\nBut keeping the public\u2019s interest on the subject long enough to enact change can prove difficult, said Gibbs Knotts, a political science professor at the College of Charleston. People, in general, tend to have short attention spans.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things competing for the public\u2019s attention,\u201d Knotts said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay focused on politics, much less stay focused on a specific issue related to politics. I don\u2019t think this is something that every day, your average citizen thinks a lot about and focuses on trying to get policy changed.\u201d\n\nA series of scandals involving public officials \u2014 Harrell, former Lt. Gov. Ken Ard, ex-state Sen. Robert Ford and then-Gov. Mark Sanford \u2014 have all eroded trust in government, Knotts added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s people who are familiar and got elected with the current system who are the ones who have to change it,\u201d Knotts said. \u201cThat\u2019s always a challenge when you\u2019re trying to get people to change something they came up with and are now in a position of power.\u201d\n\nSchuyler Kropf contributed to this report.
