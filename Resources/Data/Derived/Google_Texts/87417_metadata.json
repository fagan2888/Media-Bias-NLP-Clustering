The tens of thousands who endured perilous journeys to get here find more work opportunities than in Indonesia and a more Muslim-friendly environment than in Thailand.\n\nBut in the 25 years since Hamid Hussein Abul Khair arrived, that promise has been worn away by the statelessness and poverty that have never left him.\n\nRohingya face a tenuous existence here, unable to legally work because Malaysia, like Thailand and Indonesia, doesn\u2019t recognize asylum seekers and refugees and has not signed the U.N. Refugee Convention. They mostly scrape by on dirty or dangerous jobs shunned by Malaysians, live in squalid conditions and have no access to free health care and state-run schools.\n\nFor many Rohingya, even living on the margins of Malaysian society is a step forward. But those who have been here for years yearn for something better \u2014 at least for their children.\n\n\u201cGod willing, we can make a living here. We are thankful to Malaysia but what future do we have? My children can\u2019t get citizenship, they have no formal education and they can\u2019t get proper jobs,\u201d Hamid, 54, said in his austere apartment on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nDenied citizenship by Myanmar and chased off their land in repeated outbreaks of communal violence, the 1.3 million Rohingya there have been identified by the U.N. as one of the world\u2019s most persecuted minorities. Some 140,000 have been displaced from their homes, and many live in camps. Myanmar regards them as illegal migrants from Bangladesh, even though many have lived in the country for generations.\n\nThe desperation of the Rohingya has been highlighted in recent weeks by boatloads of people from Myanmar and Bangladesh stranded in Malacca Strait waters after their traffickers abandoned them near the end of risky 1,700-kilometer (1,000-mile) voyages amid a clampdown by local authorities. Some 3,500 came ashore in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, but many of those now at shelters say their goal was to get to Malaysia.\n\nNearly 46,000 Rohingya in Malaysia have been registered as refugees by the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, and there are an estimated 40,000 more whose status has yet to be assessed. Obtaining a U.N. refugee card generally protects people from arrest.\n\nThe economic prosperity, Islamic culture and the large population of Rohingya in Malaysia are all pull factors.\n\n\u201cMalaysia is a modern Muslim urban society, with a booming construction business and economy. As a place of income, it\u2019s many times better than where they come from. In terms of security, although it\u2019s not easy with risks of arrests and exploitation, it\u2019s still significantly better than what they have left behind,\u201d said Richard Towle, the UNHCR representative in Malaysia.\n\nRefugees from Myanmar make up the biggest chunk of the more than 150,000 asylum seekers and refugees in Malaysia, one of the highest numbers in Asia, according to the UNHCR. The country has no refugee camps, so they live as \u201curban refugees\u201d in shantytown settlements, cramped low-cost flats or isolated houses where they work on construction sites, restaurants, factories and plantations.\n\nNurjan Nur Mohamad, an 18-year-old Rohingya woman who arrived in Malaysia two months ago after a dangerous boat journey, said that while she is afraid of getting arrested, she is also extremely relieved to have left behind the threats and violence of Myanmar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rohingya seek better life in Malaysia, but reality is stark", "title": "Rohingya seek better life in Malaysia, but reality is stark", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rohingya seek better life in Malaysia, but reality is stark", "title": "Rohingya seek better life in Malaysia, but reality is stark", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/26/rohingya_seek_better_life_in_malaysia_but_reality_is_stark/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/rohingya-choosing-malaysia.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rohingya seek better life in Malaysia, but reality is stark", "title": "Rohingya seek better life in Malaysia, but reality is stark", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/rohingya-choosing-malaysia.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eileen Ng", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Some 3,500 came ashore in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, but many of those now at shelters say their goal was to get to Malaysia.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 Malaysia has been a sort of promised land for Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar.\nThe economic prosperity, Islamic culture and the large population of Rohingya in Malaysia are all pull factors.\nRohingya face a tenuous existence here, unable to legally work because Malaysia, like Thailand and Indonesia, doesn\u2019t recognize asylum seekers and refugees and has not signed the U.N.\nNearly 46,000 Rohingya in Malaysia have been registered as refugees by the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, and there are an estimated 40,000 more whose status has yet to be assessed."}
