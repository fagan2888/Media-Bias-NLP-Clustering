Ted Cruz in the Iowa Republican caucus, presidential candidate Donald Trump took several swipes at Cruz during a campaign rally Wednesday evening in Arkansas\u2019 capital city.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a president who was born in Canada, do we?\u201d Trump said, a reference to Cruz\u2019s birth in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Cruz\u2019s father was born in Cuba and his mother in the U.S.\n\nSpeaking at the mostly full Barton Coliseum, a 10,000-seat arena at the Arkansas State Fairgrounds, Trump accused the Cruz campaign of misleading Iowa voters into believing that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race and that not participating in the caucus would be a violation.\n\n\u201cThis political stuff is dangerous, and these political people are really, really dishonest,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also said Cruz has dishonestly claimed that Trump \u201cloves Obamacare,\u201d even though he has pledged to repeal it. He said Cruz helped get John Roberts confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Roberts later became the swing vote when the court voted to uphold most of the health-care law.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz gave us Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz was not yet a senator when Roberts was confirmed in 2005, but as solicitor general of Texas, he advocated for Roberts\u2019 confirmation.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech drew frequent cheers from supporters, but it also was interrupted several times by shouting protesters who were then removed by security guards. Trump sometimes heckled his hecklers.\n\n\u201cYou see these people who shout, they\u2019re usually lonely and by themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside the arena, protesters lined the street holding signs with slogans such as \u201cLove trumps hate\u201d and chanting, \u201cHate is not great! Get it out of our state!\u201d\n\nTrump said he is confident about Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary, where recent polls have shown him with a strong lead. He said he was happy to be in Little Rock, where he said a friend, whom he did not name, once received excellent care for cancer.\n\nTrump stirred up the crowd by pledging to fight illegal immigration from Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do at the border, folks?\u201d he asked\n\nThe audience began chanting, \u201cBuild a wall! Build a wall!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s gonna pay for that wall?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cMexico!\u201d the crowd yelled.\n\nTrump said that as president he would end America\u2019s trade imbalance with China, which he called \u201cthe single greatest theft in the history of the world,\u201d by making better trade deals than the Obama administration has made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not angry at China. I\u2019m angry at our leaders for being so damn stupid,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump told the crowd he would not hold back in bombing terrorists overseas.\n\n\u201cWe gotta get ISIS out of there. We gotta knock the shit out of them,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the end of his speech, Trump took a few questions from the audience. One person said he was taking his finals at Arkansas State University when police responded to a possible shooter on campus and asked Trump if he would get rid of gun-free zones. Trump said he would.\n\nAnother audience member asked Trump if he would protect Christian churches\u2019 tax-exempt status. Trump said he would.\n\n\u201cChristianity is under siege. \u2026 You can\u2019t say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 anymore. If I win, folks, we\u2019re all going to be saying \u2018Merry Christmas,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe rally was Trump\u2019s second campaign stop in Arkansas since announcing as a presidential candidate. He spoke at a Republican fundraiser in Hot Springs in July.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Two days after coming in second to Texas Sen.
