The court will deal with several political issues, among them, affirmative action, voting rights and labor unions.\n\nFor what to look for in the months ahead, we are joined, as always, by Marcia Coyle of \u201cThe National Law Journal.\u201d\n\nWelcome back to the program, Marcia.\n\nMARCIA COYLE, The National Law Journal: Thanks, Judy. It\u2019s good to be back.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, it is developing into a pretty big term.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: It is, and not only the cases that the court has already agreed to hear, but there are some big ones waiting in the wings that the justices are likely to add to this term\u2019s docket.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you were just telling me that there\u2019s a lot of conversations, before we get into some of the specifics, that this \u2014 a lot of conversation about how this could turn out to be a more conservative term than the last one.\n\nWhat did you mean by that?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, so much of a term\u2019s character depends on the nature of the cases that the justices take, but it also depends on if those cases are controversial and the court is likely to split ideologically, Justice Kennedy is in the middle. He\u2019s the swing vote. And he tends to vote conservative more than he does to the left on certain issues.\n\nAnd those certain issues are on the docket, as you mentioned, affirmative action, voting, First Amendment, unions.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let\u2019s tackle a few of those, and let\u2019s start with affirmative action. This is Fisher vs. the University of Texas.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Right.\n\nThe University of Texas uses race as one of something like 17 different factors in its admissions policies. Its goal is to achieve broader diversity. This is the second time this case has come to the courts. But, several terms ago, the court sent it back to the lower courts because it believed that the lower courts hadn\u2019t applied strict scrutiny, that is, that it hadn\u2019t found \u2014 it hadn\u2019t first looked at whether race-neutral alternatives were used by the university before using race.\n\nWent back to the lower court. The lower court once again said, this program passes constitutional muster. Comes back up to the Supreme Court. And, apparently, there are four justices, because you only need the votes of four, who still want to look at the use of race to achieve diversity in higher education.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, as you say, the second time before the court.\n\nAnother Texas case, Marcia, this one on political redistricting, one person, one vote.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Right.\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to believe that the principle of one person, one vote is now before the Supreme Court in a very basic way. How should you count people in order to get to one person, one vote in legislative districts?\n\nThe state of Texas, in fact, just about every single state counts total population in order to get to that. But the challengers in this case say, no, you really should count voting population, eligible voters. And the reason it has politically high stakes is if you go with voting population, that tends to benefit rural areas, where people do vote more and they tend \u2014 trend to vote Republican.\n\nIf you do it on total population, which includes not only voters, but non-citizens, they tend to trend Democratic in voting.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So you\u2019re going to capture a bigger group, including\u2026\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Right. Exactly.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And it raises probably some questions about\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Favored cities, yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, another case that we know is coming up has to do with public sector labor unions and individuals who are not paying members, dues-paying members of these unions, but who may receive benefits.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, back in 1977, the Supreme Court decided a case in which it had to strike a balance between the First Amendment rights of non-union members, as well as unions\u2019 rights. When they engage in collective bargaining, the benefits of collective bargaining also go to the non-union members in the public sector.\n\nAnd the unions look at that as free-riding. And so the Supreme Court says the First Amendment rights of non-union members really aren\u2019t hindered if they contribute to the cost of collective bargaining, but they don\u2019t have to pay for the unions\u2019 non-collective bargaining activities, like political lobbying, speech, things like that.\n\nBut in the case before the Supreme Court, the court is being asked to overrule that 1977 decision and eliminate the fees that non-union members pay to unions. So, the stakes are very high for public sector unions, which remain the largest unions in the country.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And the other thing, Marcia, as you have told us, there are a couple of cases that are, in your words, in the wings, potentially really controversial cases.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Yes.\n\nYes, there are two petitions pending, two cases pending right now involving abortion clinics and restrictions on how those clinics operate. This goes to the sort of art of the abortion right. How do you determine what is an undue burden on a woman\u2019s right to abortion? Do these restrictions or regulations, are they an undue burden and, thus, unconstitutional?\n\nAnd in the second group of cases, there are seven right now and there probably will be more, come from religious nonprofits who are objecting to how the government accommodate their objections to contraceptive health insurance.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it\u2019s enough to keep you very, very busy this term.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Potentially a very big term, Judy.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia Coyle, thank you. We look forward to seeing you again soon.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: My pleasure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the start of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, Marcia Coyle of the National Law Journal joins Judy Woodruff to talk about some of the issues to be tested, including affirmative action, voting rights and unions.", "pubdate": 20151005, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "With the start of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, Marcia Coyle of the National Law Journal joins Judy Woodruff to talk about some of the issues to be tested, including affirmative action, voting rights and unions.", "title": "Why the Supreme Court may swing right on key issues this session", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-491435480.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/supreme-court-may-swing-right-key-issues-session/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "With the start of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, Marcia Coyle of the National Law Journal joins Judy Woodruff to talk about some of the issues to be tested, including affirmative action, voting rights and unions.", "title": "Why the Supreme Court may swing right on key issues this session", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-491435480.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "voting rights"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "abortion, affirmative action, Supreme Court, Supreme Court watch, unions, voting rights"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35c7\"", "article_summary": "JUDY WOODRUFF: It\u2019s the first Monday in October, and that means the Supreme Court kicks off its new term.\nComes back up to the Supreme Court.\nMARCIA COYLE: Right.\nAnd it\u2019s hard to believe that the principle of one person, one vote is now before the Supreme Court in a very basic way.\nBut in the case before the Supreme Court, the court is being asked to overrule that 1977 decision and eliminate the fees that non-union members pay to unions."}
