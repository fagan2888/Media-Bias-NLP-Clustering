law.\n\nThe Diocese is challenging its participation in the health care program because it would be required to provide its employees with contraceptives.\n\nThere were strong words earlier this month from Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese leader Bishop David Zubik as he testified in federal court on the issue.\n\nKDKA Radio\u2019s Joe DeStio has reaction to the temporary injunction:\n\n\n\nDiocese Federal Lawsuit playpause\n\nBishop Zubik told the court: \u201cThe issue with the services in the mandate is that they either go against preservation of human life or involve the actual taking of human life.\u201d\n\nChurches are exempt from the mandate, but charitable organizations, including Pittsburgh Catholic Charities, were not.\n\nBishop Zubik told the court this is a problem because, \u201cthe practice of charity has to reflect the teaching of the church.\u201d\n\nBoth Bishop Zubik and Cardinal Timothy Dolan called the services at issue \u201cevil\u201d and say by giving employees access to those services, the Diocese would be \u201cfacilitating scandal.\u201d\n\nThe judge in the case writes that this is a preliminary injunction.\n\nSome experts believe the U.S. Supreme Court will make the final decision.\n\nStay with KDKA for more on this developing story.\n\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nPittsburgh Catholic Diocese Challenging Affordable Care Act (11/12/13)\n\nMore News about the
