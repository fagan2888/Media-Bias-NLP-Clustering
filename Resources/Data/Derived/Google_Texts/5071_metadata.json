Sopko, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), whose office uncovered the wasteful spending \u2013 as a platform to bolster her fiscal bona fides to conservative voters back home.\n\nRelated: The $43 Million Afghan Gas Station Scandal Blows the Lid Off Pentagon Waste\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who previously referred to the task force as a \"slush fund,\" chided the Pentagon on Wednesday for not thoroughly responding to a request he made for the task force\u2019s documents.\n\n\u201cThis response is incomplete and inadequate,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt ignores my request for the task force records. That\u2019s unsatisfactory. The Defense Department needs to address the request and provide me the documents I requested.\u201d\n\nGrassley said the department\u2019s reply \u201cis lacking in other ways,\u201d noting it says the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general denied a request for an audit of the redevelopment task force.\n\n\u201cThat raises many questions about why the Defense Department simply didn't direct the inspector general to conduct such an audit,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon's $766 Million Afghan 'Slush Fund' Comes Under Scrutiny\n\nGrassley also took the department to task for claiming that a promotion for the Army colonel who blew the whistle on the task force had been held up due to \u201cadministrative oversight.\"\n\n\u201cThis is a superficial response that requires much more accounting from the Defense Department. I\u2019ve conveyed my lack of satisfaction with the response to the Defense Department. I intend to continue pursuing answers,\u201d he said.\n\nGrassley might get his chance at next month\u2019s hearing. Besides Sopko, lawmakers will also hear from Brian McKeon, principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy and the author of the lackluster response to the Iowa Republican.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Grassley decides to sit in on the proceedings and pose some questions to McKeon face to face. Depending on McKeon\u2019s answers, this fiscal feud between Capitol Hill and the Pentagon could be just beginning.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Senate lawmakers are ratcheting up their investigation into the Pentagon\u2019s special economic development team for Afghanistan that spent $43 million to build a gas station in the county and another $150 million on private villas and security guards.", "title": "What's Inside the Pentagon\u2019s $800 Million Afghanistan \u2018Slush Fund\u2019?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/11/Pentagon-s-800-Million-Afghanistan-Slush-Fund-Will-Get-Closer-Look", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05012014_Afghanistan_Poppy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/11/Pentagon-s-800-Million-Afghanistan-Slush-Fund-Will-Get-Closer-Look", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05012014_Afghanistan_Poppy.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Senate lawmakers are ratcheting up their investigation into the Pentagon\u2019s special economic development team for Afghanistan that spent $43 million to build a gas station in the county and another $150 million on private villas and security guards.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat raises many questions about why the Defense Department simply didn't direct the inspector general to conduct such an audit,\u201d he said.\nI\u2019ve conveyed my lack of satisfaction with the response to the Defense Department.\n\u201cThis is a superficial response that requires much more accounting from the Defense Department.\nSenate lawmakers are ratcheting up their investigation into the Pentagon\u2019s special economic development team for Afghanistan that spent $43 million to build a gas station and another $150 million on private villas and security guards.\n\u201cIt ignores my request for the task force records."}
