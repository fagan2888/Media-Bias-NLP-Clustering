She says she worries about what will happen if some of the most vulnerable students in the district lose support and warned school board members that things could get bad.\n\n\u201cMany of my students do not speak English, do not have a parent that speaks English,\u201d Bernoski said. \u201cWe are the case managers, the refugee liaisons, the immigration collectors and the parent to communicate with. I will tell you that dropout rates will increase and graduation rates will dramatically reduce.\u201d\n\nASD officials rolled out the proposed 2014-2015 budget Tuesday. Under the plan, the district will cut more than 200 positions, more than half of them teaching positions. Administration and support positions will also be eliminated. In addition, high school schedules will now have seven periods, instead of six to save money.\n\nAllison Haynes, a sophomore at West High School, says she\u2019s concerned that the change will compromise her education.\n\n\u201cA seven-period day will not allow for the kind of time that is needed for intense, higher-level classes, or any class for that matter, to be taught effectively,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cI am currently in calculus, AP U.S. History and HG English. I see no way that my wonderful, dedicated teachers could possibly deliver the same quality of instruction in a 42 minute period.\u201d\n\nOfficials say cost drivers include: group medical coverage, the Affordable Care Act, new state technology requirements for online testing and teacher evaluations, liability and self-insurance and natural gas prices.\n\nGovernor Sean Parnell is recommending a base student allocation increase of $200 over three years, an increase of about one percent per year. School Board President Tam Agosti-Gisler says that\u2019s not enough.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asked, what would we need in order to stop our budget gap this year, in terms of dollar increase to the base student allocation and that is estimated at about $250 increase. To catch up with inflation for the last three years and this year, it\u2019s about $400.\u201d\n\nAgosti-Gisler says a long-term solution is needed in the form of an inflation-proof formula for funding Schools.\n\nThe next opportunity for the public to testify on the ASD budget will be Feb. 3. They\u2019ll be one more chance on Feb. 20, when the board will take their final vote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "Anchorage School District officials presented the 2014-15 budget to the Anchorage School Board Thursday evening.
