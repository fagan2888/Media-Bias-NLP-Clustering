Before the zone could be cleared, Carl Soderberg found the Avalanche captain alone in front of Laurent Brossoit and he swiftly tucked the puck around the rookie goaltender.\n\n\u201cI think it started on a lost draw,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cWe were good on the forecheck and both Matthias and Carl made two nice plays that lead to me getting basically a break away from the corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt good, no doubt.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Oilers had difficulty dialing in their aim, when they did, Calvin Pickard was more than up for the task. The Colorado goaltender stopped 26 of the 28 shots he faced.\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Mike Chambers\n\nPickard picked up where he left off in his last game against the Oilers. The 23-year-old stopped 27-of-29 shots in a 3-2 win at Edmonton on Feb. 20.\n\nHis most sensational save Sunday came with nine minutes left in the first period. Oilers rookie Connor McDavid found a trailing Darnell Nurse, who outwaited everything but Pickard\u2019s stick \u2014 which swiped the puck away from the open net.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trusting Pick, he\u2019s been playing really well for us,\u201d coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cHe\u2019s competing out there and he deserves a lot of credit.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something about the Oilers that brings out the best in Tyson Barrie.\n\nThe defenseman extended Colorado\u2019s lead 11:31 into the second period, just as an Oilers penalty expired. Barrie ripped a slap shot that ricocheted off Mark Fayne and past a screened Brossoit for the 2-0 advantage.\n\nThe goal was Barrie\u2019s 13th of the season \u2014 and team-leading sixth point against the Oilers.\n\nEdmonton ruined Pickard\u2019s bid for a shutout in the third period. Oilers winger Matt Hendricks reduced the Avalanche\u2019s lead 2:53 into the frame, receiving a pass from a sprawling Mark Letestu that he slid past Pickard for the gritty winger\u2019s fifth goal of the season.\n\nThe game was put out of reach midway through the final period. On a McDavid high-sticking penalty, Shawn Matthias tipped an Erik Johnson point shot past Brossoit for his fourth goal as a member of the Avalanche.\n\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins tallied with 7.6 seconds left in the game to match the score from the teams\u2019 Feb. 20 meeting.\n\nDespite winning, the Avs were unable to extend their lead over the Minnesota Wild in the race for the final wild-card playoff berth in the Western Conference. Minnesota defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 3-2 in a shootout Sunday.\n\nColorado remains one point ahead of the Wild, with both teams having only nine games remaining.\n\n\u201cOur focus was on making sure we got the two points tonight,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cWe knew that (Minnesota\u2019s game) was tied going into the third, so it will be tight down the stretch.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche returns home after picking up six out of a possible eight points on the road swing. They are back in action Thursday, hosting the Philadelphia Flyers at the Pepsi Center.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche gets big nights from Gabe Landeskog, Calvin Pickard to beat Oilers", "title": "Avalanche gets big nights from Gabe Landeskog, Calvin Pickard to beat Oilers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/20/avalanche-gets-big-nights-from-gabe-landeskog-calvin-pickard-to-beat-oilers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160320__Calvin-Pickardp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160320__Calvin-Pickardp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-20T22:32:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:16:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Gabe Landeskog was excellent in his return to the lineup, scoring the game\u2019s first goal and also contributing an assist.\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Mike ChambersPickard picked up where he left off in his last game against the Oilers.\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA \u2014 The Avalanche completed a road swing through western Canada with a 3-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday night.\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins tallied with 7.6 seconds left in the game to match the score from the teams\u2019 Feb. 20 meeting.\nThe defenseman extended Colorado\u2019s lead 11:31 into the second period, just as an Oilers penalty expired."}
