The mostly Indian nationals are allowed to work here under a visa program called H-1B.\u201d\n\nRight wing pundits are rallying against the move and using it as ammo against President Obama\u2019s immigration reform, and H1-B visas in particular.\n\nComputerworld reports \u201cinformation technology workers at Southern California Edison (SCE) are being laid off and replaced by workers from India. Some employees are training the H-1B visa holding replacements, and many have already lost their jobs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Michael Reagan, son of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan: \u201cThat\u2019s really pouring salt in the wound. First the company makes you train the foreign workers replacing you then, after you\u2019re fired, more foreign workers process your unemployment claim.\u201d\n\nReagan also argues that the wage scale for STEM related fields will be lowered if U.S. companies continue to support the influx of foreign nationals working in the United States. He cites Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican out of Alabama, who claims 75 percent of U.S. citizens with STEM degrees are working in completely unrelated positions.\n\nConversely, major tech companies are among the strongest proponents for H1-B expansion. Major industry players regularly endorse and finance lobbying groups such as FWD.us that claim further immigration reform would create millions of jobs, reduce deficit, and keep the United States globally competitive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California state has taken the controversial and somewhat ironic step of hiring Indian nationals to process its unemployment claims.", "og": {"site_name": "The American Bazaar", "description": "California state has taken the controversial and somewhat ironic step of hiring Indian nationals to process its unemployment claims.", "title": "California hires H1-B visa holders from India to process unemployment claims - The American Bazaar", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/US-Visa-e1442271455642.jpg", "height": 348}, "updated_time": "2015-03-09T19:30:45-04:00", "url": "http://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2015/03/09/california-hires-h1-b-visa-holders-from-india-to-process-unemployment-claims/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California state has taken the controversial and somewhat ironic step of hiring Indian nationals to process its unemployment claims.", "creator": "@ambazaarmag", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/US-Visa-e1442271455642.jpg?fit=600%2C348", "title": "California hires H1-B visa holders from India to process unemployment claims - The American Bazaar", "site": "@ambazaarmag", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 1161740282, "pages": 306602469441616}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/www.americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AB-54e9586cv1_site_icon.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/americanbazaaronline", "section": "Immigration", "published_time": "2015-03-09T13:04:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T19:30:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2302\"", "article_summary": "Foreign workers replacing Americans: Michael Reagan.\nSome employees are training the H-1B visa holding replacements, and many have already lost their jobs.\u201dAccording to Michael Reagan, son of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan: \u201cThat\u2019s really pouring salt in the wound.\nComputerworld reports \u201cinformation technology workers at Southern California Edison (SCE) are being laid off and replaced by workers from India.\nConversely, major tech companies are among the strongest proponents for H1-B expansion.\nHe cites Sen.
