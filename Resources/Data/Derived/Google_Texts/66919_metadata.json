Granted, many of the ideas were fairly old and well within the safe confines of Republican dogma, which runs counter to Rand\u2019s \u201cdifferent kind of Republican\u201d routine. And some of his ideas were gimmicky (the \u201cRead the Bills Act\u201d forcing legislators to read every word of every bill), while others were irresponsible and destructive (a constitutional amendment forcing Congress to balance the federal budget every year, an idea so bad that it unites conservatives and liberals in loud opposition). But hey, at least they\u2019re ideas, right?\n\nAnd Rand covered a lot of ground, given how brief a speech it was. He talked about debt, infrastructure, taxes, Iran, domestic surveillance, \u201ceconomic freedom zones,\u201d the Cold War, his grandmother \u2013 lots of stuff! But for all those ideas and all the issue areas he covered, Rand Paul\u2019s speech contained not a single word about one of the biggest policy questions a Republican president will have to face: healthcare.\n\nSeriously, not one measly word. Rand burned 84 words talking about his legislation to make legislators read legislation, but couldn\u2019t spare a syllable for the country\u2019s healthcare system. He didn\u2019t even promise to repeal Obamacare, which most Republican legislators do in their sleep at this point. Ted Cruz worked in a pledge to kill the Affordable Care Act into his announcement speech \u2013 it\u2019s a lay-up applause line that your supporters expect to hear, but Rand left his people hanging. And Rand Paul is an actual, real-life doctor \u2013 a fact he mentioned several times in his speech. For the Doctor Candidate to not mention healthcare at all is kinda weird.\n\nThat raises the obvious next question: what would Doctor-President Rand Paul do about healthcare? Well, even though he declined to say so yesterday morning, Rand is right in line with the rock-solid Republican consensus that the Affordable Care Act is no good and must be eliminated entirely. Beyond that, though, it\u2019s not all that clear what Rand Paul has in mind for a post-Obamacare landscape.\n\nNational Journal\u2019s Caitlin Owens and Dylan Scott broke down the healthcare positions of all the top 2016 GOP contenders along three lines: tax treatment of insurance, subsidized coverage options for the poor and people in need of substantial medical care, and coverage for employees of small businesses. When it came to Rand Paul, they had a difficult time nailing down what he intends to do when it comes to taxes and coverage options for small businesses. The only thing they knew with any certainty is that Rand supports block-granting Medicaid, which would effectively create barriers to accessing the program and likely result in many low-income people losing coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOPer's speech declaring his 2016 candidacy didn't mention healthcare reform at all, which is pretty strange VIDEO", "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s astonishing omission: 2016\u2019s newest candidate didn\u2019t have a single word to say about health care", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOPer's speech declaring his 2016 candidacy didn't mention healthcare reform at all, which is pretty strange VIDEO", "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s astonishing omission: 2016\u2019s newest candidate didn\u2019t have a single word to say about health care", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/08/rand_pauls_astonishing_omission_2016s_newest_candidate_didnt_have_a_single_word_to_say_about_health_care/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/rand_paul17.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOPer's speech declaring his 2016 candidacy didn't mention healthcare reform at all, which is pretty strange VIDEO", "title": "Rand Paul\u2019s astonishing omission: 2016\u2019s newest candidate didn\u2019t have a single word to say about health care", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/rand_paul17.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Healthcare Reform, Obamacare, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Beyond that, though, it\u2019s not all that clear what Rand Paul has in mind for a post-Obamacare landscape.\nAnd Rand Paul is an actual, real-life doctor \u2013 a fact he mentioned several times in his speech.\nThat raises the obvious next question: what would Doctor-President Rand Paul do about healthcare?\nWhen it came to Rand Paul, they had a difficult time nailing down what he intends to do when it comes to taxes and coverage options for small businesses.\nWell, even though he declined to say so yesterday morning, Rand is right in line with the rock-solid Republican consensus that the Affordable Care Act is no good and must be eliminated entirely."}
