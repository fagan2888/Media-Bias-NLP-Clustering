Lindsey Graham Lindsey GrahamSenate amendments could sink email privacy compromise Trump: Romney 'walks like a penguin' Romney should endorse Clinton MORE (R-S.C.) said Monday he plans to block funding to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) until Congress gets access to alleged side deals that are related to the Iranian nuclear agreement.\n\nGraham intends to block $88 million in U.S. funds to the IAEA until lawmakers get the documents, according to a Roll Call report confirmed by the senator's presidential campaign. Graham is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees that funding.\n\nThe report said the GOP presidential contender issued the threat during a \u201cNo Nukes for Iran\u201d town hall meeting in South Carolina Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not for a side deal that I can\u2019t look at,\u201d Graham said. \u201dAnd this is a very clever thing they did. The Iranians opposed anytime, anywhere inspections of their military facilities. We said early on that if you can\u2019t determine the military dimensions of a program, then it\u2019s not a good deal. How do you know if it\u2019s a good deal or not?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe GOP senator originally included the $88 million in the bill that would fund the State Department and foreign operations for the next fiscal year. The legislation has hit a dead end, mainly because of a dispute over funding levels.\n\nGraham said the IAEA has a \u201csecret deal\u201d with Iran that \u201climits inspections of [Iran\u2019s] military facilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a deal that until I get to look at it, so that\u2019s the problem here,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI betcha dollar if you looked at it, it would be a joke.\u201d\n\nThe alleged side deals are part of a roadmap the IAEA and Iran agreed on in mid-July that focuses on Iran\u2019s previous work on attaining a nuclear bomb. Obama administration officials say the side deals are not connected to the Iran nuclear agreement reached between Iran and the P5+1 \u2014 the U.S., Great Britain, Germany, France, China and Russia.\n\nLast week, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, who is a negotiator in the Iranian nuclear talks, told the Senate Banking Committee that she and her team had only seen rough drafts of the IAEA documents.\n\nSeparately, Graham had previously threatened to block funding for the new U.S. Embassy in Cuba in an effort to undermine the new U.S. policy toward the Communist nation. He never took that action at the committee level.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cI\u2019m not for a side deal that I can\u2019t look at,\u201d the White House hopeful says.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not for a side deal that I can\u2019t look at,\u201d the White House hopeful says.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not for a side deal that I can\u2019t look at,\u201d the White House hopeful says.", "title": "Report: Graham plans to block IAEA funding over Iran 'side deals'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/250763-report-key-gop-senator-plans-to-block-iaea-funding-over-iran-side-deals", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/grahamfox.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/250763-report-key-gop-senator-plans-to-block-iaea-funding-over-iran-side-deals", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-10T15:57-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Lindsey Graham,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-10T15:57:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/250763-report-key-gop-senator-plans-to-block-iaea-funding-over-iran-side-deals", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cI\u2019m not for a side deal that I can\u2019t look at,\u201d the White House hopeful says.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: Graham plans to block IAEA funding over Iran 'side deals'"}, "dcterms.title": "Report: Graham plans to block IAEA funding over Iran 'side deals'"}, "article_summary": "Separately, Graham had previously threatened to block funding for the new U.S. Embassy in Cuba in an effort to undermine the new U.S. policy toward the Communist nation.\nObama administration officials say the side deals are not connected to the Iran nuclear agreement reached between Iran and the P5+1 \u2014 the U.S., Great Britain, Germany, France, China and Russia.\nGraham intends to block $88 million in U.S. funds to the IAEA until lawmakers get the documents, according to a Roll Call report confirmed by the senator's presidential campaign.\nGraham is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees that funding.\nThe report said the GOP presidential contender issued the threat during a \u201cNo Nukes for Iran\u201d town hall meeting in South Carolina Monday."}
