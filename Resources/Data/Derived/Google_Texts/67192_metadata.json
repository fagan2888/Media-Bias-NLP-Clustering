(Nikki Boertman/The Commercial Appeal via AP)\n\nA year ago, Politico Magazine published a spicy comment in a story about systemic troubles at the Secret Service. Writer Ronald Kessler lamented the extremes that might be necessary to turn the situation around: \u201cAgents tell me it\u2019s a miracle an assassination hasn\u2019t already occurred,\u201d wrote Kessler. \u201cSadly, given Obama\u2019s colossal lack of management judgment, that calamity may be the only catalyst that will reform the Secret Service.\u201d\n\nPeople freaked. Offensive to suggest that the president must die to reform an agency, they protested. Pressure on Politico mounted, especially on Susan Glasser, who was then making the transition from the top magazine editor to leadership of the entire Politico newsroom.\n\nThe naysayers prevailed, and the story was revised to read, \u201cAgents tell me it\u2019s a miracle an assassination has not already occurred. In typical Washington fashion, nothing gets reformed until a disaster happens. If anything unites Republicans and Democrats, it is that nobody wants to see a tragedy: We all just want the Secret Service fixed.\u201d\n\nInstead of acknowledging that it had phrased things poorly, Politico chose to express its Beltway journalistic arrogance:\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Some readers have misinterpreted the original last line of Kessler\u2019s article as somehow suggesting that the president should be held responsible in the event of his own assassination. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, and we\u2019re sorry if anyone interpreted Kessler\u2019s meaning in any other way.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that the site\u2019s advertisers asked for a discount after learning that Politico readers aren\u2019t that smart, after all.\n\nSuch unwillingness to admit fault plagues Politico\u2019s big story of the day, which premiered just before noon and alleged that Republican presidential candidate had admitted to fabricating a scholarship offer from West Point. As all of Twitter \u2014 not to mention the Carson campaign \u2014 has pointed out, Carson admitted no such thing. At issue was a passage in Carson\u2019s 1990 autobiography \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d in which he described being \u201coffered a full scholarship to West Point.\u201d He never applied to West Point, however, and Politico reported that he had.\n\nFaced with these factual challenges, Politico has changed its story. Whereas the headline once read:\n\nBen Carson admits fabricating West Point scholarship\n\nIt now reads:\n\nExclusive: Carson claimed West Point \u2018scholarship\u2019 but never applied\n\nAnd whereas the original lede once read:\n\nBen Carson\u2019s campaign on Friday admitted, in a response to an inquiry from POLITICO, that a central point in his inspirational personal story was fabricated: his application and acceptance into the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n\nIt now reads:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson on Friday conceded that he never applied nor was granted admission to West Point and attempted to recast his previous claims of a full scholarship to the military academy \u2014 despite numerous public and written statements to the contrary over the last few decades.\n\nAs of 5:05 p.m. Friday, there was no asterisk or correction or editor\u2019s note alerting readers to the material changes in the Politico story, under the byline of Kyle Cheney. The absence of such concessions squares with a statement that the outlet supplied to the Erik Wemple Blog, which insists:\n\nWe stand by our story which is a powerful debunking of a key aspect of Ben Carson\u2019s personal narrative. The story online includes additional details now as well that bolster this account.\n\nTo unpack this week-ending brouhaha a bit, Politico\u2019s apparent error in alleging nonexistent admission by the Carson people that the candidate was guilty of fabrication is a big one \u2014 one that by any standard of modern or ancient journalistic hygiene should trigger a correction. The question of whether Carson ever applied to West Point is a bit more complicated, as one Twitter user notes:\n\nPolitico stands by Carson story \u2013 The Washington Post \u2013 To be clear, can't be \"offered\" scholarship without applying https://t.co/hO1QHBw5kZ \u2014 Cedric Evans (@Ced_Evans) November 6, 2015\n\nSocial-media backlashes have the unfortunate knack of stiffening any newsroom\u2019s stubborn caucus. This dynamic emerged over the summer, when the New York Times published late at night a blockbuster story about a federal investigation into Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s e-mail usage. Rebuttals emerged quickly, and corrections from the New York Times sluggishly.\n\nPolitico plowed this very ground back in 2013. Its superb congressional team caught wind of touchy Capitol Hill negotiations relating to the transition to Obamacare. The resulting story framed the discussions as an attempt to \u201cexempt\u201d the Hill from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that it enroll in the Obamacare exchanges: \u201cCongressional leaders in both parties are engaged in high-level, confidential talks about exempting lawmakers and Capitol Hill aides from the insurance exchanges they are mandated to join as part of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, sources in both parties said,\u201d read the story, which blew up the newsphere.\n\nLike today\u2019s Carson piece, the Obamacare story was on to something, just not the precise something in the article. Lawmakers, in fact, weren\u2019t scheming to get out of the requirement that they fetch their health-care plans from Obamacare\u2019s exchanges; they were trying to fix a \u201cdrafting error that prevents the federal government from paying into insurance exchanges on behalf of congressional staffers who got caught up in a political controversy,\u201d as Ezra Klein put it. Politico never ran a correction on the story, despite sustaining pressure to do so.\n\nAnd that\u2019s ultimately what drives decisions to write corrections in this industry: E-mails, tweets and blog posts seeking a line or two of italicized text. The next few days should provide some insight into how effectively Politico\u2019s leaders can tune it all out. Should they decide to revisit the story, perhaps they\u2019ll want to check just how \u201ccentral\u201d the West Point anecdote has been to Carson\u2019s life tale. \u201cPeripheral\u201d maybe?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics are seeking a line or two of italicized text.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Critics are seeking a line or two of italicized text.", "title": "Why won\u2019t Politico slap a correction on its Carson story?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/06/why-wont-politico-slap-a-correction-on-its-carson-story/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/05/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Carson-02ccb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ErikWemple"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/11/06/why-wont-politico-slap-a-correction-on-its-carson-story/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ben carson, politico, west point", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/erik.wemple"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Ben carson, politico, west point"}, "article_summary": "Let\u2019s hope that the site\u2019s advertisers asked for a discount after learning that Politico readers aren\u2019t that smart, after all.\nAs all of Twitter \u2014 not to mention the Carson campaign \u2014 has pointed out, Carson admitted no such thing.\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson speaks during a rally Friday, Oct. 30, 2015, at West Memphis High School in West Memphis, Ark.\nPressure on Politico mounted, especially on Susan Glasser, who was then making the transition from the top magazine editor to leadership of the entire Politico newsroom.\nShould they decide to revisit the story, perhaps they\u2019ll want to check just how \u201ccentral\u201d the West Point anecdote has been to Carson\u2019s life tale."}
