The administrator had apparently misinterpreted that rule.\n\n\u201cIf [Jaegur] was breaking the rules, he would be punished and he would have to honor whatever they give him, but he wasn\u2019t, and I have to stand by him for that,\u201d Ms. Goode said.\n\nOn Tuesday, she received a call from the principal, who apologized for all the trouble and insisted that the American flag is allowed to be worn in school. He said he was off-campus when the incident occurred, Fox reported.\n\n\u201cThe fact that acknowledging it is huge, and the fact that they\u2019re willing to stand by and see mistakes and grow from them, that means a lot,\u201d Ms. Goode said.\n\nThe principal also explained to her that the in-school suspension will not go on her son\u2019s disciplinary record.\n\nThe Dallas Independent School District has also confirmed that American flags can be displayed on clothing, Fox reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Dallas student was sent to in-school suspension Monday after an administrator caught him wearing an American flag T-shirt under his hoodie.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Dallas student was sent to in-school suspension Monday after an administrator caught him wearing an American flag T-shirt under his hoodie.", "title": "Dallas student sent to in-school suspension for American flag T-shirt", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/17/dallas-student-sent-to-in-school-suspension-for-am/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/17/shelley_goode.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/17/shelley_goode.jpg", "description": "A Dallas student was sent to in-school suspension Monday after an administrator caught him wearing an American flag T-shirt under his hoodie.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dallas student sent to in-school suspension for American flag T-shirt"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Jaegur, Shelly Goode"}, "article_summary": "A Dallas student was sent to in-school suspension Monday after an administrator caught him wearing an American flag T-shirt under his hoodie.\nThe principal also explained to her that the in-school suspension will not go on her son\u2019s disciplinary record.\nOn Tuesday, she received a call from the principal, who apologized for all the trouble and insisted that the American flag is allowed to be worn in school.\nThe Dallas Independent School District has also confirmed that American flags can be displayed on clothing, Fox reported.\n\u201cThe fact that acknowledging it is huge, and the fact that they\u2019re willing to stand by and see mistakes and grow from them, that means a lot,\u201d Ms. Goode said."}
