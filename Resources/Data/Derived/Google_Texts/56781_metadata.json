Lawmakers passed just 55 substantive bills that were signed into law, according to the Pew Research Center, while being bogged down in a partisan morass over scores of other important matters.\n\nMoreover, the House was in session a total of 942 hours in 2013 (not counting brief pro-forma sessions), The New York Times calculated \u2014 \u201cthe fewest hours in a nonelection year since 2005, when detailed information about legislative activity became available.\u201d\n\nRelated: 15 Awful Things More Popular Than Congress\n\nLike a dysfunctional family writ large, the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-dominated Senate talked past each other on critical issues that included immigration reform, gun violence, food stamps and farm legislation, job training, trade and energy production.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats could agree on practically nothing of importance unless they were performing some constitutionally mandated step, like passing spending measures to fund the government or providing for the country\u2019s defense. Even then, major differences of opinion over health care reform and spending levels triggered a 16-day government shutdown in October before the two sides finally agreed to negotiate a budget and spending package and new debt ceiling.\n\nFor the most part, it was a shameful performance, one that sent public approval of the institution to an all-time low of 9 percent in November. As veteran Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) sadly noted late last year, \u201cThe American people, very appropriately, have very little regard for us.\u201d\n\nJust how little did this \u201cdo-nothing Congress\u201d actually do last year? A new CQ Roll Call legislative analysis of provides many answers. \u201cThe year on Capitol Hill was bracketed by fiscal crises resolved, if at all, only at the margins,\u201d according to a summary of the analysis written by John Cranford. \u201cIt was characterized more by thwarted ambitions and unfulfilled promises than any measure of success.\u201d\n\nRelated: Congressional Odd Couple Finally Strikes a Budget Deal\n\n\u201cThe degree to which the 113th Congress has already been libeled by broad swaths of the press and public as the \u2018worst ever\u2019 speaks to the disappointment of missed opportunities, too-high expectations and business pretty much as usual,\u201d according to the report.\n\nPaul Ryan\u2019s New Idea is Really Smart\u2014But Will It Fly?\n\nEven the deals reached were generally small-bore. In his State of the Union address in February 2013, President Obama called on Congress to overhaul immigration laws and address gun violence. Lawmakers did neither.\n\n\u201cInstead, they battled and postured and wound up incapable of enacting even a stopgap spending bill to keep the government in business after the fiscal year rolled over on Oct. 1,\u201d the CQ Roll Call analysis notes. \u201cThe result was a 16-day shutdown of those agencies dependent on annual appropriations, increased disaffection by the public and further recriminations on Capitol Hill.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, lawmakers tallied a small handful of legislation accomplishments:\n\nReauthorization and expansion of the Violence Against Women Act\n\nAn overhaul of the student loan program that shifted Stafford undergraduate loans from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate\n\nEnactment of new rules governing compounding pharmacies and tracking pharmaceuticals after the 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak in New England\n\nApproval of $60.2 billion in assistance to victims of Superstorm Sandy in New Jersey and other northeastern states\n\nTwo so-called \u201cdoc fixes\u201d to protect doctors against scheduled sharp reductions in Medicare reimbursements\n\nRelated: Details of the Senate Fiscal Cliff Tax Deal\n\nWith the threat of a financial crisis hanging over them, the House and Senate also began the year with a last-minute deal to avert a \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d of massive tax increases and spending cuts. That agreement, approved New Year\u2019s Day before the new Congress was even sworn in, made permanent most of the Bush era tax cuts, while allowing tax increases for some upper income individuals and families.\n\nStill, the list of missed opportunities or intractable issues overshadowed these few accomplishments:\n\nMajor farm and food stamp legislation languished in the two chambers and was kicked down the road.\n\nA bipartisan proposal to extend national background checks to include people who purchase weapons at gun shows died in the Senate and had no chance of House passage.\n\nProposals for expanded mental health treatment to help prevent gun violence among young people went nowhere.\n\nNegotiations over sweeping trade legislation foundered.\n\nThe House and Senate couldn\u2019t agree on reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind law.\n\nObama\u2019s minimum wage increase proposal was tabled.\n\nA workplace discrimination law to protect gays, lesbians and bisexuals passed the Senate but wasn\u2019t brought up in the House.\n\nLegislation to overhaul and consolidate 47 federally administered job-training programs was pushed to the following year.\n\nWelfare-to-work waivers to give governors more flexibility in helping the unemployed find new jobs stalled.\n\nThe House and Senate clashed over offshore drilling policies.\n\nHouse Republicans repeatedly voted to repeal or derail the Affordable Care Act in the face of unyielding opposition from the Senate and the president.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats battled over constructing the Keystone XL pipeline, with the House attempting to force approval by stripping the president of authority over the granting of permits.\n\nAnd on and on it went.\n\nThe CQ Roll Call analysis said, \u201cPerhaps the two most significant actions of the first session of the 113th Congress were reactions to the persistent partisanship and ideological polarization that has dominated the legislative branch for more than two decades.\u201d\n\nOne was the late-December budget agreement to raise discretionary spending caps for fiscal 2014 and 2015. Hailed as a bipartisan breakthrough by its authors, the deal accomplished neither the revenue gains sought by the Democrats nor the entitlement constraints sought by Republicans.\n\nThe other was the unilateral action by Senate Democrats led by Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada when Reid pulled the trigger on the nuclear option to do away with the filibuster and the right of the minority party to block numerous Obama appointees to federal offices and judgeships. \u201cThe result may be a further deterioration of comity in the Senate \u2014 even if the president can count on the majority to more readily get nominees confirmed,\u201d the analysis stated.\n\nTop Read from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The 113th Congress last year was arguably one of the least productive bodies in history.
