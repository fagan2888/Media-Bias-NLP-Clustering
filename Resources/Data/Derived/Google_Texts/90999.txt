SAN DIEGO– Investment banker Antonio Weiss asked President Obama to withdraw his name on Monday, Jan. 12, for consideration as Undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance. Some liberal senators, including Elizabeth Warrren (D-Mass) Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) and Al Franken (D-Minnesota) had said Weiss’s position with the Lazard investment bank made him unsuitable for the position.

Sanders said: ““I have no personal animosity toward Mr. Weiss but I am very glad he withdrew his nomination. The president needs economic advisors who do not come from Wall Street. In fact, he needs advisors prepared to stand up to Wall Street. We need economic policies in this country which ask the wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and which create millions of good-paying jobs.”

Franken said: “This position requires someone who understands how to make our economy work for the middle class and those aspiring to be in the middle class, and I think Mr. Weiss made the right decision to take himself out of contention. “I was troubled by his history working on international corporate mergers and so-called inversion deals that let corporations change their address to shirk U.S. tax responsibilities. I hope the President will consider nominating someone who has demonstrated a commitment to working on behalf of middle-class Americans.”

As an investment banker with Lazard, Weiss reportedly advised Burger King to merge with a Canadian donut maker Tim Hortons Inc., and to thereby change its tax status from that of an American company to that of a Canadian company with a lower tax liability.

White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman said Weiss withdrew to avoid the distraction of a combative Senate confirmation process. Weiss is expected to be appointed as a senior advisor to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, a position that does not require Senate confirmation.

CYBER PROTECTION–U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on Monday, Jan. 12, applauded President Obama’s initiative to protect American companies, consumers, and infrastructure from cyber threats. “Last year millions of consumers’ sensitive financial data fell into the hands of thieves and criminals, as business after business disclosed news that their data security systems had been breached,” they jointly stated. “Credit card information and personal data was stolen from Target, Neiman Marcus, Home Depot and JP Morgan Chase – leaving consumers at risk and providing chilling reminders of how vulnerable our electronic infrastructure is to attack. These examples underscore the importance of enhancing our nation’s cyber security, creating stronger protections for sensitive consumer financial data, and empowering the Federal Trade Commission with the authority they need to hold businesses accountable for data breaches.”

AID TO PALESTINIANS — U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) and Charles Schumer (D-New York) have joined an effort to stop U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority because of its decision to join the International Criminal Court to seek legal action against Israel. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein declined comment to JNS.org when asked about the issue.

TERROR INSURANCE—U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland), noting Senate passage last Thursday, Jan. 8, of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), stated: “The renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) is crucial for businesses across our nation. Congress is acting to prevent disruptions that could have exposed these businesses to unpredictable premium increases and created a major obstacle for obtaining new project financing. The damage to our economy, if the policies were needed, would have been incalculable. While I would have liked to have seen the Congress take action earlier, I am pleased that we are finally able to give U.S. companies the certainty that they deserve on this important issue.”

NEW YORK JETS — U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer (D-New York) called on the New York Jets to keep their summer training camp at SUNY Cortland. Schumer’s call comes in light of the fact that there is no agreement in place between the Jets and SUNY Cortland for the team to host training camp at the university this summer, something the Jets have done each year since 2009. Coupled with recent changes to the Jets’ coaching staff and management, the future of Jets’ training camp in Central New York is uncertain. Schumer said that the annual, three-week training camp is a tremendous boon to the local economy – bringing in close to $5 million each year – and an important attraction for local football fans, 22,000 of whom attended last year. Schumer noted that the SUNY System spent almost $500,000 last year to accommodate the Jets and the State invested over $500,000 back in 2010 to upgrade the SUNY Cortland facilities to NFL standards.

House of Representatives

IMMIGRATION—U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel (D-New York) said “”House Republicans are trying to use the Homeland Security Appropriations Act to roll back the President’s new immigration program. For the Republicans to play partisan games with the Department of Homeland Security when international terrorism is on the rise is outright dangerous.” This was similar to comments made by Stosh Cotler, CEO of Bend the Arc, who said GOP amendments “would break up millions of immigrant families across the country–families who contribute enormously to the economy of or country and who are part of the fabric of our society.”

HAITI GOVERNMENT REFORM–U.S. Rep. Nita Lowey (D-New York), noted the five-year anniversary of the earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010. “Today, we pause to remember more than 200,000 victims of the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010, one of the worst disasters in modern history. During the last five years, the United States has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Haiti as they have endeavored to rebuild their lives and futures. As the Ranking Member of the State & Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I remain deeply committed to the close relationship between our two countries and to long-term poverty reduction, economic development, and the promotion of human rights on the island. That is why I have supported, and continue to monitor, the more than $4 billion in U.S. assistance since the earthquake for these efforts. Significant achievements have been made – millions of cubic meters of rubble have been removed, housing has been built for hundreds of thousands of displaced Haitians, and access to healthcare, electricity, and education has improved throughout the country. Much more remains to be done and we cannot afford to reverse any of these gains, which is why Haiti’s leaders must work together to overcome the current political impasse and ensure that the people of Haiti have a voice through free, fair, and transparent elections. The continued delay in Parliamentary elections in unacceptable. Today and each day moving forward, all sides should focus on achieving lasting security and economic stability by committing to strong and responsible government institutions.” …. U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Illinois) issued this statement on Haiti: “The Haitian government still struggles with instability, housing remains inadequate for many families and the economy continues to lag behind – leaving many Haitians struggling to make a living. However, there has been significant progress in Haiti. The contributions of those like Dr. Paul Farmer and his organization, Partners in Health, have dramatically improved the Haitian healthcare infrastructure over the last five years. Child mortality and HIV/AIDS are on the decline. Family planning, pre-natal and neo-natal care are available to more women and children. There is an ongoing educational campaign in Haiti to decrease the occurrence of Gender-Based Violence. I stand in solidarity with the people of Haiti in the effort to build a better country. Our nation’s continued support remains a critical foundation of Haiti’s recovery. If we all work together there will be many more improvements to report in the next five years.”

ISLAMIST ZEALOTRY—U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-New York) delivered the following statement at the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) memorial at the Lincoln Square Synagogue about the recent terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine and the Kosher supermarket in Paris, France: “What are we to make of the attacks on Charlie Hebdo? and on a kosher grocery store in Paris? First, that Islamist zealotry is a threat to individual liberty, to democracy, to gender equality, to religious freedom – to everything free people hold dear. Second, that Islamist zealotry is a particular threat to Jews – raising a new and murderous form of anti-Semitism. Third, demonstrating once again the essential role of Israel as a refuge for Jews, who have been persecuted and murdered in so many nations, and whose safety in much of Europe is, for the second time in a century, sharply in question. ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah, Al Qaeda show that the quote from the Haggada – ‘B’chol dor vador omdim aleinu lechaloteinu’ – ‘In every generation they rise up against us, to destroy us’ – is once again applicable in this generation. Vehakadosh Baruch Hu matzileinu miyadam’ – ‘And the Almighty saves us from their hands.’ But the Talmud tells us – ‘Ain somchin al hanes.’ We cannot rely on miracles. As John F. Kennedy said, ‘Here on Earth, G-d’s work must . . . be our own.’ All of us, all men and women of good will, all believers in liberty and equality, must join in the Lord’s work, in combating Islamist zealotry, in combating the increasing attacks on Jews, and on freedom of expression, and in proclaiming and promoting freedom of thought, the right of all – of both sexes – to equality and education. This may be a generation’s work, but free men and women, when confronted by totalitarian challenges, have always risen to meet the challenge and now must again.”

VETERANS — Freshman Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin (R-New York) a member of the House Veterans’ Affairs committee, co-sponsored and voted in favor of the Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22), which passed unanimously in the House on Tuesday, Jan. 6. “The Hire More Heroes Act allows employers to exclude veterans who already receive health insurance through the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs from the employer mandate, a key provision of Obamacare, which requires all businesses with more than 50 employees to provide health insurance to any full time worker,” Zeldin said. “Under current law, veterans who already receive health insurance through the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs are still counted towards the employer mandate. The Hire More Heroes Act would allow those veterans to be excluded from this count. This would incentivize businesses to hire more veterans and would provide businesses with much-needed relief from Obamacare.” Zeldin, an Army veteran who currently serves as a Major in the Army Reserves said, “I’m proud to support and sponsor legislation that protects our veterans and helps them obtain jobs and financial security. This provision would encourage small businesses to hire veterans, while providing employers with relief from burdensome requirements under Obamacare.”

Interest Groups

FRENCH MARCH — Morton A. Klein, president and CEO of the Zionist Organization of America, criticized President Obama for not attending the massive anti-Islamic terrorism in France, which drew numerous world leaders from other countries, including Israel’s Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. “By this action, Pres. Obama has humiliated and embarrassed all Americans in front of the whole world while sending the wrong message to Islamic murderers,” said Klein. U.S. State Dept. deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. Ambassador to France participated in the March and that Secretary of State John Kerry would have participated had he not been in India at the time. She deferred questions about the President’s non-appearance to the White House, but did say: “Obviously, for the President, there are very specific security concerns that go along when he travels. There are just a variety of factors we take into account here.”
