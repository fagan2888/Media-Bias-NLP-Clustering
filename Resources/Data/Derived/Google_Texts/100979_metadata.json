That\u2019s 63 percent of the total.\n\nAmong the rest, sure, there is Russell Wilson, who has a Super Bowl ring and was one ill-timed play call from winning another. And Andrew Luck, who\u2019s showing signs that he\u2019ll win one someday.\n\nBut the other 21, including Andy Dalton and Colin Kaepernick, have started some \u2014 or many \u2014 games, and are still trying to prove they\u2019re either worth the money or the draft pick spent on them.\n\nSo, the message for Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota and the 13 other quarterbacks working out for coaches, scouts and general managers this week is simple: There are plenty of opportunities, but the odds are against you.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s harder and harder to play the position and develop the position because of the timetable and the fact we\u2019re not very patient as a society or a league,\u201d said Rich Gannon, the MVP quarterback who spent nearly two decades in the league. \u201cTeams draft a kid and expect him to become successful right away. And just because Dan Marino or Peyton Manning didn\u2019t take very long to get it figured out, we think they\u2019re all going to be that way.\u201d\n\nOne story line whenever the combine rolls around is that quarterbacks are better suited to make the quick switch from college to the pros because passing offenses have proliferated around the country over the past decade. High school and college teams line up in spread-out, pistol and shotgun formations and, from the time they\u2019re teenagers, quarterbacks are used to receiving the ball, making a quick scan across the field and throwing.\n\nBut as everyone from Tim Tebow to Teddy Bridgewater have shown, the art of playing quarterback changes drastically once they reach the NFL.\n\nDefenses adjust more quickly, the athletes are better and the option of tucking the ball in and running isn\u2019t as available in the NFL.\n\n\u201cThe quarterbacks we have coming into the game today are a lot better than 10, 20 years ago,\u201d said Gil Brandt, the longtime director of personnel for the Cowboys. \u201cBut the game is also considerably harder to learn. Not so much from an offense standpoint, but from a defense standpoint. People do so many different things, coverage-wise, now. In the old days, it was the grade-school version of defense. Now, you better be a grad student from MIT.\u201d\n\nThe top three quarterbacks chosen in the last two drafts have served up proof of how difficult this transition is. Blake Bortles won only three games with Jacksonville and finished with 11 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions. Johnny Manziel\u2019s flame-out in his first start with Cleveland and his eventual landing in a rehab facility this offseason stood as the starkest example of how rough the transition can be, both on and off the field. Bridgewater helped the struggling Vikings win a few games but management had to tread carefully, realizing he wasn\u2019t ready to step right in and take over.\n\n\u201cA lot of factors went into it, with how the rest of the team, how the offensive line was playing, how the receivers were,\u201d said Vikings coach Mike Zimmer, who made Bridgewater the starter four games into the season. \u201cThere\u2019s so many variables that come into it. And then the quarterback himself. What kind of person he is? How quick does he handle things?\u201d\n\nE.J. Manuel, the top quarterback in 2013, got benched in Buffalo in favor of Kyle Orton. The Bills are currently shopping the free agent market. Geno Smith took a back seat to Michael Vick for a time with the Jets. His window is, by many accounts, on the verge of closing.\n\nAnd though Buccaneers coach Lovie Smith insists Mike Glennon could be the quarterback of the future, he does so while looking hard at Winston and Mariota when deciding how Tampa should use this year\u2019s first pick.\n\n\u201cI think it helps a little bit if you\u2019ve done more of the things in college that you\u2019ll be doing in an NFL game,\u201d Smith said, when asked if Winston\u2019s experience in a pro-style offense at Florida State could help him. \u201cBut a lot of this is about projections.\u201d\n\nLuck, much like Manning 17 years ago, is one of those once-in-a-generation talents who lived up to the projections, making the transition without too many growing pains. He threw for 4,300 yards and took the Colts to the playoffs in his 2012 rookie season and has gotten better from there.\n\nIf any quarterbacks in this class match that performance, it will be a surprise. It\u2019s considered a weak group, with questions dogging Winston about his character and Mariota about his ability to transition from a spread offense to the NFL.\n\nBut two teams\u2019 front offices will take chances on these players. And in a league built on quarterbacks, their jobs will hinge on the decision and what they do after they sign the quarterbacks.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s pretty consistent is that teams that are firing coaches are also the ones looking for quarterbacks,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cYou look at the New York Jets, Buffalo, some other places. You see that they fire coaches when they can\u2019t get the quarterbacks to play well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Of the 62 quarterbacks picked in the NFL draft this decade, 15 are out of the league and another 24 have spent most of their time on the bench or the practice squad.
