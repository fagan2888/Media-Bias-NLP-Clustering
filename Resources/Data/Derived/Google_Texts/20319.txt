Indiana has rejected Dayton-based CareSource’s bid to become one of the state’s Medicaid managed care providers under a contract that would have been worth more than $300 million.

Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Managed Health Services of Indiana and MDwise each won Medicaid contracts in Indiana worth about $335 million in annual revenue, according to Indiana insurance officials.

CareSource, the biggest Medicaid managed care provider in Ohio with more than 1.3 million members, would have received a lump-sum payment to provide care in Indiana for aged, blind and disabled Medicaid enrollees.

CareSource, Magellan and Advantage Health Solutions all lost during the bidding process.

“The recent procurement in Indiana was an opportunity to serve the aged, blind and disabled populations. We serve a similar population in Ohio and this would have allowed us to take our mission-based expertise into Indiana beyond our current offerings on the Health Insurance Marketplace,” company officials said in a statement, referring to the expansion of their commercial business into Indiana.

CareSource has signed more than 30,000 new members to its CareSource Just4Me marketplace plans, which it began selling in Ohio this year, and it has joined insurance marketplaces in Indiana and Kentucky, where it is currently signing new members for coverage beginning next year.

The marketplaces, otherwise known as health insurance exchanges, where established by the Affordable Care Act to provide eligible consumers with one-stop shopping for private health coverage.
