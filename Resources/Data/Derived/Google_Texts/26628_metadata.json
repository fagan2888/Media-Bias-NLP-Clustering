Burwell and the Supreme Court oral arguments in the case by Tim Jost, Grace-Marie Turner, Sara Rosenbaum, Bill Sage, and others.\n\nDespite all the media hubbub and intense scrutiny, we didn\u2019t learn all that much from the oral argument in King v. Burwell. The four liberal justices\u2014Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan\u2014clearly believe that an exchange established \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cin\u201d a state by the federal government is the same as an exchange \u201cestablished by the state\u201d (or at least that it\u2019s ambiguous and the tie goes to the IRS). Justices Scalia and Alito\u2014and presumably the silent Thomas\u2014equally believe that words mean what they say.\n\nSo the case, as expected, turns on the views of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy, who gave very little away. Indeed, I\u2019ve never seen John Roberts so quiet at an oral argument\u2014holding his cards so close that they risk being permanently imprinted on his vest\u2014while Anthony Kennedy was characteristically inscrutable. In other words, 4-3 in the government\u2019s favor with two wild cards.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what everyone knew going into the argument, and 85 minutes later if anyone tried to tell you that they knew what the outcome would be, they were engaging in spin or wishful thinking. To put an even finer point on it: whichever side you thought had the better chance of winning, downgrade your expectations to 50-50.\n\nA Revealing Exchange\n\nBut getting beyond the prognostication\u2014which is almost always a futile exercise\u2014there was one exchange that at least illuminated what this case turns on. Not surprisingly, it came in a colloquy between Justices Kagan and Alito (with the petitioners\u2019 counsel, Mike Carvin, acting as the foil). As seasoned court-watchers know, those two justices are the ones to focus on if you want to understand the crux of any matter before the Court. They\u2019re rarely the swing votes, but their questioning is clear, incisive, and to the point.\n\nHere\u2019s Kagan\u2019s initial question:\n\nSo I have three clerks, Mr. Carvin. Their names are Will and Elizabeth and Amanda. Okay? So [to] my first clerk, I say, Will, I\u2019d like you to write me a memo. And I say, Elizabeth, I want you to edit Will\u2019s memo once he\u2019s done. And then I say, Amanda, listen, if Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write such memo. Now, my question is: If Will is too busy to write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should Elizabeth edit the memo?\n\nCarvin stylized this hypothetical a bit, positing that the original plan was to pay Will for a memo and Amanda ends up writing the memo, then \u201cunder plain English and common sense,\u201d Will doesn\u2019t get paid (presumably regardless of whether Elizabeth edits the memo). Justice Kagan cut him off before he finished this explanation, saying:\n\nGosh . . . you run a different shop than I do . . . . Because in my chambers, if Elizabeth did not edit the memo, Elizabeth would not be performing her function. In other words, there\u2019s a substitute, and I\u2019ve set up the substitute. And then I\u2019ve given instructions: Elizabeth, you . . . edit Will\u2019s memo, but of course if Amanda writes the memo, the instructions carry over. Elizabeth knows what she\u2019s supposed to do. She\u2019s supposed to edit Amanda\u2019s memo, too.\n\nCarvin again explained that the difference between Kagan\u2019s chambers and the case at hand was that the justice was \u201cagnostic\u201d as to which of her clerks writes the memo, while Congress \u201cwas not agnostic as to whether States or HHS established the Exchange.\u201d In other words, while Justice Kagan doesn\u2019t care who authors her memo (regardless of whether Elizabeth edits it)\u2014and might be willing to pay any of her clerks if money were in play\u2014the political dynamics surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act indicate that Congress very much wanted to have states \u201cauthor\u201d exchanges.\n\nAt this point, Justice Alito cut to the chase:\n\nWell, Mr. Carvin, if I had those clerks . . . and Amanda wrote the memo, and I received it and I said, This is a great memo, who wrote it? Would the answer be it was written by Will, because Amanda stepped into Will\u2019s shoes?\n\n\u201cThat was my first answer,\u201d Carvin quickly rejoined, provoking the fourth transcript notation of \u201c(Laughter.)\u201d during this interplay. \u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d Justice Kagan said with a smile, pointing to Justice Alito.\n\nCarvin then reiterated his point that \u201cCongress was not agnostic as between State and Federal exchanges.\u201d Justice Kagan agreed with this, suggesting that this conclusion meant that the answer to her original question really depends on context rather than \u201cfour or five words.\u201d And that\u2019s absolutely true\u2014one of the canons of statutory construction is not to read a provision in a way that creates an absurd result\u2014but Justice Alito showed that it\u2019s just as nonsensical to say that the federal government established an \u201cexchange established by the state\u201d as it is to say that Will wrote the memo that Amanda wrote.\n\nReconciling Plain Meaning And A Reasonable Reading Of Congressional Intent\n\nSo the only question here is whether reading the statute in the way that makes grammatical sense produces absurd results: Is there a reasonable explanation for why Congress would create a structure that denies premium subsidies to people who buy health insurance through federally run exchanges?\n\nThe answer to that is obvious: If Congress really wanted a system where states set up exchanges\u2014and, under well-settled constitutional understandings, it couldn\u2019t force them to do so\u2014it would have to provide an incentive. The incentive here is the premium subsidy, which Obamacare\u2019s designers apparently felt was an offer no state would refuse.\n\nThat\u2019s a very easy story to tell and understand, and Congress has offered these sorts of carrots/sticks before (not least with Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which the Court rewrote three years ago to remove the unconstitutionally coercive elements). Is that what really happened here?\n\nThere\u2019s no dispositive evidence going either way\u2014and really can\u2019t be, given that Congress had to pass the law to find out what was in it\u2014though ACA \u201carchitect\u201d Jonathan Gruber\u2019s infamous videos do suggest that at least the idea wasn\u2019t foreign to the staffers who crafted the legislation behind closed doors.\n\nBut the point is that it\u2019s a perfectly plausible contextual explanation, which means that there\u2019s no need to depart from the plain text of the law and somehow decree that Amanda\u2019s memo was written \u201cby\u201d Will a federal exchange was established \u201cby\u201d the state.\n\nIn short, the fact that enforcing the Affordable Care Act produces a result that Congress may very well have intended but which has certain negative consequences is no reason to abandon the rule of law and allow the IRS to rewrite the statute. While Justice Kagan\u2019s chambers may run like a well-oiled machine, Obamacare has been a mess from the very beginning. Roberts and Kennedy should enforce the law as written and thereby direct Congress to write better memos.\n\nNote: Ilya Shapiro is a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, on whose behalf he filed an amicus brief supporting the challengers in King v.
