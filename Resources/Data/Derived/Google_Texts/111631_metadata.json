The cost of insuring Brazilian bonds for five years in the CDS market fell for the fourth day in five to 340.7 basis points, near the lowest levels since last August, according to Markit pricing. An exchange-traded fund of Brazilian equities gained 3.8 percent at 11:20 p.m. local time, or 11:20 a.m. in Tokyo, where it is traded.
