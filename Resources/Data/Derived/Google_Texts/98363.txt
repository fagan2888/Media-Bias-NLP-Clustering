NEW YORK (MainStreet) — CVS has admitted to overcharging thousands of women, San Diego’s Channel Six reported yesterday, by charging for generic contraceptives that under the Affordable Care Act should have been provided at no extra cost. The law requires that any FDA-approved form of birth control, including the pill, UID’s or patches, be provided without cost-sharing as long as the patient has a doctor’s prescription.

In a statement to House Representative Jackie Speier, however, CVS admitted to charging approximately 11,000 women for the drugs and said that it had been caused by a “drug price coding error” in the computer system.

Speier’s office became aware of the problem after a staff member encountered it and sent a September 9 letter to the company and CEO Larry Merlo. In its response, CVS noted the computer error. Merlo promised to resolve it by September 26 and send refunds to the effected customers; all checks should arrive by October 1.

In addition to CVS, isolated incidents have been reported at Walgreens and Target pharmacies. These issues remain under investigation.

Although a major goal of the ACA is to expand and guarantee free birth control for women, a recent study out of the Guttmacher Institute shows that goal coming true for only about 67% of women.

“There’s many reasons why it’s not 100%,” said Judy Waxman, vice president for health and reproductive rights with the Women’s Law Center. “One thing is that this doesn’t apply to all people on Medicaid, and of course 23 states haven’t expanded Medicaid, so when you’re looking at all women there’s a lot of holes. The other thing is that the plans that this applies to are un-grandfathered, meaning that they’ve changed their plans since the ACA passed in a significant enough way [to have to meet the law’s requirements]. At this point 75% of employer plans are un-grandfathered, and over the next several years they’ll all be.”
