Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has overtaken Clinton in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nWaiting until late September or early October to see if former Secretary of State Clinton\u2019s campaign implodes or Sanders\u2019 falters is a big risk for any potential candidate. It\u2019s not just because of the obvious challenges of having to assemble a strong national campaign organization on the fly or raise hundreds of millions of dollars to mount an effective media strategy.\n\nOne of the more important\u2013 albeit mundane and dreary \u2013 tasks in the early going is to get a candidate\u2019s name on the ballot for the early, critical primary races in New Hampshire, South Carolina and a handful of other southern states.\n\nA basic political fact is that candidates can give the best speeches and run the cleverest ads, but if they miss a deadline for filing, they can miss out on a passel of delegates who will ultimately help choose their party\u2019s nominee. The late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts learned that lesson the hard way when he challenged Democratic President Jimmy Carter for their party\u2019s nomination in 1980.\n\nRelated: Surprised Bernie Sanders Is Leading the Polls? So Is He\n\n\u201cPutting aside the question of how serious Hillary\u2019s problems are . . . there are serious structural problems that will, very shortly, keep anyone who is not already in this race from getting in,\u201d Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote on a blog last week.\n\n\u201cConventional wisdom says a candidate has to get in early in order to raise money. That\u2019s true for unknowns but any of the nationally recognized candidates . . . could, thanks to the Internet, raise a fair amount of money pretty quickly,\u201d she added. \u201cThe more serious problem is that presidential nominees these days get elected in public primaries and public primaries have filing deadlines.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden continues to agonize over whether to enter the race, Sanders and his advisers are planning a delegate strategy and assembling a grass-roots team throughout the country that is modeled in part on President Obama\u2019s highly successful 2008 campaign, according to The Washington Post.\n\nApart from Sanders\u2019 substantial campaign organization in Iowa and New Hampshire, he is increasing his presence in South Carolina and Nevada and beginning to target four delegate rich states with primaries or caucuses on March 1 -- Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont, The Post reported.\n\nParty primary elections are used to elect slates of delegates committed to particular candidates who then help nominate their party\u2019s presidential standard-bearer at the summer national conventions. Under Democratic Party rules, delegates are divvied up proportionately among the candidates based on vote totals by congressional district \u2013 meaning that even if a candidate doesn\u2019t win a primary contest statewide, he or she can still pick up a portion of the total delegates.\n\nSo missing a filing deadline to appear on a ballot is a mortal sin in presidential politics \u2013 one that usually means forfeiting precious delegates to the conventions. And because the process of collecting a sufficient number of valid signatures on a petition can be laborious, time consuming and costly, getting a candidate on a ballot isn\u2019t always a snap.\n\nRelated: Sanders Pulls Ahead in Iowa, but a Tougher Clinton Aims to Even the Score\n\nFor even the better organized campaigns, the filing deadlines can come fast and furious, beginning in early November and December.\n\nHere are two charts prepared by Brookings that highlight the risks of missing filing deadlines for primaries:\n\nGraph #1 shows filing deadlines for Democratic primaries along the horizontal axis and number of delegates potentially forfeited along the vertical axis. The New Hampshire filing deadline hasn\u2019t been announced yet. By the end of November, a candidate who is not in the race and on ballots has forfeited around 500 votes. By the end of December, a candidate not on primary ballots has forfeited more than 1000 votes.\n\nGraph # 2 shows that a candidate who has missed filing deadlines through the end of January has potentially forfeited 2,232 delegates, the number needed to win the Democratic nomination.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "From the sound of things, Vice President Joseph Biden is still struggling with a decis", "title": "Why Every Passing Day Makes It Harder for Biden\u2014or Any Latecomer--To Run", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/13/Why-Every-Passing-Day-Makes-It-Harder-Biden-or-Any-Latecomer-Run", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-ukraine-biden_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/13/Why-Every-Passing-Day-Makes-It-Harder-Biden-or-Any-Latecomer-Run", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-ukraine-biden_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "From the sound of things, Vice President Joseph Biden is still struggling with a decis", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1df\"", "article_summary": "By the end of November, a candidate who is not in the race and on ballots has forfeited around 500 votes.\nBy the end of December, a candidate not on primary ballots has forfeited more than 1000 votes.\n\u201cConventional wisdom says a candidate has to get in early in order to raise money.\nWaiting until late September or early October to see if former Secretary of State Clinton\u2019s campaign implodes or Sanders\u2019 falters is a big risk for any potential candidate.\nGraph # 2 shows that a candidate who has missed filing deadlines through the end of January has potentially forfeited 2,232 delegates, the number needed to win the Democratic nomination."}
