He\u2019s had successes in cases and had more of a bumpy ride in others such as the 5-4 decision upholding Obamacare. How he deals with the possibility of a deadlocked court with the backdrop of a contentious election and the controversy surrounding the nomination of Scalia\u2019s replacement could say much about Roberts\u2019 leadership.\n\nWhen the court is evenly divided it simply affirms the lower court opinion and sets no national precedent. It\u2019s as if the court never even heard the case.\n\n\u201cThe chief has made clear how much he cares about preserving the court\u2019s legitimacy in these polarized times, and this term will be a real test of that vision, \u201d said Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the National Constitution Center, a non-partisan institution established by Congress.\n\nSince Scalia\u2019s death, Roberts and his colleagues have worked to find common ground or move quickly where possible. The court has already announced that it was deadlocked in an important case concerning public sector unions as well as two others.\n\nIt managed a unanimous result in a voting rights case, brought by conservative activists. It issued an order in a voter ID case that reflected a goal for consensus on an issue that might come back as the election heats up. And justices sent a clear signal that they are working overtime trying to find a way forward in a contraceptive mandate case.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, a liberal, gave Roberts early praise for how he\u2019s handled the court and worked to build consensus since Scalia\u2019s death in February.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s conveyed that both in his words and in his deeds to all of us and I give him enormous credit for what he\u2019s doing,\u201d she said at NYU Law School last month.\n\nRoberts has steered clear of discussing controversial topics in public. Last week, at a judicial conference in Arkansas, he was asked whether he\u2019d like to expand upon comments he made before the death of Scalia concerning the politicization of the confirmation process.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Roberts had a simple answer: No.\n\nAlthough he\u2019s the chief of the court that bears his name, he only has one vote. But he serves as a traffic cop on an increasingly hot bench, and he runs the closed-door conference where decisions are made.\n\nAs chief, he has the power to assign opinions if he is in the majority. \u201cIt\u2019s not my greatest power; it\u2019s my only power,\u201d Roberts told Rosen for an article he wrote for The Atlantic in 2007.\n\n\u201cThe chief\u2019s ability to frame the debate behind closed doors by speaking at conference can make a huge difference,\u201d Rosen said.\n\nImpact of a 4-4 court\n\nKagan repeated the refrain that while the court is often unanimous, the media and the public often focus solely on the handful of 5-4 decisions that occur each term.\n\nWhat makes this term different, however, is that with Scalia\u2019s absence in some of those 5-4 decisions could become 4-4.\n\n\u201cAlthough sharply divided decisions in prior terms (i.e., 5-4) might have perpetuated the perception of an ideologically divided court, sharply divided decisions this term (i.e., 4-4) come with an added twist: no decision of the court at all,\u201d said Pratik A. Shah, a lawyer at Akin Gump who frequently argues before the court.\n\nAs the stalemate continues in Washington over whether the Republicans will hold confirmation hearings for Judge Merrick Garland, it\u2019s unclear when the court will return to full strength.\n\nDemocrats have used the prospect of more 4-4 rulings as an argument Garland should be confirmed. The inability to set national precedents deprives people in parts of the country the full protections of the law, they argue. Republicans have downplayed the impacts of those rulings, and stressed a belief that there should be no hearings so close to an elections.\n\nThe court has already accepted fewer cases for next term, perhaps because justices are unclear of how long they will remain without a replacement for Scalia.\n\nWorking to find consensus\n\nJustices have worked to find consensus whenever possible.\n\nFor instance, after oral arguments in a challenge to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate it seemed the justices might be headed for an even split. But a few days later the court issued an unusual order suggesting it was seeking compromise in the case.\n\nThe justices took a narrow route that managed to win the support of the full court, when they ruled in a case concerning the drawing of state legislative lines in Texas.\n\nAnd a recent order reflected sensitivity to a challenge that divided the justices two years ago.\n\nAt issue was an emergency motion brought by civil rights groups to block Texas\u2019 controversial voter ID law even before the challenge could be heard by a federal appeals court. The first time the law came before the court in 2014, the justices allowed it to remain in effect over a harsh dissent penned by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan. This time around, the justices once again allowed the law to remain in effect, but the court\u2019s order made clear that if the appeals court didn\u2019t act in a timely matter, the plaintiffs could return to the high court for relief.\n\nThere are only a few tea leaves on how they might rule in some of the other cases.\n\nThe affirmative action case, for example, will be decided by seven justices because of Scalia\u2019s death and the fact that Justice Kagan had to recuse herself from hearing the challenge because she dealt with it in her previous job. Behind closed doors, the chief might question whether the case would be a good vehicle for a broad 4-3 ruling.\n\n\u201cI would be kind of surprised almost if this winds up being that consequential a case because I think the chief justice might feel a little bit chary about having much decided by a seven-member divided court by a single vote,\u201d lawyer John Elwood said at an event sponsored by the Constitutional Accountability Center.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON-- The Supreme Court is in the home stretch of an unexpected term, racing to issue opinions in more than 30 cases, many that were impacted by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WPMT FOX43", "description": "WASHINGTON\u2013 The Supreme Court is in the home stretch of an unexpected term, racing to issue opinions in more than 30 cases, many that were impacted by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scal\u2026", "title": "Down a justice, John Roberts looks to find compromise, avoid 4-4 ties", "url": "http://fox43.com/2016/05/10/down-a-justice-john-roberts-looks-to-find-compromise-avoid-4-4-ties/", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "https://tribwpmt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/s001899342.jpg?w=960", "height": 1200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwpmt.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/s001899342.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox43", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox43"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News in Harrisburg, York, Lancaster, Lebanon News, Weather, Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=593652814", "fb": {"pages": 121742908330}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox43.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c21a62ded72703161d0a8a5845d07db8?s=16", "application-name": "WPMT FOX43", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox43news", "published_time": "2016-05-10T15:06:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-10T15:06:45+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox43news"}, "keywords": "news, politics, antonin scalia, supreme court, supreme court justice", "google-site-verification": "ilkJ6nB6LBJwfhBgyPxbKMW1j6YSMqGS-P6sRpLIxD4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Since Scalia\u2019s death, Roberts and his colleagues have worked to find common ground or move quickly where possible.\nWhen the court is evenly divided it simply affirms the lower court opinion and sets no national precedent.\nJustice Elena Kagan, a liberal, gave Roberts early praise for how he\u2019s handled the court and worked to build consensus since Scalia\u2019s death in February.\nWhat makes this term different, however, is that with Scalia\u2019s absence in some of those 5-4 decisions could become 4-4.\nBut a few days later the court issued an unusual order suggesting it was seeking compromise in the case."}
