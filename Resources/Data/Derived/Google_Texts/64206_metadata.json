I am here to help you with that last one.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the NBA puts on a quintuple-header of marquee games. This is, unofficially, the league\u2019s yearly coming-out party; it\u2019s when basketball has the conch and everyone sits around and listens. But let\u2019s be honest: Telling your loved ones that you are going to watch 12 hours of basketball on Christmas is a nonstarter. And let\u2019s be even more honest: Watching 12 hours of these particular basketball games could be bad for your mental stability, your physical health, and your brand (especially if your brand is \u201cwell-adjusted person\u201d). So be safe, follow this guide, and you might just make it through to the other side.\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nWAKE UP. Merry Christmas. You have two hours until basketball apocalypse. Hustle yourself downstairs, because it\u2019s time to open presents. Did your parents give you something that feels like the Christmas present version of a subtweet? Did you get a calculator or a Christian Mingle or JDate profile? Take that rage and push it deep down inside! You\u2019re going to need it! You\u2019re about to watch the Bulls!\n\nIt\u2019s important to hydrate, carb load, and caffeinate. Seriously, spend some quality time with your loved ones, exchange gifts and warm embraces, clean up the wrapping paper, and have a wonderful breakfast. Then chase it all down with some Lakers-approved BULLETPROOF COFFEE AND GET YOUR GAME FACE ON.\n\n10:30 a.m.-Noon\n\nDo suicide sprints up and down your block because you just drank coffee with butter and cream and you\u2019re going to have heart failure if you don\u2019t burn off some of the fat. Don\u2019t worry, Thibs still loves you.\n\n(Via FTW)\n\nNoon\n\nFirst game of the day! The old, injured, underperforming Brooklyn Nets host Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Chicago Bulls! D.J. Augustin on Christmas Day? No, you\u2019re not dreaming. Here\u2019s how you play this: Check in with this game for the pageantry of tipoff, watch some hardcore Blatche-on-Boozer action for a few minutes, mute the game, and leave the room. Circulate. What\u2019s going on in the kitchen? Does anyone need any help? Dad, how\u2019s that book on World War II? No, the other book on World War II. Talk to your sister\u2019s boyfriend about EDM. Be social. Keep an eye on the score of the game, and more specifically the level of animosity between Kevin Garnett and Joakim Noah.\n\n(Via HeyBelinda)\n\n2 p.m.\n\nLunch. Maybe some Italian?\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nBAAAAAAAAAAARGGGGGGGGGS. Make sure you are wearing all black for the Knicks-Thunder clash, because this is going to be Andrea Bargnani\u2019s funeral. You may feel the need to get up, to walk around, to talk to your family. Resist that urge. No matter how bad the basketball is, sit there and watch. If you have a son, LET THE BOY WATCH. Kevin Durant is about to kill a man. He\u2019s averaging 28.2 points per game in December, he\u2019s on national television, and he is going to see Bargs on defense. He could go for 60. Watch this. Besides, you\u2019re going to have plenty of time to do other things this afternoon.\n\n4:50 p.m.\n\nLook up in the sky, see J.R. Smith fly over your head in a sleigh pulled by reindeer. Marvel at the universe.\n\n5 p.m.\n\nWatch the first five minutes of Lakers-Heat. After that, the score will likely be 54-10. Go help your mother with dinner. Nobody should have to watch this. Midway through this contest, Erik Spoelstra is going to be running Norris Cole, Birdman, Rashard Lewis, Pitbull, and Glen Frey out there.\n\n6:30 p.m.\n\nDinner. Get after it. Ignore the sounds of exploding metal and Dyan Cannon screaming. If you happen to make a pass by the television and see Kendall Marshall playing basketball, do not be alarmed. Remember your training.\n\n8 p.m.\n\nNow things get interesting. It\u2019s time to stop talking about Obamacare, Duck Dynasty, Justine Sacco, and the movie with Sandy Bullock in space not the movie with Sandy Bullock and the lady from Mike and Molly \u2026 and it\u2019s definitely time to stop talking about EDM with this guy.\n\nIt\u2019s time for some serious Texas basketball, with some serious Texas basketball players. And Dwight Howard. The Rockets and the Spurs, the top two teams in the Southwest Division, clash, with names like Lin, Leonard, Howard, Harden, Duncan, and Ginobili on display. This is the first \u201cgood\u201d game of the day. Patrick Beverley is out with a broken hand, Kawhi Leonard is coming of a \u201cdental procedure,\u201d and Tony Parker is still nursing his bad shin, so we don\u2019t really know how much we\u2019ll see of those guys. Mind you, Pop could very well start Patty Mills, Jeff Ayres, Aron Baynes, Matt Bonner, and Cory Joseph. But even if he did, would you be shocked if the Spurs won?\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nWe end our day the way Christmas usually ends: contentiously. Warriors vs. Clippers is the best game of the day, and one of the most interesting new rivalries in the league. Remember back in November when these two played a 126-115 street fight that the Clips won on the back of a 42-point Chris Paul performance? It was the same game where Andrew Bogut and DeAndre Jordan got into a shoving contest and Blake Griffin got into it with Warriors coach Mark Jackson. Now we get a rematch. Everyone has gone to bed. Only true heroes stay up for the last game on Christmas. Do you have what it takes? It\u2019s time to fashion that ugly sweater into a headband and get into the jungle of basketball for real. After the day you\u2019ve had, you deserve it.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noodp", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Chris Ryan", "og": {"site_name": "Grantland", "description": "Christmas is a time for many things: awkwardly regressing into your childhood by spending copious amounts of time in your old bedroom while avoiding your family, watching Home Alone, frantically bu\u2026", "title": "How to Watch the NBA on Christmas and Not Get Expelled From Your Family", "url": "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/how-to-watch-the-nba-on-christmas-and-not-get-expelled-from-your-family/", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/458202515.jpg", "height": 422}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/458202515.jpg?w=640"}, "maxage": 300, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "Grantland33", "id": 241964676}}, "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-tooltip": "Sports and pop culture from our rotating cast of writers", "fb": {"app_id": 135272579883594}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "application-name": "Grantland", "google-site-verification": "sBS9Jdz1HC3Fh09nz_SLTBI0VXP3OZ6fOqL61QwkuJY", "msvalidate.01": "980DAC91C6458F6FA90F7089E61D12B0", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2013-12-24T17:30:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-24T17:30:24+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://grantland.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/aa872ea20c62336515046995cae2daf2?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea5f\"", "article_summary": "On Christmas Day, the NBA puts on a quintuple-header of marquee games.\nBut let\u2019s be honest: Telling your loved ones that you are going to watch 12 hours of basketball on Christmas is a nonstarter.\nAugustin on Christmas Day?\nYou\u2019re going to need it!\nBesides, you\u2019re going to have plenty of time to do other things this afternoon."}
