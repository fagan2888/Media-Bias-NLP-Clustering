But according to a new, anonymously-sourced report from Radar Online, there were three big names that turned her down.\n\nAccording to a \u201ca source close to production\u201d at ABC News, Jay Z, Kristen Stewart and Robert Downey Jr. all chose not to appear on Walters\u2019 show. \u201cThe real story behind the show is who turned down a sit-down with the interview queen for her annual special,\u201d the source said. \u201cTypically, Barbara very carefully starts approaching people in September for the special, but she always accounts for getting turned down by some of her interview targets. They start with 30 names and narrow it down to get all the interviews done for Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nTo fill the Hollywood ingenue slot, Walters ended up including Jennifer Lawrence, who arguably had a more \u201cfascinating\u201d year than Stewart with The Hunger Games sequel and American Hustle. Instead of Jay Z, Walters ended up with that rapper\u2019s frequent collaborator Kanye West, who appeared with his wife Kim Kardashian. And without Downey, the list was left without a male actor.\n\nInterestingly, Walters did not get sit-down interviews with Edward Snowden, Pope Francis I or the royal baby, but that did not stop her from including them on her list.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barbara Walters named Hillary Clinton her number one \"most fascinating\" person of 2013, on a list that included Miley Cyrus, Robin Roberts and the cast of Duck", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-18-at-10.45.07-PM-300x2031.png", "title": "Three of 2013\u2019s \u2018Most Fascinating\u2019 People Reportedly Turned Down Barbara Walters"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barbara Walters named Hillary Clinton her number one \"most fascinating\" person of 2013, on a list that included Miley Cyrus, Robin Roberts and the cast of Duck Dynasty.
