Kennedy, that rare commander-in-chief who after his death became popular among Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nJFK is a pivotal figure of an older Washington where bipartisanship was the standard operating procedure. His assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963 has in large part helped to define each of his White House successors, according to the new book, The Kennedy Half Century, by University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.\n\nRELATED: 10 STATES THAT CAN ELECT THE NEXT PRESIDENT\n\nThe book entertains controversy about the moments before Kennedy\u2019s death and the government reports that followed, but it leaves almost no doubt about the virtues of an era that ended with the young president\u2019s death. The book\u2014as with MSNBC host Chris Matthews\u2019 \u201cTip and the Gipper\u201d\u2014recounts a period that seems to be lost as the country lurches into the third week of a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cConjure up a time when government actually worked,\u201d Sabato said Tuesday at the book\u2019s launch in the Newseum at Washington.\n\nBut that period of faith in the government quickly eroded in the years after JFK\u2019s death, with the suspicions of Washington only confirmed by the Warren Commission report\u2014which made the case for Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone gunman\u2014and the House Special Committee on Assassinations\u2014which undermined the lone gunman argument.\n\nSabato called the investigations into JFK\u2019s death a \u201cRorschach test about the government\u2019s credibility, and the government has easily failed the test over the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe Warren Commission\u2014led by Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2014failed to exhaustively marshal all of the available evidence and ignored any finding that raised doubts about Oswald acting alone, Sabato said.\n\nThe House committee relied on dictabelt recording from the Dallas Police Department, claiming that four gunshots could be heard over the course of eight seconds, a conclusion indicating that there was at least one other gunman. But analysis for Sabato\u2019s book finds that the dictabelt did not, in fact, record the shots being fired, as the motorcycle carrying the microphone that became the basis of the dictabelt was not by the presidential motorcade at the fateful moment. The \u201clong hoped for Rosetta stone of the Kennedy assassination is nothing of the sort,\u201d Sabato said.\n\nRELATED: WHICH FORMER PRESIDENT COSTS THE U.S. MOST?\n\nSabato noted that Kennedy rarely had adequate security, often putting himself in a position where the crowds could practically crush him. \u201cIt would have been a major miracle if JFK had gotten through two terms without one or more assassination attempts,\u201d Sabato said.\n\nFew presidents have endured as vividly in the public\u2019s memory as JFK, a remarkable accomplishment given that he was only in the third year of his first term. Accompanying the book is polling about Kennedy, who enjoys a favorable reputation among both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nSabato notes that Ronald Reagan relied on JFK to sell his 1961 tax cut and Cold War foreign policy, a sign of just of fiscally conservative the Kennedy administration actually was. Bill Clinton tapped into Kennedy\u2019s rhetoric to \u201ccapitalize on baby boomer nostalgia.\u201d George W. Bush used the movie \u201cThirteen Days\u201d about the Cuban missile crisis to foster a relationship with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), who then partnered with the administration for the 2001 No Child Left Behind law.\n\nGeoff Garin, president of Hart Research Associates, which conducted the survey, said at the book launch that JFK continues to be as much of the public dialogue as President Obama. \u201cIt was as if we were talking to Americans about a contemporary politician,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Over the last 50 years, every American president has relied heavily on the legacy, memory and ideals of John F.
