Or that antibiotic-resistant infections \u2014 many attributed to doctors not washing their hands \u2014 cause 23,000 deaths a year.\n\nThese were among 10 critical health issues presented Monday to an audience of about 275 people, including 10 strategically picked CEOs and entrepreneurs who must now decide whether they can create a viable company in 10 days.\n\n10.10.10, the first-of-its-kind event, has rallied the city of Denver and health care systems, including Kaiser Permanente and Celebration Health Florida Hospital, to support entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs hold the key to unlocking a huge market opportunity. That is what they do,\u201d said Tom Higley, a serial entrepreneur who dreamed up the idea three years ago. \u201cThey have a vision. They\u2019re able to execute and deliver on that vision. That is a resource that hasn\u2019t been explored in a way we\u2019d like it to be.\u201d\n\nKelly Dunkin, vice president of philanthropy at Colorado Health Foundation, pitched the epidemic of childhood obesity by showing how in the past few decades, national rates jumped from a few states with a high of 10 percent to 14 percent obese children to more than half the states having childhood obesity rates above 25 percent.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything about this, this generation of kids will be the first to live sicker and shorter lives than their parents,\u201d she said.\n\nThe College of Healthcare Information Management Executives, or CHIME, pointed out the high cost of misidentifying patients or duplicating their records \u2014 it can cost $1,000 to fix a record. CHIME president Russ Branzell\n\nmentioned something even scarier: \u201cIf I can\u2019t identify you, how can I make sure your information is protected?\u201d he said.\n\nDavid De Jesus, with Florida Hospital, which will offer experts and data to entrepreneurs, said he flew in to witness the event because he sees Denver as a leader in digital health.\n\n\u201cDenver has progressed far more than other states. We\u2019re really looking for opportunities to create an alliance,\u201d said De Jesus, the hospital\u2019s digital health principal architect. \u201cOverall, all these problems are a national endeavor. Not just local.\u201d\n\nThe 10 wicked problems presented were:\n\n\u2022 Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n\u2022 Childhood obesity\n\n\u2022 Patient engagement\n\n\u2022 Antibiotic resistance\n\n\u2022 End-of-life care\n\n\u2022 Pandemic weapons and bioterrorism\n\n\u2022 Patient and data matching\n\n\u2022 Health guide maps\n\n\u2022 Health data\n\n\u2022 Patient mobility and independence\n\nThe entrepreneurs will work 10 days straight and return Feb. 26 to present their findings and indicate whether they will spend the next nine to 10 months pursuing a startup.\n\nTamara Chuang: 303-954-1209, tchuang@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Gadgetress\n\nThe 10 entrepreneurs are:\n\n\u2022 Frank Ricotta, managing partner of BurstIQ from Denver\n\n\u2022 Maurice Herbelin, a Sacramento, Calif., medical doctor who previously served as a UnitedHealth Group medical director\n\n\u2022 Joy Randels, CEO of tech-accelerator New Market Partner in Bradenton, Fla.\n\n\u2022 Monique Giggy, co-founder of mobile-golf app Swing by Swing Golf, in Palo Alto, Calif.\n\n\u2022 Zackary Lewis, Denver founder of radio-streaming company Liquid Compass\n\n\u2022 Lizelle van Vuuren, Denver-based CEO of marketing firm Effectively and founder of Women Who Startup\n\n\u2022 Craig Misrach, San Diego-based founder of medical device company Freedom Meditech\n\n\u2022 Kelly O\u2019Neill Dwight, Denver-based president of KMD Consulting Services\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Kellond, co-founder of Boulder\u2019s Bia Sport, a sports watch company\n\n\u2022 Lincoln Powers, founder and CEO of Rocky Mountain Technology Group in Montana", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Entrepreneurs start 10-day race to solve 10 big health problems", "title": "Entrepreneurs start 10-day race to solve 10 big health problems", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/16/entrepreneurs-start-10-day-race-to-solve-10-big-health-problems/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150216__20150217_A9_BZ171010102p2.jpg", "height": 415}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150216__20150217_A9_BZ171010102p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-16T18:50:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T22:41:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a27\"", "article_summary": "10.10.10, the first-of-its-kind event, has rallied the city of Denver and health care systems, including Kaiser Permanente and Celebration Health Florida Hospital, to support entrepreneurs.\nWe\u2019re really looking for opportunities to create an alliance,\u201d said De Jesus, the hospital\u2019s digital health principal architect.\nOr that antibiotic-resistant infections \u2014 many attributed to doctors not washing their hands \u2014 cause 23,000 deaths a year.\nIn this age of technology, it\u2019s mind-boggling to think that as many as one in five patients are misidentified at hospitals nationwide.\nThat is what they do,\u201d said Tom Higley, a serial entrepreneur who dreamed up the idea three years ago."}
