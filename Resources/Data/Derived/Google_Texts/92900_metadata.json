An unoccupied blue BMW was later seen two block from the school at 1001 W. 84th Ave., he said.\n\nThe school was placed in lockdown. While police were searching the school an anonymous caller told dispatchers they had seen a person with a gun inside the charter school.\n\nPinnacle\u2019s elementary and middle schools were placed in lockdown and Pinnacle High School was put in lockout during a search of the high school, Vallero said.\n\nThornton police and Adams County Sheriff\u2019s Department deputies also helped search the charter school.\n\nA perimeter was set up around the school, Vallero said.\n\nLarry Devan, who works at an auto parts store across the street, said he saw officers flowing into the area.
