The start of the game was very good. I liked the way we back-checked. Our tracking was solid,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cWe were coming back and working as a unit of five. I thought it was a really solid team effort. That\u2019s the type of game I was hoping to see us play.\u201d\n\nThe power play, however, remains troublesome \u2014 although the Avs had just one. Their scoreless skid with the man advantage increased to 11 games and 32 consecutive chances.\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\nBut the Avs will take the win, their first since beating the Stars 3-2 in a shootout Feb. 3 in Dallas. Colorado is 4-0 against the Stars.\n\nNathan MacKinnon, Alex Tanguay, Jarome Iginla and Dennis Everberg scored on 5-on-5 situations, goalie Semyon Varlamov was good when he needed to be and McLeod served as the sparkplug. Before being ejected at 6:22 of the third period with 30 minutes worth of penalties that included two fighting majors, McLeod had four shots, five hits, two blocked shots and contributed to a flawless penalty kill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he does, night in night out, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s in this league and one of the most effective energy players, physical players \u2014 one of the best guys in his role in this league,\u201d Avs captain Gabe Landeskog said of McLeod.\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Avalanche beat the Dallas Stars, 4-1\n\nRookie winger Everberg scored with 23.1 seconds remaining for his second point of the game.\n\nThe Stars, who played Friday in Dallas and were without three injured forwards and a suspended fourth, produced just 15 shots on Varlamov after two periods and 25 for the game.\n\nIginla gave the Avs a 3-0 lead early in the third period on an awkward play that will never lose its highlight identity. Brad Stuart wound up from the point just before colliding with defensive partner Nick Holden, and the puck caromed off Iginla\u2019s left leg and past backup goalie Jhonas Enroth.\n\nStuart required help off the ice and went through the concussion protocol in the trainer\u2019s room before returning. In addition to his assist, Stuart played a big role in limiting Dallas\u2019 chances in front of Varlamov.\n\nIginla\u2019s goal was the 578th of his career, moving him into sole possession of 19th-most in NHL history. He was tied with Mark Recchi.\n\nTrailing 3-0, Dallas scored on a 5-on-4 attack midway through the third period with Enroth on the bench for an extra attacker. It was not a power-play goal. It just looked like it.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche stops four-game slide with 4-1 victory over Dallas", "title": "Avalanche stops four-game slide with 4-1 victory over Dallas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/14/avalanche-stops-four-game-slide-with-4-1-victory-over-dallas/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__avs-rorp1-2.jpg", "height": 500}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150214__avs-rorp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T12:00:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T19:56:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe282a\"", "article_summary": "Trailing 3-0, Dallas scored on a 5-on-4 attack midway through the third period with Enroth on the bench for an extra attacker.\nPHOTOS: Colorado Avalanche beat the Dallas Stars, 4-1Rookie winger Everberg scored with 23.1 seconds remaining for his second point of the game.\nThe Avs used three even-strength goals and extreme toughness from Cody McLeod to beat the Dallas Stars 4-1 at the Pepsi Center and snap a four-game losing streak.\nIn addition to his assist, Stuart played a big role in limiting Dallas\u2019 chances in front of Varlamov.\nIginla gave the Avs a 3-0 lead early in the third period on an awkward play that will never lose its highlight identity."}
