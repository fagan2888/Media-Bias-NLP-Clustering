Officials could not discuss what was talked about in the closed-door session.\n\nCouncilwoman Sally Mounier said the discussion was \u201cvery good\u201d but added there is not a set date when they will talk about the issue again.\n\n\u201cWe did not have enough time,\u201d Mounier said. \u201cWe need to talk more.\u201d\n\nMayor Steve Hogan said having an outside facilitator present helped move along the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe started some discussion that could have been held before,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cI think it was valuable.\u201d\n\nNoe declined to comment, and the topic did not come up at the regular City Council meeting later Monday night.\n\nDuring the Jan. 26 City Council meeting, five female council members \u2014 Mounier, Barb Cleland, Molly Markert, Renie Peterson and Marsha Berzins \u2014 voted in favor of having a no-confidence vote added to the regular council agenda. But the measure needed eight votes to place it on the agenda and it failed.\n\nSince then, some of the women have said Noe is condescending to them, yells at them and treats them differently compared to their male counterparts.\n\n\u201cHe treats us like we\u2019re hysterical females and we should sit down and take three Midol,\u201d Mounier said last week.\n\nNoe told The Denver Post last week that he hoped all sides could work things out, and that if the majority on the council support him continuing in his role as city manager, he intends to do so after running the city for four years.\n\nNoe\u2019s fate is even more significant given that Aurora, unlike Denver, is not a strong form of mayoral government; the city manager runs the day-to-day operations. Also of note is the November election, when the dynamic of the City Council could change dramatically. Five of the 10 council seats are up for grabs, as well as the mayor\u2019s position.\n\nCarlos Illescas: 303-954-1175, cillescas@denverpost.com or twitter.com/cillescasdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aurora officials plan to meet again about City Manager Skip Noe", "title": "Aurora officials plan to meet again about City Manager Skip Noe", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/23/aurora-officials-plan-to-meet-again-about-city-manager-skip-noe/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150221__20150222_B1_CD22NOEp1.jpg", "height": 607}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150221__20150222_B1_CD22NOEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-23T19:16:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T01:25:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2064\"", "article_summary": "AURORA \u2014 City manager Skip Noe, the City Council and the mayor met Monday afternoon in an executive session to hash out concerns that Noe treats women on the Aurora council differently than the men.\n\u201cI think it was valuable.\u201dNoe declined to comment, and the topic did not come up at the regular City Council meeting later Monday night.\nAlso of note is the November election, when the dynamic of the City Council could change dramatically.\nNoe\u2019s fate is even more significant given that Aurora, unlike Denver, is not a strong form of mayoral government; the city manager runs the day-to-day operations.\nDuring the Jan. 26 City Council meeting, five female council members \u2014 Mounier, Barb Cleland, Molly Markert, Renie Peterson and Marsha Berzins \u2014 voted in favor of having a no-confidence vote added to the regular council agenda."}
