From PTSD to the ways multiple deployments challenge whole communities \u2014 families, schools, healthcare networks, and efforts to process all of this in face-to-face dialogue \u2014 we narrate a \u201ctale of two cities,\u201d the relationship between Colorado Springs and Fort Carson.\n\nWe also tell a tale of two cultures, tracing the contours of what some call the military-civilian cultural gap.\n\nHow did a study that began focused on PTSD become a book that urges readers to go beyond that medical diagnosis? When we were called in 2008 to interview a battalion of Fort Carson infantrymen back from a second hard tour in Iraq, it was specifically to explore how stigma tied to unseen wounds like PTSD might prevent soldiers from seeking help.\n\nThrough our interviews, however, we noted that many would virtually roll their eyes when the topic of PTSD came up. We grasped how many soldiers treat PTSD within their ranks with suspicion. As one put it, \u201cThere are more people that claim PTSD and don\u2019t actually have it than people who have it and don\u2019t seek treatment.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t believe something like PTSD existed. \u201cAnyone who served with us has to have it, really,\u201d another soldier said, \u201cbut we aren\u2019t the ones claiming it.\u201d Military personnel also grow suspicious of media coverage, bloggers, and activists\u2019 attention to PTSD because they may feel it is being used as proxy for critique about the wars, or of the military itself.\n\nMeanwhile, mental health providers worried about \u201cbracket creep\u201d (the standards of diagnosis growing ever looser), such that \u201csecondary\u201d or \u201cvicarious\u201d PTSD is increasingly being claimed and diagnosed in military family members traumatized by deployment\u2019s impact from home, as well as by service providers to service members and veterans.\n\nStill others worry that showcasing impressive new PTSD programs may distract from a dearth of other, equally needed services for traumatic brain injuries, depression, addiction, domestic violence intervention, or increased criminality.\n\nAnd whether or not combat and deployment experiences manifest in PTSD or other problems, reintegration itself, apart from mental injuries, poses significant challenges to soldiers and the families and communities from whom they have been separated. Many young adults who enlisted as adolescents are integrating as civilians for the first time.\n\nWhile medical diagnoses like PTSD are expected to bring a politically neutral framework to post-deployment casualties, we found this applied only in the therapeutic context itself. Overall, the topic of PTSD in public discourse emerged as exceedingly fraught: ambiguous, controversial, and inescapably politicized. One soldier said, \u201cThe problem with PTSD is that it lets everyone put everything about the wars onto the individual soldier.\u201d\n\nWe suggest a shift in the way we narrate war for ourselves. Beyond war stories centered upon the individual male hero\u2019s journey, we offer a collective, mind-boggling labyrinth, a tangled plurality of many standpoints and stories both local and global, and lurking with variable, minotaur-like threats and fears.\n\nIn so doing, we submit that coming back from war entails dismantling the compartmentalization that war creates, between \u201cus\u201d and our \u201cenemies,\u201d between \u201chere\u201d and \u201cover there,\u201d between soldier and civilian, between \u201ctheir\u201d war and \u201cour\u201d war. War as labyrinth defies separation and insulation: It means that global echoes of war\u2019s violence reverberate and affect us all, and that they necessarily follow combatants home.\n\nFrom a singular focus on PTSD as \u201cthe\u201d unseen wound of war, we have asked \u201cWhat else do we also need to understand?\u201d From versions of public engagement with war based on civilians-as-audience whose job is merely to listen, we have called for reciprocal military-civilian interchange, and for civilians who shoulder responsibility.\n\nIn dwelling considerably on PTSD even as we urge readers to also go beyond it, we argue the diagnosis means something distinct for afflicted soldiers and the clinicians who treat them from the meanings it takes on in wider public discourse. The unprecedented challenges presented by protracted wars and multiple deployments, and serviced through an all-volunteer force, create a circumstance in which what is good for treating individual bodies afflicted by PTSD \u2014 individualized, mental health treatment \u2014 may not be the best prescription for the collective, social body, where nations and communities must reckon with war in all its components.\n\nAmerican communities must be called to attend to the moral dimensions of suffering, healing, and the divisions within and between communities affected by war. War is already so multifaceted, involving control over and access to resources, conflicting cultural values, biological drives, and environmental conditions. When we try to to suggest that we can predictably manage it to attain a favorable cost-benefit result, we are blindsided.\n\nStigma surrounding PTSD and physical disabilities resulting from the wounds of war differs from stigma associated with how military occupational specialties become ranked in ways that are gendered (and \u201cclassed,\u201d \u201craced\u201d and so on). Stigma assigned to civilians and civilian life as undisciplined, indulgent and weak is something still again.\n\nWe conclude that stigma in its myriad forms is better understood as one of many ways that humans manage terror. Terror is an existential dilemma that we all face, on battlefields and in domestic life alike; it reminds us of our mortality and fragility, and that trauma is always, everywhere, potentially just around the corner. Even at home, violence on a scale approaching what soldiers face in war plagues many communities. In war, violence takes on sharpened, particular forms. Terror, stress, and trauma punctuated by waiting and boredom become \u201cnormal\u201d parts of life, no longer buffered by the relative regularity of domestic culture. Life is intrinsically hard; where we have choices about the use of war and violence it is best to consider carefully how we might avoid compounding the terror.\n\nThat we use culture to manage terror \u2014 the global war on terror being only the most pronounced instance \u2014 may be in part hard-wired, an aspect of our evolutionary adaptation for survival. But how we frame culture and the paradigms we use are things we can and do change. On an individual and community level, the army\u2019s efforts to fight stigma associated with war\u2019s invisible wounds so that soldiers and veterans seek help is an important step.\n\nEqually important are establishing effective, evidence-based clinical treatments complemented by a variety of community-based programs that reintegrate soldiers into civilian life and extend hands across the military-civilian divide.\n\nBut by themselves they are inadequate. We must also ask ourselves: How will we manage terror culturally, as a nation? If we condition a segment of our citizens, many already troubled by violence, declining economic opportunities, and poor education, to exercise lethal force, and repeatedly place them in embattled contexts where they become subject to and agents of violence, blowback at home and abroad is inevitable.\n\nSoldier-perpetrated crimes, whether the murder cluster tied to Fort Carson soldiers or massacres at Fort Hood and a distant Afghan village, may not be wholly isolated events. They form a pattern of violence spilling over from the sanctioned use of lethal force. Once again, the labyrinth of war forces us to view these events as part of a global whole.\n\nWe maintain that civilian disengagement with the plight of our service members and the campaigns they serve is dangerous. Checks and balances are an essential component of a vibrant democracy. Soldiers frequently told us that they had been mis-trained for what they were asked to do on deployments. Many soldiers, especially those in the junior enlisted ranks without a college education, find that military experience does not always translate into similarly well-paying jobs in the civilian workforce.\n\nAt the national level, as we maintain a sizeable standing army (albeit much reduced from its greatest size in World War II), we must feed it, clothe it, equip it, and find things for it to do. This distracts attention and resources from honing other skills, maintaining infrastructure, investing in public education, and other national pursuits that have made us a strong nation.\n\nIn a globalized world where national boundaries are increasingly porous, human security is essential in creating national security.\n\nSarah Hautzinger, Ph.D., teaches anthropology and feminist and gender studies at Colorado College.
