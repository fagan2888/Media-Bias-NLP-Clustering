CONCORD, N.H.—Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley tonight advocated for a return to what he called “common sense economics”—including keeping the minimum wage above the poverty level.

“I don’t believe that any nation ever cut its way to prosperity,” O’Malley said during a backyard town hall in New Hampshire. “There are certain things we need to do for our common good and to strengthen our common good.”

O’Malley, a Democratic nominee for president in 2016, said that “our economy isn’t money, our economy is people.”

“We’ve spent the last 30 years following this false economics, this heresy of every person for themselves,” O’Malley said.

He said that the role of the United States “remains to lead by example the rise of the global middle class.”

O’Malley stressed his dedication to protecting the environment.

“I am the only candidate in this race that has set the goal of 100 percent clean electric energy in the United States of America by 2050,” O’Malley said.

He called the goal achievable.

“What’s the difference between a goal and a dream? It’s a deadline,” O’Malley said.

He said he wants to lead “the green movement.”

“It is not the technology that is lacking, but the political will,” O’Malley said.

O’Malley touted his record of “executive experience,” citing his experience as both a mayor and governor.

He concluded the town hall by playing a rendition of “This Land is Your Land” on a guitar.
