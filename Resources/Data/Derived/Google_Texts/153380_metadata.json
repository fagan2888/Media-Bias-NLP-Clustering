Perez and Treasury Secretary Jacob \u201cJack\u201d Lew.\n\nIn a statement June 3, the archdiocese said its suit was \u201cgrounded on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment\u201d of the Constitution, and it asks the court \u201cto block enforcement of portions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that force religious employers to provide contraceptive services that violate Catholic belief.\u201d\n\nThe Philadelphia Archdiocese qualifies as a religious employer so it enjoys an exemption to provide contraceptive services. But Catholic Charities \u2014 and the 16 social service and health care agencies that comprise it \u2014 does not qualify.\n\n\u201cHouses of worship,\u201d including churches and dioceses, are exempt, but religious institutions within a diocese, such as schools, universities, social service agencies and hospitals are not exempt.\n\nThe mandate does not include a conscience clause for employers who object to such coverage on moral grounds.\n\nThe filing of the archdiocese\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdisputes the government\u2019s power to order Catholic entities to offer or cooperate in such services,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThere are only two options for Catholic Charities, the archdiocese and other dioceses that have filed similar lawsuits: These Catholic organizations can sign a form stating that a third-party provider will offer the objectionable services, but the organizations will still pay indirectly for services that are contrary to Catholic teaching, or they can refuse to sign the form and be subject to fines of $100 per each beneficiary for each day of noncompliance.\n\nWith 1,600 subscribers in the archdiocesan health care plan, Catholic Charities\u2019 fines would amount to $160,000 per day. In only six months, the fines would reach nearly $1 million.\n\nThe potential financial duress would begin soon. The mandate would normally begin to take effect when the health care plan reached its renewal date. In the archdiocese\u2019s case, that is July 1.\n\nJoseph J. Sweeney Jr., secretary for Catholic Human Services and head of Catholic Charities in the archdiocese, stated in the court filing that four options are open to the archdiocese, all of which he called \u201cintolerable:\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cSponsor a group health plan that provides coverage for contraceptive services\u201d (in violation of church teaching).\n\n\u2014 \u201cSponsor a group health plan that excludes coverage for contraceptive services but subjects the archdiocese affiliates (the agencies of Catholic Charities) to onerous fines.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cExpel the archdiocese affiliates from the (archdiocese\u2019s health) plan.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cDo not sponsor a group health plan at all.\u201d\n\nSweeney suggested the latter point would be inconsistent with Catholic teaching on the right of basic health care for its employees.\n\n\u201cNone of these options is morally acceptable to the archdiocese,\u201d he said, \u201cand each substantially burdens its religious exercise.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Catholic bishops have for many years supported health care reform so that health benefits might be extended to all Americans. But the bishops also have vigorously opposed the HHS mandate on the grounds that it restricts religious freedom.\n\nWith its lawsuit, the archdiocese becomes the 50th nonprofit organization \u2014 including 17 individual dioceses and archdioceses \u2014 to file suit seeking an injunction on the regulations, according to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which was not involved in the suit\u2019s filing.\n\nThe Diocese of Greensburg and Bishop Lawrence E. Brandt, in southwestern Pennsylvania, filed a similar suit May 27 in the federal court of the western district of the state.\n\nThat court recently granted an injunction to the dioceses of Pittsburgh and Erie.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Catholic News Service", "og": {"site_name": "The Catholic Sun", "description": "The Archdiocese of Philadelphia and its Catholic Charities affiliates sued three agencies of the U.S. federal government June 2 seeking relief from the federal mandate that most employers cover con\u2026", "title": "Lawsuit \u2018disputes government\u2019s power\u2019 to require contraceptive coverage", "url": "http://www.catholicsun.org/2014/06/03/lawsuit-disputes-governments-power-to-require-contraceptive-coverage/", "image": {"width": 2400, "identifier": "http://www.catholicsun.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20130201nw41.jpg", "height": 1443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.catholicsun.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/20130201nw41.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-03T23:10:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T23:10:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With 1,600 subscribers in the archdiocesan health care plan, Catholic Charities\u2019 fines would amount to $160,000 per day.\nThe mandate would normally begin to take effect when the health care plan reached its renewal date.\nBut Catholic Charities \u2014 and the 16 social service and health care agencies that comprise it \u2014 does not qualify.\nThe filing of the archdiocese\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdisputes the government\u2019s power to order Catholic entities to offer or cooperate in such services,\u201d the statement read.\nUnder the federal health care law, the Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations requiring that employee health care coverage include contraception, sterilization procedures and potentially abortion-causing drugs, all of which violate Catholic Church teaching on the sanctity of human life."}
