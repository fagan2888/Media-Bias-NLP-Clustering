About 100 people turned out Monday night for the first of four meetings hosted by the Mayor\u2019s Gang Prevention Task Force. This one took place at Overfelt High School and was for citizens served by the Police Department\u2019s Foothill division.\n\nSeveral of the eastern San Jose residents voiced concern about the use of marijuana, heroin and painkillers by youth, along with graffiti tagging and bullying in and out of schools. Personal security emerged as an overarching theme.\n\n\u201cDepending on which street you live on or where you come from, this doesn\u2019t feel like the safest place in the country,\u201d San Jose native Mario Maciel, superintendent of the task force, said to open the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a big task ahead of us, but we take it personally.\u201d\n\nSome community members mentioned the possible connection between gangs and street prostitution. Others said they were worried about children being exposed to vape pens, also known as e-cigarettes, which can be doctored into marijuana pipes.\n\nTo combat the problems, the city\u2019s current budget allocates more than $3 million over two years to gang prevention, a significant increase from last year\u2019s funding level. Police attribute the drop in violent gang-related crimes to the department\u2019s Violent Crime Reduction Plan begun in June of this year.\n\nAt the meeting, participants were divided into small focus groups to help the task force develop its 2014-2016 strategic work plan. Esther G. Mota, who led one of the focus groups, said a number of the community concerns were not a surprise to her and other task force members.\n\nLinda Lara, a grandmother and minister in a local church, was assigned to Mota\u2019s group. When asked if they felt safe, Lara and others in the focus group agreed that they did not, particularly in neighborhoods where the Latino gang presence is significant. Lara noted a rise in the influence of gangs from out of town, mentioning Oakland and East Palo Alto. Another parent commented that \u201cit\u2019s carte blanche out there for trouble.\u201d\n\nLara believes families must bear a portion of the responsibility for youth involvement in gangs.\n\n\u201cThe only reason why the gangs are getting them is because no one else is paying attention to them, and they feel accepted,\u201d Lara said. \u201cIf they feel accepted at home, they will not have to go outside the home to feel accepted.\u201d\n\nThe reigning Miss San Jose Latina, Kassandra Pe\u00f1a, attended the town hall meeting as a way to educate herself and lend her voice to the discussion.\n\n\u201cWith the title that I have, through my blog, I\u2019ve been able to raise awareness of what\u2019s going on on our streets,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that if I\u2019m educated, I\u2019m able to get out in the community more and help people who need to be educated about the negative effects of gangs.\u201d\n\nAs perhaps the youngest member of Lara\u2019s group, she brought to the surface the impact social networks and other forms of media can have on influencing youth violence.\n\n\u201cI think kids who [besides media] aren\u2019t really exposed to the danger, or have just a little sense of idea of what\u2019s going on, they don\u2019t think that the consequence is that serious,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cThey need to really know that this is not a game. Gangs, when you enter, it\u2019s either really hard to get out or you get out because of death.\u201d\n\nMany participants agreed the problem needs to be tackled by a variety of partners, including the government and community organizations, and in the home.\n\n\u201cGet involved with your kids,\u201d Lara said she tells parents. \u201cLove your kids. Let them know that there is a future and their future is for success. They all have a call. They all have a purpose.\u201d\n\nThree more town hall meetings are scheduled in the coming weeks, each featuring a different division of the San Jose Police Department. According to Maciel, participant responses will be compiled into a plan the task force will present to the City Council in the spring.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "East Palo Alto,Esther Mota,gangs,Kassandra Pena,Linda Lara,Mario Maciel,Mayor\u2019s Gang Prevention Task Force,Miss San Jose Latina,Oakland,Overfelt High School,San Jose,San Jose Police Department,Town Hall,Tre\u2019vell Anderson,Crime,Frontpage Featured,Politics & Gov", "description": "Despite a reported drop in gang-related violent crimes, San Jose is hosting town hall meetings to listen to community concerns about gang members selling drugs\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0abc\"", "article_summary": "About 100 people turned out Monday night for the first of four meetings hosted by the Mayor\u2019s Gang Prevention Task Force.\nAt the meeting, participants were divided into small focus groups to help the task force develop its 2014-2016 strategic work plan.\nAccording to Maciel, participant responses will be compiled into a plan the task force will present to the City Council in the spring.\nSeveral of the eastern San Jose residents voiced concern about the use of marijuana, heroin and painkillers by youth, along with graffiti tagging and bullying in and out of schools.\nThey all have a purpose.\u201dThree more town hall meetings are scheduled in the coming weeks, each featuring a different division of the San Jose Police Department."}
