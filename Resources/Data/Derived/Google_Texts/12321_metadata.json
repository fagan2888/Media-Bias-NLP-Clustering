But Feedback, in its seventh year, has won its reputation as one of SXSW\u2019s most reliable good times, whether you\u2019re there for the brisket sliders or whiskey-sauced chicken wings or music from 14 acts who, due to weather-related technical delays, played for more than an hour past the planned 4 p.m. ending time, with a couple -- Blondie and Bob Schneider -- forced to cut their sets a bit short to accommodate the circumstances.\n\nBillboard at SXSW: Full Coverage\n\nFor the first time ever at Feedback, it was a band playing Stubbs' tiny indoor room that generated the biggest buzz. Green Day\u2019s adjunct Foxboro Hot Tubs -- who played the night before in the larger Brazos Hall -- specifically asked to play there, but the quintet didn\u2019t downsize its show at all, from the balloon drop at the start of the show to the confetti and silly string that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong showered the packed room with throughout the 14-song set.\n\nSporting a flowered top hat, Armstrong opened by taunting the crowd that it was \u201cBoring!\u201d before the group tour into \u201cPieces of Truth.\u201d It stuck mainly to Foxboro\u2019s garage-y originals - \u201cSally\u201d is a kissing cousin to the Monkees\u2019 \u201c(I\u2019m Not Your) Stepping Stone\u201d -- though the band also covered the Network\u2019s \u201cSupermodel Robots\u201d and Green Day\u2019s \u201cMakeout Party\u201d and \u201cFuck Time,\" the latter in a long, lusty version that incorporated Ray into the mid-song chants. Foxboro finished with the Who\u2019s mini-opera \u201cA Quick One (While He\u2019s Away),\" the original of which, we should note, was about as long as the \u201cJesus of Suburbia\u201d suite from \u201cAmerican Idiot.\u201d\n\nCee Lo Green, however, was not to be outdone -- he even got a huge cheer when he and his posse arrived, walking across Stubbs\u2019 main stage after sitting for a SXSW discussion at the Austin Convention Center. Fronting a full, mixed-gender band, whose female members sported tight, glittery body suits, and promising to \u201cbe your adult entertainment for the evening,\u201d Green started his buoyant, spirit-lifting set with his own \u201cBright Lights Bigger City\u201d before taking the human jukebox approach at the start of his set, covering MGMT\u2019s \u201c\u201dElectric Feel\u201d David Bowie`s \u201cLet\u2019s Dance.\u201d Throughout he mixed his own material with more covers, including the Violent Femmes\u2019 \u201cGone Daddy Gone\u201d (which he performed as part of Gnarls Barkley on the duo's 2006 debut \"St. Elsewhere\") and Pussycat Dolls\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t Cha\u201d before elevating things even further with Gnarls Barkley\u2019s \u201cCrazy\u201d and \u201cthe song that made me rich and famous,\u201d \u201cForget You.\u201d\n\nDespite the shortened set, Blondie was tight and clearly energized by its first-ever visit to SXSW (though drummer Clem Burke is a regular), powering through a hits-heavy playlist that included \u201cOne Way or Another,\u201d \u201cRapture,\u201d \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d and \u201cCall Me,\u201d as well as a rendition of the Beastie Boys\u2019 (You\u2019ve Got to) Fight For Your Right (To Party).\u201d\n\nBlondie performs at Rachael Ray's annual Feedback party and concert at SXSW.

Schneider -- whose accordion player, Oliver Steck, entertained the crowd during the production delays -- joined Ray\u2019s husband John Cusimano and his band, the Cringe, for a version of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Feeling.\u201d Indoors, meanwhile, the Last Internationale got the day started with a hard-hitting modern rock m\u00e9lange slated for its June debut album, and Bad Suns blended atmosphere and energy in convincing fashion.\n\nAustin Mayor Lee Leffingwell proclaimed Saturday Rachael Ray Day and presented the TV host with a plaque; Ray, however, had lost her voice \u201cscreaming the Beatles with my husband \u2018til midnight\u201d and kept her remarks truncated, though she did introduce Foxboro Hot Tubs\u2019 set.\n\n(Additional reporting by Randy Alexander and John Mogos)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Rain apparently does not dampen the appetite for free food and music -- at least  not when it\u2019s the offerings at Rachael Ray\u2019s annual Feedback party and concert.", "title": "Blondie, Foxboro Hot Tubs, Cee Lo Green Rock Rachael Ray's SXSW Feedback Party", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/sxsw/5937558/blondie-foxboro-hot-tubs-cee-lo-rachael-ray-feedback-party", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/cee-lo-green-feedback-sxsw-650-430.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rain apparently does not dampen the appetite for free food and music -- at least  not when it\u2019s the offerings at Rachael Ray\u2019s annual Feedback party and concert.", "title": "Blondie, Foxboro Hot Tubs, Cee Lo Green Rock Rachael Ray's SXSW Feedback Party", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/sxsw/5937558/blondie-foxboro-hot-tubs-cee-lo-rachael-ray-feedback-party", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/cee-lo-green-feedback-sxsw-650-430.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Rain apparently does not dampen the appetite for free food and music -- at least  not when it\u2019s the offerings at Rachael Ray\u2019s annual Feedback party and concert.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Blondie, Foxboro Hot Tubs, Cee Lo Green Rock Rachael Ray's SXSW Feedback Party | Billboard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9de9\"", "article_summary": "Rain apparently does not dampen the appetite for free food and music -- at least not when it\u2019s the offerings at Rachael Ray\u2019s annual Feedback party and concert.\nCourtesy of Ball Park BrandBlondie performs at Rachael Ray's annual Feedback party and concert at SXSW.\nCourtesy of Kim HaxtonTravis Barker performs at Rachael Ray's annual Feedback party and concert at SXSW.\nBillboard at SXSW: Full CoverageFor the first time ever at Feedback, it was a band playing Stubbs' tiny indoor room that generated the biggest buzz.\nThe line snaked literally the entire block around Stubbs before the gates opened Saturday morning, as Feedbackers braved off-and-on rain that was heavy at times into the late afternoon."}
