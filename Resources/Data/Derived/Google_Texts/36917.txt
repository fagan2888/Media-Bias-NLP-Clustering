Archbishop Cupich: Pay No Attention To That Man Behind The Curtain!

Archbishop Cupich: Pay No Attention To That Man Behind The Curtain!

For his first homily as Archbishop of Chicago fortunate son Blase Cupich delivered a lengthy and entirely compelling message. It was not the sort of thing that would spread the Catholic faith or stir souls to conversion, but it was certainly an example of leadership. It was not directly polarizing. Many may have found it inspiring.

It’s a bit of a shock then to hear reports that the homily was written by the catty dissident king of the National Catholic Reporter, Michael Sean Winters. It’s no wonder. Winters has always been vigorous, skillful, and effective on behalf of the cause.

Washington D.C. and Chicago sources are reporting that the homily of newly appointed Bishop Blase Cupich, scheduled to be delivered at his installation mass in Chicago on Tuesday, has been written by Leftist National Catholic Reporter writer Michael Sean Winters. Reports claim that the homily begins with a 5-minute condemnation of Philadelphia’s Archbishop Charles Chaput without mentioning him by name.

Sources also claim that Winters is positioning himself to become the shadow writer for the new Archbishop in Chicago. The left-wing Winters has been a prominent defender of the Obama administration, including the Obamacare healthcare law. Winters’ vocal opposition to Abp. Chaput also is well known. A long time critic of the U.S. Bishops, including their opposition to the HHS Mandate, Winters has chastised Abp. Chaput and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as ‘culture warriors.’

What does this say about Pope Francis's hand-picked bishop?
