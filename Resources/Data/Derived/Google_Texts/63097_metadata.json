In ads, McConnell and his allies have repeatedly portrayed Grimes as a proxy for Obama, who is unpopular in Kentucky.\n\nGrimes, meanwhile, says after nearly three decades of McConnell in the Senate, it is time for a change. In ads and speeches, she has tagged McConnell as out of touch with Kentucky values and a key contributor to Washington gridlock.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the two candidates have launched a fierce battle on issues ranging from the Affordable Care Act and Medicare to jobs and coal. Too often, though, facts have taken a backseat to the political narratives.\n\n\n\nClaim: McConnell voted \u201ctwo times against the Violence Against Women Act.\u201d\n\nFacts: He did. But McConnell has never opposed the central purpose of the Violence Against Women Act. In fact, he was a co-sponsor of the original bill in 1991, and he has twice supported its reauthorization.\n\nIn a campaign ad, Grimes highlighted two of McConnell\u2019s votes against Democratic measures. McConnell voted against a Democratic-sponsored massive crime bill that included the Violence Against Women Act, because, he said, it also contained a ban on assault weapons.\n\nMore recently, McConnell voted against reauthorization of the law in 2012 and 2013, because he opposed Democratic expansions of the bill that included provisions for same-sex couples and immigrants. In both cases, McConnell supported Republican alternatives to those bills that he believed would have strengthened the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nFull story: \u201cPlaying Politics with Violence Against Women,\u201d July 31\n\n\n\nClaim: Grimes was \u201csilent as Obama attacked coal.\u201d\n\nFacts: Grimes has been critical throughout her campaign of Obama administration regulations on the coal industry. In fact, in the very newspaper article cited in the TV ad\u2019s small print, Grimes is quoted as saying, \u201cI will not stand idle as overreaching regulation adversely impacts jobs and middle-class families.\u201d\n\nDuring her first campaign rally in Lexington on July 30, 2013, Grimes said: \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you I don\u2019t always agree with the president. I think he is wrong on coal.\u201d In September 2013, when the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new greenhouse gas rules for future power plants, Grimes said the rule left her \u201cdeeply disappointed.\u201d\n\nAnd in June, when Obama proposed new regulations on existing coal plants, Grimes ran a radio ad saying the regulations \u201care impossible to achieve\u201d and will cost more coal jobs. That was the same month that the pro-McConnell group Kentucky Opportunity Coalition aired this TV ad accusing Grimes of being \u201csilent\u201d on Obama\u2019s \u201cnew attack on coal.\u201d\n\nFull Story: \u201cCorrecting Kentucky Claim on Coal,\u201d June 9\n\n\n\nClaim: McConnell saved 99 percent of Kentuckians from \u201cObama\u2019s tax increases.\u201d\n\nFacts: The actual figure is closer to 1 percent to 2 percent.\n\nThis claim, made in a McConnell TV ad, is based on the compromise he helped craft to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. As part of the deal, Bush-era tax cuts that were set to expire were permanently extended for individuals making less than $400,000 and couples making less than $450,000. But the McConnell ad suggests Obama wanted the income tax rate to rise for everyone, when in fact the president only called for allowing the higher tax rates to kick in for individuals making more than $200,000 or couples making more than $250,000.\n\nMcConnell and other Republicans can credibly claim to have increased the threshold from $200,000/$250,000 to $400,000/$450,000. But that\u2019s all. That translates to saving 1 percent to 2 percent of Americans from \u201cObama\u2019s tax increases.\u201d\n\nFull story: \u201cMcConnell\u2019s Bloated Tax Boast,\u201d April 23\n\n\n\nClaim: McConnell voted to raise Medicare costs by $6,000.\n\nFacts: McConnell did no such thing. Nor did any other Republican.\n\nThe Grimes ad cites McConnell\u2019s 2011 procedural vote to advance a nonbinding budget resolution that had been drafted by Rep. Paul Ryan. That budget blueprint advocated phasing out traditional, government-administered Medicare and replacing it gradually with a \u201cpremium-support\u201d system of government-subsidized private insurance. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis of that plan indicated that a 65-year-old enrolled in the \u201cpremium-support\u201d plans in 2020 would pay $6,000 more than under traditional Medicare.\n\nBut anyone already on Medicare \u2014 including the elderly man in Grimes\u2019 ad \u2014 would not have been affected. Ryan\u2019s premium-support plan pertained to those who were younger than 55. Additionally, the CBO has effectively retracted its $6,000 estimate, saying its 2011 report was a \u201crough analysis\u201d based on assumptions that have turned out to be incorrect.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s 2011 vote was on a motion to proceed to consider the Ryan budget. The motion failed on a mostly party-line vote, so there was no Senate vote on the Ryan budget itself.\n\nFull Story: \u201cMedicare Ghost Stories,\u201d July 9\n\n\n\nClaim: Obamacare \u2014 which Grimes supports \u2014 \u201ccuts $700 billion from seniors\u2019 Medicare.\u201d\n\nFacts: The Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t slash $700 billion from the current Medicare budget; instead, this is a cut in the future growth of spending over a decade.\n\nFurthermore, the reductions apply to payments made to hospitals and other non-physician providers, and it remains to be seen whether those would translate into reduced services. Finally \u2014 and most ironic \u2014 that same $700 billion in \u201ccuts\u201d is part of the Ryan budget plan that McConnell voted to consider.\n\nFull story: \u201cMedicare Ghost Stories,\u201d July 9\n\n\n\nClaim: McConnell said it\u2019s not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky.\n\nFacts: McConnell doesn\u2019t dispute saying it and no recording exists, but he claims that he misunderstood a reporter\u2019s question and that his words have been misinterpreted. There is some evidence to support McConnell\u2019s defense.\n\nA laid off coal miner in a Grimes TV ad poses a question to McConnell: \u201cWhy\u2019d you say it\u2019s not your job to bring jobs to Kentucky?\u201d McConnell was quoted as saying, \u201cEconomic development is a Frankfort issue. That is not my job.\u201d But the comment came on the same day that he was in his home state to speak about jobs. So, the theme of McConnell\u2019s speeches that day \u2014 four of them in all \u2014 was about the very issue (jobs) and the very industry (coal) that concerns the man featured in the Grimes ad. The speech McConnell delivered made clear that McConnell considers the protection of coal jobs, and fighting Obama\u2019s regulations of coal mining, a key responsibility of his job.\n\nMoreover, there have been numerous instances that show the senator considers creating jobs part of his job. He has supported approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline, passage of trade legislation, and funding for job training and workforce development programs.\n\nFull story: \u201cParsing McConnell\u2019s Job Description,\u201d July 25\n\n\n\nClaim: McConnell voted to \u201craise his own pay four times.\u201d\n\nFacts: This claim simply ignores numerous votes McConnell has cast over his long career to prevent pay increases for members of Congress.\n\nThe ad \u2014 by the Senate Majority PAC and Patriot Majority USA \u2014 cites McConnell\u2019s vote against a 2009 appropriations bill with a provision eliminating the pay raise scheduled to take effect in 2010. And the ad cites votes he cast in 2001, 2002 and 2003 to block amendments to bills that would have prevented pay raises in fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004.\n\nThat\u2019s all true, but the ad disregards votes McConnell cast before and since that have or would have denied annual pay increases. Most recently, he supported measures that successfully blocked pay increases in 2011, 2012 and 2013. He also voted in 2007 to block a pay raise and, going back even further, McConnell, in 1995, voted for a budget resolution with a provision (later dropped) that would have frozen member pay for seven years.\n\nFull story: \u201cCherry-Picking McConnell\u2019s Pay Raise Votes,\u201d June 21, 2013\n\n\u2013 The Staff of FactCheck.org", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8ad\"", "article_summary": "Claim: McConnell voted \u201ctwo times against the Violence Against Women Act.\u201dFacts: He did.\nFull story: \u201cCherry-Picking McConnell\u2019s Pay Raise Votes,\u201d June 21, 2013\u2013 The Staff of FactCheck.org\nIn what has shaped up as the most expensive Senate race in the country, Kentucky voters have a stark choice between Republican incumbent Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.\nMcConnell voted against a Democratic-sponsored massive crime bill that included the Violence Against Women Act, because, he said, it also contained a ban on assault weapons.\nFinally \u2014 and most ironic \u2014 that same $700 billion in \u201ccuts\u201d is part of the Ryan budget plan that McConnell voted to consider."}
