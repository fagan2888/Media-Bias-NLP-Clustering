The 60-second spot features a woman talking about a man she met online in 2008 with a seemingly perfect profile: \u201csmart, handsome, charming articulate.\u201d But since, their relationship has soured.\n\nAFSP bashes Obama for recent NSA spying scandals and the president\u2019s foreign policy as if they were personal transgressions. \u201cHe\u2019s in my emails and text messages, spying on me but ignoring real threats,\u201d the woman says. The ad goes on to critique Obamacare: \u201cHe thinks the only thing I care about is free birth control, but he won\u2019t even let me keep my doctor.\u201d\n\nSome have slammed the spot for seemingly comparing Obama to an abusive partner. The woman says her relationship with \u201cBarack\u201d was on the rocks in 2008 but she \u201cstuck with him because he promised he\u2019d be better. He\u2019s great at promises.\u201d Critics say the ad\u2019s language echoes too closely that of the recent #WhyIStayed movement in which domestic abuse victims explained why they remained with their abuser. Many listed false promises of change among the reasons for staying.\n\nOthers have lambasted the ad for being condescending to women by assuming they can only understand politics through the language of dating:\n\nThe ad is airing in North Carolina, where Democratic Senator Kay Hagan will has a tough reelection battle ahead of him. Head of the outside group, Californian multimillionaire John Jordan, told Politico that he was disturbed when the democrats cast Republican policy as a \u201cwar on women\u201d in the 2012 cycle and that this ad and another one yet-to-air will push back against that notion. He says this ad was designed \u201cto communicate with women voters in a way that outside groups and campaigns haven\u2019t.\u201d He added, \u201cThe purpose of this is to treat women voters more like adults.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics are saying the Republican group is capitalizing on NFL news by comparing Obama to an abusive boyfriend", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Critics are saying the Republican group is capitalizing on NFL news by comparing Obama to an abusive boyfriend", "title": "Anti-Obama Ad Compares President to a Bad Online Date", "url": "http://time.com/3421894/obama-ad-war-on-women/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-23-at-10-41-51-am.png?w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-23-at-10-41-51-am.png?w=1012"}, "description": "Critics are saying the Republican group is capitalizing on NFL news by comparing Obama to an abusive boyfriend", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Anti-Obama Ad Compares President to a Bad Online Date"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "president barack obama, americans for shared prosperity, afsp, dating profile ad, republican dating profile ad, domestic abuse, obama abuser ad, twitter, birth control, nsa", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "President Barack Obama, Americans for Shared Prosperity, AFSP, Dating profile ad, Republican dating profile ad, domestic abuse, Obama abuser ad, Twitter, birth control, NSA"}, "article_summary": "+ READ ARTICLEAn outside Republican group, Americans for Shared Prosperity, is running a new ad that compares President Obama to a bad boyfriend.\nHe says this ad was designed \u201cto communicate with women voters in a way that outside groups and campaigns haven\u2019t.\u201d He added, \u201cThe purpose of this is to treat women voters more like adults.\u201d\nAFSP bashes Obama for recent NSA spying scandals and the president\u2019s foreign policy as if they were personal transgressions.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in my emails and text messages, spying on me but ignoring real threats,\u201d the woman says.\nThe woman says her relationship with \u201cBarack\u201d was on the rocks in 2008 but she \u201cstuck with him because he promised he\u2019d be better."}
