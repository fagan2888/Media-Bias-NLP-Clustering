One estimate puts the number of prostitutes in Brazil at one million in a country of nearly 203 million.\n\n\n\nThere are said to be around 2,000 prostitutes working in Belo Horizonte (one of the World Cup's 12 host cities) alone. Belo Horizonte gained notoriety in 2013 when Cida Vieira, chairwoman of Aprosmig, a local prostitutes' union, said that the city's prostitutes would accept credit card payments to make transactions more convenient for World Cup attendees. The city gained still more publicity when Laura Maria Do Espirito Santo, a founding member of Aprosmig, came up with the idea of arranging English lessons for prostitutes so they could better cater to English-speaking soccer fans attending the competition. \"The language gets you ahead,\" remarked Santo. \"We are learning the basics. They say there'll be 200,000 tourists in Belo Horizonte so it makes a lot of sense.\"\n\n\n\nBrazil has also been the subject of unfavorable publicity surrounding its reputation for attracting \"sex tourists\" seeking underage prostitutes. In another of the tournament's host cities, Recife, one in four prostitutes is reputed to be a child, according to the BBC. Unicef estimates that there are 250,000 children selling sex in Brazil, while the National Forum for the Prevention of Child Labor puts the number at half a million. Though child prostitution and sex trafficking are crimes, Brazil's age of consent is 14, and in 2012 a Brazilian court \"decided that sex with a 12-year-old did not necessarily constitute statutory rape, in part because the girls in question had worked as prostitutes,\" according to TIME magazine. Some of the children, aged as young as 10, sell sexual services for as little as two dollars or a pack of cigarettes. State prosecutor Antonia Lima Sousa told CNN that \"These girls come from extreme poverty, a culture of social exclusion and a tradition of profound disrespect for women.\"\n\n\n\nThough the Brazilian government has made recent attempts to crack down on child prostitution and sex trafficking, it came under fire for a 2013 campaign to destigmatize sex workers using the slogan \"I\u2019m happy being a prostitute.\" Criticism was also leveled at Brazilian police ordered to curtail Brazil's sex industry in advance of the World Cup. Some were accused of robbing, beating, and raping sex workers while raiding illegal brothels.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n\nJeremy Armstrong and Andy Lines, \"Brazilian Women Turning to Prostitution for World Cup - and England Fans Are Their Biggest Goal,\" mirror.co.uk, June 11, 2014\n\n\n\nBBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), \"Brazil Child Prostitution Alert as World Cup Nears,\" bbc.com, May 31, 2014\n\n\n\nGreg Bishop, \"Viagem Brazil: Prostitution, Revelry and World Cup Soccer Own the Night,\" si.com, June 16, 2014\n\n\n\nShasta Darlington, \"Brazil Tackling Child Prostitution for World Cup,\" cnn.com, Apr. 2, 2014\n\n\n\nFred Dews, \"10 Things to Know about Brazil as You Watch the World Cup,\" brookings.edu, June 12, 2014\n\n\n\nEleanor Goldberg, \"During the World Cup, Child Prostitutes Sell Sex for a Pack of Cigarettes or a Couple of Bucks,\" huffingtonpost.com, June 13, 2014\n\n\n\nGirish Gupta and Olivia Crellin, \"Brazil\u2019s World Cup Raises Fear of Rampant Child Prostitution,\" time.com, Dec. 12, 2013\n\n\n\nEwan MacKenna, \"Brazil's Sex Trade: How the Country's One Million Prostitutes Are Preparing for the World Cup,\" independent.co.uk, June 1, 2014\n\n\n\nJulie Ruvolo, \"Brazil's Ugly Pre-World Cup Sex-Worker Crackdown,\" citylab.com, June 2, 2014\n\n\n\nAnjani Trivedi, \"Brazil\u2019s 'Happy Prostitute' Slogan Gets a Chilly Reception,\" time.com, June 6, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "legal prostitution, world cup prostitution, brazil prostitution, world cup, prostitute, brazil world cup", "description": "Article about legal prostitution around World Cup in Brazil", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sources:Jeremy Armstrong and Andy Lines, \"Brazilian Women Turning to Prostitution for World Cup - and England Fans Are Their Biggest Goal,\" mirror.co.uk, June 11, 2014BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), \"Brazil Child Prostitution Alert as World Cup Nears,\" bbc.com, May 31, 2014Greg Bishop, \"Viagem Brazil: Prostitution, Revelry and World Cup Soccer Own the Night,\" si.com, June 16, 2014Shasta Darlington, \"Brazil Tackling Child Prostitution for World Cup,\" cnn.com, Apr.\nCriticism was also leveled at Brazilian police ordered to curtail Brazil's sex industry in advance of the World Cup.\nSource: Julie Ruvolo, \"Brazil's Ugly Pre-World Cup Sex-Worker Crackdown,\" citylab.com, June 2, 2014 Prostitution is legal in Brazil, home to the 2014 World Cup tournament, and host to an estimated 600,000 foreign soccer fans visiting the country for the month-long competition.\nBelo Horizonte gained notoriety in 2013 when Cida Vieira, chairwoman of Aprosmig, a local prostitutes' union, said that the city's prostitutes would accept credit card payments to make transactions more convenient for World Cup attendees.\nOne estimate puts the number of prostitutes in Brazil at one million in a country of nearly 203 million."}
