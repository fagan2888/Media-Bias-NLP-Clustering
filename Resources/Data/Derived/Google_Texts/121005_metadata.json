If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll have a few new fishing toys to try out. You know, the ones that have been sitting next to the Christmas tree that has to be taken down and put back into the attic.\n\nJust as soon as the tree is out of our living room I\u2019m headed fishing. Mid December brought us some very nice weather and the water temperatures have remained very mild. To have good fishing in January we need to have mild water temperatures.\n\nWhen water temps dip into mid 60s, slowing down your presentation with both artificial and natural baits is one of the most important factors. Both January and February are excellent months to use live shrimp for bait. Hooked shrimp are slow movers and that is exactly what fish are looking for this time of year. Seems fish tend to get lazy when the water temperature drops. It has to do with their metabolism, which slows and makes them not want to work too hard for their food.\n\nBoth spotted sea trout and silver trout have been very active this past month. Look for sea trout in the deeper grass flats and some of the deeper spots of the Manatee and Little Manatee Rivers. I\u2019ve found large numbers of silver trout in the ship channel from Apollo Beach south to Port Manatee. Shrimp or live pilchards work well for either species, but don\u2019t pass up your favorite artificial soft plastic tails on a light jig head.\n\nRedfish have been all over South Shore waters. Anglers fishing the Little Manatee River and Cockroach Bay have produced some impressive catch reports. Most redfish have been caught near the many oyster bars that fill the backcountry of Tampa Bay or in the deeper areas within the Little Manatee River. Try using a large shrimp under a bobber. One of my favorite\u2019s artificial baits for redfish is a gold, \u00bc ounce spoon. You can also work the spoon at different speeds. As I said earlier, slowing down your retrieve will improve your odds.\n\nJanuary and February are also the months that the sheepshead make a big showing. Find structure in deeper water and most likely you\u2019ll find a good number of sheepshead hanging around. Shrimp combined with a little weight and a No. 2 or No. 4 hook will do the trick. Sheephead have a very light bite so be ready for their nibbles.\n\nDecember\u2019s fishing was very good and I\u2019m optimistic that January\u2019s bite will be even better. But you know what, it really doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve got a new Ohero rod and reel that I can\u2019t wait to try out. So no matter what, I\u2019m going fishing.\n\nBe safe out there.\n\nDanny Guarino is one of three Ruskin-based fishing guides and charter captains who share this column.
