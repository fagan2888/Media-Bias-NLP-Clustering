A number of hackers who have been pre-approved by the service can enter into a bidding competition to receive the assignment.\n\nDifferent fees for different needs\n\nFrom the list of projects available on the website, breaking into online accounts (email, social media) seems to be the most frequent type of job posted.\n\nHowever, it appears that removing content already indexed by search engines is highly remunerated, with someone willing to pay as much as $4,000 / \u20ac3,400 for eliminating information from Google, Bing and other search engines.\n\nThe legitimacy of the business is controversial since some of the users may simply want to regain control of an email address they own but forgot the access password for it.\n\nOn the other hand, others want access to the account of a particular individual for spying purposes.\n\nScammers are banned from the website\n\nThe service, which takes its profit from a commission paid for each project, provides complete privacy (data from billing to details of the task are encrypted using AES 256) and guarantees against fraud.\n\n\u201cOur strict review process ensures that we keep scammers and frauds away. We review every hacker for hire or professional hacker for hire service provider to ensure the highest quality,\u201d reads the description of the service.\n\nIn case a professional receives too many complaints, they are banned from the website, without the possibility to rejoin. The details of the reviewing process or how the hackers are identified by the service are unclear, though.\n\nAt the moment, the number of registered users seems to be over 3,600, while hackers offering their skills for hire are almost 730. According to a tweet from the service, there are currently more than 700 projects listed. We\u2019ve noticed that some of the announcements date back to December 2014.\n\n3613 registered users, 727 registered hackers and over 700 projects listed.
