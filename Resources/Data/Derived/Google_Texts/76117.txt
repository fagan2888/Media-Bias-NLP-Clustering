CLARKSVILLE, TENN. â€” A 20-year-old Virginia man has been charged with injuring a man Friday evening after he intentionally drove a stolen vehicle into a fence, police said.

Darius Jordan Jefferson, who gave a Hopewell, Va., address but was listed as homeless on warrants, was charged with aggravated assault, leaving the scene of a wreck involving injuries, evading arrest, theft of property, criminal impersonation and not having a driver license. Bond was set at $46,000.

According to warrants, a car crashed through a fence just after 8:30 p.m. on Friday outside Salvation Army on Kraft street. The fence surrounded a smoking area and several people were outside at the time, including a man at a picnic table who was injured.

The driver got out of the car and ran away, but police apprehended him a short time later and returned him to Salvation Army where he was positively identified, because he had previously stayed there, warrants said.

Warrants said the 1996 Honda Accord involved in the crash had been reported stolen in Nashville, and arresting officers indicated that Jefferson gave them multiple names and dates of birth when he was taken into custody.

The man who was injured in the crash was taken to Gateway Medical Center were he was treated for an injury to his back and was released.
