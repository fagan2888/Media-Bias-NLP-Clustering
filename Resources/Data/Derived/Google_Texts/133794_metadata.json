Tuesday night, after attending the gubernatorial inauguration activities in Harrisburg, to join the conference. He is among six mayors from Pennsylvania to attend. The other mayors are from Allentown, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Reading, and Wilkes-Barre.\n\nPapenfuse has been steadily sending public messages on his Twitter account about the various panels he's attended, which have covered public transportation, summer jobs programs and vacant and abandoned properties.\n\nHe noted that Cleveland uses a vacant property registry, something he's trying to get started in Harrisburg. He then directed a Tweet at Council Member Shamaine Daniels, chair of the building and housing committee.\n\n\"Could we please have a committee hearing on our bill @ShamaineDaniels ?\" he wrote in a Tweet.\n\n\"Sure,\" Daniels replied in a Tweet. \"Please inform your staff blight is an issue you care about. Also, twitter is not the best way to reach me.\"\n\nThe Twitter war continued with Papenfuse chiding Daniels to get the bill moving in her committee.\n\n\"I am informing you,\" Papenfuse wrote. \"Bill has been stuck in your com w/o a hearing for wks, revenues are needed - City can't afford to wait.\"\n\nDaniels replied, \"Again get your staff to work on blight...also...twitter...not best way to reach me. Enjoy your day.\"\n\nPapenfuse also called out others in his Twitter updates, including the Harrisburg School District and its Chief Recovery Officer Gene Veno, during a panel by the U.S. Secretary of Education.\n\n\"We must put politics aside - realize that this is about civil rights says @ArneDuncan,\" said Papenfuse. \"Listening?\"\n\nPapenfuse also sent a Tweet directed at Council Member Brad Koplinski after the Tacoma mayor touted a tax abatement plan with a 15-percent resident/job apprenticeship requirement.\n\n\"Are you ready yet?\" Papenfuse asked Koplinski, who recently voted down Papenfuse's latest attempt at a tax abatement plan in Harrisburg.\n\nThose tweets did not elicit responses.\n\nThe latest panel Papenfuse attended Friday before noon concerned Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative, a challenge issued to cities to develop strategies to help improve the lives of youths. The program was developed to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color.\n\nMore than 150 cities accepted the challenge, including Harrisburg.\n\n\"Hbg proud to be one,\" Papenfuse said in a Tweet.\n\nAt 12:52 p.m., Papenfuse sent a Tweet with a photo showing a stream of mayors working their way through a security checkpoint to enter the White House.\n\nUPDATE: This article was updated to add Tweets from Mayor Papenfuse to others beyond Shamaine Daniels.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "harrisburg,mayors,white house", "title": "Harrisburg Mayor Eric Papenfuse among a group of mayors invited to the White House", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Harrisburg Mayor Eric Papenfuse among a group of mayors invited to the White House\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/01/harrisburg_mayor_national_conf.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/mayors-conferencepng-642b0a8b65bba040.png\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15032560\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-23T18:02:46Z\", \"author\": \"Christine Vendel | cvendel@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstories\",\"harrisburg\",\"mayors\",\"white house\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/16840819-thumb_square_large.png", "creator": "@ChristineVendel", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Harrisburg Mayor Eric Papenfuse drove to Washington D.C.
