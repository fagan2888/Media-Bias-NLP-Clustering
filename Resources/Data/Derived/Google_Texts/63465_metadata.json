But you won\u2019t hear unhinged Harry Reid railing Queegishly about him on the Senate floor. Why?\n\nHere\u2019s why: LaMarche is a militant leftist philanthropist. He\u2019s a protected elite \u2014 Columbia University grad, former ACLU leader and Human Rights Watch official \u2014 with ready access to the White House. He and the Left\u2019s other dark-money managers preach transparency and openness while plotting behind closed doors to secure power at every level of government.\n\nLaMarche currently heads the shadowy Democracy Alliance (DA). In internal documents obtained and published this month by John Hinderaker of the Power Line blog, the group currently describes itself as the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d for the progressive funding world. DA enrolls wealthy liberal \u201cmembers\u201d who coordinate and finance a web of at least 132 left-wing groups. Though some of their members\u2019 and partners\u2019 identities have been exposed, DA takes great care to promise a cloak of donor secrecy \u201cto provide a comfortable environment for our partners to collectively make a real impact.\u201d\n\nWhile they bash Wall Street publicly, DA leaders have quietly recruited venture capitalists, bankers, and hedge-fund moguls \u2014 along with union bosses and red-diaper trust-fund babies \u2014 to fund their takeover goals. Public-school educators who belong to the American Federation of Teachers, headed by $500,000-plus yearly salaried President Randi Weingarten, should know that $230,000 of their hard-earned union dues go to DA, as Lachlan Markay of the Washington Free Beacon has reported.\n\nWhile they bemoan \u201cincome inequality,\u201d the DA brass has wined, dined, and wooed 1-percenter plutocrats with swanky get-togethers featuring New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, Kentucky secretary of state and Democratic Senate candidate Alison Grimes, and popular \u201ccomediennes\u201d Stephanie Miller and Lizz Winstead.\n\n\u201cOver the past nine years,\u201d the organization brags to potential contributors, DA has \u201caligned leaders in the progressive movement and political infrastructure\u201d to \u201cachieve victories at the ballot box and in policy fights.\u201d Their agenda spans \u201csocial justice,\u201d \u201cclimate change,\u201d \u201cvoting rights,\u201d gun control, illegal-alien amnesty, campaign finance, and sustained \u201cstrategic investment\u201d to turn red states blue. That\u2019s exactly what DA members Jared Polis and Tim Gill succeeded in doing in once-GOP-dominated Colorado in 2008.\n\nLaMarche previously served as president and CEO of The Atlantic Philanthropies. As I first reported five years ago, that entity was a Bermuda-based political front stocked with acolytes of progressive billionaire George Soros. The \u201ccharity\u201d run by LaMarche dumped some $40 million to help fund the astroturf Health Care for America Now group. As the tax disclaimer for HCAN discloses, \u201cHCAN is related to Health Care for America Education Fund, a project of The Tides Center, a section 501(c)(3) public charity.\u201d The Tides Center and its parent organization, the Tides Foundation, in turn have seeded some of the country\u2019s most radical activist groups of the Left, including the Communist-friendly United for Peace and Justice, the jihadist-friendly National Lawyers Guild, and the grievance-mongering Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nThe faux-populist HCAN, coordinated from 1825 K Street, provided invaluable ground and air support to reinforce Democratic messaging on Obamacare. LaMarche met with Valerie Jarrett for hours-long meetings on at least two disclosed occasions before the health-care juggernaut\u2019s passage. By November 2009, he had visited the White House nine times.\n\nI checked the most updated White House visitor logs (as incomplete and shoddy as they are). LaMarche has tripled his visits over the past five years. He is listed 23 times (21 under \u201cPhilip G. LaMarche\u201d or \u201cPhilip LaMarche\u201d and twice under \u201cGara LaMarche\u201d). LaMarche also donated $18 million through The Atlantic Philanthropies to a Chicago charity headed by Jarrett.\n\nFriend of Barack and Val. Bagman for Soros. Community organizer for progressive billionaires. Chances are, LaMarche and his operators have affected you, your statehouses, your businesses, and your freedom, no matter where you live.
