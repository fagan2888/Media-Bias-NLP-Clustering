It has spent about $3 million so far for Phase I and Phase II work installing infrastructure inside the 518-acre park. The county committed to $10 million in improvements to the industrial park, including water, sewer, storm systems and roadways.\n\nWith more than $6 million already committed, the county has slightly less than $4 million to establish sewer service for the park in North Hall.\n\nThe county agreed to provide sewer service to the industrial park within 36 months of its first tenant, the Georgia Poultry Lab, closing on its property there.\n\n\u201cWe have yet to bid out the gravity sewer and pump stations,\u201d said Ken Rearden, county Public Works director. \u201cWe believe that we will have adequate funding with the $10 million.\u201d\n\nThe state lab closed on its 10-acre property there in October 2012. The funding from the county is coming from the current special purpose local option sales tax revenue collection.\n\nTim Evans, vice president of economic development for the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce, said the industrial park is seeing some interest.\n\nEvans said his staff has been working on marketing the site for more than a year. The chamber hosted a bus tour last week of the site with 25 project managers, he said. He wants some signage put out near White Sulphur Road and the Georgia Poultry Lab site now that there\u2019s some roadway work completed.\n\n\u201cThat would go ahead and get us some visibility,\u201d Evans said.\n\nAbout 40 percent of the industrial park does front on Norfolk Southern railroad tracks, Evans said. Rail sites with utilities draw companies, he said.\n\n\u201cWe think that that\u2019s a very attractive part of the site that\u2019s at the northern end of the site,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThose are very rare things to find.\u201d\n\nNow is the time frame where projects start to consider sites with all utilities because typical projects take about nine to 12 months to build.\n\n\u201cWe have been active with some inquiries, as you know,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThat\u2019s encouraging. There\u2019s some projects that have enough lead time that we can go ahead and show this property before the sewer delivery in early 2015.\u201d\n\nHall County estimates sewer capability for the Gateway park will be available in early 2015.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot out there that people don\u2019t know and I can\u2019t say,\u201d board Chairman Richard Mecum said. \u201cI\u2019m in a hurry to get it done.\u201d\n\nThe Gainesville-Hall Development Authority is developing the land, which the county is managing. The authority recently reimbursed the cost of the land to the county in the amount of $690,000, which was reimbursed by the Georgia State Properties Commission.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/88500/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2013/09/09/0910county.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hall County has spent much of what it has currently pledged for the Gateway Industrial Centre, according to a presentation at the board of commissioners\u2019 Monday work session.", "title": "Gateway Industrial Centre making costly progress"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Gateway Industrial Centre making costly progress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb13\"", "article_summary": "The county committed to $10 million in improvements to the industrial park, including water, sewer, storm systems and roadways.\n\u201cWe think that that\u2019s a very attractive part of the site that\u2019s at the northern end of the site,\u201d Evans said.\nTim Evans, vice president of economic development for the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce, said the industrial park is seeing some interest.\nAbout 40 percent of the industrial park does front on Norfolk Southern railroad tracks, Evans said.\nHall County has spent much of what it has currently pledged for the Gateway Industrial Centre, according to a presentation at the board of commissioners\u2019 Monday work session."}
