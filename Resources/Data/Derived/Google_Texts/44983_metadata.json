( Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera )\n\nCome October, the first apartments are expected to open at Apex 5510, a 231-unit multifamily development in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood.\n\nThose first units are at least a few months behind schedule \u2014 earlier this year, developers targeted an Independence Day delivery for the project that sits to the north of the intersection of Spine and Lookout roads.\n\nConstruction timelines typically are quite fluid as projects are at the mercy of weather, inspections and permitting \u2014 not to mention the availability of labor and materials.\n\nIn Apex 5510's case, the 12-building project that formerly bore Trammell Crow Residential's \"Alexan\" name has seen changes in its branding and ownership structure in the two years since it gained city approval.\n\nA less visible issue, however, appears to have played a significant role in Apex 5510's development and timing.\n\nA dispute between the project's contractor and two of its subcontractors has escalated to Boulder District Court, where the two sides have traded allegations ranging from unjust enrichment to shoddy workmanship.\n\nWork is moving forward on the site under the direction of Chesterfield, Missouri-based R.G. Brinkmann Co.'s Brinkmann Contractors.\n\nOfficials for Brinkmann say crews now are shelling out more money to fix mistakes that were made by others, while former subcontractors Marco Sanchez and Mike Becker say they are facing financial ruin.\n\n\"It's driving me into a hole,\" said Sanchez, owner of Franktown-based Marco All Season Construction LLC, which filed a nearly $480,000 mechanic's lien against Brinkmann in July for unpaid labor and materials.\n\n\"I stood up because this is wrong. What they did to us is wrong.\"\n\nIn a prepared statement, though, Brinkmann placed the blame squarely on Sanchez: \"Unfortunately, the work performed by Marco for Becker was rejected by Brinkmann because it was defective.\"\n\nT he Apex 5510 apartment project in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood has seen delays over a dispute between the development's main contractor and two subcontractors. (Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera)\n\n'Cart before the horse'\n\nSanchez's legal complaint came nearly five months after his crew started working on Apex 5510.\n\nMarco All Season Construction was hired around Valentine's Day by Becker General Contractors Inc., a Lakewood-based subcontractor that had worked at the Brinkmann site since the fall. Sanchez and Becker had worked together in the past on a couple commercial developments.\n\nAfter their months of working on and walking off the Apex 5510 site, Becker and Sanchez claim the development was riddled with issues that negatively affected their efforts to frame the apartments.\n\n\"Things were unorganized, uncoordinated, incomplete,\" Becker said. \"We were out there prematurely.\"\n\nWork such as grading and slab installations was unfinished, contributing to an unstable and muddy surface in which machinery sunk to their wheel bases, Becker alleged, adding that other elements including masonry also were behind schedule.\n\nBecker and Sanchez claim the site became increasingly chaotic in the following months. Certain trades fell apart, a new project manager took the helm and last-minute design changes forced some backtracking in construction, the two alleged.\n\n\"I don't think that anyone would disagree with what was going on out there was the cart before the horse,\" Becker said.\n\nSanchez said he decided to fire off the lien and legal complaint after delays of paychecks turned from weeks into months.\n\n\"They kept making promises that they would pay us,\" Sanchez said.\n\nAs Marco All Season Construction's work and labor tally started to climb to the six-digit level, Sanchez said he started pawning cars and tools and borrowed money to pay his crew, he said.\n\nBecker and Sanchez allege that Brinkmann used funds allocated for the framing work to complete other aspects of the project.\n\n'Significant' repairs needed\n\nIn a counterclaim and third-party complaint filed Aug. 4, attorneys for Brinkmann denied the claims made by Marco All Season Construction on the basis that Sanchez and crew were hired by subcontractor Becker.\n\nWork wraps up for the day on Thursday at the Apex 5510 apartment project in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood, which has seen delays over a dispute between the development's main contractor and two subcontractors. (Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera)\n\nThe complaint continued to allege the work performed by Becker and Sanchez contained \"significant defects and deficiencies,\" including the improper installation of Tyvek building wrap, windows, doors and siding.\n\nBrinkmann claimed some framing aspects were out of plumb and that the installations did not match approved plans and thus violated building codes.\n\n\"Brinkmann has performed and continues to perform significant work to repair and replace Becker's and Marco's defective and deficient work in an effort to minimize its damages and losses as well as to keep the project moving towards completion and final delivery to the owner,\" attorneys for Brinkmann wrote in the filing.\n\nThe total damages sought were unspecified.\n\nWilliam H. Eikenberry, an attorney for Denver-based Darling Milligan Smith & Lesch, P.C., who is representing Sanchez and Becker, said he plans to file an answer to Brinkmann's counterclaims.\n\nDuring an inspection of the site late last month, Eikenberry said he saw that the alleged problematic work cited by Brinkmann had been corrected. He also claimed that Sanchez's crew continues to work on the site.\n\nIt's Sanchez's position that, \"If I did such bad work, why are they using my crew?\" Eikenberry said.\n\nThrough attorney Tiffanie D. Stasiak, of Kutak Rock LLP, Brinkmann officials declined interview requests. Stasiak added that Brinkmann's policy is to not try legal cases in the media.\n\nStasiak gave the following statement in response to Marco All Season Construction's complaint:\n\n\"On Aug. 4, 2014, Brinkmann Constructors filed a counterclaim against Marco and a third party complaint against Becker General Contractors showing that Brinkmann Constructors did not hire Marco to work on the Alexan Flatirons project at any time. Marco was, in fact, hired by Becker General Contractors. Becker's contract with Brinkmann requires Becker to complete its work in a good and workman-like manner, free of defects, and in accordance with the approved plans, specifications, designs, applicable codes, standard of care and standard of practice.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the work performed by Marco for Becker was rejected by Brinkmann because it was defective. The work has since been replaced at a cost far exceeding any amount sought by Marco in its complaint in an effort by Brinkmann to see this excellent project to its proper completion.\"\n\nApex 5510's owners say they stand by Brinkmann's work on the project.\n\n\"We are highly confident in the work of our contractor, and we're looking forward to delivering the first residences of this high-quality apartment community to the people of Boulder County in early October,\" said Brad Blash, managing partner of Crossbeam Concierge LLC, which is developing Apex 5510 in partnership with Trammell Crow Residential.\n\nContact Camera Business Writer Alicia Wallace at 303-473-1332 or wallacea@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26481879/contractors-dispute-clouds-apex-5510-development-gunbarrel", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace ,  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26481879:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-07T15:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Come October, the first apartments are expected to open at Apex 5510, a 231-unit multifamily development in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood.", "title": "Contractors' dispute clouds Apex 5510 development in Gunbarrel", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26481879/contractors-dispute-clouds-apex-5510-development-gunbarrel", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0906/20140906__08DCBCOVw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0906/20140906__08DCBCOVw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2014-09-07T10:57:44-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-06T14:58:46-0600", "description": "Come October, the first apartments are expected to open at Apex 5510, a 231-unit multifamily development in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood.", "byline": "By Alicia Wallace,", "pubDate": "2014-09-07T10:58:32-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-07T15:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Contractors' dispute clouds Apex 5510 development in Gunbarrel", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_26481879/contractors-dispute-clouds-apex-5510-development-gunbarrel", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Come October, the first apartments are expected to open at Apex 5510, a 231-unit multifamily development in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood.", "title": "Contractors' dispute clouds Apex 5510 development in Gunbarrel"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0906/20140906__08DCBCOVw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc08\"", "article_summary": "( Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera )Come October, the first apartments are expected to open at Apex 5510, a 231-unit multifamily development in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood.\nT he Apex 5510 apartment project in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood has seen delays over a dispute between the development's main contractor and two subcontractors.\n(Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera)'Cart before the horse'Sanchez's legal complaint came nearly five months after his crew started working on Apex 5510.\nAfter their months of working on and walking off the Apex 5510 site, Becker and Sanchez claim the development was riddled with issues that negatively affected their efforts to frame the apartments.\nWork wraps up for the day on Thursday at the Apex 5510 apartment project in Boulder's Gunbarrel neighborhood, which has seen delays over a dispute between the development's main contractor and two subcontractors."}
