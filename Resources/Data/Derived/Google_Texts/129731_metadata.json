On MSNBC, Chris Matthews called Republican opponents of the program \u201cpolitical lightweights\u201d and \u201cpuppatoons.\u201d Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said House Republicans were \u201csickening.\u201d A night of debate on the first federal government shutdown in 17 years and the country\u2019s largest new government program in a generation had begun. On balance, Fox was worse than MSNBC. But both broadcasts were emblems of America\u2019s failing news industry. The triumph of opinion-driven cable TV and the collapse of newspapers has created an American news media that does an increasingly poor job of informing the public. And an excellent job of dividing it. The media, of course, is not solely to blame for America\u2019s political polarization. Complex dynamics \u2014 including a weak economy, gerrymandering and rapidly-shifting demographics \u2014 are fueling growing partisanship. But an economically battered news industry in desperate need of a new business model is a core part of the problem.\n\nCreating cable television and social media bubbles where one\u2019s political views are affirmed has proven popular and profitable. Angrily declaring one\u2019s opponents imbeciles enriches pundits, corporate executives and stockholders. The result for many Americans, though, is confusion, cynicism and division. I\u2019m not suggesting a false equivalence between Fox and MSNBC, or the far right and left \u2014 which James Fallows has rightly criticized in The Atlantic. Hard-line Republicans egged on by Fox are responsible for the government shutdown. They have taken the government hostage in their obsession to end Obamacare. Yet if one watches only Fox, radical steps are needed to prevent the cataclysm that conservatives believe Obamacare represents. There are some reasons for hope. The emergence of non-profit news outlets and the web\u2019s breadth of information and instant accountability are promising. But simplistic, reassuring narratives are more profitable than dispassionate descriptions of complex public policy problems. For a collapsing, digital-age news industry desperate for income, partisanship is an economic lifeline. That was evident Wednesday night. Flipping between Fox and MSNBC for several hours \u2014 something I suggest you try \u2014 produced two completely different realities. On MSNBC, Matthews and his guests called House Republicans \u201cwacko-birds,\u201d \u201cbirthers,\u201d and \u201ccrazy, angry.\u201d They said opponents of Obamacare were driven by bigotry and selfishness. \u201cThere is very little sense on the Hill that they\u2019re there for something bigger than themselves,\u201d said Susan Milligan, a columnist for U.S. News and World Report. At 8 p.m. on Fox, Bill O\u2019Reilly upped the rhetorical ante. Two days after its introduction, Obamacare was \u201cnot ready for primetime,\u201d according to O\u2019Reilly, riven with so many problems \u201cit was pretty much impossible to list them all,\u201d and likely to spawn delays in medical care and fraud. Over on MSNBC, Chris Hayes opened his 8 p.m. show with a screen logo declaring far-right opponents of the law \u201cfrauds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There&#39;s a direct connection between the shutdown and hyperbolic, partisan journalistic outlets driven more by profits than the search for truth.", "author": "David Rohde", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "There&#39;s a direct connection between the shutdown and hyperbolic, partisan journalistic outlets driven more by profits than the search for truth.", "title": "How the Broken Media Helped Break the Government", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/10/rtr9ryf/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/how-the-broken-media-helped-break-the-government/280261/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd490f\"", "article_summary": "Creating cable television and social media bubbles where one\u2019s political views are affirmed has proven popular and profitable.\nThe media, of course, is not solely to blame for America\u2019s political polarization.\nFlipping between Fox and MSNBC for several hours \u2014 something I suggest you try \u2014 produced two completely different realities.\nThe triumph of opinion-driven cable TV and the collapse of newspapers has created an American news media that does an increasingly poor job of informing the public.\nOver on MSNBC, Chris Hayes opened his 8 p.m. show with a screen logo declaring far-right opponents of the law \u201cfrauds.\u201d"}
