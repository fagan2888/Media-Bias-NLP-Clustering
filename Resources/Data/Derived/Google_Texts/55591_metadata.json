He\u2019s been shoving the last eight years. I think this bears repeating \u2014 nobody wants to believe the president of the United States is a liar. Nobody. It doesn\u2019t work out well. No one wants to say that about the president.\u201d\n\nBeck said he has immense respect for the office of the president of the United States, but \u201cit is a fact\u201d that Obama is a \u201cspecial kind of liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proof is readily available for anybody who cares to look,\u201d Beck said. \u201cAnd the fact is, the president is a special kind of liar because he can lie about things that have long been proven to be lies. Then he has the nerve to tell you to look up the evidence. \u2026 That\u2019s what he did this week.\u201d\n\nBeck played audio of the president saying: \u201cIt was one thing for them to argue against Obamacare before it was put in place. Every prediction they have made about it turned out to be wrong. See, it\u2019s working better than even I expected. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Evidence be damned.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, evidence be damned,\u201d Beck repeated. \u201cThat was a special kind of liar. You have to almost sit back in awe and say \u2018Oh, my gosh, he is an artist. He is a Rembrandt or the Monet of lies. He is so convincing, he may even have convinced himself!\u2019 And I believe he has. But what a statement. \u2018Evidence be damned.\u2019 All of the evidence is on our side, and he makes the opposite claim. But we have seen it before, repeatedly.\u201d\n\nBeck played audio of the president saying it is an \u201cillegitimate concern\u201d that Obamacare could lead to a single-payer healthcare system, and separate audio of the president saying, \u201cA single-payer health care plan, universal health care plan \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see.\u201d\n\nHe also played audio of the president saying the costs associated with Obamacare are \u201cabsolutely\u201d not taxes, and belittling George Stephanopoulos for implying otherwise. Then, Beck noted, the Obama administration argued before the Supreme Court that the costs were taxes.\n\n\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a tax; it is a tax,\u201d Beck summarized. \u201cHe wanted a single payer, he doesn\u2019t want a single payer. I am absolutely for a single payer, but against a single payer.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most egregiously, Beck said, the president promised the nation that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d and if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n\n\u201cTurns out millions of Americans couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t,\u201d Beck said.\n\n\u201cI hate being the guy telling you the president of the United States is a liar. I hate it. I don\u2019t want to be this guy, but nobody else will say it,\u201d Beck concluded. \u201cSomebody has to, for the record, set it straight. Someone has to preserve the record, because they are changing our history. If they say it enough, it will be recorded that way for all time and no one will know the truth.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
