She is a professor of psychiatry and founding director of the Psychiatry and Law Program and Forensic Psychiatry Fellowship, as well as associate dean for academic affairs at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine (UCSF). As her term draws to a close, Dr Binder met with Psychiatry Advisor at the 2016 Annual Meeting to look back on the past year and to share some of her plans for the future.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nPsychiatry Advisor: Dr Binder, how did you deal with the complexity of the issues facing the APA?\n\nRenee Binder, MD: It is a crucial time for the APA, as well as for psychiatrists and our patients. Recent years have seen enactment of the Affordable Care Act, as well as the Mental Health Parity Act. However, although we are decreasing the number of uninsured\u2014and despite the fact that psychiatric illnesses are given parity with other medical illnesses\u2014there are still many patients who do not have access to care. One major challenge is that since enactment of the Parity Act, there has not been effective enforcement in many jurisdictions. Our organization believes that mental health care is part of general health care, and that accessing mental health care is a right of every citizen. So, although there has been forward momentum, we still have a long way to go before everyone in the United States who needs to access to mental health care is able to do so.\n\nPsychiatry Advisor: In light of your expertise in criminalization of the mentally ill, research has shown that criminal behavior has a neurobiological basis, and there has been increased interest in the potential application of neuroscience to the judicial system. What are your thoughts on the implications of applying neuroscience research for predicting criminal behavior?\n\nDr Binder: First of all, we are not there yet. There have been incredible scientific discoveries that enable us to visualize the brain and understand about pathways and some of the underpinnings of behavior. On occasion, an article will be published that says, \u201cYou can tell if someone is lying by seeing what lights up in their brain.\u201d But it is not that simple. There is currently no tool that meets the Daubert standard for use in the judicial system. This is a standard for evidence in federal legal proceedings that ensures that for something to be introduced into the courts\u2014where the consequences of determining someone's guilt or innocence are significant\u2014it must have a very high standard of evidence. Consider lying: many \u201clie detector tests\u201d assume that when people lie, they get anxious. Therefore, if a lie detector test is administered and the individual gets very anxious, one might think that he or she is lying. But what must be recognized is that many people are anxious even when they are telling the truth. In addition, there are people who lie frequently without experiencing any anxiety at all about lying. So, any test being used to detect the lying\u2014whether it has something to do with the voice box or an increased level of sweating\u2014would have no validity as the individual being tested is not experiencing anxiety. Therefore, we have a long to go before we can use these tools in the judicial system.\n\nPsychiatry Advisor: Do you believe that there is a place for neurobiological markers and genetics in potentially identifying people who might have a propensity for violent or aggressive behavior?\n\nDr Binder: There is a lot of research trying to identify neurobiological markers for violent behavior. My concern is that violence is caused by many different things and cannot be determined by neurobiological markers alone. Violence could be influenced by an individual's peer group; for example, if one is in a gang and other members are committing acts of violence, that individual may also commit violence just to establish memberhood within that gang. There are also social and cultural factors\u2014such as poverty or witnessing violence in your household\u2014that must be considered. Therefore, violent behavior is caused by many different things.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,cancertherapyadvisor.com,chemotherapyadvisor.com,clinicaladvisor.com,clinicalpainadvisor.com,empr.com,endocrinologyadvisor.com,infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com,mycme.com,neurologyadvisor.com,oncologynurseadvisor.com,psychiatryadvisor.com,renalandurologynews.com", "news_keywords": "APA 2016, Practice Management", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "Psychiatry Advisor", "description": "Renee Binder, MD, recaps her year as president of the American Psychiatric Association.", "title": "Parity and Criminalization in Mental Health: A Discussion With APA President, Renee Binder, MD", "url": "http://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/apa-2016-coverage/apa-president-dr-binder-discusses-decriminalization-of-the-mentally-ill/article/496730/", "image": "http://media.psychiatryadvisor.com/images/2016/05/16/binderphoto1_977818_977819.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@PsychiatryAdv", "image": {"src": "http://media.psychiatryadvisor.com/images/2016/05/16/binderphoto1_977818_977819.jpg"}, "description": "Renee Binder, MD, recaps her year as president of the American Psychiatric Association.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Parity and Criminalization in Mental Health: A Discussion With APA President, Renee Binder, MD"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=909713520", "fb": {"app_id": 236959933328663}, "google-site-verification": "dZgjJ9HRVwo_jdEmYHQ6bp5TORr7UErbyMrKG8JxzvM", "article": {"section": "APA 2016 Coverage", "tag": "Practice Management", "published_time": "2016-05-16T12:54:15", "modified_time": "2016-05-26T12:19:36"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Renee Binder, MD, recaps her year as president of the American Psychiatric Association."}, "article_summary": "Our organization believes that mental health care is part of general health care, and that accessing mental health care is a right of every citizen.\nRenee Binder, MD: It is a crucial time for the APA, as well as for psychiatrists and our patients.\nATLANTA, Georgia \u2014 In addition to serving as the 2015 president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), Renee Binder, MD, serves in multiple additional clinical and educational capacities.\nContinue Reading BelowPsychiatry Advisor: Dr Binder, how did you deal with the complexity of the issues facing the APA?\nRecent years have seen enactment of the Affordable Care Act, as well as the Mental Health Parity Act."}
