The law was successfully challenged by the United Church of Christ in 2014. \u201cBy depriving the Plaintiffs of the freedom to perform religious marriage ceremonies or to marry,\u201d the UCC argued, \u201cNorth Carolina stigmatizes Plaintiffs and their religious beliefs\u201d\u2014and the court agreed, finding it to be an unconstitutional violation of their rights.\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s not surprising that UCC\u2019s general minister and president, the Rev. John C. Dorhauer, wrote the preface to a major new report, shedding new light on the right\u2019s decades-long campaign to redefine religious freedom into a tool for their own theocratic domination. \u201cRemoving someone\u2019s civil rights by empowering the government to protect and preserve my religious homophobia is not my idea of religious liberty,\u201d Dorhauer writes. But that\u2019s exactly how the religious right has tried to stand the idea of religious freedom on its head. \u201cWhat they want to call religious freedom is in fact the kind of oppressive religious tyranny that my ancestors left their homeland to escape,\u201d Dorhauer added.\n\n\u201cWhen Exemption is the Rule: The Religious Freedom Strategy of the Christian Right,\u201d published by Political Research Associates on Jan. 12, was written by Frederick Clarkson, PRA\u2019s Senior Fellow for Religious Liberty, author of \u201cEternal Hostility: The Struggle Between Theocracy and Democracy\u201d and co-founder of the blog Talk to Action. The title highlights a key aspect of the religious right\u2019s long-term strategy, taking the time-honored principle of religious exemption, intended to protect the individual right of conscience, and expanding it recklessly to apply to whole institutions, even for-profit businesses\u2014as seen in the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 Hobby Lobby decision, in a process designed to fragment the common public sphere and carve out vast segments of American life where civil rights, labor law and other core protections simply do not apply.\n\nThis strategy was kicked into high gear back in 2009 with the \u201cManhattan Declaration,\u201d a widely endorsed manifesto linking \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d specifically to \u201csanctity of life\u201d and \u201cdignity of marriage,\u201d which religious progressives are just beginning to effectively counter-organize against. This report represents a significant beacon, shedding light on that strategy, the battlefield it\u2019s waged on, and the kinds of long-term responses needed to counter-organize against it.\n\nRooted In Discrimination\n\n\u201cWhen Christian Right leaders talk about religious liberty, they often really mean theocratic supremacism of their own religious beliefs inscribed in government,\u201d Clarkson points out. The report presents a detailed account of how their Orwellian agenda is unfolding, combining up-to-the-minute analysis of recent developments with an historical account dating back to the 1970s and the birth of the modern-day religious right, defending Bob Jones University\u2019s \u201cright to discriminate,\u201d based on religion. As noted in the report:\n\nAs recently as the 1980s, Christian Right activists defended racial segregation by claiming that restrictions on their ability to discriminate violated their First Amendment right to religious freedom\u2026. Instead of African Americans being discriminated against by Bob Jones, the university argued it was the party being discriminated against in being prevented from executing its First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court disagreed\u2026.\n\nTwo things are worth noting here: first, the primacy of discrimination as a political motivation, and second, the \u201cenvious reversal\u201d of victim and victimizer that lies at the heart of the conservative victimhood shtick. Elaborating on the first point, the report also notes:\n\nThe case, which began during the Nixon administration, became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of the then-budding Christian Right as it advanced over the course of a decade. The late conservative strategist Paul Weyrich and historian Randall Balmer, among others, credited Bob Jones as the catalyst that politicized a wide range of conservative evangelicals\u2026. \u2026..even before the issues of abortion and homosexuality became the policy priorities of a newly politicized Christian Right, its leaders fought the perceived threat of racial equality at conservative Christian academies by claiming their religious freedom to discriminate. This legacy should remind us that the Right\u2019s religious liberty campaigns mobilize old arguments around new targets, and that their agenda extends beyond questions of contraception coverage, or marriage and nondiscrimination in the LGBTQ context.\n\nIn short, Bob Jones University is not just an old case, irrelevant to what\u2019s happening today. It represents, at its core, the exact same argument that conservatives are making today. As Faulkner wrote, \u201cThe past isn\u2019t dead. It isn\u2019t even the past.\u201d\n\nWe see this as well with regard to the second point, the \u201cenvious reversal\u201d of victim and victimizer. Portraying themselves as victims, uniquely, if not solely threatened with the loss of religious liberty, is the central premise of the right\u2019s \u201creligious liberty\u201d crusade, even though, as the UCC case shows, their phony claims of victimhood can lead to actually victimizing others instead.\n\nAs the UCC case underscores, the cause they are actually advancing is neither religion nor freedom, but the antithesis of both: theocratic political control. No church, minister or priest anywhere in America has ever been forced to perform a gay marriage against their will\u2014the kind of scenario that so-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d advocates supposedly fear. Yet, for almost two years, UCC ministers in North Carolina faced criminal charges if they dared to perform a same-sex marriage ceremony. UCC\u2019s case made it stunningly clear which side was really interested in religious liberty, and which side was deceptively hijacking the concept to force its own narrow-minded religious views onto the rest of society\u2014the exact opposite of what most Americans instinctively know religious freedom to be.\n\nThe Struggle Intensifies\n\nIn the 30-plus years since the Bob Jones decision, the religious right\u2019s basic argument hasn\u2019t changed, but they\u2019ve put enormous effort into changing the cultural and political environment, particularly by building organizational infrastructure\u2014think tanks, law schools (like Pat Robertson\u2019s Regent University School of Law and Jerry Falwell\u2019s law school at his Liberty University), and legal advocacy groups. Over the same period, they\u2019ve advanced anti-gay and anti-reproductive choice agendas which have been much easier to defend in terms of a moral high ground based on traditional hierarchies of power. But ever since the ground began clearly shifting on gay rights, a new phase has been entered.\n\n\u201cThe evangelical Protestant Christian Right and U.S. Roman Catholic bishops are intensifying their campaign to carve out arenas of public life where religious institutions, individuals, and even businesses may evade civil rights and labor laws in the name of religious liberty,\u201d Clarkson writes in the executive summary. \u201cBy creating zones of legal exemption, the Christian Right seeks to shrink the public sphere and the arenas within which the government has legitimacy to defend people\u2019s rights, including reproductive, labor, and LGBTQ rights.\u201d\n\nThese efforts have powerful outside allies as well, Clarkson notes. \u201cIn this, it is often aligned with the antigovernment strategy of free market libertarians and some business interests, who for a variety of reasons also seek to restrict arenas where government can legally act.\u201d And while their actions are largely fueled by recent developments, particularly the sudden dramatic shift toward acceptance of gay marriage, and LGBTQ rights in general, the scope of their reaction is vastly more far-reaching:\n\nThis conservative Christian alliance is challenging a century or more of social advances and many of the premises of the Enlightenment underlying the very definition of religious liberty in the United States. Its long-range goal is to impose a conservative Christian social order inspired by religious law, in part by eroding pillars of undergirding religious pluralism that are integral to our constitutional democracy.\n\nIn the end, he explains:\n\nTheir goal is to impose a conservative Christian social order inspired by religious law. To achieve this goal, they seek to remove religious freedom as an integral part of religious pluralism and constitutional democracy, and redefine it in Orwellian fashion to justify discrimination by an ever wider array of \u201creligified\u201d institutions and businesses.\n\nClarkson describes religification as \u201ca tactic \u2026 by which an organization rewrites mission statements, contracts, and job descriptions in an attempt to exempt institutions from the law in as many ways a possible,\u201d and he points out that \u201cThe groups promoting this tactic, such as Alliance Defending Freedom and Liberty Institute, have issued handbooks to help organizations protect against \u2018dangerous antireligious attacks.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne such \u201cdangerous antireligious attack\u201d involved 2,800 employees of the St. Peter\u2019s Healthcare System of New Brunswick, New Jersey, whom the hospital tried to cheat out of their pension benefits under the guise of \u201creligious freedom.\u201d The hospital had underfunded its pension plan by $30 million, claiming a religious exemption from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which protects individuals in most private pensions by setting minimum standards, including mandatory fiduciary and funding requirements. \u201cPensioner Laurence Kaplan was concerned that the plan was underfunded and his lawsuit showed that indeed it was,\u201d Clarkson reports:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The religious right can't win at the polls.
