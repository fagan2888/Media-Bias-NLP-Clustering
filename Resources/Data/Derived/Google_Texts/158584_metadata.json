He suffered a rare stroke, paralyzing the left side of his body and leaving him in a coma for several days. The Ponder Junior High School assistant principal spent two years recovering.\n\n\u201cWe know what that felt like and how scary it was, but more importantly, we know what it felt like to get help and to have our family, friends and our church family and our small community just rally around us \u2026 so we didn\u2019t have to spend a huge amount of energy and thought on how we were going to pay our bills and whether or not we were going to lose our home,\u201d said Emily McLarty, who is principal at Denton ISD\u2019s Adkins Elementary School.\n\nThe generosity shown to them is why the McLartys are now looking to pay it forward. In recent weeks, the couple launched a gaming application, Dunking Monkey, on Google Play and in Apple\u2019s iTunes App Store. The app is being sold for $1.99, and the McLartys say they\u2019ll use three-fourths of the revenue collected to assist cancer patients and their families with medical bills.\n\n\u201cThe game is just kind of a vehicle to an idea, the bigger picture, I guess,\u201d Patrick McLarty said. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking people to give money, donate anything because \u2026 they\u2019re buying the app.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just asking them to buy an app and kind of be a part of something different, a different way of thinking, and understand that we\u2019re normal people just trying to help other normal people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe idea to pay it forward came one night while the couple was playing a game of \u201cWhat If.\u201d One question that came up: What would you do with a $1 million lottery prize?\n\n\u201cPat said \u2026 without hesitation, \u2018I\u2019d want to help people. I\u2019d want to help people with their medical bills,\u2019\u201d Emily McLarty recalled.\n\nAlso spurring the idea was Patrick McLarty\u2019s experience seeing a hard-working person with insurance struggle with medical debt.\n\nWhen Patrick was in his 20s, his mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She died in 1997. He watched as his father, who had worked hard to avoid incurring debt, was blindsided with his mother\u2019s medical bills. He saw the worry his father experienced.\n\n\u201cIt just killed him, this illness that came out of nowhere and caused all this debt that he didn\u2019t want,\u201d Patrick McLarty said.\n\nHe said he\u2019s had the idea for an app for a while. He researched what was needed to develop one and reached out to software companies to share the idea he had for Dunking Monkey. Eventually, he found a Chicago-based company interested in creating his app idea.\n\nDevelopment for the game began in July and was funded with savings the McLartys had after selling their first house in Sanger. For several months, they worked remotely with a handful of developers in India, poring over sketch designs, development samples and communicating the vision they had for the game. Patrick McLarty said some of his students in Ponder tested the game during development and offered feedback. He said it\u2019s surreal to walk into a gymnasium and see students playing a game he created.\n\nThe game\u2019s objective is simple: Succeed at knocking a cartoon monkey into a dunk tank. Players must hit a target, and depending where their strike lands on that target, they earn multiple points. The game has three levels with a special feature for players who advance to Level 3.\n\nThe game debuted on Google Play on Oct. 31 and in the iTunes App Store on Nov. 6. So far, the game has accumulated about 100 downloads.\n\nThe couple launched the website www.dunkingmonkey.com this week for people to learn more about the game\u2019s purpose. The website will also be used as a portal for families to apply for medical bill assistance. The McLartys say that through the website, they intend to be transparent about who\u2019s being supported by the funds raised.\n\nGiven their family\u2019s own medical ordeal, Emily McLarty said they have an appreciation for what it means to experience the goodness in humanity.\n\n\u201cThat feeling of being the recipient of such generosity is humbling, and it changes you,\u201d she said. \u201cOur community came together and took care of us, and over and over again. There were little examples of that and it\u2019s so affirming of the world.\n\n\u201cI think when given the opportunity, people will choose to be kind and they will choose to be generous. We need opportunities to do that.\u201d\n\nBRITNEY TABOR can be reached at 940-566-6876 and via Twitter at @BritneyTabor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patrick and Emily McLarty can relate to families faced with mounting medical bills. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced what that\u2019s like, and the uncertainty and the fear,\u201d Emily McLarty said.
