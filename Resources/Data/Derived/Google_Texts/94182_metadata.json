Writing for a 6-3 majority, Roberts, like the consummate A student he is, offered an excellent third-year administrative law exam answer to the questions the challengers posed. There had been speculation that the crucial votes to save the Act would come from Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, and that they would have to be lured across the Court\u2019s liberal-conservative line by soothing words about the prerogatives of the states. But federalism was the dog that didn\u2019t bark Thursday. Instead, Roberts wrote for himself and five others\u2014Justices Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. The challengers had argued that one clause of the Act limited its tax-benefits to \u201can exchange established by a state,\u201d and so the subsidies could not be offered to those who purchased their plans on state-level exchanges established by the federal government. Roberts explained in his customary breezy style that this clause, read in context, referred to all American Health Benefit Exchanges established under the act, whether by the states themselves or by the federal government.\n\nThis reading means that federal subsidies are available to all eligible Americans who comply with the Act\u2019s individual mandate by buying health insurance through an exchange. The contrary reading would have meant that those who did so in states that had not set up their own exchanges would lose their coverage, and very soon be forced to drop it. \u201cSo without the tax credits, the coverage requirement would apply to fewer individuals. And it would be a lot fewer.\u201d Roberts cited figures suggesting that up to 87 percent of exchange customers would lose subsidies. Related Story 'We Doubt That Is What Congress Meant to Do' He made clear as he did so that this reading was the correct one as a matter of law\u2014not an administrative interpretation that could be changed by a hypothetical Republican administration. In other words, for better or worse, the ACA is now part of federal law, to be uprooted, if at all, only by a full congressional vote to repeal and, possibly, to override a presidential veto. Roberts also refused to duck responsibility for making an interpretive choice, rather than simply following the words of the statute. Both parties before the Court\u2014the right-wing challengers represented by the conservative attorney Michael Carvin, and the federal government, represented by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, had argued that the statute was clear. But it wasn\u2019t, and Roberts said so. The phrase \u201cestablished by a State,\u201d he wrote, could mean either \u201csuch exchange,\u201d state or federal, or \u201conly a state exchange.\u201d It takes nothing away from Roberts\u2019s legal and literary skills to say that, once that was established, the result flowed naturally. Because if the phrase is ambiguous, it is hornbook law that courts should interpret ambiguous provisions in their context and in line with the most reasonable view of congressional intent. \u201c[E]stablished by a state\u201d might seem clear \u201c\u2019when viewed in isolation,\u2019\u201d he wrote. But that \u201cmost natural reading\u201d was foreclosed by \u201cthe context and structure of the Act.\u201d\n\nRoberts read the statute in a broad context indeed, including the history of healthcare policy and the legislative process that produced the ACA. Massachusetts had the first successful state healthcare plan, he noted. The three reforms at the heart of its plan are a ban on insurers refusing coverage or raising rates on individuals on the basis of their heath; an \u201cindividual mandate\u201d that all taxpayers secure coverage; and tax credits for those who otherwise could not afford coverage. Those reforms are at the heart of the ACA as well. If the Court agreed with the challengers, the gap between states operating state exchanges and those without would be huge: \u201conly one of the Act\u2019s major reforms would apply in States with a federal Exchange.\u201d That\u2019s because without the tax credits, lower-income taxpayers would get a \u201chardship\u201d exemption from the \u201cmandate.\u201d Only the insurance reforms requiring companies to insure the sick as well as the healthy (\u201cguaranteed issue\u201d) would apply\u2014and the experience of the states shows that guaranteed issue in isolation leads to a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d Customers wait to get sick before buying insurance; companies, saddled with only the bad risks, must jack up rates; and then the private insurance market contracts or even collapses. \u201cIt is implausible,\u201d he wrote with some understatement, \u201cthat Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner.\u201d Roberts had kind words for the challengers. Their argument, he wrote, is \u201cstrong,\u201d and the Court should be wary when relying \u201con context and structure in statutory interpretation.\u201d The Act itself, he wrote with even more understatement, \u201ccontains more than a few examples of inartful drafting.\u201d He likened its passage to an old cartoon once cited in a law review by the late Justice Felix Frankfurter, \u201cin which a senator tells his colleagues, \u2018I admit this bill is too complicated to understand. We\u2019ll just have to pass it to find out what it means.\u201d But he concluded: \u201cWe must respect the role of the legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done.\u201d The ACA was passed \u201cto improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them.\u201d And with that, the witch was gone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The chief justice\u2019s opinion upholding Obamacare aims to fulfill his promise to serve as an impartial umpire.", "author": "Garrett Epps", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The chief justice\u2019s opinion upholding Obamacare aims to fulfill his promise to serve as an impartial umpire.", "title": "John Roberts Calls a Strike", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/06/RTR4YXE7/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/roberts-scalia-affordable-care-act-king-burwell/396863/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Instead, Roberts wrote for himself and five others\u2014Justices Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.\nAnd it would be a lot fewer.\u201d Roberts cited figures suggesting that up to 87 percent of exchange customers would lose subsidies.\n\u201cIt is implausible,\u201d he wrote with some understatement, \u201cthat Congress meant the Act to operate in this manner.\u201d Roberts had kind words for the challengers.\nThis reading means that federal subsidies are available to all eligible Americans who comply with the Act\u2019s individual mandate by buying health insurance through an exchange.\nRoberts also refused to duck responsibility for making an interpretive choice, rather than simply following the words of the statute."}
