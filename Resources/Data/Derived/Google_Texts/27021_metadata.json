As a result, Gov. Paul LePage plans to introduce legislation to send all of that money into the state\u2019s Budget Stabilization Fund.\n\nIf approved the by Maine Legislature \u2013 which isn\u2019t guaranteed given the current political climate in Augusta \u2013 the transfer would increase Maine\u2019s rainy day fund from $111 million to at least $183 million by June 30, 2017. That represents roughly 3 percent of the state\u2019s two-year $6.7 billion budget.\n\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund, which is frequently referred to as the rainy day fund, is used to cover revenue losses during economic downturns, but has been tapped by politicians to pay for other budget priorities. Credit rating agencies also consider the size of the fund relative to the state budget.\n\nIn a statement, LePage said state government could only operate for just over one week on the current fund balance. The Republican governor also took a political jab at lawmakers, who he said have \u201cshown that they cannot be trusted to exercise fiscal restraint,\u201d and said the latest forecast is an opportunity to \u201crestore some semblance of fiscal responsibility to state operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBond rating agencies, such as Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s, have warned the State of Maine for years of the consequences should we fail to maintain or increase the balance of our Budget Stabilization Fund,\u201d LePage said. \u201cOur existing balance is insufficient. All too often we wait until the last day of the fiscal year to determine what money the state will put into savings. This is an irresponsible way to run a business and an irresponsible (way) to run a government.\u201d\n\nWhile there likely will be bipartisan support for setting aside some of the projected surplus, it was unclear Monday how LePage\u2019s proposal to send all $72.7 million to the Budget Stabilization Fund would be received by the Legislature.\n\n\u201cThe entire country has seen a remarkable turnaround over the past eight years, and an increased revenue projection is evidence of that turnaround\u2019s effect in Maine,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Justin Alfond, D-Portland, said in a statement. \u201cOur budget must be responsible, and that includes saving for a rainy day. But just like Maine families, the state first has to make sure all its bills are paid and that it\u2019s making investments in the future.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are already fighting over a \u201ctax conformity\u201d proposal that would align Maine\u2019s tax code with recent changes made at the federal level.\n\nWhile Republicans want to adopt all of the federal tax credits and deductions, to the tune of $38 million, House Democrats are leading the push for a one-year conformity extension costing $16.8 million. But the House Democratic proposal would also use more than $20 million in the Budget Stabilization Fund to provide additional funding to public schools.\n\nThe fight over \u201ctax conformity\u201d has become a full-blown election-year issue.\n\nIn recent weeks, LePage and his Republican base in the Legislature have accused Democrats of trying to increase taxes on regular Mainers and business owners. House Democrats, meanwhile, have accused Republicans of being willing to shortchange public schools in order to continue a particular tax break for businesses that they contend has not proved to be effective.\n\nOn Monday, LePage accused \u201ca radical group of socialist Democrats\u201d of attempting to raid the rainy day fund. Alfond countered that \u201cit\u2019s no surprise to see that Gov. LePage couldn\u2019t announce a policy proposal without couching it in insults and petty political attacks.\u201d\n\nThe Legislature is expected to debate the tax conformity issue again this week, perhaps as early as Tuesday.\n\nA LePage administration official said the governor\u2019s proposal to increase the size of the Budget Stabilization Fund will likely be formally presented to the Legislature \u201cin the coming days.\u201d The legislation would transfer $67.3 million to the fund no later than June 30 of this year followed by a transfer of $5.4 million no later than June 30, 2017.\n\nDavid Heidrich, spokesman for the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, said an increase in revenue from individual income taxes and other factors led the Revenue Forecasting Committee to project the $72.7 million surplus. The committee is expected to present a formal revenue forecast report on March 1.\n\n\u201cThe positive changes made by the revenue forecasting committee primarily recognize strong income tax withholding and high growth in individual estimated payments,\u201d Heidrich said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The governor's proposal comes after the Maine Revenue Forecasting Committee projects that the state will finish the current two-year budget cycle with a surplus.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The governor's proposal comes after the Maine Revenue Forecasting Committee projects that the state will finish the current two-year budget cycle with a surplus.", "title": "LePage proposes transferring $72.7 million to Maine's rainy day fund - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/805854_274152-LePage_04.jpg", "height": 695}, "updated_time": "2016-02-23T10:21:24-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/02/22/lepage-to-introduce-legislation-to-transfer-72-7-million-to-states-rainy-day-fund/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The governor's proposal comes after the Maine Revenue Forecasting Committee projects that the state will finish the current two-year budget cycle with a surplus.", "title": "LePage proposes transferring $72.7 million to Maine's rainy day fund - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/805854_274152-LePage_04.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2016-02-22T18:43:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T10:21:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb375\"", "article_summary": "Paul LePage plans to introduce legislation to send all of that money into the state\u2019s Budget Stabilization Fund.\nOn Monday, LePage accused \u201ca radical group of socialist Democrats\u201d of attempting to raid the rainy day fund.\nAUGUSTA \u2014 The LePage administration is proposing to funnel a projected $72.7 million budget surplus into Maine\u2019s rainy day fund, a move that could generate debate with lawmakers about the best uses for the additional money.\nBut the House Democratic proposal would also use more than $20 million in the Budget Stabilization Fund to provide additional funding to public schools.\nThe Budget Stabilization Fund, which is frequently referred to as the rainy day fund, is used to cover revenue losses during economic downturns, but has been tapped by politicians to pay for other budget priorities."}
