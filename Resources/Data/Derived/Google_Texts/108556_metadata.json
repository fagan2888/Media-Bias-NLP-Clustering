And the two editorials follow comments from Rick Ledgett, an NSA official who led a task force investigating damage from the Snowden leaks, who said that he\u2019d be open to a deal that allowed Snowden to return home if he stopped leaking documents.\n\nThe expanded role of the NSA came after Congress authorized the Patriot Act, which passed the Senate in October 2001 by a margin of 98-1. The USA Patriot Act is an acronym for Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001. The law gives federal authorities permission to search a home or business without the owner\u2019s or the occupant\u2019s consent or knowledge. It also allows the FBI and NSA to search telephone, e-mail, and financial records without a court order; and it allows enforcement agencies access to business records, including library and financial records.\n\nAfter the law passed, the Dept. of Homeland Security issued a color-coded system of alerts. Whenever there was an \u201celevated risk\u201d of terror attacks or greater, it was usually based on \u201cincreased chatter.\u201d Where did The New York Times think that chatter was coming from? A phone booth?\n\nLetting Snowden off the hook is a bad idea. Here are three reasons why:\n\n1. It sets a bad precedent. Snowden made off with a massive cache of documents and has leaked them at the worst possible moments for the United States, badly damaging credibility around the world. But he is just one of four million people who have top-secret clearance.\n\nIf the White House decides to give Snowden a pass, it sets a dangerous precedent: if you don\u2019t like your job, leak American secrets to the media and we\u2019ll let you off the hook. Clemency for Snowden would remove the threat of prosecution for ignoring the oath to protect American secrets that employees of the NSA and CIA take.\n\n2. The Snowden revelations are no longer shocking. Snowden\u2019s initial revelations arrived with a bang, but the ongoing trickle of secrets amounts to a whimper. HIs latest leaks - that the NSA is collecting metadata on American cell phone calls - is hardly a surprise to anyone who\u2019s been paying attention to how the United States fights terrorism (one could argue that none of the revelations are all that shocking).\n\nMinus an absolute bombshell from Snowden, the worst of the damage he caused is already done. He\u2019ll no doubt keep leaking, but the shock value of the revelations is likely to continue to wane over time.\n\nRelated: Edward Snowden: From Whistleblower to Traitor\n\n3. Let\u2019s not forget, Snowden peddled American secrets in exchange for asylum. The United States is currently engaged in a cyber Cold War with China. Lost in the ever-evolving Snowden narrative is that at the beginning of this all, he offered China documents in exchange for asylum.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be a whistleblower; it\u2019s another to offer American secrets to a rival in exchange for safety. That makes Snowden no different than other spies who have left the United States and then gave information to a rival.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to minimize the importance of the issues raised by Snowden\u2019s leaks. It\u2019s important that U.S courts and the public debate whether the NSA\u2019s tactics are legal.\n\nBut it\u2019s not an accident that Snowden has ended up in Russia, an emerging rival to the United States and a police state far worse than here. The best course of action is to let him stay there.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s a growing movement to grant clemency to NSA leaker Edward Snowden.
