The sum for the Butte Fire, southeast of Sacramento, is more than $225 million.\n\n\u201cThe severity of the September wildfires in California serves as a reminder of how costly the peril can be for the insurance industry,\u201d Adam Podlaha, head of Impact Forecasting, said in a statement.\n\nTotal economic losses, which include costs not borne by insurers, will probably exceed $2 billion, helping to make 2015 the costliest year for wildfires in the U.S. since 2007, according to Impact, which is a unit of London-based insurance broker Aon Plc. That was the year when the Witch Fire struck California\u2019s San Diego County.\n\nDry weather, high temperatures and gusty winds hampered efforts to contain the fires, resulting in at least six deaths. Throughout the U.S., wildfires burned more than 9 million acres (3.6 million hectares) this year through Sept. 29, more than triple the total in the same period of 2014, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nArkansas, Idaho and Oregon are among other states currently reporting fires, according to the center. Before this year, eight of the 10 costliest U.S. wildfires occurred in California, according to Property Claim Services data compiled by the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nAnd, as Podlaha said in the statement, \u201cthe peak of the California wildfire season is just beginning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Christie Boyden", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-08/california-wildfires-will-cost-insurers-more-than-1-1-billion", "title": "California Wildfires Will Cost Insurers More Than $1.1 Billion", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "description": "The wildfires that raged across Northern California last month will cost insurers more than $1.1 billion, according to catastrophe modeler Impact Forecasting."}, "parsely-author": "Christie Boyden", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "California", "news_keywords": "California", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-08/california-wildfires-will-cost-insurers-more-than-1-1-billion", "parsely-title": "California Wildfires Will Cost Insurers More Than $1.1 Billion", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-08T17:45:01.351Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The wildfires that raged across Northern California last month will cost insurers more than $1.1 billion, according to catastrophe modeler Impact Forecasting.", "parsely-tags": "California,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-10-08T17:45:01.351Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-08/california-wildfires-will-cost-insurers-more-than-1-1-billion", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The wildfires that raged across Northern California last month will cost insurers more than $1.1 billion, according to catastrophe modeler Impact Forecasting.", "title": "California Wildfires Will Cost Insurers More Than $1.1 Billion"}, "fb": {"status": "The wildfires that raged across Northern California last month will cost insurers more than $1.1 billion, according to catastrophe modeler Impact Forecasting."}, "parsely-post-id": "NVWU916KLVRK01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06e6\"", "article_summary": "The wildfires that raged across Northern California last month will cost insurers more than $1.1 billion, according to catastrophe modeler Impact Forecasting.\nBefore this year, eight of the 10 costliest U.S. wildfires occurred in California, according to Property Claim Services data compiled by the Insurance Information Institute.\n\u201cThe severity of the September wildfires in California serves as a reminder of how costly the peril can be for the insurance industry,\u201d Adam Podlaha, head of Impact Forecasting, said in a statement.\nAnd, as Podlaha said in the statement, \u201cthe peak of the California wildfire season is just beginning.\u201d\nDry weather, high temperatures and gusty winds hampered efforts to contain the fires, resulting in at least six deaths."}
