Lindsey Graham, who was part of the 1994 Republican wave that witnessed the birth of the original Contract, wants to recapture that magic with a 2014 version of the document that will let voters know what the GOP intends to do with the Senate majority, should they win it.\n\nGraham\u2019s thinking makes sense, sort of. The Republicans are poised to win a few Senate seats in states where incumbent Democrats are fighting structural disadvantages, and it\u2019s in their interest to convince anyone silly enough to listen that they actually have a national mandate to repeal the Affordable Care Act or cut taxes forever. A \u201cContract With America\u201d is a ham-fisted way of nationalizing those races \u2013 it says \u201cAmerica\u201d right there in the title, after all.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey did when they unveiled the original Contract With America six weeks before the 1994 midterm election. The Republicans were poised to make huge gains, so they slapped together an agenda and told reporters after the fact that they\u2019d been swept to power on a national mandate to prohibit welfare assistance to teen mothers under the age of 18 (a provision of the original Contract). The Contract itself had little impact on the Republicans\u2019 success at the polls; only 31 percent of voters had even heard of the Contract by late October 1994.\n\nBut it\u2019s since attained this mythic status as the most potent device of electoral persuasion ever devised. As such, whenever Republicans think they have a chance at a pretty good election cycle, out comes the \u201cnew\u201d Contract With America.\n\nIn late September 2010, not long before the Tea Party wave, the Republicans unveiled the \u201cPledge to America,\u201d a gauzy and unspecific \u201cplan\u201d for taking the country back from Barack Obama and the socialists. It was a long-form recitation of rote GOP policy positions \u2013 taxes bad, spending bad (military excluded), Obamacare double-plus bad \u2013 paired with inspiring photos of cowboys and Mt. Rushmore. The newly empowered Republicans broke a bunch of the promises (Obamacare was not repealed, taxes were raised on the wealthy), and went on to lose House and Senate seats in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With election season coming up, Republicans are once again trying to pre-manufacture a \"mandate.\" Here's the ploy", "title": "The right\u2019s transparent new sham: New \u201cContract With America\u201d will not be new at all", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With election season coming up, Republicans are once again trying to pre-manufacture a \"mandate.\" Here's the ploy", "title": "The right\u2019s transparent new sham: New \u201cContract With America\u201d will not be new at all", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/27/the_rights_transparent_new_sham_new_contract_with_america_will_not_be_new_at_all/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/cruz_gingrich_paul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With election season coming up, Republicans are once again trying to pre-manufacture a \"mandate.\" Here's the ploy", "title": "The right\u2019s transparent new sham: New \u201cContract With America\u201d will not be new at all", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/cruz_gingrich_paul.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Dick Armey, Editor's Picks, GOP, John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, midterm elections, Midterms, Newt Gingrich, Politics, Republican Party, Republicans, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe215a\"", "article_summary": "A \u201cContract With America\u201d is a ham-fisted way of nationalizing those races \u2013 it says \u201cAmerica\u201d right there in the title, after all.\nThat\u2019s precisely what Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey did when they unveiled the original Contract With America six weeks before the 1994 midterm election.\nAs such, whenever Republicans think they have a chance at a pretty good election cycle, out comes the \u201cnew\u201d Contract With America.\nIt was a long-form recitation of rote GOP policy positions \u2013 taxes bad, spending bad (military excluded), Obamacare double-plus bad \u2013 paired with inspiring photos of cowboys and Mt.\nThe Contract itself had little impact on the Republicans\u2019 success at the polls; only 31 percent of voters had even heard of the Contract by late October 1994."}
