It\u2019s paternalistic,\u201d said Martha Dina Arguello, executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility-Los Angeles. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s a better idea not to let us know what\u2019s in our food.\u201d\n\nThe warnings are coming on line in California under the state\u2019s Proposition 65, a measure approved by voters in 1986 that requires businesses to notify the public about high levels of chemicals in products or places.\n\nCalifornia officials decided last year to add BPA, or bisphenol A, to the list of about 800 other chemicals requiring Proposition 65 notices. Manufacturers use BPA in epoxy liners of some cans, bottles and jars.\n\nThe state based its action on a 2008 finding by the National Toxicology Program, which determined the chemical was an estrogen-like substance that could harm the female reproductive system at high levels.\n\nThat 2015 decision by California is controversial. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned BPA from baby bottles and sippy cups in 2012, but it says the level of BPA that leeches into food is safe otherwise. The federal agency also is awaiting the results of more studies.\n\nOrdinarily, the state would either require manufacturers to put those warnings on the cans, or make grocers post signs on canned-goods shelves specifically warning that \u201cBrand X tomato sauce, Brand Y green beans\u201d have the targeted chemical in the can, said Allan Hirsch, chief deputy director of the state EPA\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.\n\nFor BPA, though, \u201cwe think that would be kind of chaotic,\u201d the state official said. \u201cRetailers might react \u2026 by just pulling canned and bottled foods off their shelves entirely,\u201d which would be bad news in neighborhoods without good grocery stores.\n\n\u201cWe would want to make sure that people, especially in low-income communities, still have access to canned fruits and vegetables. That\u2019s certainly better than not having access to them,\u201d the state official said.\n\nHirsch also acknowledged hearing \u201csome concern from retailers\u201d about how the warning is going to work.\n\nKathleen Roberts, executive director of the can industry\u2019s North American Metal Packaging Alliance, said Thursday that confusion \u201cfrom these warning signs could further limit healthy choices, particularly for low-income families in inner-city neighborhoods and rural communities.\u201d\n\nRather than require warnings for specific cans and other goods when the warning-requirement kicks in in May, the state plans to make merchants place general notices saying some cans for sale in the store have BPA.\n\nState officials foresee requiring more specific notices after perhaps a year. That would give can manufacturers more time to label their cans and to see what ongoing medical studies find regarding safe and unsafe levels of the chemicals, Hirsch said.\n\nIt\u2019s the state\u2019s arguments about BPA and canned vegetables in so-called food deserts \u2014 neighborhoods too poor to attract top grocery chains \u2014 that offend the community groups.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is willingly putting out the language \u2026 excluding a whole sub-population of people from protection,\u201d said Jose T. Bravo, executive director of Just Transition Alliance, an environmental health and labor coalition in San Diego.\n\nThe community representatives say they plan to file protests before a final decision by another state agency that approves such regulatory changes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California put off plans to place warnings about BPA on cans over concerns it would deter poor shoppers from buying canned fruits and veggies.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Delays BPA Warning So Low-Income People Won't Be Scared of Canned Food\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/24\\/california-delays-bpa-warning-so-poor-people-wont-be-scared-of-canned-food\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-24 15:31:54\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-24 19:47:00\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":164122,\"author_id\":\"11105\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Fine\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Fine\",\"tags\":[\"BPA\",\"Canned Veggies\",\"Cans\",\"Fruits\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Living Healthy\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/iStock_000021349948_Large-e1458856814708.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "California plans to delay state-required warnings on metal cans lined with the chemical BPA, arguing too-specific warnings could scare stores and shoppers in po", "title": "California Delays BPA Warning So Low-Income People Won\u2019t Be Scared of Canned Food", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/24/california-delays-bpa-warning-so-poor-people-wont-be-scared-of-canned-food/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/iStock_000021349948_Large-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "bpa,canned veggies,cans,fruits,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s the state\u2019s arguments about BPA and canned vegetables in so-called food deserts \u2014 neighborhoods too poor to attract top grocery chains \u2014 that offend the community groups.\n\u201cWe would want to make sure that people, especially in low-income communities, still have access to canned fruits and vegetables.\nCalifornia officials decided last year to add BPA, or bisphenol A, to the list of about 800 other chemicals requiring Proposition 65 notices.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned BPA from baby bottles and sippy cups in 2012, but it says the level of BPA that leeches into food is safe otherwise.\nThe decision and rationale of the California Environmental Protection Agency are angering some community and public-health groups."}
