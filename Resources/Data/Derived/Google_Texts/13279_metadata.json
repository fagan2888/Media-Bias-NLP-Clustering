Twice the eight-year-old refused to order, \u201cNot hungry.\u201d\n\nThen, on the way to brother\u2019s ball game, the little girl asked, \u201cMay I have some of your sandwich, Mommy?\u201d to which Shelly replied, \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n[pullquote]\n\nBefore she knew it, a sated Cindy gazed back in the rear-view mirror, having devoured all of the breakfast sandwich! But that meant no food for Mommy, for the duration of the Saturday morning little league game in the hot sun.\n\n\u201cCindy, I can\u2019t believe you just ate the whole thing! You knew it wasn\u2019t for you. You knew I was only sharing it with you! You said you didn\u2019t want one. Why wouldn\u2019t you leave some for it for me? It was my sandwich!\u201d\n\nBy the time Shelly pulled into my driveway, she was distraught, and not just because she was on a sugar low. She felt deeply conflicted for humiliating her daughter to make her point.\n\n\u201cOf course you should shame your children,\u201d I replied. \u201cThat is your job, as a responsible parent. Shame is one of our most useful tools! Shame is the barrier between decency and depravity in a moral society.\u201d\n\nWhen Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden, they \u201cwere both naked and were not ashamed.\u201d (Gen 2:25 ESV) Then they ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.\n\nFrom their (original) sin, they discovered shame; they clothed themselves \u2013 why? Because they felt ashamed, and that changed the way they looked. They blushed, and probably sweat, too.\n\nThey fashioned the grape leaves to cover not their nakedness, but their shame. After God received their confessions, he created garments for them and sent them (in shame) from the garden.\n\nMerriam-Webster defines shame as \u201ca painful emotion caused by the consciousness of guilt, shortcoming, or impropriety.\u201d It\u2019s also the susceptibility to having such an emotion. Shameless is the inability to feel disgrace, which describes many of our politicians these days.\n\nPresident Obama was not ashamed of having lied to the American people about their options under ObamaCare.\n\nHis shameless \u201capology\u201d stated, \u201cI am sorry that they, you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me.\u201d\n\nHe was not ashamed about the Benghazi deaths, which occurred on his \u2018watch\u2019, though, in truth, we don\u2019t know exactly what he was doing while the ambassador and three others burned. He did imply he was ashamed by a video he had no role in making.\n\nClearly, he misunderstands the word. He cannot be shamed into action, though people and pundits everywhere are calling for some answer to the Islamic State\u2019s genocide, Putin\u2019s military maneuvers, and the shameful situation at our southern border. Unashamed, he continues his vacation.\n\nBut he has also called for air strikes and humanitarian aid in Iraq, citing, in a New York Times interview, his lack of follow up in Libya as a lesson-learned.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a lesson that I now apply every time I ask the question, \u2018Should we intervene militarily?\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cDo we have an answer the day after?\u201d It\u2019s just great that he\u2019s getting on-the-job training, but notice that his hubris prevents a more open nod to the Bush doctrine of nation-building -- which he destroyed, in his haste to withdraw from Iraq, but now clearly espouses! And witness, no apology to all the Christians who are being starved or beheaded. Shameful.\n\nOur societal break with shame traces most clearly to the Clinton White House.\n\nBefore that, we had Watergate, a spying and lying tale resulting in the resignation of a president, Nixon, who valued the office of the presidency too much to bring the disgrace of impeachment upon it.\n\nNot so for Bill Clinton, who was not at all ashamed of his deplorable seduction of a young woman less than half his age.\n\nThe progressive women\u2019s movement lifted no voice against his predatory behavior because they supported him politically. Shameful.\n\nThen Clinton unabashedly lied directly to the American Public on TV. Impeachment, though inevitable, was unsuccessful, because the Senate was unwilling to shame the man they adored, despite his transgressions. Now he is one of the highest paid speakers in the country. Shameless.\n\nAfter years of claiming the troop withdrawal from Iraq as his great achievement, because it can now be seen as disastrous, Obama just changed his narrative and blamed Bush for it. \u201c\u2026 As if this was my decision.\u201d\n\nImmediately following that he blamed President Maliki as well. His blatant rejection of culpability speaks not to his sense of shame but lack thereof.\n\nThat Clinton\u2019s and also Obama\u2019s actions have demanded impeachment is clear, except that We the People have lost our ability to shame. We shun the very idea of it, perhaps because we all feel our own so vividly.\n\nJudge not, that you be not judged. 2For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. (Mat 7:1-2 ESV)\n\nAre we seeking so strongly not to be judged, that we refuse to judge others?\n\nRecently, we witnessed Rob Ford\u2019s brother defend the Toronto mayor\u2019s right to retain his seat despite his excessive illegal drug use, by pointing his finger at the parliament in Canada and accusing them of smoking pot. But is this redistribution of shame? Does our own shame mean we lose the right to shame others? In that case, there is no more right and wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s asymmetrical warfare, in that shame is used only on those who can feel it \u2013 but for the others, well, there is no amount of scorn they cannot withstand. They simply turn the finger back on those who would correct them. \u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d (Read, \u201cYou will not shame me!\u201d) And so good people are disarmed of our ability to defend what\u2019s right and condemn what\u2019s deplorable.\n\nHomer Simpson said, \u201cIt takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s even truer of shame. Former New York Congressman Anthony Wiener ought to be ashamed, but no. As a forgiving society, we\u2019ve given him a (snickering) pass \u2013 though he, thankfully, didn\u2019t get reelected. Yes, you shouldn\u2019t tweet your private parts, but haven\u2019t we all done something regrettable?\n\nBut (luckily) tweeting inappropriate photos isn\u2019t the same thing as taking some post-it notes from work. So good people ought not to allow themselves to be shamed into submission, just because they aren\u2019t perfect. If it\u2019s wrong, speak up, stand up, and if you are also guilty (of something, aren\u2019t we all?), handle that on your own time. Don\u2019t be a hypocrite, but don\u2019t be a cowardly doormat, either. Or worse, a sycophant, supportive of bad behavior for other rewards.\n\nIt is incumbent on a just society to shame those deserving of it. It is simple self-protection. We no longer have pillories, and the mainstream press clearly has no concept (witness the terrorist-graced Rolling Stone magazine), but therefore the moral society must make up the difference.\n\nShame on them if they don\u2019t.\n\nSam Sorbo, a former international model, is host of \"The Sam Sorbo Show,\"and author of \"The Answer: Proof of God in Heaven.\" She is an international fashion model, real estate developer, actress, wife, mother of three, writer, philosopher, photographer, hospital volunteer, and founder of TrueFeminist.com.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Values", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-01 07:33:16 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "\u201cOf course you should shame your children,\u201d I replied. \u201cThat is your job, as a responsible parent.
