Part of it is the pure eroticism of her lyrics. She doesn\u2019t need any four-letter words to make listeners - especially men - tremble with excitement to lyrics such as \u201dBaby, oh sweet baby: kiss me hard; make wonder who\u2019s in charge,\u201d from \u201cEssence,\u201d one of the familiar songs Williams crooned to the sold-out audience.\n\nWilliams\u2019 style is heavily influenced by Delta blues and her strong voice did poetic justice to a cover of Depression-era bluesman Skip James\u2019 \u201cHard Time Killing Floor Blues.\u201d Williams wasn\u2019t shy about political commentary, saying James\u2019 hard times lyrics were \u201cas relevant as ever\u201d today as the gap between rich and poor continues to widen.\n\nAlong those lines, Williams brought the crowd to its feet during her encore with a cover of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRocking in the Free World,\u201d a scathing critique of American inequality.\n\nOther favorites during the two-hour concert: \u201cDrunken Angel,\u201d a song written about deceased Texas musician Blaze Foley, and \u201cLake Charles\u201d which harkens back to Williams\u2019 birthplace in Louisiana.\n\nWilliams\u2019 band, as always was tight and her voice, as she recently told Rolling Stone Magazine, is \u201cthe best it\u2019s ever been.\u201d The adoring crowd, heavy in the Baby Boomer demographic, clapped and whooped its approval.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 24 May 2014 21:50:32 -0400", "Description": "No one sings as powerfully and honestly about heartbreak as Lucinda Williams.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "No one sings as powerfully and honestly about heartbreak as Lucinda Williams.", "title": "Lucinda Williams keeps outlaw country alive", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/lucinda-williams-keeps-outlaw-country-alive-20140524/", "image": {"width": 1993, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140524/ARTICLE/140529503/AR/0/AR-140529503.jpg", "height": 1324}, "updated_time": "2014-05-25T11:32:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "No one sings as powerfully and honestly about heartbreak as Lucinda Williams.", "title": "Lucinda Williams keeps outlaw country alive", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140524/ARTICLE/140529503/AR/0/AR-140529503.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-05-24T21:50:32Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-05-25T11:32:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Capitol Theatre,Clearwater,concert,Lucinda Williams,review"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5f9\"", "article_summary": "No one sings as powerfully and honestly about heartbreak as Lucinda Williams.\nThe 61-year-old Williams, dressed in her familiar black shirt and jeans, pleased longtime fans by mixing standards off her Grammy winning, \u201cCar Wheels on a Gravel Road,\u201d and the 1988 self-titled, \u201cLucinda Williams,\u201d re-released last year, with new songs for an album coming out in the fall.\nShe didn\u2019t disappoint in that regard Saturday night as the three-time Grammy-award winner brought her kick-butt, country-blue-rock fusion to the Capitol Theater in Clearwater.\nOther favorites during the two-hour concert: \u201cDrunken Angel,\u201d a song written about deceased Texas musician Blaze Foley, and \u201cLake Charles\u201d which harkens back to Williams\u2019 birthplace in Louisiana.\nAlong those lines, Williams brought the crowd to its feet during her encore with a cover of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRocking in the Free World,\u201d a scathing critique of American inequality."}
