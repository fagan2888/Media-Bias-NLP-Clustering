They've managed to get the attention of Shakira, one of the biggest pop stars in the world:\n\nThe video she retweeted is a saucy take on her hit \"Hips Don't Lie\" by the Oxford University a cappella group Out of the Blue. The single from the group's album Soul Sisters benefits Helen & Douglas House, a children's hospice in the U.K.\n\nTwo of the group's members, Ollie Nicholls and Marco Alessi, spoke with NPR's Scott Simon about their sudden worldwide fame, how they put together their dance moves, and some of the other artists they've covered.\n\nClick on the audio link above to hear the full conversation, plus a snippet of one of their favorite covers, a \"choral-esque\" version of Simon and Garfunkel's \"The Sound of Silence.\"\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 NPR.
