Building cranes are again a common sight in and near the centers of Minneapolis, St. Paul and other Minnesota cities. But evidence of an improving economy is harder to see at ground level in places where homeless people spend their days and nights. Homelessness remains a visible problem.\n\nDocumenting the extent of that problem has been the work of the research arm of the St. Paul-based Wilder Foundation at three-year intervals since 1991. Its latest analysis, based on a count taken on Oct. 25, 2012, was released this week. It confirmed the impression one acquires on Minnesota streets: Homelessness did not decline as the economy improved between 2009 and 2012. To the contrary, it grew by 6 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s a slower pace of growth than the 25 percent jump that Wilder Research found from 2006 to 2009, when the full force of the recession swept thousands of people out of their homes. But any growth in homelessness since 2009, during what was otherwise a period of recovery, should not sit well with Minnesotans in general and public policymakers in particular. At some point in the last year, 40,000 Minnesotans were homeless, with 14,000 people in such circumstances on a typical night, Wilder projects. About half of the state\u2019s homeless people are children under age 17, with the fastest growth in numbers seen among families with young children.\n\nClearly, recovery has not reached those at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. Their distress not only depletes their own resources but drains public ones as well. A public policy push to house them would benefit everyone.\n\nGrowing homelessness between 2009 and 2012 could be chalked up to the tendency of all recessions to hit the poor first, hardest and longest. But in a blog post, Wilder study directors Greg Owen and Michelle Decker Gerrard suggest that blaming the recession alone for still-growing homelessness is too simplistic. They cite these additional factors behind the increase:\n\n\u2022 An insufficient supply of affordable housing. By that, Owen and Gerrard mean housing subsidized by the nonprofit and/or public sectors. The private housing market isn\u2019t working for the homeless. The numbers explain: In the Twin Cities, the median monthly income of homeless adults last year was $381, while fair market rent for a one-bedroom apartment was nearly twice as much at $745.\n\nWho\u2019s homeless? The federal government says you\u2019re homeless if you: \u2022 Sleep in an emergency shelter, transitional housing or a place not meant for human habitation. \u2022 Are scheduled to lose your primary nighttime residence within 14 days and lack funds or connections to find a new place. \u2022 Are fleeing domestic violence with no permanent place to go. \u2022 Are a family with dependent children residing in a place without a lease or ownership stake for at least 60 days. National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2012.\n\nAverage waiting time on lists for subsidized housing is one year, with 15 percent of homeless people reporting that when they tried to be placed on a waiting list, they were denied. Since that finding, the federal sequester has further depleted Section 8 housing subsidies, Gerrard said Tuesday. \u201cIt might well be worse now,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2022 More mental and physical disability. Owen and Gerrard report \u201cmeasurable increases in the level of distress in the population\u201d since Wilder\u2019s first count in 1991. One-third of the 2012 homeless adults reported diminished cognitive ability; half said they suffer from a mental or physical disorder. Among those deemed long-term homeless, a whopping 60 percent suffer from mental illnesses.\n\nImproved access to health care, courtesy of the federal Affordable Care Act, could prove to be an important tool to combat homelessness, Gerrard said. That\u2019s one more reason to resist GOP efforts to undo Obamacare.\n\n\u2022 Inadequate help for homeless youth. About three out of five homeless youth are former residents of foster or group homes. Their transition to independence can be perilous, Owen and Gerrard attest. \u201cYouth on their own have the fewest services available to them,\u201d they said, with shelters and other services for homeless adults often ill-suited to the needs of 16-21-year-olds. That\u2019s a gap that public policymakers should attempt to fill. The 2013 Legislature provided $4 million in response to an $8 million request from a coalition of nonprofits serving homeless youth. Meeting the rest of that request should have a high priority as an improving economy refills state coffers.\n\nTo its credit, the Dayton administration is paying attention. Cathy ten Broeke, state director to prevent and end homelessness, has convened an interagency council to coordinate efforts to tackle the problem. It is expected to develop recommendations in time for the 2014 legislative session.\n\nTen Broeke notes that Minnesota efforts to end long-term homelessness, particularly among veterans, have produced considerable success. The size of that population has been shrinking in recent years \u2014 only to be surpassed by growing numbers of families with children who cannot afford a regular roof over their heads. \u201cWhat\u2019s so striking is the constantly growing divide between incomes decreasing and housing costs rising,\u201d she said.\n\nHomelessness isn\u2019t just about the economy. But an economy \u2014 or a minimum wage \u2014 that boosted low-end wages would help.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A scan of Minnesota skylines confirms that the economy is improving.", "title": "Homelessness grows along with Minnesota's economy", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/homelessness-grows-along-with-minnesota-s-economy/226981901/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138127394775899.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138127394775899.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A scan of Minnesota skylines confirms that the economy is improving.", "title": "Homelessness grows along with Minnesota's economy", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/homelessness-grows-along-with-minnesota-s-economy/226981901/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138127394775899.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_138127394775899.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A scan of Minnesota skylines confirms that the economy is improving."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec42\"", "article_summary": "Improved access to health care, courtesy of the federal Affordable Care Act, could prove to be an important tool to combat homelessness, Gerrard said.\nIt confirmed the impression one acquires on Minnesota streets: Homelessness did not decline as the economy improved between 2009 and 2012.\nThe 2013 Legislature provided $4 million in response to an $8 million request from a coalition of nonprofits serving homeless youth.\nAbout three out of five homeless youth are former residents of foster or group homes.\nHomelessness isn\u2019t just about the economy."}
