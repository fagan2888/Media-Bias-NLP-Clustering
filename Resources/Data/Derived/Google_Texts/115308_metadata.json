They could not entirely ignore us because our criticism was on target.\n\nLike many other people with HIV, I felt betrayed by Clinton, because I\u2019d believed him during his campaign when he told my ACT UP colleague Bob Rafsky, \u201cI feel your pain.\u201d The pride I once felt at having been the first LGBT community publisher to endorse his campaign turned to regret when it became apparent that his promises were empty.\n\nIn our third issue, in August 1994, we published a feature on the fifty most important AIDS policy leaders in the United States. Kristine Gebbie, Clinton\u2019s rubber-stamp AIDS czar, had recently resigned after accomplishing virtually nothing. \u201cThere was near unanimity among people we consulted that Gebbie should not be on the list,\u201d I wrote in my column. \u201cThe board chairperson of one AIDS research group told me \u2018including her would totally invalidate the credibility of this project. She is a laughingstock and not taken seriously by anyone working in AIDS whose judgment I respect.\u2019 \u201d\n\n*\n\nBob Hattoy was working in the White House, and we spoke several times a week. When POZ had inside information on the Clinton administration, it was usually Hattoy who had given us the tip. After the column on Gebbie came out, he cackled with glee, telling me, \u201cCopies of POZ are sitting on every desk in the West Wing. They. Are. Pissed. I told them I couldn\u2019t control what you write. But this is good; now they\u2019re paying attention.\u201d\n\nThat was the issue featuring Pedro Zamora on the cover. He was a handsome young Cuban-American who publicly chronicled his battle with AIDS on \u201cThe Real World.\u201d When Pedro died, the White House revealed that President Clinton had personally telephoned Pedro in his last days. Donna Shalala, whose record on AIDS as Clinton\u2019s health and human services secretary was especially egregious, was quoted as saying, \u201cI love Pedro.\u201d\n\nMost of the media, including the LGBT media, dutifully published the spin, but in my December 1994 column, I wrote, \u201cIf Shalala really \u2018loves Pedro\u2019 as she claims, she will kick some butt at the FDA, CDC, and NIH\u2014all agencies under her supervision\u2014to cut the red tape, expedite new treatments, dramatically increase anonymous testing, reempower the Office on Alternative Health and increase funding for prevention and care.\u201d\n\nHattoy said their political cowardice stemmed in part from the gays-in-the-military debacle. It made Clinton\u2019s top advisers skittish about anything to do with gay issues\u2014as AIDS was then seen\u2014so inaction was the default strategy.\n\nAfter the December column, Hattoy asked that I use Xavier\u2019s name instead of my own when calling him at the White House. If his coworkers knew he was communicating with POZ, it could jeopardize his job.\n\nThough Clinton\u2019s top aides were looking for an excuse to fire Hattoy, his personal friendship with the Clintons protected him, as well as his AIDS diagnosis. \u201cThe White House boys all thought I was going to die and nobody wanted to be the guy who fired the dying guy with AIDS,\u201d Hattoy said.\n\nAfter Bob committed several well-publicized gaffes (\u201cgaffe\u201d is Washingtonspeak for when a politician tells the truth), he was pushed out of the White House to a liaison position at the Department of the Interior. He was prohibited from providing quotes to any member of media without prior approval.\n\nHiding Hattoy didn\u2019t change anything concerning the administration\u2019s response to AIDS. Vincent Gagliostro, part of the art collective that created the \u201cSilence=Death\u201d image, created a poster for the inside back cover of the April 1995 issue that expressed the community\u2019s dismay over Washington\u2019s response to the epidemic. It was a black-and-white photograph of Clinton and Newt Gingrich with big guffawing smiles on their faces, two good old boys sharing a big joke. Vincent added a transparent red stripe across their smiles; the caption above read, \u201cWIPE THAT SMILE OFF YOUR FACE,\u201d and below, \u201cAIDS IS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.\u201d\n\n*\n\nThere was no AIDS issue during the Clinton years that was more pressing than lifting the ban on the use of federal money to fund needle-exchange programs. There was ample proof that such programs dramatically reduced HIV transmission; conversely, there was no evidence showing that they increased drug use. They were a key part of HIV-prevention strategies in many countries.\n\nEarly in the Clinton administration, Secretary Shalala passed the authority to lift the ban to Jocelyn Elders, the fearless surgeon general who later was forced to resign when she spoke frankly about sex education in schools. After the Republicans swept the 1994 congressional elections, Elders\u2019s authority to take unilateral action reverted back to Shalala, who refused to lift the ban. When research showed a dramatic increase in young girls and women acquiring HIV through sex with older drug-injecting men, we laid the blame at Shalala\u2019s feet. These were infections that might have been prevented with needle-exchange programs. We started keeping track of \u201cShalala Infections,\u201d running a box in every issue tallying the climbing number of new infections that we calculated had resulted from her failure to lift the ban.\n\nShalala downplayed reports from the CDC that supported lifting the ban, misrepresented research findings, and questioned whether needle-exchange reduced transmission or increased drug use, contrary to the evidence. I called her out in harsh terms, labeling her failure to lift the ban an \u201cact of genocidal neglect . . . pathetic, if not criminal,\u201d and quoted Elizabeth Taylor, who said the U.S. government\u2019s failure to fund needle-exchange programs amounted to \u201ca measured act of premeditated murder.\u201d\n\nOur needle-exchange campaign benefited from Larry Kramer\u2019s brash rhetoric. POZ\u2019s first anniversary issue, in May 1995, featured Kramer on the cover, interviewed by Andrew Sullivan, then the editor of The New Republic and a prominent gay Catholic leader of the neoconservative movement.\n\nI had a hunch that Andrew was HIV-positive\u2014which was why I wanted him to interview Kramer\u2014but he didn\u2019t disclose his HIV-positive status to Larry, me, or our readers. In the interview, he and Kramer discussed the nature of evil. Larry said, \u201cI think that because he [Anthony Fauci] has not done what he was capable of doing, [it] opens him up to very acceptable charges of evil. I certainly think Donna Shalala is evil. Evil, evil, evil.\u201d Larry\u2019s comment was as a perfect pull quote and we ran it on the center spread, in stark white type, against an ominous Albert Watson portrait of Kramer.\n\nIt got the attention of C-SPAN when they invited me to their studio to discuss the magazine\u2019s first anniversary. At the time, KS lesions were starting to appear on my neck and face. When I was in the greenroom, the producer asked if I wanted makeup. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. It was a small black-box studio, with the interviewer and me seated at a table surrounded by black curtains. I didn\u2019t notice the cameras, nearly invisible in the folds of the curtains.\n\nWhen the interviewer held up the page with Larry\u2019s quote and asked about his comment, I explained Shalala\u2019s various failures and argued that part of her reluctance was \u201cbecause . . . as a closeted lesbian, she goes that extra mile to say \u2018my personal life isn\u2019t impacting these decisions.\u2019\u201d Then I caught myself and said, \u201cYou probably won\u2019t air this.\u201d\n\nAfter the interview, I said to the producer, \u201cYou can edit that out,\u201d explaining that I\u2019d forgotten about the camera and hadn\u2019t intended to out Shalala (who denied she was a lesbian). He replied, \u201cThis is C-SPAN. We run interviews as they are, we don\u2019t edit them. This will air on Thursday.\u201d My heart started pounding in anticipation of the broadcast. I was worried that Jean O\u2019Leary, who told me Shalala was a lesbian, would be upset with me. Before I left the studio, they gave me a VCR tape of the interview. When I met Xavier in the greenroom, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here. You\u2019ll never believe what I just said on camera.\u201d\n\nLater that day, I told Hattoy what had happened. He laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t know you anymore.\u201d That evening we spoke again, and he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to tell Victor [Zonana, Shalala\u2019s openly gay press secretary], and boy, was he freaked out!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On AIDS, marriage and more, the record is sadly one of fear, cowardice and inaction", "title": "Bill Clinton\u2019s LGBT shame: Where was he then?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "On AIDS, marriage and more, the record is sadly one of fear, cowardice and inaction", "title": "Bill Clinton\u2019s LGBT shame: Where was he then?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/01/bill_clintons_lgbt_shame_where_was_he_then/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/bill_clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On AIDS, marriage and more, the record is sadly one of fear, cowardice and inaction", "title": "Bill Clinton\u2019s LGBT shame: Where was he then?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/bill_clinton.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Strub", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AIDS, Books, Editor's Picks, LGBT, monica lewinsky", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9057\"", "article_summary": "Evil, evil, evil.\u201d Larry\u2019s comment was as a perfect pull quote and we ran it on the center spread, in stark white type, against an ominous Albert Watson portrait of Kramer.\nYou\u2019ll never believe what I just said on camera.\u201dLater that day, I told Hattoy what had happened.\nAfter the December column, Hattoy asked that I use Xavier\u2019s name instead of my own when calling him at the White House.\nThough Clinton\u2019s top aides were looking for an excuse to fire Hattoy, his personal friendship with the Clintons protected him, as well as his AIDS diagnosis.\n\u201cThe White House boys all thought I was going to die and nobody wanted to be the guy who fired the dying guy with AIDS,\u201d Hattoy said."}
