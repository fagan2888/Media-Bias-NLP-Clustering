Tim Murphy, who leads the House Oversight Committee\u2019s health subpanel, on Tuesday slammed the administration for repeatedly opposing policies that have been adopted by \u201crespected institutions,\u201d such as the U.S. military.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for the American people to understand why the government would have one standard for the military and yet another standard for people who may have been in the same, or possibly more perilous, circumstances,\u201d Murphy said at the hearing, which marks the first held by the House Oversight Committee in more than a month.\n\nRep.

Health officials have shifted their stance on both issues in the wake of the Ebola infections in Dallas.\n\nRep.
