(AP Photo)\n\n(CNSNews.com) - Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) criticized the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare, at a congressional hearing on Wednesday, saying \u201cpremiums are going up\u201d and explaining how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) has proposed premium hikes of 10 percent or more in 2016.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut look at the facts: premiums are going up. Emergency room use is rising. Co-ops are failing. There\u2019s certainly a wave of evidence, and it\u2019s definitely pointing to one clear conclusion: Obamacare is not working,\" said Roskam at the House Ways and Means Committee hearing on \u201cRising Health Insurance Premiums Under Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\"Now, for the first time since the ACA became law, insurers are able to look at a full year\u2019s worth of claims data to calculate premium prices for the year ahead,\u201d said Roskam. \u201cThe proposed premium hikes tell us a lot about how much health care cost last year and what insurers calculate health care will cost this next year. On June 1, CMS made public proposed premium hikes of 10 percent or more for the 2016 plan year, and many of the proposed increases are eye-poppingly huge.\n\n\n\n\"For five years, the Obama administration insisted that the law would reduce health care costs,\u201d said the congressman. \u201cPresident Obama said, 'We can cut the average family\u2019s premium by about $2,500 a year.' The nonpartisan fact checker Politifact called that a 'broken promise.' President Obama pledged that insurance premiums 'will go down.'\n\n\n\nIn fact, we\u2019re five years in, and health insurance costs under Obamacare aren\u2019t going down\u2014they\u2019re going up,\u201d he said. Roskam explained how different states such as Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee and South Dakota have seen costs climb.\n\n\n\n\"In Maryland, CareFirst Blue Choice, which covers approximately 80 percent of the individual market, has asked for an average increase of nearly 30 percent. In Missouri, Coventry Health has requested an increase of 22.7 percent. In North Carolina, Blue Cross Blue Shield has asked for an increase of 25.7 percent. In Tennessee, Blue Cross Blue Shield has asked for an increase of 36.3 percent. In South Dakota, one of the largest insurers, Wellmark, has asked for premium hikes between 24 percent and 51.5 percent.\u201d\n\n\n\nProponents of the ACA say that it has improved the uninsured rate and rates have not increased.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m happy to report that our state\u2019s uninsured rate is at 8.5 percent - representing a drop of almost 40 percent since the Affordable Care Act took effect and the lowest rate we\u2019ve seen since at least 1987,\u201d said Mike Kreidler, Washington state\u2019s insurance commissioner, who testified at the hearing. \u201cWe have not seen premiums soar. In fact, we\u2019re experiencing record low rate requests, and in most cases, approving even lower rates.\u201d\n\n\n\nRep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) disagreed, saying that costs have increased in his state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president campaigned aggressively on the promise to lower out-of-pocket expenses for families by roughly $2,500 a year. However, insurers that cover my constituents just in the last two years we\u2019ve seen an increase by one insurance provider 22.9 percent in 2014,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis year, they\u2019ve requested an additional 22.7 percent increase because of the one-size-fits-all approach under Obamacare of all the different burdens and regulations, rules, everything that's coming into place, but in my opinion, this administration cannot continue to believe that Obamacare will reduce costs for families and individuals,\u201d said Smith.\n\n\n\n\u201cThroughout my district that\u2019s not what I\u2019m hearing back home. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t believe is a reality, but the families in my district need a health care system with more choice, more access, and that\u2019s more affordable, but what I seem to be reading on a daily basis is that instead of more choices, we are getting fewer,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Rep.
