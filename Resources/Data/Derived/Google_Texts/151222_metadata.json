For innovative sectors that work with new technologies, processes and markets, an agile new jurisdiction with a unique, rapid customization capacity.\n\n-- A durable and transparent investment regime secured by a strong law, guaranteed by a constitutional amendment, reinforced by an international treaty, and further protected by international trade agreements including CAFTA and others.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Libertarians the world over have had their eye on Honduras as it experiments with the notion of special economic zones that allow great liberty in some", "title": "Honduran Government Hypes Its New \"Free Zones\" with New President", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/27/honduran-government-hypes-its-new", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_01/-58.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_01/-58.jpg", "description": "Libertarians the world over have had their eye on Honduras as it\nexperiments with the notion of special economic zones that allow\ngreat liberty in some respects than the rest of the nation.\n\nOver the weekend the administration of new president Juan\nOrlando Hernandez \nissued a press release hyping them.\nFrom the release:\n\nInnovative \"Zon", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Honduran Government Hypes Its New \"Free Zones\" with New President"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "World", "published_time": "2014-01-27T16:31:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Libertarians the world over have had their eye on Honduras as it experiments with the notion of special economic zones that allow great liberty in some respects than the rest of the nation.\nFrom the release:Innovative \"Zones for Economic Development and Employment\" (ZEDE) are designed to be the most competitive new jurisdictions in the CAFTA space.\nOver the weekend the administration of new president Juan Orlando Hernandez issued a press release hyping them.\n-- A durable and transparent investment regime secured by a strong law, guaranteed by a constitutional amendment, reinforced by an international treaty, and further protected by international trade agreements including CAFTA and others.\nFor innovative sectors that work with new technologies, processes and markets, an agile new jurisdiction with a unique, rapid customization capacity."}
