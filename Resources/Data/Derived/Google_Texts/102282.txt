Pima County, Arizona — employer of some 3,000 workers — could be on course to refusing to hire smokers. And smoking employees may face a steep surcharge for their health coverage if they don’t kick the habit.

The county, which includes Tucson and has a population of nearly 1 million, already has a strict non-smoking policy. Its county benefits plan offers smokers — about 1,000 of whom work for the county — various smoking diversion programs. Now, a county administrator wants to take the anti-smoking sentiment to the next level and include the no-hire clause in the county’s employment policy.
