(Alexander Cohn/for New York Daily News)\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, if I\u2019d been leading this movement, I would have started with the home health care aides, because so many people rely on them to care for their families, they trust them and when they learn what they make, they are shocked,\u201d he said.\n\nGresham, whose mother was a home care aide, said he was heartened to see the historically insular construction trades had joined the Fight for $15 movement.\n\nNew York Daily News \"Fight for Fair Pay Campaign\" logo\n\n\u201cTheir voice broadens the discussion and we\u2019re happy to march alongside them,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are about 150,000 home health care aides in the city \u2014 most of them women, and predominantly women of color. Of those, 80,000 are in 1199 SEIU.\n\nAlong with their higher wages, 1199 home care workers who clock at least 100 hours a month also are eligible for health insurance.\n\nThe nonunion aides get lower pay and no benefits \u2014 in one of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing industries.\n\n\u201cOur sign for this march says \u2018Invisible No More,\u2019 \u201d Gresham said. \u201cWe\u2019re marching with union and nonunion health aides (because) so many of us rely on or are going to rely on the care these workers provide. We can\u2019t ignore that they have needs, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "Ginger Adams Otis", "twitter": {"description": "About 70,000 nonunion health care workers earn minimum wage, which until recently was $8 an hour.", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Home health workers join \u2018Fight for $15\u2019 pay war", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-home-health-workers-join-fight-15-pay-war-article-1.2183024", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2183023.1428896840!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health13n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "fight for 15, minimum wage, fair pay, new york minimum wage, new york fair pay,", "parsely-author": "Ginger Adams Otis", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "fight for 15, minimum wage, fair pay, new york minimum wage, new york fair pay,", "news_keywords": "fight for 15, minimum wage, fair pay, new york minimum wage, new york fair pay,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-home-health-workers-join-fight-15-pay-war-article-1.2183024", "parsely-title": "EXCLUSIVE: Home health workers join \u2018Fight for $15\u2019 pay war", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-13T02:30:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "EXCLUSIVE: Home health workers join \u2018Fight for $15\u2019 pay war", "nydn_section": "New York", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-13T06:30:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2183023.1428896840!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health13n-1-web.jpg", "description": "About 70,000 nonunion health care workers earn minimum wage, which until recently was $8 an hour.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "New York", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "About 70,000 nonunion health care workers earn minimum wage, which until recently was $8 an hour.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "About 70,000 nonunion health care workers earn minimum wage, which until recently was $8 an hour.", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Home health workers join \u2018Fight for $15\u2019 pay war", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-home-health-workers-join-fight-15-pay-war-article-1.2183024", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2183023.1428896840!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health13n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Ginger Adams Otis", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2183023.1428896840!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health13n-1-web.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd291e\"", "article_summary": "There are about 150,000 home health care aides in the city \u2014 most of them women, and predominantly women of color.\nGeorge Gresham, president of the SEIU 1199 health care workers union, is bringing workers into the Fight for $15, a national movement to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nNow, she\u2019s one of the 80,000 unionized city home health aides who make $10 \u2014 but another 70,000 nonunion health care workers earn minimum wage, which until recently was $8 an hour.\nAlong with their higher wages, 1199 home care workers who clock at least 100 hours a month also are eligible for health insurance.\n\u201cWe\u2019re marching with union and nonunion health aides (because) so many of us rely on or are going to rely on the care these workers provide."}
