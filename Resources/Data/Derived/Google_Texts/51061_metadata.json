The video showed SNL player Taran Killam dressed as Republican House Speaker John Boehner, and Cyrus as Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, partying hard, and symbolically having their way with Uncle Sam, while Barack Obama (played by Jay Pharoah) looked on uninvolved and forlorn, locked outside this very unpatriotic house party.\n\nGiven that much of the shutdown is about public relations, one has to wonder if even a silly thing like an \u201cSNL\u201d parody might have some real-world effect, if Republican lawmakers get the sense that mainstream outlets are singling them out for ridicule. In a \u201cWeekend Update\u201d piece on the show, Boenher and the G.O.P. were both labelled \u201closer.\u201d (So was the Affordable Care Act website\u2013only because of reports of glitches due to too much demand for Obamacare.)\n\nWatch the best clips from last night\u2019s SNL.
