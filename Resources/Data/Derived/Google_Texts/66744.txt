EVIAN-LES-BAINS, France (AP) — Going up against a seven-time major winner more than twice her age, it was teenager Hyo-Joo Kim who showed the calm nerves of a veteran.

Kim came from a shot back on the last hole to beat Australian great Karrie Webb by one shot on Sunday and win the Evian Championship, becoming the third youngest major winner at 19 years, 2 months.

The South Korean trailed the 39-year-old Webb heading into the 18th but turned the tables with a birdie from 12 feet out. Webb then missed a chance to force a playoff when a difficult attempt for par from the same distance drifted left of the hole.

“I feel very happy, like a bird,” Kim said through a translator. “I want to fly in the sky.”

Kim led Webb by one shot overnight and they both posted 3-under rounds of 68 in perfect conditions, with no clouds or wind to disrupt them.

She finished on 11-under 273 overall, having shot the lowest ever round in a major with a 61 on Thursday.

Webb, meanwhile, was looking to win her eighth career major and first since Kraft Nabisco in 2006.

“I believe in fate a little bit, and I wasn’t meant to win,” Webb said. “I hit a lot of good putts this week. Probably the one on the last was the poorest I hit all week.”

Only Morgan Pressel and Lexi Thompson — both from the U.S. — have won majors at a younger age than Kim, who is studying physical education in Seoul.

She seemed to take it all in her stride.

When Webb’s putt rolled wide, Kim removed her glasses slowly and then walked up to give Webb a small hug.

Her caddie, Gordon Rowan, said Kim didn’t know she’d won at first.

“I don’t think she was aware of the real situation of the scores,” Rowan said. “I said ‘You’ve won. She said ‘No, no, I haven’t,’ which was quite sweet.”

Kim and Rowan were paired randomly the last time she played Evian, tying for fourth in 2012 — the final year before Evian became the fifth major. It’s a partnership that has flourished since.
