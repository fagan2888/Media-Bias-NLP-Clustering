The CEO deflected the questions with the responses like \u201cwe\u2019re looking into that\u201d and \u201cthat is part of our investigation.\u201d\n\nAs the questioning continued, Barra took even more drastic measures to avoid answering, even restarting the new GM and trying to roll away in her chair.\n\nSadly, the SNL cold open skit is relatively accurate. In the hearing on Tuesday, the CEO of GM didn\u2019t provide the panel of Representatives with many answers, especially in regard to the long period of time \u2014 10 years \u2014 between when the ignition problem was evident and when the company took action to address the issue.\n\nBy the end of the fake SNL hearing, no real questions were answered, and the case had gone virtually nowhere. Sounds about right.\n\nWatch below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "This week\u2019s Saturday Night Live mocked General Motors CEO Mary Barra during her hearing on Capitol Hill, portraying her as someone who knows nothing about anything in regard to the auto manufacturer.", "title": "'SNL' blasts GM CEO in congressional hearing skit - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/SNL-GM-Hearing-skit-600x375.png", "height": 375}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/04/06/snl-blasts-congressional-hearings-gm-ceo-skit/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "snl-gm-skit", "published_time": "2014-04-06T12:41:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-07T09:25:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "By the end of the fake SNL hearing, no real questions were answered, and the case had gone virtually nowhere.\nBut as the members of Congress began to ask Barra questions, that \u201chonesty and transparency\u201d didn\u2019t hold up.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you why it took GM so long to address this safety issue, but I promise we are investigating the matter fully because I represent the new GM, and the new GM is all about honesty and transparency,\u201d she said.\nThis week\u2019s Saturday Night Live mocked General Motors CEO Mary Barra during her hearing on Capitol Hill, portraying her as someone who knows nothing about anything in regard to the auto manufacturer.\nIn the hearing about the GM ignition switch problem linked to multiple deaths, faux Barra \u2014 played by Kate McKinnon \u2014 began pleading her case by apologizing to those affected, stressing that the old guard is out and a new GM has arrived."}
