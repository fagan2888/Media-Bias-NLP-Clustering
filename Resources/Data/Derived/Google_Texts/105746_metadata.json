Rick Scott had not piled nearly $6 million into his independent political committee during the same month.\n\nCrist\u2019s backers say his fundraising total is unprecedented for a Democrat or for a challenger to a sitting Florida governor and should answer questions about whether Crist can raise money as a Democrat as effectively as when he was a Republican.\n\nMeanwhile, on the same day that Crist filed his campaign finance report, Scott filed papers with the state Division of Elections officially forming his re-election campaign.\n\nScott has been actively fundraising for months for his re-election, but not through a formal campaign committee. Instead, he\u2019s been raising money for his independent committee, Let\u2019s Get to Work.\n\nDetails from the contributions records make it appear Scott pulled out all the stops to show a big fundraising total for the month of November, a total sure to get attention because of Crist\u2019s entry into the race and first campaign finance report.\n\nBut a Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman said it was \u201cpurely coincidental\u201d that Scott filed his re-election papers on the same day Crist\u2019s first fundraising total was due, and showed a big contribution total for November.\n\n\u201cWhat Charlie decides to do doesn\u2019t affect our plans,\u201d said spokeswoman Susan Hepworth.\n\nCrist\u2019s $3 million total is for both his own independent committee, Charlie Crist For Florida, which raised $2.2 million, and his campaign committee, which reported raising about $800,000 in the same period.\n\nBoth independent committees have been reporting their contributions on their web sites, but Crist\u2019s fundraising for his campaign wasn\u2019t available until the filing deadline Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled to announce that ... we raised about 3 million dollars in just over three weeks,\u201d Crist said in an email to supporters. \u201cWhile Rick Scott shakes down a few gigantic special interests, I will continue to be inspired by you, the people.\u201d\n\nCrist \u201cseems to be setting records for a Democrat running for governor,\u201d said Fort Lauderdale lawyer Mitchell Berger, a veteran Democratic political fundraiser and Crist backer. \u201cHis numbers for this month are better than we used to do in a quarter\u201d in previous races for governor.\n\nThe money for Crist\u2019s independent campaign committee was heavily weighted with contributions from lawyers and law firms.\n\nHowever, Berger noted, it didn\u2019t include a contribution from Crist\u2019s employer John Morgan, prominent Orlando trial lawyer of the Morgan & Morgan law firm. Morgan, one of Crist\u2019s staunchest supporters, who\u2019s known for large political and charitable contributions, hasn\u2019t yet contributed to Charlie Crist for Florida or held a fundraiser but is widely expected to make a large contribution.\n\nScott\u2019s independent committee, Let\u2019s Get to Work, is the vehicle he used for most of the roughly $74 million of his personal fortune he spent during his 2010 campaign.\n\nIts November fundraising total of about $5.9 million is more than Let\u2019s Get to Work has ever previously reported during even a three-month finance reporting period, except for its first report during Scott\u2019s 2010 campaign, which showed $8 million coming from Scott\u2019s wife\u2019s trust fund.\n\nScott\u2019s 2010 spending eclipsed all previous Florida governor\u2019s races, but Scott and his political allies have said he may outdo it in the coming year, spending up to $100 million.\n\nScott\u2019s November fundraising total is increased by heavy contributions from industries Crist has battled in the past \u2013 big sugar and utilities \u2013 and by a contribution of $1 million from Miguel Fernandez, a Miami health insurance magnate.\n\nScott, an ardent opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d became wealthy as head of a chain of hospitals. Fernandez couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on his contribution.\n\nAmong Scott contributors:\n\n* Florida Crystals, $500,000. The company had already given $150,000 earlier in the year, along with U.S. Sugar, which had given $300,000.\n\n* St. Petersburg developer Bill Edwards, $500,000.\n\n* The Florida Chamber of Commerce, $350,000\n\n* Florida Power & Light and Progress Energy, $250,000 each. Crist has battled utilities over rates for much of his political career.\n\n* The Geo Group, a private prison firm, and its inmate health care affiliate, $150,000.\n\n* Lawrence DeGeorge, Jupiter businessman, $500,000.\n\nIn addition, Scott reported dozens of contributions of $10,000 to $50,000.\n\nScott\u2019s committee has raised $19.8 million so far this year.\n\nCrist\u2019s committee bulked up its total with contributions including the following:\n\n* $345,000 from Floridians for Fairness, a Tampa-based political action committee heavily funded by law firms and health care companies.\n\n* $250,000 from the Grossman Roth law firm of Coral Gables.\n\n* $100,000 from Coral Gables lawyer William Haggard.\n\n* $100,000 from Coral Gables investor Bruce Berkowitz.\n\nwmarch@tampatrib.com\n\n813-259-7761", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Tue, 10 Dec 2013 17:34:26 -0400", "Description": "Charlie Crist raised $3 million in campaign money in his first month as a candidate for governor, a total that would be remarkable if it weren\u2019t for Gov.
