(Photo: Special to the Register )\n\nThere\u2019s much attention and excitement in central Iowa around the Nov. 4 elections.\n\nOne local race that should not get lost in the shuffle is the Broadlawns Medical Center board of trustees. While in the past it\u2019s sometimes been hard even to find candidates for these positions, this year there are six people running for just two seats. The outcome definitely matters to central Iowans who pay property taxes.\n\nFor background, Broadlawns is a publicly owned \u201csafety net\u201d hospital responsible for providing care to any resident of Polk County, free of charge if necessary. Broadlawns receives about $57 million in support from property taxpayers in Polk County each year to cover charity care, making it the fourth highest supported public entity in Polk County.\n\nBroadlawns is not part of Polk County government. Rather it is governed by its own independently elected board of trustees.\n\nBroadlawns Medical Center was formerly considered the \u201ccounty hospital,\u201d where only the poorest went for care. Its facilities were run down and it operated on the brink of financial insolvency; at one point it had only four days of cash on hand.\n\nToday, after eight years under CEO Jody Jenner and backed with strong board leadership and support, Broadlawns has become financially stable and the care system of choice for many low-income and other central Iowans. Its facilities (including outpatient clinics in addition to the hospital) and equipment are up-to-date, and its quality of care is highly rated. It operates much more efficiently, having reduced the cost per adjusted patient day by 40 percent over the past seven years.\n\nBroadlawns emphasizes primary care and has become the region\u2019s largest outpatient mental health provider. It continues to offer the largest family practice residency in the region, with two-thirds of the graduates remaining in practice in Iowa.\n\nPerhaps most important for taxpayers, for the first time the share of total revenue coming from property tax payers in Polk County has actually dropped below the share funded by net patient revenues. This is important because the more paying patients (whether publicly or privately insured) a public hospital can attract, the lower its unit costs and the more patients it can serve.\n\nSome of the changes that Broadlawns has had to make in order to become more competitive were neither easy nor popular at the time they were made. Layers of middle management were cut, and a new performance culture put in place that emphasizes productivity and patient outcomes. Today, the organization has become an employer of choice, and in 2013 turnover was 20 percent less than the national average.\n\nIt\u2019s very fortunate the board of trustees had the foresight 10 years ago to see the necessity of changing the vision for Broad\u00adlawns \u2014 from being a \u201clast resort\u201d provider of care to becoming a competitive provider of choice. With implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which theoretically extends open-market coverage to everyone, it will be a few years before the role of \u201csafety net\u201d hospitals becomes clear.\n\nMeanwhile, with the public hospital no longer \u201cassigned\u201d a large share of the public assistance population (who may now choose where to be served), it very well could end up with fewer, sicker (or multiple-diagnosis) patients, plus those who remain uninsured.\n\nHad Broadlawns not already positioned itself to be competitive in the marketplace, thus able to attract insured patients, these changes could have become very costly to local taxpayers. Instead, Broadlawns is positioned to be possibly even more successful in the future as the number of publicly insured patients increases.\n\nWhat does the election on Nov. 4 have to do with all of this? The choice appears to be between those who support the direction that Broadlawns has been moving \u2014 making operations more efficient and emphasizing performance accountability \u2014 and those who seek to change the course or even undo some of the changes that have been made.\n\nIt will be important for all Polk County residents to ask the candidates where they stand on these changes, and vote accordingly.\n\nGRETCHEN TEGELER is president of the Taxpayers Association of Central Iowa.
