Mark Pryor and Republican Rep. Tom Cotton tangle over religion.\n\nIn a new ad titled \u201cHeart,\u201d Pryor takes on his opponent Cotton for recent comments he made questioning the Democratic senator\u2019s faith.\n\n\"I'm not ashamed to say that I believe in God, and I believe in His word. The Bible teaches us no one has all the answers, only God does,\" Pryor says directly to camera while holding a Bible. \"This is who I am and what I believe.\"\n\nThe ad also features a graphic reading \u201cNo one should judge another\u2019s heart,\u201d and uses footage of Pryor from a television spot he ran last year in which he called the Bible his \u201ccompass\u201d and \u201cNorth Star.\u201d\n\nPryor\u2019s six figure statewide ad buy is a direct response to Cotton\u2019s suggestion last week that Pryor thinks \"faith is something that only happens at 11 on Sunday mornings.\u201d Cotton\u2019s comments came during an interview about the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the Hobby Lobby case last week.\n\n\"It's another example of how Obamacare infringes on the liberties of all Arkansans. Barack Obama and Mark Pryor think that faith is something that only happens at 11 on Sunday mornings,\u201d Cotton said in an interview with KNWA. \u201cThat's when we worship but faith is what we live every single day. And the government shouldn't infringe on the rights of religious liberty. So I'm pleased with the Supreme Court's ruling but it's just another example of why Obamacare is bad for Arkansas.\"\n\nREAD: Americans For Prosperity Unleashes Another Attack On Mark Pryor\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time religion has come to the forefront of the Arkansas Senate Race. Last year, a spokesman for the NRSC criticized Pryor\u2019s faith following the \u201cNorth Star\u201d ad.\n\n\u201cSo is the Bible Mark Pryor\u2019s compass, providing the \u2018comfort and guidance to do what\u2019s best for Arkansas?\u2019 Or is it really not a good rule book for political issues and decisions made in the Senate? Guess it depends on which Mark Pryor that you ask,\u201d NRSC Communications Director Brad Dayspring said in December.\n\nThe Cotton campaign quickly jumped to Pryor\u2019s defense and denounced Dayspring\u2019s criticism.\n\n\u201cThat is an incredibly bizarre and offensive email from the NRSC\u2019s press secretary. We should all agree that America is better off when all our public officials in both parties have the humility to seek guidance from God,\u201d Cotton campaign spokesman David Ray told The Hill in December.\n\nREAD: Ad Money Pours Into Arkansas for Key Senate Race\n\nCotton released an ad of his own Tuesday, hitting Pryor and outside Democratic groups for saying the Arkansas Republican voted against disaster relief. The ad, titled \"Recovery,\" features Andy Shock, the sheriff of Faulkner County, which was ravaged by tornadoes earlier this year.\n\n\"Shame on anyone who uses our tragedy for their own political gain. It\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Shock says in the ad. \u201cSenator Pryor, start focusing on the real issues. Leave our community and our family out of the campaign.\u201d\n\nPryor and Cotton will be back in Washington, D.C., for the majority of July until the next Congressional recess in August, but their six figure ad buys might make it seem like they never left. Additionally, the Pryor campaign is employing the help of Mark Pryor\u2019s political parents - David Pryor, a former senator and governor of Arkansas, and Barbara Pryor, who will tour the state this week.\n\nNegative Attacks Fly In Kentucky\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes is also out with a new television ad, unveiling the beginning of what they call a series of Bluegrass State voters posing questions directly to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe ad, titled \u201cQuestion from Don,\u201d is Grimes\u2019 first explicitly negative ad against McConnell and features retired coal miner Don Disney questioning McConnell.\n\n\u201cSenator, I\u2019m a retired coal miner,\u201d Disney says to the camera with Grimes seated next to him. \u201cI want to know how you could\u2019ve voted to raise my Medicare costs by $6,000. How are my wife and I supposed to afford that?\u201d\n\nDisney and Grimes\u2014Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state\u2014wait for a long pause before she turns to Disney and says, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna answer that.\u201d\n\nThis is the Grimes\u2019 campaign\u2019s third television ad this cycle and although they would not comment on exactly how much the buy is they say it is six figures.\n\nThe McConnell campaign fired back to today\u2019s ad saying it\u2019s not McConnell who is raising Medicare costs, but because of her tepid support of Obamacare she\u2019s the one who backs the cutting.\n\n\"It says a lot about the candidacy of Alison Lundergan Grimes that she's a full four months away from the election and she already hit the panic button by resorting to the oldest, most cynical attack in the Obama playbook to scare Kentucky seniors,\u201d McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a statement. \u201cThe simple reality is that Senator McConnell has fought to protect Medicare, while Alison Lundergan Grimes and her political benefactors have raided it by $700 billion to pay for Obamacare.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "What\u2019s God Got to Do With the Arkansas Senate Race?", "description": "What\u2019s God Got to Do With the Arkansas Senate Race?", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "God is front and center in the Arkansas Senate race this week as Democratic Sen.
