He stood before clerics and scholars and asserted that years of Islamic writings and sermons had created an ideology that justifies waves of violence. Now, he said, the imams have a duty to stop it.\n\n\u201cYou must emerge from it and look from outside, in order to get closer to a truly enlightened ideology,\u201d he said in a speech televised to the Egyptian people. \u201cYou must oppose it with resolve. Let me say it again: We need to revolutionize our religion.\u201d\n\nAnalysts cannot recall any other world leader taking such a bold public step since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al Qaeda, which, like other organizations that want to unleash violence around the world, bases its doctrine on Sunni Muslim ideology.\n\nWhen the smoke had cleared in Paris, French President Francois Hollande in effect broke with Mr. el-Sissi\u2019s Dec. 28 message. He told citizens, \u201cThose who carried out these attacks, the terrorists, the madmen, these fanatics have nothing to do with the Muslim religion.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama asserts repeatedly that al Qaeda-type killers have nothing to do with Islam, the religion.\n\nAt the same university and same audience makeup in 2009, Mr. Obama said, \u201cIslam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism. It is an important part of promoting peace.\u201d\n\nWhen the Islamic State, also known as ISIL, killed American Peter Kassig by beheading, Mr. Obama chose to refer to him by his Muslim name, apparently believing he freely became a Muslim after the violent group took him captive.\n\n\u201cISIL\u2019s actions represent no faith, least of all the Muslim faith, which Abdul-Rahman adopted as his own,\u201d the president said.\n\nSome analysts say Egypt\u2019s Mr. el-Sissi, while not a model for democratic rule, should be applauded for his willingness to officially link parts of his religion\u2019s ideology to violence.\n\nU.S. political conservatives point out that there are clerics who preach violence. There are mosques used to raise terrorist money, recruit fighters and plan attacks. All are components of Islam, fringe or otherwise, they say.\n\n\u201cWestern leaders often appear to be the great apologists for Islam,\u201d said Soeren Kern, an analyst with the Gatestone Institute who writes on the \u201cIslamization of France.\u201d \u201cHow many times have I heard recently that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam, or Islam is a religion of peace, or that jihadists are not true Muslims. Until the West gets over the political correctness, Islam is going to run roughshod over Western values of democracy and free speech.\u201d\n\nOne frequent criticism from U.S. conservatives is that there is still no sustained public campaign by moderate Muslim leaders to condemn and root out extremists \u2014 14 years after al Qaeda\u2019s attacks on America.\n\n\u201cSissi said something profound and, I think, correct,\u201d said Douglas Feith, the Pentagon\u2019s top policy official under President George W. Bush. \u201cThe great question is whether he\u2019ll be heeded.\n\n\u201cMany officials around the world fear that confronting the Islamist threat will be seen as an attack on Islam itself,\u201d said Mr. Feith, an architect of Mr. Bush\u2019s war on terrorism. \u201cNational security officials can educate the public on the difference between Islamism as a totalitarian political ideology and Islam as a religion. Opposing Islamism is not religious bigotry, not the same as attacking Islam. If we want to defeat the terrorists, we must counter Islamist ideology.\u201d\n\nMr. el-Sissi\u2019s pointed speech has received much more attention in the American conservative press than it has in the main liberal media, which are sensitive to charges of \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must take a long, hard look at the situation we are in,\u201d Mr. el-Sissi said, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute. \u201cIt is inconceivable that the ideology we sanctify should make our entire nation a source of concern, danger, killing, and destruction all over the world. It is inconceivable that this ideology \u2014 I am referring not to \u2018religion,\u2019 but to \u2018ideology\u2019 \u2014 the body of ideas and texts that we have sanctified in the course of centuries, to the point that challenging them has become very difficult.\u201d\n\nAt one point, he spoke directly to Ahmed Muhammad Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand sheik of Al-Azhar University and its revered mosque.\n\n\u201cHonorable Imam,\u201d he said, \u201cyou bear responsibility before Allah. The world in its entirety awaits your words, because the Islamic nation is being torn apart, destroyed, and is heading to perdition. We ourselves are bringing it to perdition.\u201d\n\nMr. el-Tayeb was appointed by President Hosni Mubarak. He supported Mr. el-Sissi\u2019s ouster of Mohammed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate who once in office quickly moved to consolidate power, crack down on dissent and suspend certain laws.\n\nMr. el-Tayeb has condemned Islamic extremists such as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former Iraqi cleric who heads the Islamic State and its ultraviolent terrorist army that invaded Iraq last year. Mr. el-Tayeb also has condemned Israel as a force for evil.\n\nZuhdi Jasser is a Syrian-American internist and nuclear cardiologist who has emerged in the U.S. as a major voice for countering Islamic extremism.\n\nConcerning Mr. el-Sissi\u2019s tough talk, Dr. Jasser, a Muslim, reminds people that it has been a long line of autocratic rulers such as the former general who created an environment in which violent Islamic ideology took hold in Egypt.\n\nMost notably, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri, a Cairo surgeon, led Egyptian Islamic Jihad. It merged in 1998 with Osama bin Laden\u2019s Pakistan-based terrorist group that attacked the U.S. three years later.\n\nDr. Jasser said, \u201cIt is certainly a major step \u2014 the fact that el-Sissi addressed the clerics and told them that we need a revolution and condemned the violence and really put them on their heels as far as the fact that this is not just an isolated problem, that there is an endemic theological interpretation that is a militant interpretation.\n\n\u201cNow, having said that, as somebody who is on the front line of countering these ideas, I can tell you what he was missing in his speech. This is a military dictator. What you didn\u2019t hear from el-Sissi \u2014 he never uses the word freedom, never uses the word liberty.\u201d\n\nWhat Dr. Jasser said Muslim leaders are needed to declare a separation between mosque and state, in the place of Islamic states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear a Muslim leader say that, then I will take a second look that they\u2019re real about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut until then, what\u2019s happening is these radicals are coming back to bite these oligarchs in the rear end.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s June 2009 appearance at Egypt\u2019s Al-Azhar University was part of his travels to majority Muslim nations.\n\nIn Cairo, he portrayed Muslims as victims of colonialism, then the Cold War, then modern Western societies.\n\nHe compared women\u2019s struggles in the male-dominated Muslim culture to a lack of rights today for American women. He said, \u201cThe struggle for women\u2019s equality continues in many aspects of American life, and in countries around the world.\u201d\n\nHe praised Islam\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cAnd throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I consider it part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear. So let there be no doubt. Islam is a part of America.\u201d\n\nThe president did urge the clerics to shun violence.\n\n\u201cThe sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer,\u201d he said. \u201cAmong some Muslims, there\u2019s a disturbing tendency to measure one\u2019s own faith by the rejection of somebody else\u2019s faith.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Obama appeared at the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington to outline his strategy for combating terrorists.\n\nHe said he wanted Congress to repeal the law that in 2001 authorized war against al Qaeda and allied groups.\n\n\u201cOur systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this war, like all wars, must end. That\u2019s what history advises. That\u2019s what our democracy demands.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ruler of Egypt is alone among major world leaders in his willingness to go before an audience of senior Muslim clerics and tell them that parts of Islamic ideology are indeed driving terrorists to kill worldwide.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The ruler of Egypt is alone among major world leaders in his willingness to go before an audience of senior Muslim clerics and tell them that parts of Islamic ideology are indeed driving terrorists to kill worldwide.", "title": "Islamic ideology driving terrorists to kill, Egypt\u2019s president tells Muslim clerics", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/11/islamic-ideology-driving-terrorists-to-kill-egypts/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/11/1_112015_mideast-egypt-reforming-i-48201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/11/1_112015_mideast-egypt-reforming-i-48201.jpg", "description": "The ruler of Egypt is alone among major world leaders in his willingness to go before an audience of senior Muslim clerics and tell them that parts of Islamic ideology are indeed driving terrorists to", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Islamic ideology driving terrorists to kill, Egypt\u2019s president t"}, "Author": "Rowan Scarborough", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Religion Belief, Abdel Fattah El Sissi, al Qaeda, Al Azhar University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1e1\"", "article_summary": "The ruler of Egypt is alone among major world leaders in his willingness to go before an audience of senior Muslim clerics and tell them that parts of Islamic ideology are indeed driving terrorists to kill worldwide.\nMr. el-Sissi\u2019s message is at odds with President Obama\u2019s view that Islam the religion has nothing to do with Muslim extremists.\nSome analysts say Egypt\u2019s Mr. el-Sissi, while not a model for democratic rule, should be applauded for his willingness to officially link parts of his religion\u2019s ideology to violence.\n\u201cISIL\u2019s actions represent no faith, least of all the Muslim faith, which Abdul-Rahman adopted as his own,\u201d the president said.\nHe stood before clerics and scholars and asserted that years of Islamic writings and sermons had created an ideology that justifies waves of violence."}
