MORITZ, Switzerland \u2014 Exceeding expectations in her comeback season, Lindsey Vonn now heads to her hometown world championships injury-free and winning races in style.\n\nThat is a rare luxury, the Alpine ski star reflected Sunday, after running her women\u2019s World Cup wins record mark to 64 with an impressive super-G victory.\n\nVonn\u2019s mastery of a tricky course setting meant only one racer, Olympic super-G champion Anna Fenninger of Austria, finished within a second of her winning time.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely the healthiest I\u2019ve been going into a big event, for sure,\u201d said the 30-year-old American, due to arrive home Monday in Vail, Colorado, one week ahead of the two-yearly worlds.\n\nVonn\u2019s pursuit of Olympic and world titles has often been hampered by injury and crashes in the days before racing.\n\nHer three career gold medals are outnumbered by four giant crystal globe trophies won for scoring the most all-around points in the grueling World Cup season.\n\nTo find Vonn in such good shape is remarkable after she twice blew out her right knee in 2013. First, in her opening super-G race at the previous worlds, held in Schladming, Austria, and a second which kept her from the Sochi Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally feel healthy again,\u201d said Vonn, who has won five World Cup speed races this season. \u201cAfter every race I have muscle pain and my knees hurt a little bit, but it\u2019s nothing new.\u201d\n\nStill, she just won three times in a stellar eight-day span to prepare for a world championships staged on her local Beaver Creek course.\n\nVonn recalled feeling this good for a gold-medal challenge only before the 2009 worlds, when she took downhill and super-G titles at Val d\u2019Isere, France.\n\nThis being Lindsey Vonn, she lacerated her right thumb on a broken champagne bottle at a sponsor\u2019s party to celebrate that downhill win and almost jeopardized the rest of her dominating season.\n\nOn Sunday, a super-G win at St. Moritz repeated her feat of 2010 when it had seemed the perfect send-off in Europe for the Vancouver Olympics where she was expected to shine.\n\nVonn did indeed win her Olympic downhill title five years ago, though only after injuring her right shin in training which added drama and uncertainty.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t jinx me,\u201d Vonn said Sunday when asked about her star-crossed luck. \u201cSo, hopefully in the next training days nothing happens.\u201d\n\nEverything about Vonn\u2019s latest victory suggests she learned enough to stay safe before her first medal race, the super-G on Feb. 3.\n\nVonn found a fast racing line through a challenging set of gates. A tight turn into the finish tricked several rivals, including double Sochi gold medalist Tina Maze of Slovenia.\n\nOn crossing the finish line, Vonn raised both arms in the air and bowed to the cheering Swiss crowd who appreciated her impressive run.\n\nFenninger acknowledged being outsmarted higher up the course.\n\n\u201cIt was really good skiing on the last two sections,\u201d the 24-year-old overall World Cup champion said. \u201cI think that is the way you can beat Lindsey but it has to be for the whole run.\u201d\n\nVonn now leads the season-long super-G standings from Fenninger.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s nice to be a veteran on the tour,\u201d said Vonn, who debuted in a World Cup slalom aged 16 in November 2000. \u201cI knew a few gates that would cause trouble.\u201d\n\nSuch veteran savvy should help her manage the demands of being a home-team favorite for the two-week championships \u2014 the first on American snow since the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.\n\n\u201cI know the limit and I know how to handle my schedule,\u201d said Vonn, who will stay in relative calm at the team hotel. \u201cMy whole family will be at my house so I want to separate myself.\u201d\n\nHer father, Alan Kildow, was again course-side to watch. He also attended last Monday at Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, when another super-G win set a wins record for Vonn which arrived so soon after such serious injuries.\n\n\u201cShe works so hard physically on the rehabilitation that I knew she would be in good shape,\u201d Kildow said. \u201cBut to come that far back, that quickly, is, I won\u2019t say it\u2019s surprising, but \u2026 you know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn wins super-G for 64th World Cup victory", "title": "Lindsey Vonn wins super-G for 64th World Cup victory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/25/lindsey-vonn-wins-super-g-for-64th-world-cup-victory/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150125__vonnsupergp1.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150125__vonnsupergp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-25T09:40:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T22:12:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alpine skiing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc254\"", "article_summary": "That is a rare luxury, the Alpine ski star reflected Sunday, after running her women\u2019s World Cup wins record mark to 64 with an impressive super-G victory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally feel healthy again,\u201d said Vonn, who has won five World Cup speed races this season.\nFirst, in her opening super-G race at the previous worlds, held in Schladming, Austria, and a second which kept her from the Sochi Olympics.\nVonn\u2019s mastery of a tricky course setting meant only one racer, Olympic super-G champion Anna Fenninger of Austria, finished within a second of her winning time.\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s nice to be a veteran on the tour,\u201d said Vonn, who debuted in a World Cup slalom aged 16 in November 2000."}
