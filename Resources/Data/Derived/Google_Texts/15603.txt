WINNIPEG, Manitoba — Avalanche rookie defenseman Chris Bigras missed his third consecutive game with the Avalanche. He remained in Colorado to recover from a concussion, and his return to the lineup is up in the air.

“He’s better but not ready to practice with the team,” Avs coach Patrick Roy said from MTS Centre.

Bigras, 21, was called up from the minors Jan. 13, made his debut the following night and played in 23 consecutive games before absorbing a hit to the head last week against Nashville. He wasn’t immediately diagnosed with a concussion, because his symptoms were delayed.

Zach Redmond has replaced Bigras. Redmond and Andrew Bodnarchuk both took warm-ups Saturday, but Roy again settled on Redmond to partner with Eric Gelinas on the third pairing.

Danger. The Avs on Sunday began a stretch of four road games against Canadian teams with little or no chance of making the playoffs. Roy was asked if that spells “danger” for a team in a tight fight with Minnesota for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot.

“Not really. They’re all dangerous games,” Roy said. “In today’s hockey, nobody is missing much. Even if you’re out of the race and you can say you’re fighting for jobs, we’re fighting for a playoff spot and we know they’re going to come to play. We were in that position last year. We did everything we could to remain focused and finish the year strong and build around it for the following year.”

The Avs play at Vancouver on Wednesday before visiting Calgary on Friday and Edmonton on Sunday.

Entering Saturday’s games, the Jets (59), Canucks (64), Flames (61) and Oilers (61) were the four teams with the fewest points in the Western Conference.

Footnote. The Avs are expected to take Sunday off and return to practice Monday. They will depart for Vancouver after Tuesday’s practice.
