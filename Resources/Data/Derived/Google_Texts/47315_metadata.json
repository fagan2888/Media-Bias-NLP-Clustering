Doesn't that make you question the vehemence of your views?\n\nRUBIO: No. Because I interact with people all the time that have just come from there, dissidents that come here and go back. I'm not operating in a vacuum, and I'm not operating out of things I read in a book. I'm dealing with people, I'm dealing with dissidents that come to the U.S. and speak to us about what's happening. I have that benefit of that interaction combined with the benefit of understanding U.S. policy towards Cuba, and understanding the history behind it, and the nature of this regime.\n\nMost Americans don't spend a lot of time thinking about it. And most of the public policy leaders in our country don't know a lot about the true nature of the Castro regime and what's happening there. And what's happening there is very simple: Raul Castro is transitioning that government eventually towards a succession that will involve his son as the leader of that country. What they're looking for is enough revenue to allow that system of government they have in place to sustain itself for the long term. And this opening, this one-sided opening will make it easier for him to achieve that goal. And that means the Cuban people will never have freedom.\n\nHARWOOD: You said in the debate the other day that you can compete toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton on people who live paycheck to paycheck because you lived paycheck to paycheck. How do you think people who are living paycheck to paycheck will receive the news that your tax plan eliminates taxes on estates, capital gains and dividends?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, capital gains and dividends is investment. That means someone is taking money they have access to and investing it in something. That's how jobs are created.\n\nMy father had a job as a bartender at a hotel. And the reason why he had a job as a bartender is because someone who had money invested in that hotel. Invested in building it, invested in expanding it, invested in modernizing it so people would keep coming back. And that's why people visited that hotel. That's why my dad had a salary, and that's why he had tips.\n\nAnything you tax, you're going to get less of it. So that's why we tax cigarettes, because we don't want people to smoke. We want more investment; why would we tax it? Now I understand that in the process of a negotiation with other policymakers, it may not be 100 percent my plan, but that's the direction we should head. But that's not the only thing the tax plan does. It also lowers the business taxes on business income, especially for S corporations. Most American business activity happens through a pass through an S Corp.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Rubio has put a sweeping tax reform plan at the center of his White House campaign.
