A Hampton, Vir., sheriff\u2019s deputy named Daniel Ray Carter decided to \u201clike\u201d the campaign page of \u201cJim Adams for Sheriff.\u201d Carter actually worked at the time for Sheriff B.J. Roberts, who was being challenged for office by Adams.\n\nAfter Roberts beat Adams in the election, he fired Carter. Carter filed a lawsuit, saying his \u201clike\u201d on Adam\u2019s campaign page led to his dismissal.\n\nFacebook itself joined in on the defense of Carter, writing in a court brief that use of a \u201clike\u201d on the social media site should be protected as free speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nThey compared Carter\u2019s liking of Adams as \u201cthe 21st Century equivalent of a front-yard campaign sign.\u201d They noted that if Carter had simply publicly said that he liked Adams, there would no doubt that his opinion and statement were protected by free speech.\n\nThe ACLU also came to Carter\u2019s defense, saying that \u201cthe ease\u201d of doing things on the Internet \u2013 one button click can lead to posting a comment, photo or video \u2013 does not take away from their \u201cexpressive nature.\u201d They questioned why pushing a button to say you \u201clike\u201d something would somehow not be protected speech, while affixing a button to your lapel supporting a candidate would be protected.\n\nA federal appeals judge last week apparently agreed with at least some of these arguments, ruling that Carter had the right to \u201clike\u201d the campaign page of his boss\u2019s opponent, basically equating pushing a Facebook \u201clike\u201d button to saying that you like something or someone, which is protected by free speech, according to webpronews.com.\n\nWhile the ruling is significant for many workers in business and perhaps especially those working for political candidates, it\u2019s important for employees to remember that posting to Facebook is something that should be considered carefully before pushing the \u201center\u201d key.\n\nFor example, while using Facebook is not against federal law, it can lead to someone losing their job, such as the Taco Bell employee who posted a photo of himself licking taco shells earlier this year and was fired by the fast food giant.\n\nGet Free Updates!
