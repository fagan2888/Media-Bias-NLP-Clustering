The hospital\u2019s board signed a letter of intent with Mercy Health Network this September in order to begin discussions regarding the benefits of transitioning to a closer affiliation.\n\n\u201cAlthough nothing changes today\u2014and may not\u2014our board believes it is time to investigate whether now is the right time to develop a stronger relationship with Mercy,\u201d GRMC\u2019s CEO and president Todd Linden wrote in a press release from the hospital recently.\n\nGRMC\u2019s initial affiliation with Mercy began on July 1, 2009, and since then the hospital has shared best practices and contracted services with Mercy network hospitals.\n\nA task force has been put together to consider options for the future of GRMC\u2019s relationship with Mercy. Members of GRMC\u2019s board, as well as an MD and the vice president of operations, are among those on the task force.\n\n\u201cThe discussion is focusing on how the organizations may work closer together to strengthen access to care and enhance quality and clinical efficiency. We are also exploring new delivery system models and payment programs consistent with the incentives in the Affordable Care Act and healthcare reform in general,\u201d said Todd Reding, GRMC board chair, in the press release.\n\n\u201cWe do not know what the headline will say after the conversations are completed,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat we do know is that we are committed to providing quality care consistent with the needs of our community. Our ability to do this successfully is reliant on a progressive system that is viable in our new healthcare environment. We are actively looking at new models so that our medical center can remain the amazing institution it is today.\u201d\n\nGRMC said that a potential pro of a stronger affiliation with Mercy would be an increase in capital resources, which could help sustain and grow Grinnell\u2019s medical services.\n\n\u201cThe letter of intent allows the leaders of both organizations to discuss specific terms about the possibility of integrating GRMC more fully into the Mercy system as either a \u2018managed hospital\u2019 or an \u2018owned hospital\u2019 in the network,\u201d Reding wrote in a note as part of GRMC\u2019s fall newsletter.\n\nReding\u2019s note highlighted what he sees as the clear benefits of a strengthened relationship, listing Mercy\u2019s proven track record, its focus on community health care and its forward-thinking ethos.\n\n\u201cWe also believe Mercy has the potential to benefit from a closer relationship with GRMC,\u201d Reding wrote. \u201cOur hospital is a nationally recognized rural leader in patient satisfaction, innovation, quality and safety. In fact, in the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services patient satisfaction report, GRMC excels over area hospitals in cleanliness, nurse and physician communication, pain control and responsiveness.\u201d\n\nNeither Redding\u2019s note nor the press release laid out a timeline for when decisions will be made, but it was made clear that both Redding and Linden were available to members of the community who had further questions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Zane Silk\r\nsilkniha@grinnell.edu\r\nGrinnell\u2019s local hospital, Grinnell Regional Medical Center (GRMC), is considering becoming more fully integrated into the", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.4.8", "og": {"site_name": "The Scarlet & Black", "description": "Zane Silk silkniha@grinnell.edu Grinnell\u2019s local hospital, Grinnell Regional Medical Center (GRMC), is considering becoming more fully integrated into the Mercy Health Network of Iowa to increase t\u2026", "title": "Grinnell Regional announces partnership with Des Moines medical center", "url": "http://www.thesandb.com/community/grinnell-regional-announces-partnership-with-des-moines-medical-center.html", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://www.thesandb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GRMC-logo.jpg", "height": 332}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thesandb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GRMC-logo.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-04T04:17:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T04:17:43+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9932\"", "article_summary": "Members of GRMC\u2019s board, as well as an MD and the vice president of operations, are among those on the task force.\nA task force has been put together to consider options for the future of GRMC\u2019s relationship with Mercy.\nZane Silksilkniha@grinnell.eduGrinnell\u2019s local hospital, Grinnell Regional Medical Center (GRMC), is considering becoming more fully integrated into the Mercy Health Network of Iowa to increase the city\u2019s healthcare options.\nGRMC\u2019s initial affiliation with Mercy began on July 1, 2009, and since then the hospital has shared best practices and contracted services with Mercy network hospitals.\n\u201cWe also believe Mercy has the potential to benefit from a closer relationship with GRMC,\u201d Reding wrote."}
