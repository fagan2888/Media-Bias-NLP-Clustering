(Photo: ANNA REED / Statesman Journal)Buy Photo\n\nThe Public Employees' Benefit Board has voted unanimously to restructure state employee health care premiums, averting hundreds of millions of dollars in future federal excise tax payments.\n\nThe restructuring doesn't take effect until 2017, but eventually premiums for individual employee plans will drop and family plan premiums will increase.\n\nThe changes come because of an excise tax within the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe tax has been called the \"Cadillac Tax\" because it is levied on the most expensive health plans. It takes effect in 2018 and taxes insurers 40 percent of premiums for plans above an annual threshold \u2014 $10,200 for individual plans and $27,500 for plans with dependents.\n\nOregon's employee-only plans currently cost $14,256 a year \u2014 well above the threshold triggering the tax. The state's most expensive plans, which are its family plans, are $19,536 a year \u2014 well below threshold.\n\nIf the tax is triggered, the state would have to potentially pay up to $335 million in taxes over 10 years. Instead of either paying the tax or slashing benefits, PEBB took advantage of a creative actuarial solution. The Cadillac Tax is triggered by total premium paid. By changing premiums, the state could avoid the tax without cutting benefits.\n\nTuesday's vote balanced the premium tiers closer to actual costs of the plans. Plans for single people had slightly subsidized the cost of family plans.\n\nPEBB voted to offset increased family plan premiums with a two year subsidy, meaning those employees won't pay premium increases. (All employees will have to pay for inflation-related costs, however.)\n\nThe subsidies come from PEBB's stabilization fund, currently sitting at a $15 million surplus with more than $362 million in the fund.\n\nWithout the subsidy, employees with dependents would have to pay nearly $20 more a month for health care.\n\nBeginning in 2019, it's expected PEBB will begin weening employees off the subsidies. At that point, monthly payments will go up for employees with dependents. But the subsidies will be reduced a little at a time over several years.\n\n\"Rather than rip that Band-Aid off we\u2019re going to go in two steps,\" Kathy Loretz, PEBB's deputy administrator, said.\n\ngfriedman2@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6653, on Twitter @gordonrfriedman, or Facebook.com/gordonrfriedman\n\nRead or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/1RXi1bQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Public Employees' Benefit Board voted unanimously Tuesday to adjust\u00a0how employee health care\u00a0premiums are structured,\u00a0averting\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars in\u00a0future federal excise tax payments.", "og": {"site_name": "Statesman Journal", "description": "The Public Employees' Benefit Board voted unanimously Tuesday to adjust\u00a0how employee health care\u00a0premiums are structured,\u00a0averting\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars in\u00a0future federal excise tax payments.", "title": "State restructures employee health care rates", "url": "http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2015/10/21/state-restructures-employee-healthcare-rates/74335774/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/statesmanjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Public Employees' Benefit Board voted unanimously Tuesday to adjust\u00a0how employee health care\u00a0premiums are structured,\u00a0averting\u00a0hundreds of millions of dollars in\u00a0future federal excise tax payments.", "title": "State restructures employee health care rates", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bebbfd7d118db0091dec69ef9bfb086193113118/c=400-0-2000-1600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/21/Salem/Salem/635810545113816205-SAL-PEBBBuilding-ar-01.JPG", "creator": "@salem_statesman", "site": "@salem_statesman", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815599744", "fb": {"app_id": 138699832852944}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/gordonrfriedman/"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "pebb, oregon, cadillac tax, aca, obamacare, lund report, lund, lundreports, health care, premiums, benefits, oebb"}, "article_summary": "The state's most expensive plans, which are its family plans, are $19,536 a year \u2014 well below threshold.\nPlans for single people had slightly subsidized the cost of family plans.\nThe restructuring doesn't take effect until 2017, but eventually premiums for individual employee plans will drop and family plan premiums will increase.\n(Photo: ANNA REED / Statesman Journal)Buy PhotoThe Public Employees' Benefit Board has voted unanimously to restructure state employee health care premiums, averting hundreds of millions of dollars in future federal excise tax payments.\nPEBB voted to offset increased family plan premiums with a two year subsidy, meaning those employees won't pay premium increases."}
