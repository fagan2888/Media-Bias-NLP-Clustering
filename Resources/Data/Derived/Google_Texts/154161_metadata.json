But the stories emerging out of the filming of \u201cSpectre\u201d in the Mexican capital have dramas worthy of a spy flick themselves.\n\nThe real-life plots spin from corporate hacking to dictators to government bribes to narco police.\n\nBut it is not all scandal. The iconic British agent has also brought his trademark glamorous women and explosive action scenes to Mexico City\u2019s historical center.\n\nFilming began here March 19 and runs all this week. The movie might struggle to be as outlandish as reality when it hits the screens in November. GlobalPost looks at the highlights.\n\n1) \u201cSpectre\u201d gets hacked\n\nIn December, before James Bond got anywhere near Mexico, Sony Pictures was hit by what its CEO called \u201cthe worst cyber attack in US history.\u201d (Which is pretty hard to verify.)\n\nUS intelligence agents say North Korea was behind the hack in reaction to the Sony comedy \u201cThe Interview,\u201d about TV reporters trying to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang denies involvement.\n\nThe hackers ripped a plethora of embarrassing emails and data from Sony. They stole and leaked a \u201cSpectre\u201d script, including major plot spoilers. And they exposed dealings over the movie that spilled controversial details about the Mexico shoot.\n\n2) Mexican government accused of bribery\n\nOn March 3, the website Tax Analysis broke a story, based on one of the hacked Sony emails, that Mexican officials were giving the filmmakers between $14 million and $20 million in tax cuts on \u201cSpectre.\u201d In return they wanted significant changes to the script to help Mexico\u2019s image, which has been tarnished by drug violence, the story said.\n\nThese alleged tweaks included changing the nationality of an assassin from Mexican, showing shots of Mexico City\u2019s modern skyline rather than slum streets, and switching a cage fight to a traditional Day of the Dead parade.\n\nWhile tax incentives are normal for movies, Tax Analysts said the tradeoffs went \u201cwell beyond that, with the studio permitting Mexican authorities to make casting decisions, dictate characters\u2019 ethnicities.\u201d\n\nMexican newspapers ran headlines like \u201cMexico Bribes James Bond.\u201d\n\nIn response, film producer Michael G. Wilson gave a news conference in Mexico City last week. He denied some of the changes and said the Bond films always receive tax incentives.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the script that we hadn\u2019t had before,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cEverywhere we go we have incentives. Sometimes they\u2019re taxes; sometimes they\u2019re other kind of incentives. You can get co-operation, you can get things you would usually pay for free and all that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Activists actually asked 007 to help find the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa", "title": "5 interesting stories behind the making of the new James Bond film, \u201cSpectre\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Activists actually asked 007 to help find the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa", "title": "5 interesting stories behind the making of the new James Bond film, \u201cSpectre\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/29/5_interesting_stories_behind_the_making_of_the_new_james_bond_film_spectre_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/Daniel-Craig-in-Skyfall-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Activists actually asked 007 to help find the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa", "title": "5 interesting stories behind the making of the new James Bond film, \u201cSpectre\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/Daniel-Craig-in-Skyfall-.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ioan Grillo", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Daniel Craig, GlobalPost, james bond, Miss Bala, spectre", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Daniel Craig, GlobalPost, james bond, Miss Bala, spectre, Entertainment NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostMEXICO CITY \u2014 The combination of James Bond espionage and Mexico\u2019s crime and chaos always promised to be a sizzling cocktail.\nThey stole and leaked a \u201cSpectre\u201d script, including major plot spoilers.\nHe denied some of the changes and said the Bond films always receive tax incentives.\n1) \u201cSpectre\u201d gets hackedIn December, before James Bond got anywhere near Mexico, Sony Pictures was hit by what its CEO called \u201cthe worst cyber attack in US history.\u201d (Which is pretty hard to verify.)\nBut the stories emerging out of the filming of \u201cSpectre\u201d in the Mexican capital have dramas worthy of a spy flick themselves."}
