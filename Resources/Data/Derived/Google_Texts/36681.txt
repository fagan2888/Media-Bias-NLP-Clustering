Inside most galaxies a supermassive black hole lurks. But one galaxy about 4 billion light-years from us was recently discovered to have not one, not even two, but three gigantic black holes at its center.

Such triple systems appear to be extremely rare—only four are known. The newfound system includes two black holes orbiting each other very closely, about 450 light-years apart, with a third black hole a bit farther out. The central pair zoom around each other at a fast clip, about 300 times the speed of sound on Earth. The hole trinity also represents the tightest trio of black holes known to date. It’s described in the journal Nature. [R.P. Deane et al, A close-pair binary in a distant triple supermassive black hole system]
