â€” A Raleigh man was arrested Friday on sex-related charges involving a child.

Edvin Lopez-Arguenta, 32, of 3909 Falmouth Drive, faces four counts of sex offense and two counts of rape.

He was in the Wake County jail Saturday under a $1.5 million bond.

An arrest warrant for Lopez-Arguenta indicated that the alleged crimes happened in 2008, but it did not say how he knew the child.
