After complaints from the community board representing the area around Tudor Park in Queens that hard-hit cricket balls had become a health hazard for residents, a higher fence has finally gone up.



Problems began in late 2012, after the city's Department of Parks and Recreation completed the renovation of the ball fields to improve drainage in the park, which stretches from 80th to 88th streets just west of JFK International Airport. As part of the reconstruction, the cricket pitch was shifted slightly to eliminate an overlap with a softball field, and to give the area's increasing number of mostly South Asian and West Indian cricketers a bit more elbow room. But the new layout allowed a veritable stream of hard, leather-covered cricket balls to sail over the park's 16-foot-high fence.



Within days, complaints began landing on desks at Community Board 10. In response, late last year Frank Dardani, chairman of the community board's park committee, reached out to the Parks Department for relief. "The department sent someone to evaluate the problem and then ordered the material," he said. As of Nov. 12, eight feet of netting had been added to the fence, and area residents were heaving a sigh of relief. "This shouldn't be a problem anymore," said Mr. Dardani.
