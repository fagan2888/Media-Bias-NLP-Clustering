But that\u2019s what Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, did yesterday when she contradicted President Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cISIL is contained.\u201d\n\nLike other lawmakers in both parties, along with security chiefs sworn to keep America safe, Feinstein is worried not only about the administration\u2019s minimalist strategy in dealing with ISIS, ISIL, Daesh or whatever one wants to call the terror group \u2013 most of which can\u2019t be published here \u2013 but about how the U.S. can stop an attack on the homeland when the enemy communicates using \u201cdark\u201d technologies.\n\nFeinstein is referring to messaging apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, Telegram, Wickr and Apple\u2019s iMessage, all of which are encrypted so that the messages can\u2019t be captured and monitored. Some of them actually disappear after they\u2019re opened and read. Feinstein and another ally, CIA director John Brennan, want to restore the government\u2019s ability to monitor the digital chatter of ISIS and other terror groups by having a back door opened to apps that have end-to-end encryption.\n\nWould that help? Not according to an article in Scientific American, which cites security analysts who say it wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cEncryption is just math, and there are dozens of open-source encryption packages. There\u2019s no way you could stop it,\u201d Matthew Green, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, told Scientific American.\n\nISIS has shown its technological prowess from the start. The high production values of their effective marketing videos, their use of social media, and their ability to find and possibly customize existing open source media to serve their needs has been a challenge for U.S. government officials who don\u2019t exactly have stellar records in the technology wars.\n\nLast year, The Fiscal Times compared Facebook\u2019s photo tagging system with the FBI\u2019s billion dollar facial recognition system \u2014 the one that\u2019s supposed to ID the bad guys. The test was done by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a tech trade group, which found the FBI\u2019s system was accurate only 85 percent of the time compared with Facebook\u2019s system that works 97 percent of the time.\n\nIn one case, the FBI\u2019s facial recognition system matched a suspect\u2019s photo with the wrong name one in seven times.\n\nThe FBI story is still a good result compared with, say, Healtcare.gov \u2014 the billion dollar website that never worked well and cost taxpayers a bundle. Or the IRS\u2019s inability to keep millions of taxpayers\u2019 Social Security numbers from being stolen. Or how about the Office of Management and Budget letting the personal information of 25 million federal workers be hijacked by hackers?\n\nA few examples of federal I.T. expertise:\n\nA failed electronic health record program that was supposed to allow the Pentagon and Veterans Affairs to share files. DOD canceled it when the cost of the program was projected to top $28 billion. The original system was supposed to cost $1 billion.\n\nThe Virtual Case File System, for which the FBI paid contractors $170 million. The bureau eventually decided the program as conceived would never work -- and canceled the contract.\n\nThe Secure Border Initiative, which was supposed to create a virtual fence between the U.S. and Mexico. Homeland Security canceled it after spending $1 billion on just 53 miles of fence. The entire border is 1,954 miles.\n\nThe Business Modernization Program, launched by the IRS in the 1980s. The program\u2019s goal was to help the IRS manage files. More than 20 years and $7 billion later, it's still not done.\n\nThe Kinetic Energy Interceptor, an anti-ballistic missile system that would take down enemy rockets early in flight; Northrup Grumman was the contractor. After the DOD spent $1.2 billion on it, the Obama administration canceled the program because it simply didn't work.\n\nYet, there may still be hope for defeating an ISIS plot, if the U.S. wants to count on the hacker group Anonymous to jump in and save the day. A piece in The Guardian published a tweet from the group\u2026\n\nMake no mistake: #Anonymous is at war with #Daesh. We won't stop opposing #IslamicState. We're also better hackers. #OpISIS \u2014 Anonymous (@GroupAnon) November 15, 2015\n\n\u2026and translated this video from the French: \u201cYou, the vermin who kill innocent victims, we will hunt you down like we did those who carried out the attacks on Charlie Hebdo.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian also reported that Binary Sec, another group of hacktivists, will join the online fight against ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe as a collective will bring an end to your reign of terror. We will no longer turn a blind eye to your cruel and inhumane acts of terrorism towards all other religions that are not Islam. We\u2019ve watched you behead innocent people, kidnap and murder children, and then launch terrorist attacks in France. This will NOT BE TOLERATED ANY LONGER.\n\n\u201cWe here at BinarySec live for the sole purpose of bringing down All ISIS Propaganda ONE website and/or person at a time. ISIS \u2026 Your Jihad is coming to an abrupt end. We here at BinarySec will be one of the driving forces to your end and that\u2019s a promise.
