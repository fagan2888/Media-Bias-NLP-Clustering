The ending of the month of fasting was supposed to be a day of celebration for Quran, who worked as a fireman in a town north of Jerusalem before immigrating. Instead, it\u2019s just like any other day.\n\nFor nearly two decades, Quran has been working to provide for his wife and four children here in the United States. He\u2019s been successful, putting all four of them through college with the money his store makes, and saving for retirement.\n\nBut on a June day last year, Quran nearly lost it all after the Internal Revenue Service seized $153,907.99 from his store\u2019s bank account.\n\nHe was never charged with a crime.\n\n\u201cThe United States government\u2014they stole my money,\u201d he said in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cI\u2019m working all my life, seven days a week, and they just came in here and took it.\u201d\n\nWhen two IRS agents came into Quran\u2019s convenience store last year, he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d done anything wrong. But the agents told him he had committed multiple structuring violations, which involve making cash deposits or withdrawals of under $10,000 to skirt reporting requirements.\n\n\u201cThe United States government\u2014they stole my money.I\u2019m working all my life, seven days a week, and just came in here and took it,\u201d said Khalid Quran.\n\nWhen the government officials came into Quran\u2019s store to tell him his money had been seized, they provided him with a form confirming his \u201cconsent to forfeit.\u201d Quran, whose first language is Arabic, said he had trouble understanding the form\u2019s legal jargon.\n\nThe officers offered to read it for him, Quran recalled, and they ordered him to sign it, yelling in his face. If he didn\u2019t, the IRS agents said they would go to Quran\u2019s wife, Dina, and get her signature instead\u2013which he viewed as a veiled threat.\n\nQuran complied.\n\n\u201cThey scared me to death,\u201d he said. \u201cI was by myself. I have nobody in this country. If something happened to me, what would happen to my wife and kids?\u201d\n\nQuran consulted a local lawyer who warned him that while he would fight the case for him, it was unlikely that Quran would win against the government. Plus, it would cost him between $40,000 and $50,000 to go to court, Quran recalled, in addition to the $5,000 retainer he\u2019d already paid.\n\nWhen the government sent the 61-year-old man a notice of the forfeiture, he opted not to take on the federal government.\n\n>>> Police Officer Pockets $6,000 From People Who Had Their Cars Taken Through Forfeiture\n\nIn the \u2018Interest of Justice\u2019\n\nSeizures that take place because of structuring violations fall under a subset of civil asset forfeiture laws that monitor cash transactions.\n\nCivil asset forfeiture is a tool that gives law enforcement the power to seize money and property if it\u2019s suspected of being tied to a crime.\n\nStructuring laws and civil asset forfeiture were designed to stop drug trafficking and money laundering, but in recent years, innocent property owners have been swept up in a system of law enforcement \u201cpolicing for profit.\u201d\n\nIn Quran\u2019s case, the government found no wrongdoing, and the only \u201ccrime\u201d he committed was his pattern of withdrawals and deposits. Quran, though, said he had no idea making deposits or withdrawals of under $10,000 was wrong.\n\nQuran told The Daily Signal he withdrew only what he would need to operate the store.\n\nLast year, after a growing number of Americans had money seized after committing structuring violations\u2014but were never charged with a crime\u2014the Internal Revenue Service changed its policy regarding such seizures.\n\nSeveral months later, the Justice Department followed suit.\n\nUnder the policy change, the IRS and Department of Justice can pursue only structuring cases in which the money stems from illegal activity. Under the new policies, Quran wouldn\u2019t have had his money seized.\n\nNow, in an attempt to right the IRS\u2019s wrong, Quran is fighting to get his money back.\n\nThe tax agency seized his money before the policy change was enacted, but the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm representing Quran and Randy Sowers, a Frederick County, Md. dairy farmer, has turned to a new legal mechanism that it hopes will help the pair.\n\nIn February 2012, the government came to Sowers\u2019s farm and told him the farm\u2019s bank account had been seized. The IRS took $60,000 from Sowers, emptying the account.\n\nSowers was making deposits of just under $10,000 into the account frequently, which came from customers who paid in cash at the local farmer\u2019s market. His pattern of deposits, the IRS said, was indicative of structuring.\n\nSowers settled with the government and had half of his money returned.\n\nNow, like Quran, he\u2019s trying to get the rest of it back.\n\n>>> IRS Returns $107,000 It Took From North Carolina Convenience Store Owner\n\nOn behalf of Quran and Sowers, the Institute for Justice filed \u201cpetitions for remission or mitigation\u201d with the government.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Robert Johnson, an Institute for Justice lawyer who is representing Quran, equated the petition for remission or mitigation to a \u201cpresidential pardon petition.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The government] has the discretion to give back money whenever it feels that doing so would advance the interest of justice,\u201d said Robert Johnson.\n\n\u201cIt allows the IRS to give back money after completing a civil forfeiture,\u201d he said. \u201c[The government] has the discretion to give back money whenever it feels that doing so would advance the interest of justice.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, property owners like Quran don\u2019t have the means to fight the government for their money and property. Others like Sowers decide to settle, often to have half of their money returned.\n\nThe petition gives property owners a chance to see justice after their money has been taken.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2013, there have been 618 cases involving property owners who have had their money forfeited by the IRS because of structuring violations, according to the Institute for Justice. In each of those cases, the victims never committed a crime.\n\nOver that six-year span, the IRS forfeited more than $43 million.\n\n\u201cTo file a petition in this situation where there\u2019s been a resolution of the forfeiture is unusual, and a use of the petition mechanism is somewhat novel,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut, Congress created the ability to file the petition to allow the agencies to return money when keeping it would be unjust. This is exactly this kind of situation, which is why we\u2019re using this.\u201d\n\nThe Institute for Justice hopes that, if successful, Quran and Sowers will set a precedent for the remaining property owners to get their money back.\n\n\u201cWith the petitions, we\u2019re trying to open up an avenue with people who have been coerced into these settlements to petition the government and ask the government to do the right thing and give the money back,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that the government recognized the seizures were wrong when they changed their policies,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, the government should do the right thing and give the money back.\u201d\n\n>>> Commentary: 3 Reasons Stopping Police From Wrongly Seizing Americans\u2019 Assets Will Be Tough", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the last day of Ramadan, which ended Friday, Khalid (Ken) Quran was headed to work.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On the last day of Ramadan, which ended Friday, Khalid (Ken) Quran was headed to work.", "title": "Two Business Owners Fight the IRS to Get Their Money Back", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150717_NCForfeiture_QuinnFEAT1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-20T23:47:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1fbBLdM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On the last day of Ramadan, which ended Friday, Khalid (Ken) Quran was headed to work.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150717_NCForfeiture_QuinnFEAT1.jpg"}, "title": "Two Business Owners Fight the IRS to Get Their Money Back", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-07-20T03:01:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-20T23:47:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Institute for Justice, structuring, civil asset forfeiture, Khalid Quran, Randy Sowers, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Justice, Robert Johnson"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s been successful, putting all four of them through college with the money his store makes, and saving for retirement.\nThe petition gives property owners a chance to see justice after their money has been taken.\nUnder the policy change, the IRS and Department of Justice can pursue only structuring cases in which the money stems from illegal activity.\n\u201cIt allows the IRS to give back money after completing a civil forfeiture,\u201d he said.\nFrom 2007 to 2013, there have been 618 cases involving property owners who have had their money forfeited by the IRS because of structuring violations, according to the Institute for Justice."}
