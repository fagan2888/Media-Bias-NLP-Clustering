Duane Ankney of Colstrip on behalf of Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, who made campaign disclosure a top priority. It requires \u201cdark money\u201d groups, known for their anonymous attack mailers, to report all of their donors and expenditures in political campaigns, just as candidates and other political committees must do.\n\nGarner learned about the effects of dark money the hard way, when, without bothering to notify him, Americans for Prosperity-Montana sent critical postcards attacking Garner\u2019s stance on Medicaid expansion, and notifying members of his legislative district of a Feb. 5 town hall meeting in the lawmaker\u2019s hometown of Kalispell.\n\nHe found out about the event from a Capitol reporter on the House floor, and decided to make an impromptu, eight-hour round trip drive from Helena to Kalispell to attend the meeting, despite not receiving an invitation.\n\nAFP-Montana is part of the conservative political organization founded by billionaires David and Charles Koch of Wichita, Kansas, and at the meeting Garner asked why, if the group\u2019s intent was to influence state policy, had they taken aim at him through a blitz of anonymous attack mailers rather than simply ask him to the table for discourse.\n\nThe reason, explained Zach Lahn, state director for the Montana chapter of Americans for Prosperity (AFP), is that Garner refused to sign the group\u2019s blanket pledge card in opposition to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, a stunt the group had performed on other Republican lawmakers whose views on Medicaid reform didn\u2019t align with the hard-right faction.\n\nGarner, who did not support full Medicaid expansion this session but ultimately supported a compromise bill that expands coverage to the working poor, wasn\u2019t satisfied with AFP\u2019s answer. And while he hadn\u2019t intended to support the dark money bill \u2013 it wasn\u2019t even on his radar as the session got underway \u2013 he decided on the late-night drive back to Helena to take a stand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never been exposed to it before, and after being exposed to it I saw the need for more disclosure. People have the right to know who is trying to influence their vote,\u201d Garner said.\n\nAnkney, the bill\u2019s sponsor, asked Garner to carry the bill in the House, and after considering the ramifications from fellow representatives in his caucus, he agreed, notifying the GOP House leaders of his intention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that they take a big bill like this and give it to a freshman to carry it,\u201d Garner said. \u201cAs a new guy, it\u2019s not easy to make those choices when not everybody in the caucus agrees. But my motto has been putting my constituents first, and sometimes it\u2019s possible to do that without any pushback, and sometimes it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, Garner defected from the ranks of Republican leadership and the majority of the caucus to argue for the measure, at several points holding up a Flathead Beacon illustration of marionette strings attached to the Capitol building to demonstrate the powerful influence of outside interest groups, saying Montanans deserve to know the identity of \u201cthe hands on the puppet strings.\u201d\n\nGarner repeatedly stood up on the floor and resisted the dozen Republican-introduced amendments to dilute the measure, standing firm even as he described it as a difficult stance.\n\n\u201cThis is not an easy thing to do, to stand up in front of my caucus today in disagreement with some of the people I have such great respect for. But I believe this is right. That is the legacy I want to leave, one of fairness, one of disclosure,\u201d Garner said.\n\n\u201cThat was a bill that got him fired up,\u201d Bullock said of Garner. \u201cI knew Representative Garner back when he was chief of police and I was Attorney General. He is no pushover by any means, and he is a conservative Representative, but he did a good job standing up for transparency in our election process.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Chuck Hunter similarly praised Garner\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cIn the four terms I have been here I think this rises to the level of importance the way few bills do,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cIt\u2019s about disclosure, pure and simple. It\u2019s about letting folks know who is influencing our government.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately it\u2019s important to our democracy because honesty and transparency are important to our democracy,\u201d he added.\n\nThe coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans also endured criticism from hardline conservatives because they sent the bill to the House Business and Labor Committee instead of the House State Administration Committee, where election bills are normally assigned. Then, the same coalition blasted SB289 out of committee before it acted on it and sent the measure directly to the floor.\n\nBut Garner remained stalwart, and during the debate on the House floor he concluded by saying the bill would make Montana elections fairer and more transparent and \u201cprovide a place full of light where darkness dare not tread.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe future of our elections are in our hands,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then asked lawmakers to open their desk drawers and consider the legacy left by former lawmakers, who in a long-standing tradition signed their names on the wooden slate. He asked his colleagues to consider their own legacy.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of hard decisions that need to be made during this process,\u201d Garner added. \u201cIt is not an easy job, and I think that\u2019s how it should be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Flathead Beacon", "description": "HELENA \u2013 Frank Garner arrived in Helena with the same statesmanlike principles intact that characterized his campaign for a seat in the state House of Representatives \u2013 standing up for...  more", "title": "Garner Displays Independent Streak During 2015 Session - Flathead Beacon", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/20150424_HELENA_040.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-29T08:35:10-06:00", "url": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/2015/04/28/garner-displays-independent-streak-during-2015-session/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/themes/flathead-beacon/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FlatheadBeacon", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-04-28T14:53:39-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T08:35:10-06:00"}, "google-site-verification": "x7bqQRTLUVbNNQe0HUJ0bnx_EXmr6uOwcIs_ZIT9n9g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21e7\"", "article_summary": "Garner, who did not support full Medicaid expansion this session but ultimately supported a compromise bill that expands coverage to the working poor, wasn\u2019t satisfied with AFP\u2019s answer.\n\u201cThere are a lot of hard decisions that need to be made during this process,\u201d Garner added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that they take a big bill like this and give it to a freshman to carry it,\u201d Garner said.\nSenate Bill 289 was sponsored by Republican Sen.
