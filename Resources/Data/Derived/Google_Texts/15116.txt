In one study conducted by the University of Wisconsin and published in March, researchers found that female mortality rates rose in 43 percent of U.S. counties from the early â€™90s to 2006 and that women aged 75 and younger were dying at higher rates than their predecessors. At the same time, the life expectancy for men did not change.

A more recent report confirmed these findings, revealing that female life expectancy either stagnated or declined in 45 percent of U.S. counties between 1985 and 2010.

In both studies, scientists are baffled about what is causing the decline, although some attribute the higher mortality rates to obesity, smoking rates and higher education levels.

Co-author of the Washingston study, David Kindig, said he was so shocked by the findings that he did the numbers again only to find the same result. He lso said that health care, or lack thereof, may not be the whole story:
