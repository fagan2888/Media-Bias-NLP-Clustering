Ted Cruz has been peddling for two years, since the defeat of Mitt Romney.\n\nRomney? A good man. John McCain? Bob Dole? Decent men. Patriots. But each, in the Cruz analysis \u2014 which just happens to tilt the playing field his way \u2014 was doomed. And the next in this line of certain failures would be the candidate to draw the most attention lately, Jeb Bush, brother and son of presidents and darling of the party\u2019s establishment.\n\n\u201cWe need to learn from history,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nThat was two months ago, throwing an elbow when Bush was merely eyeing a run. Last week, Bush became the first candidate to announce he\u2019ll explore a bid. And Cruz\u2019s warning got more overt.\n\n\u201cThe only way we win in 2016 is if we follow Reagan\u2019s admonition \u2014 if we paint in bold colors and not pale pastels,\u201d the senator told Sean Hannity on Fox News. \u201cIf we continue to run to the mushy middle \u2026 the same voters that stayed home in 2008 and 2012 will stay home again, and we will not win.\u201d\n\nCentrists can win, actually. Jeb Bush\u2019s brother and father didn\u2019t run as dogmatic right-wingers. And there\u2019s that inconvenient data point from 1964: Barry Goldwater, the conservative senator from Arizona, crushed in a landslide.\n\n\u201cThe public is clearly not looking for an ideological president. They are looking for a president who can get things done,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, a self-described \u201cGoldwater girl\u201d in her younger days.\n\nBush allies reject depictions of him as anything but a true-blue conservative. In any case, even with showers of cash from his family\u2019s robust donor network, there\u2019s no easy path to the GOP nomination for him or anyone else.\n\nHe\u2019ll need to get past New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for one. And the eventual winner from that wing of the party will end up in a showdown with Cruz or whoever else emerges from the right \u2014 outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, perhaps, or Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio or any of a half-dozen others.\n\n\u201cWhile people are nostalgic for the Clinton years, they are not nostalgic for the Bush years,\u201d Lake said.\n\nJockeying for 2016 was already well underway when Bush made known his intentions on Facebook, a first for the Bush dynasty. President Barack Obama\u2019s d\u00e9tente with Cuba exposed big differences in the GOP field, with Paul lauding the effort to set aside a Cold War remnant and Rubio, in particular, accusing Paul of being a dupe.\n\nCruz, like others, has been making preparations.\n\nA few weeks ago, his Princeton University roommate and debate partner, Atlanta investor David Panton, started a super PAC devoted to promoting Cruz for president. Panton seeded the effort with $100,000, and two other donors kicked in $35,000, campaign filings show.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to go the distance, but it signals that Cruz has friends willing to pony up serious money.\n\nBut GOP pollster Ed Goeas sees obstacles for Cruz. One is the large and impressive class of Senate Republicans in the new majority.\n\n\u201cWe did not nominate any crazies,\u201d Goeas said, adding, \u201cThe more the country sees the quality of that class, the more people like Ted Cruz are going to fade into the background.\u201d\n\nThe failings of the current president also hurt Cruz, he argued. They may have little in common politically. But the Texan is just as untested as the president was ahead of his 2008 campaign.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve always seen in polling is that people elect legislators based on are you smart enough to govern. They elect mayors, they elect governors, they elect presidents, on are you strong enough to lead,\u201d Goeas said. \u201cThere is a lot of feeling, even on the left, that maybe we elected a president with not enough experience to get the job done. \u2026 That works against Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nCruz prefers to frame the choice through litmus tests. The next president, he argues, should be standing up and proclaiming that the economy is a mess, Obamacare is a \u201ctrain wreck,\u201d and the Constitution and American clout are under siege.\n\nThat, of course, would be a description of himself.\n\nFollow Washington Bureau chief Todd J.
