But the operator refused to credit Fristoe as an agent on the application, meaning he wouldn't get the commission or be listed as the follow-up contact if his client needed help again later.\n\nThe Wichita Falls, Texas, insurance agent is one of many brokers around the country finding frustration as they try to help customers navigate the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces while earning the commissions they've long built their businesses around. Some insurers and insurance agents are calling on President Barack Obama's administration to allow them to bypass HealthCare.gov and enroll consumers directly amid growing complaints about problems with enrollment information generated from the website.\n\nThe so-called `back-end' problems could mean that consumers who think they've successfully signed up for a health plan, may find themselves unable to access their coverage come January. The problems include enrollment information that's rendered practically useless by errors, duplication or garbles. Efforts to fix the issues are underway.\n\n(Read more: Obamacare 'perfect storm'\u2014Feds reveal 10 percent error rate)\n\n\n\nNearly 70,000 agents and brokers have been certified nationwide to sell health insurance on the federal exchange. Many say they could be the troubled health law's best ambassadors with the potential to boost lackluster enrollment figures\u2014only about 27,000 had enrolled via the federal website nationwide in the first month. But instead, many agents said they're continually met by obstacles.\n\n\"You look at this dismal number they have of how many people have enrolled on healthcare.gov,\" said Fristoe. \"If they would just relax and loosen up, because me and all of my associates across this nation want to help these consumers get enrolled into the market.\"\n\nFederal health officials announced on Nov. 22 that they'd fixed some portions of the website to allow more insurers and insurance agents to enroll consumers directly. The feds are asking roughly 16 insurers, agents and brokers in Florida, Texas and Ohio to test it out and give detailed feedback about the fixes, hoping to expand it to other states in the coming weeks. Health officials have been vague about the scope of the botched applications insurers are receiving and what steps they're taking to fix the problems. One bug related to Social Security numbers, which federal health officials said accounted for more than 80 percent of insurers' problems, was fixed last weekend.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Insurance agents are frustrated that as they try to help customers navigate Obamacare's marketplaces, they aren't earning the commissions they've long built their businesses around.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare health exchanges, cost cutting, insurance agents.", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Insurance agents are frustrated that as they try to help customers navigate Obamacare's marketplaces, they aren't earning the commissions they've long built their businesses around.", "title": "Left out: Insurance agents' struggle with Obamacare", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/08/insurance-agents-feeling-left-out-of-obamacare.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/11/26/101228314-187991339.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Insurance agents are frustrated that as they try to help customers navigate Obamacare's marketplaces, they aren't earning the commissions they've long built their businesses around.", "title": "Insurance agents feeling left out of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/08/insurance-agents-feeling-left-out-of-obamacare.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/11/26/101228314-187991339.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Obamacare, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, Insurance, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2013-12-08T11:29:30-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2013-12-09T07:16:50-0500", "tag": "Insurance"}, "pageNodeId": 101255736, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ea1\"", "article_summary": "(Read more: Obamacare 'perfect storm'\u2014Feds reveal 10 percent error rate)Nearly 70,000 agents and brokers have been certified nationwide to sell health insurance on the federal exchange.\nFederal health officials announced on Nov. 22 that they'd fixed some portions of the website to allow more insurers and insurance agents to enroll consumers directly.\nOne bug related to Social Security numbers, which federal health officials said accounted for more than 80 percent of insurers' problems, was fixed last weekend.\nHealth officials have been vague about the scope of the botched applications insurers are receiving and what steps they're taking to fix the problems.\nSome insurers and insurance agents are calling on President Barack Obama's administration to allow them to bypass HealthCare.gov and enroll consumers directly amid growing complaints about problems with enrollment information generated from the website."}
