But U.S. officials have said the Obama administration is considering ways in which non-U.S. companies could use the dollar in some business transactions with Iran.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said on Monday that Kerry would also press Iran to use its influence over the Syrian government to end Syria's five-year-old civil war.\n\nNeither Kerry nor Zarif mentioned Syria.\n\n(Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "U.S., Iran discuss fulfilling nuclear deal pledges to Tehran", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/US-Iran-diplomats-meet-UN-sanctions-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-kerry_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/US-Iran-diplomats-meet-UN-sanctions-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-kerry_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Iran and six world powers clinched a historic nuclear agreement in July 2015, which allowed for the easing of some sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and United Nations in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.\nTehran's top diplomat added that he and Kerry on Friday would discuss ways of getting their ideas into operation.\nZarif said they discussed ways to \"make sure that we will draw the benefits that Iran is entitled to from the implementation of the agreement.\"\nTehran has called on the United States to do more to remove obstacles to the banking sector so that businesses feel comfortable with investing in Iran without penalties.\nUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Tuesday discussed ways of ensuring that last year's historic nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers is implemented the way it was originally envisioned."}
