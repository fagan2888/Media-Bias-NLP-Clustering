This is spurring adoption rate at a clinical and ambulatory level.\n\n\n\n- The POCT market for cardiac biomarkers is spurring the growth in this region.\n\n\n\n- With the implementation of Affordable Care Act (ACA), there is a shift toward value-based care. This is increasing pressure on manufacturers to produce more cost efficient and efficient devices for consumers, especially in the hospital sector.\n\n\n\n- Manufacturers are seeing the value of integrated and wholesome platform solutions in this emerging value-based system.\n\n\n\n- Device companies like Medtronic are entering the cardiac space to provide telehealth solutions to patients. Siemens and Roche have a unique advantage due to their strong affiliation with their medical devices and pharmaceutical wings, respectively.\n\n\n\n- Companies with different diagnostic wings have a unique advantage, as they can offer a more integrated solution to diagnose a patient.\n\n\n\n- Still in the early stages, the cardiovascular segment has tremendous potential for personalized medicine. There is a movement toward this space similar to other fields, like oncology.\n\n\n\n- In the future, heart failure therapy is going to utilize a combination of multiple markers for risk assessment and diagnosis. Many of these biomarker tests are going to combine into a panel test rather than compete individually.\n\n\n\n- Products with a narrow therapeutic index, which can be dangerous either over- or underdosing, have a higher profitability capacity to develop companion diagnostic tests to determine sensitivity to the product.\n\n\n\n- Companion diagnostics is a major opportunity for manufacturers as cardiovascular disease holds only % of the overall companion diagnostics market space.\n\n\n\n- Integrating digital apps enables manufacturers to understand consumer behavior but also provide differentiated products compared to competitors.\n\n\n\n- Manufacturers can begin to offer consultations and services for biomarker testing and not be exclusive to providing lab solutions.\n\n\n\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3327250/\n\n\n\nAbout Reportbuyer\n\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\n\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\n\n\n\nFor more information:\n\nSarah Smith\n\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\n\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\n\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\n\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n\nSOURCE ReportBuyer", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "england", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "LONDON, Feb. 17", "description": "LONDON, Feb. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Analysis of the Cardiac Biomarker Diagnostics Market.", "author": "ReportBuyer", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/analysis-of-the-cardiac-biomarker-diagnostics-market-300221914.html", "image": "http://content.prnewswire.com/images/prn_facebook_sharing_logo.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "LONDON, Feb. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Analysis of the Cardiac Biomarker Diagnostics Market\u00a0\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe...", "title": "Analysis of the Cardiac Biomarker Diagnostics Market"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "Analysis of the Cardiac Biomarker Diagnostics Market", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "keywords": "ReportBuyer, england, Surveys, Polls and Research, Publishing & Information Services, Health Care & Hospitals, Medical Pharmaceuticals", "date": "2016-02-17T19:36:00Z", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0316\"", "article_summary": "LONDON, Feb. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Analysis of the Cardiac Biomarker Diagnostics MarketKey FindingsThe overall US cardiac biomarker diagnostic market stands at $ million in 2014 and is predicted to grow to $ million by 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of %.\n- Companion diagnostics is a major opportunity for manufacturers as cardiovascular disease holds only % of the overall companion diagnostics market space.\n- The increasing adoption of point-of-care tests (POCTs) in the United States makes this segment the fastest growing, where it holds close to % of the cardiac biomarker market.\nMany of these biomarker tests are going to combine into a panel test rather than compete individually.\n- Device companies like Medtronic are entering the cardiac space to provide telehealth solutions to patients."}
