Public service, especially military service, is what allows us to have these debates.\n\n\u201cBut, here\u2019s the deal. Mark Bircher is about as Tea Party as it gets. \u201cHe wants Medicare, Social Security, and the Affordable Care Act repealed. \u201cYou read that right. \u201cMedicare. Social Security. And the Affordable Care Act. Repealed. \u201cThat\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d\n\nCrist then follows up by making the ask.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to welcome him to the race? How about a contribution, of any amount, to the right side of history?\u2019\n\nBircher is extremely conservative, which made it a challenge for him in his first bid for electoral office last year against fellow Republicans David Jolly and Kathleen Peters. The district has now become more Democratic-leaning with redistricting, making it a challenge for any Republican to win the seat that was held by the late Bill Young for over four decades.\n\nCrist is running against former Obama Defense Department adviser Eric Lynn in the CD 13 Democratic primary.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Congressional District 13 Democratic hopeful\u00a0Charlie Crist\u00a0is coming out swinging against Republican\u00a0Mark Bircher, in advance of Bircher\u2019s formal kickoff campaign announcement Tuesday night.
