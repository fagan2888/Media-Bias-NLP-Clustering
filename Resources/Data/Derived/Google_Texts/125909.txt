Cherokee Casino employees across northeast Oklahoma help keep drivers safe by removing debris and litter alongside Oklahoma highways.

The continual effort is a part of Oklahoma’s Adopt-A-Highway program.

“We enjoy volunteering and helping our local communities,” said Erin Williams, shift manager at Cherokee Casino Fort Gibson. “It feels good to give back to the community we work in, while also doing our part to keep our great state clean.”

Employees recently cleared stretches of 12 Oklahoma highways, with seven more scheduled before the year ends. So far, 73 employees have participated and volunteered more than 230 hours during recent clean-up efforts.

“The Oklahoma Department of Transportation is thrilled to have Cherokee Nation Businesses as a partner in our Adopt-A-Highway program,” said Melody Johnson, ODOT state beautification coordinator. “It’s a free and easy way for groups to help beautify their communities, and CNB has shown it’s committed to doing just that. We truly appreciate CNB and its employees for making a concerted effort to take part in clean-up events year-round and for making the pledge to keep Oklahoma beautiful.”

Cherokee Nation Entertainment employees pick up trash along highways near Cherokee Casino locations throughout northeastern Oklahoma every year. In their effort to beautify local communities, Cherokee Casino employees have additional clean-up days scheduled throughout the year.

The annual projects are coordinated through the company’s Community Impact Team, which helps promote volunteerism and community engagement for all employees. All seven of CNE’s Cherokee Casinos and Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tulsa have separate CIT teams that participate in the Adopt-A-Highway program.
