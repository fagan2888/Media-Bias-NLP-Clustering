Marco Rubio, brought up the subject of Trump University, a now-defunct business that Trump established to sell supposedly educational courses and seminars on entrepreneurship. Trump University is currently being sued for fraud by numerous former students, who said that they were pressured to take on debt to pay for tens of thousands of dollars in fees and that the company did not deliver the type of educational experience it promised.\n\nRelated: Trump Numbers Are Falling \u2013 How Far Can They Go?\n\nOn stage last week, Trump angrily challenged criticism of Trump University, insisting that the organization had a \u201c98 percent\u201d approval rating among its students.\n\nBut it was when Rubio brought up the company\u2019s D- grade from the Better Business Bureau that Trump really started to get creative.\n\nHe conceded that at one point the company did have a D- rating from the Better Business Bureau, but he said the rating was poor only because Trump University hadn\u2019t bothered to submit data to the BBB. He insisted that the grade was subsequently \u201celevated to an A\u201d once the data was supplied.\n\n\u201cThe only reason that is was a D was because we didn't care -- we didn't give them the information...\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen they got the information it became an A.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Donald Trump\u2019s Lies May Be Good for U.S. Politics\n\nDuring a commercial break, Trump was given a fax from his staff, which he handed to Fox moderator Bret Baier. He later posted the document on Facebook. It appeared to be a BBB Business Review giving Trump University (actually, Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, after a 2011 name change) an A grade.\n\nAt least one news organization reported, at the time, that the document appeared to have been faxed to the Fox News set by the BBB itself.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Council of Better Business Bureaus issued a detailed statement setting the record straight.\n\n\u201cBBB did not send a document of any kind to the Republican debate site last Thursday evening,\u201d it read. \u201cThe document presented to debate moderators did not come from BBB that night.\u201d\n\nIt continued, \u201cTrump University does not currently have an A rating with BBB. The BBB Business Review for this company has continually been \u201cNo Rating\u201d since September 2015. Prior to that, it fluctuated between D- and A+. The document posted on social media on Thursday night was not a current BBB Business Review of Trump University. It appeared to be part of a Business Review from 2014.\u201d\n\nRelated: Irony Alert: Trump Is Upset that Ted Cruz Is Lying\n\nMore damning, though, was the BBB\u2019s account of how Trump University\u2019s rating went from a D- to an A. The BBB said that, despite Trump\u2019s claims to the contrary, the rating was never increased as a result of new information received from the company.\n\nWhat happened is that as Trump University failed as a business, it stopped attracting new students, and with no new students, there were no more complaints filed to the BBB.\n\n\u201cDuring the period when Trump University appeared to be active in the marketplace, BBB received multiple customer complaints about this business,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThese complaints affected the Trump University BBB rating, which was as low as D- in 2010. As the company appeared to be winding down, after 2013, no new complaints were reported.\n\n\u201cComplaints over three years old automatically rolled off of the Business Review, according to BBB policy. As a result, over time, Trump University\u2019s BBB rating went to an A in July 2014 and then to an A+ in January 2015.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Net Worth Isn\u2019t His Only Claim That\u2019s Fake\n\nIn other words, Trump was lying about Trump University\u2019s rating on national television, and even provided misleading documentary evidence in real time to help him make his case.\n\nIn a sane campaign season, this sort of thing would be utterly disqualifying, but whether it will have much effect on Trump\u2019s core support is doubtful. The billionaire\u2019s supporters have proven remarkably immune to factual arguments about Trump\u2019s obvious deficiencies as a candidate, and uninterested in proof that he frequently lies to them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Council of Better Business Bureaus is calling out Donald Trump for what appears to", "title": "Better Business Bureau: Trump Lied About Our Ratings", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/08/Better-Business-Bureau-Trump-University-Had-D-Rating", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Trump-University-Scam.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/08/Better-Business-Bureau-Trump-University-Had-D-Rating", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Trump-University-Scam.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Council of Better Business Bureaus is calling out Donald Trump for what appears to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It appeared to be a BBB Business Review giving Trump University (actually, Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, after a 2011 name change) an A grade.\nThe document posted on social media on Thursday night was not a current BBB Business Review of Trump University.\nBut it was when Rubio brought up the company\u2019s D- grade from the Better Business Bureau that Trump really started to get creative.\nOn stage last week, Trump angrily challenged criticism of Trump University, insisting that the organization had a \u201c98 percent\u201d approval rating among its students.\n\u201cThese complaints affected the Trump University BBB rating, which was as low as D- in 2010."}
