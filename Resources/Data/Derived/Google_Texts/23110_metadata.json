But that may be about to change.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports nearly 50 wind turbines could be built in southwestern Wisconsin over the next year. A global renewable energy company based in Spain hopes to build the Lafayette County wind farm in 2017. The project is valued at about $200 million.\n\nAnd state regulators are taking another look at a proposed $250 million wind farm in western Wisconsin.\n\nEmerging Energies of Wisconsin wants to build 44 large wind turbines in St. Croix County. Residents have opposed the project, but the state Public Service commission decided Friday to reopen the case.\n\nCopyright 2016: Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wind power may be about to pick up in Wisconsin.", "language": "english", "author": "NBC15", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/After-5-year-drought-Wisconsin-wind-power-may-pick-up-371892472.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/420*315/wind49.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wind power may be about to pick up in Wisconsin.", "title": "After 5-year drought, Wisconsin wind power may pick up"}, "twitter": {"description": "MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wind power may be about to pick up in Wisconsin.", "creator": "@nbc15_madison", "url": "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/After-5-year-drought-Wisconsin-wind-power-may-pick-up-371892472.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/420*315/wind49.jpg", "title": "After 5-year drought, Wisconsin wind power may pick up", "site": "@nbc15_madison", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "After 5-year drought, Wisconsin wind power may pick up", "google-site-verification": "nVn1exeOti1r4o5YNXcCBEDU1eFrVztxyWcqAwhz9WA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "After 5year drought, Wisconsin wind power may pick"}, "article_summary": "POSTED: Saturday, March 12, 2016 --- 6:31 p.m.MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Wind power may be about to pick up in Wisconsin.\nA global renewable energy company based in Spain hopes to build the Lafayette County wind farm in 2017.\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports nearly 50 wind turbines could be built in southwestern Wisconsin over the next year.\nAnd state regulators are taking another look at a proposed $250 million wind farm in western Wisconsin.\nEmerging Energies of Wisconsin wants to build 44 large wind turbines in St. Croix County."}
