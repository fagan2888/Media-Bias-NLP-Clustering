The Obama administration has less than a month left to achieve its goal of enrolling 9.1 million people in insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but appears to be nearly there. More than 7.1 million consumers have now signed up for coverage, according to this week's release of enrollment numbers from the Department of Health and Human Services. That number includes new enrollees and automatic re-enrollments through the HealthCare.gov platform.

The new total means the administration is about 80 percent of the way to its goal, though it's likely even closer, since that 7.1 million doesn't include enrollments by consumers in states running their own health insurance exchanges.

The last enrollment deadline is Feb. 15; consumers need to sign up by then to gain coverage this year.
