No, it\u2019s not the bike from \u201cThe Wild One\u201d \u2014 that was a Triumph Thunderbird. Rather, this is a 1969 Harley-Davidson HOG, +0.42% FLH Electra-Glide purchased by Brando in 1970, well after \u201cThe Wild One\u201d was filmed (but just before \u201cThe Godfather\u201d). A transfer notice from Harley-Davidson in Los Angeles to Brando proves it was once his, and based on the 13,859-mile odometer reading, he spent a fair amount of time in the saddle.\n\nSteve McQueen-owned bikes usually dominate the \u201cmotorcycle with celebrity provenance\u201d headlines, and for good reason: McQueen, a well-known lover of all things gasoline-powered, owned a lot of them. Brando, by contrast, isn\u2019t really recognized as a gear head, despite his defining role in \u201cThe Wild One.\u201d So that makes this Harley somewhat special.\n\nJulian It\u2019s no Triumph, but Brando\u2019s 1969 Harley is still a smooth ride.\n\nTo be the only guy on a Brando bike in a sea of ex-McQueen Husqvarnas, however, you\u2019ll have to pay handsomely: Starting bid for this online auction, which ends June 26, is a cool $100,000, and the expected hammer price is between $200,000 and $400,000.\n\nThat seems a tad optimistic to us, but that\u2019s a far cry for the most ever paid for a motorcycle at auction \u2014 $852,000 for a 1915 Cyclone. Yes, it was once owned by Steve McQueen. On the plus side, you can use that extra cash to bid on a Brando-owned leather jacket. There\u2019s a whole bunch of them on the block courtesy of the same auction house selling the bike.\n\nHead to Julien\u2019s Auctions to check out the Harley or to cast a bid.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Be The Wild One: Bid on Marlon Brando\u2019s motorcycle.", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DN186_AW_bra_MG_20150602143041.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Graham Kozak", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Be The Wild One: Bid on Marlon Brando\u2019s motorcycle.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/your-chance-to-own-brandos-harley-2015-06-06", "author": "Graham Kozak", "parsely-title": "Your chance to own Brando\u2019s Harley", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-06T06:00:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Be The Wild One: Bid on Marlon Brando\u2019s motorcycle.", "title": "Your chance to own Brando\u2019s Harley", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/your-chance-to-own-brandos-harley-2015-06-06", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DN186_AW_bra_MG_20150602143041.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DN186_AW_bra_MG_20150602143041.jpg"}, "article.id": "681A1F6E-095A-11E5-971E-11C57B18DFE4", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Julian It\u2019s no Triumph, but Brando\u2019s 1969 Harley is still a smooth ride.\nHead to Julien\u2019s Auctions to check out the Harley or to cast a bid.\nBrando, by contrast, isn\u2019t really recognized as a gear head, despite his defining role in \u201cThe Wild One.\u201d So that makes this Harley somewhat special.\nAnd now, you can bid on one of Brando\u2019s personal motorcycles.\nNo, it\u2019s not the bike from \u201cThe Wild One\u201d \u2014 that was a Triumph Thunderbird."}
