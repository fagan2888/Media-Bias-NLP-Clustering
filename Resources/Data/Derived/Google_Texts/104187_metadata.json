Tyler H. Jones | Daily News\n\nLaGRANGE \u2014 There is no question that the medical landscape has changed in the wake of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare.\n\nAs hospitals and care providers across the country cope with new requirements, payment mechanisms and changing regulation, that landscape is shrinking.\n\nIf West Georgia Health merges with Marietta-based WellStar Health System next month as expected, it would make WellStar the largest health care system in Georgia, with 11 hospitals under its belt and a service area that encompasses the greater northern part of the largest state east of the Mississippi River.\n\nDuring a breakfast meeting with the LaGrange-Troup County Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, WellStar\u2019s CEO, Candice Saunders, addressed that topic.\n\n\u201cThere is increasing consolidation around the country, including with insurers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching that very closely.\u201d\n\nBehind the trend is a move to create \u201ceconomies of scale,\u201d Saunders said. Health care is expensive and having a network of providers, specialists and hospitals is necessary to provide low-cost, affordable care, she said.\n\n\u201cThe goal is sustainability,\u201d Saunders added.\n\nWest Georgia Health isn\u2019t the only system WellStar has its eyes on.\n\nUnder a definitive agreement signed in December, WellStar is poised to purchase Dallas, Texas-based Tenet Healthcare and its five metro-Atlanta hospitals.\n\nAs a result of these changes, WellStar would employ about 20,000 people across their 11 hospital campuses, more than 200 medical office locations and numerous outpatient facilities. The purchase of the Tenet facilities will be submitted to the Federal Trade Commission for review, according to a press release from WellStar.\n\nSimilarly, the WGH and WellStar partnership requires the approval of the Georgia attorney general following a public hearing process held last month. That approval is expected by the end of this week or early next week.\n\nWithin the next few years, there could be as few as five major health care providers in North Georgia, Saunders said Tuesday.\n\nAlthough WellStar will be the biggest, that isn\u2019t their overall goal, according to Tyler Pearson, a spokesman for WellStar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about getting bigger,\u201d he wrote in an email to the Daily News. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we will be able to improve the quality of care we offer and increase patient access. Together, we will be better prepared to address challenges in the health care industry.\u201d\n\nSaunders echoed that sentiment Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is about ensuring local access,\u201d she said.\n\nPending approval by the Georgia Attorney General\u2019s office, WellStar and West Georgia Health are expected to sign a merger agreement March 7. The agreement would take effect April 1, according to officials at West Georgia Health.\n\nTyler H. Jones is a reporter with LaGrange Daily News.
