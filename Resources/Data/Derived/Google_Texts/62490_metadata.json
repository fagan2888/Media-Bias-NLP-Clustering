Ms. Mahmud, 39, had devoted her life to creating an alternative to the religious nationalism promoted by the Pakistani state over recent decades, which has led to a proliferation of violent jihadist organizations. She was gunned down on Friday night as she left the arts center she had founded.\n\nIn the country\u2019s largest city, troubled by violence and crumbling institutions, Ms. Mahmud created a hub to promote the arts, harness creative talent and foster democratic dialogue. Since 2007, The Second Floor, commonly known as T2F, had evolved as a small but significant arena for pluralist and secular movements in the Islamic Republic. In Pakistan\u2019s deeply conservative, repressive society, this was a kind of liberation theology.\n\nHours before she was shot, Ms. Mahmud, a tech entrepreneur as well as a social activist, hosted human rights advocates who were campaigning against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in insurgency-hit Balochistan Province. After the government ordered the cancellation of the event, which was called \u201cUnsilencing Balochistan\u201d and was to be held at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, Ms. Mahmud offered T2F as a venue.\n\nThe government is deeply worried about the insurgency in Balochistan. The commonly held \u2014 and vigorously promoted \u2014 view is that Pakistan\u2019s great rival, India, is supporting the insurgency. Thus advocating for the rights of the Baloch people is regarded as treasonous.\n\nThis act of defying state censorship by Ms. Mahmud\u2019s arts center appears to have been the reason for her death. While some suspect the hand of the government in her assassination, the truth is that the state has long since ceased to exercise a monopoly over violence in Pakistan. As authority has fragmented, extremist groups that originally acted at the behest of the state now also act autonomously to perpetrate violence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the wake of the Pakistani Taliban\u2019s bloody attack on a military school in Peshawar in December, the government and the military have begun to try to wrest control of the situation \u2014 but their task is like repacking Pandora\u2019s box. In recent years, scores of human rights defenders, public intellectuals, journalists and secular politicians have been attacked or killed in Pakistan. Perpetrators are rarely, if ever, put on trial.\n\nAnyone who espouses liberal, secular views and becomes a public figure is a potential target. In Lahore, last March, my driver was shot dead and a guard was injured by unknown assailants in an attempt on my life. I was lucky to escape alive. The police later claimed that Islamic extremists were responsible. A month later, the popular television journalist Hamid Mir survived a similar attack in Karachi. He still has three bullets in his body. A year later, the assailants have not been identified.\n\nWhen Mr. Mir\u2019s family and his media group voiced a view that Pakistan\u2019s spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, or ISI, was behind the shooting, they were forced to recant. The TV channel\u2019s transmission was blocked for a time, and the rival media groups moved quickly to prove their loyalty to the military. Since then, hard-earned press freedoms have suffered still further. Television news no longer even reports on \u201csensitive\u201d issues like the Balochistan insurgency.\n\nThe seeds of today\u2019s social conflict were sown during the dictatorship of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who governed from 1977 to 1988. President Zia radically altered the constitutional nature of the Pakistani state, ushering in a set of sectarian laws that, among other things, reduced the value of a woman\u2019s testimony to half that of a man\u2019s. The West bears some responsibility for supporting the Zia regime because that advanced its Cold War interests in Afghanistan, but after 1989, Pakistan had a choice.\n\nUnfortunately, it opted to continue with General Zia\u2019s agenda of promoting religious radicalization at home and using jihadist groups as tools of foreign policy. Even school textbooks reflected an India-hating, militarized Islamic nationalism as the underpinnings of the country\u2019s identity.\n\nSubsequent governments have been unwilling or unable to reverse this trend for two generations. Ms. Mahmud was one who strove to present alternative ideas about Pakistan for its youthful population: The median age in Pakistan is under 23. Many young people regarded Ms. Mahmud as an inspirational model.\n\nMost of T2F\u2019s regulars came at first from relatively affluent backgrounds, but recently the space had started to attract young men and women from low-income communities, too. It was also a place where transgender citizens could come and be treated with respect.\n\nIn 2013, Ms. Mahmud ran an online campaign to counter efforts by Islamists to suppress Valentine\u2019s Day. That led to death threats, but with courage and optimism, she stuck to her work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Mahmud also championed one of Pakistan\u2019s last remaining domains of free expression \u2014 social media. That, too, is now endangered: A parliamentary committee recently approved the draft of a cybercrime law that would curtail digital freedoms.\n\nPakistan\u2019s beleaguered liberals must reorganize themselves and mobilize civil society support. They must exert pressure on Parliament and the government to investigate properly and prosecute cases like Ms. Mahmud\u2019s assassination. In addition, they must lobby for reforms of the judicial system to hold the executive authorities accountable and to enforce Pakistan\u2019s fading press freedoms.\n\nThe international community should recognize that progress on fighting the Taliban is only part of the story. The Pakistani state must also be pushed to respect civil liberties and not allow the wanton slaying of liberal activists. Unless it does so, Pakistan\u2019s democracy will slide back toward a disastrous authoritarianism.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150429062123, "twitter": {"description": "The assassination of a leading rights advocate is the latest attempt to silence liberals in Pakistan.", "title": "Sabeen Mahmud, Martyr for Free Speech", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/opinion/sabeen-mahmud-martyr-for-free-speech.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003655597"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/opinion/sabeen-mahmud-martyr-for-free-speech.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003655597", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/opinion/sabeen-mahmud-martyr-for-free-speech.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "A Martyr for Free Speech", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 29, 2015", "edt": "Global", "keywords": "Pakistan,Assassinations and Attempted Assassinations,Politics and Government,Censorship", "news_keywords": "Pakistan,Censorship", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Raza Rumi", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By RAZA RUMI", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The assassination of a leading rights advocate is the latest attempt to silence liberals in Pakistan.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The assassination of a leading rights advocate is the latest attempt to silence liberals in Pakistan.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 29, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-04-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Censorship", "published": "2015-04-29", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "Pakistan", "slug": "30iht-edrumi30", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150430024110, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/opinion/sabeen-mahmud-martyr-for-free-speech.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The assassination of a leading rights advocate is the latest attempt to silence liberals in Pakistan.", "title": "Sabeen Mahmud, Martyr for Free Speech"}, "pdate": 20150429, "des": "Censorship", "articleid": 100000003655597, "cre": "International New York Times", "hdl": "Sabeen Mahmud, Martyr for Free Speech", "col": "Op-Ed Contributor", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7c7\"", "article_summary": "In 2013, Ms. Mahmud ran an online campaign to counter efforts by Islamists to suppress Valentine\u2019s Day.\nThe Pakistani state must also be pushed to respect civil liberties and not allow the wanton slaying of liberal activists.\nIn the country\u2019s largest city, troubled by violence and crumbling institutions, Ms. Mahmud created a hub to promote the arts, harness creative talent and foster democratic dialogue.\nMany young people regarded Ms. Mahmud as an inspirational model.\nMs. Mahmud was one who strove to present alternative ideas about Pakistan for its youthful population: The median age in Pakistan is under 23."}
