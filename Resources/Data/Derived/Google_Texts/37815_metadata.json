The legislature, the governor\u2019s office, and the political culture of California share culpability for decades of neglect and strategic misdirection, the commission says.\n\nThe program falls \u201cdisastrously short in providing dental care to a third of California\u2019s population and more than half of its children.\u201d\n\nA more vivid description comes from Pedro Nava, the commission\u2019s chairman:\n\n\u201cIn California we have kids\u2019 teeth rotting out of their heads,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s utterly inexcusable.\u201d\n\nDental Profession \u2018Thoroughly Alienated\u2019\n\nThe report makes grim reading. California faces an \u201cepidemic of tooth disease in which toddlers by the thousands have mouthfuls of cavities, children and adults are plagued with toothaches, whole counties have no Denti-Cal providers and families don\u2019t understand basic preventative dental care,\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Denti-Cal has \u201cthoroughly alienated the dental profession\u201d with tangles of red tape and \u201creimbursement rates among the nation\u2019s lowest,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn sum, the commission said it\u2019s time to \u201creboot\u201d Denti-Cal.\n\nThe program is run by the state Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Care, California\u2019s version of Medicaid.\n\nThe department released a lengthy prepared response to questions from CHL, which includes this statement:\n\n\u201cDHCS is strongly committed to providing access to quality dental care for our millions of Medi-Cal members, and Director Jennifer Kent has publicly stated that improving the Denti-Cal program is one of her top priorities.\u201d\n\nNava has heard it before. \u201cI have been completely underwhelmed by the response of the department,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir efforts have been far too little and far too late.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the department though. Acccording to the report, \u201cBlame goes so much deeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuccessive legislatures and administrations,\u201d the commission said, \u201chave underfunded the Denti-Cal program and slashed reimbursement rates for dental providers to national lows. The state has historically lacked any strategy to prevent dental disease among its neediest populations.\u201d\n\nEvidence is widespread that bad dental health can seriously affect general health, making more people sick and driving health costs even higher.\n\nBut in California, there is a Denti-Cal dentist shortage.\n\nMany dentists say they lose money on state-funded patients, so caring for them becomes a form of charity work.\n\nJohn Blake is a dentist who gave up a private practice in Long Beach to run the Children\u2019s Dental Health Clinic in Long Beach, where about 85 percent of patients are on Denti-Cal.\n\nBlake said he just wants to break even \u2014 the business is a non-profit \u2014 25 percent of his overhead is paid for through donations and fund-raising events. It\u2019s impossible to cover costs with the low payments from the state, he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of my colleagues used to take Denti-Cal, but it\u2019s not just the low rates, it\u2019s that the hassle of the system is so much worse than reimbursement. The hassle factor just got to be too much,\u201d Blake said. \u201cThey just gave up.\u201d\n\nLittle Hoover more formally addressed the hassle factor, noting that copious pre-authorizations for basic procedures are a major hassle, never mind a a clunky billing system, much of it still paper-based, and a 22-page application form just to participate in the program.\n\nCamille Nishikawa is a dentist in Los Angeles who doesn\u2019t have those problems. She runs the QueensCare mobile dental clinic in partnership with USC Medical Center, which travels to the poorest parts of LA to take care of kids\u2019 teeth. The mobile dental van is funded by grants; it doesn\u2019t accept any money from patients or from Denti-Cal.\n\nChildren \u2018Suffer in Pain\u2019\n\nOrganizational dysfunction is only part of the problem with Denti-Cal, Nishikawa said. Many poor people who are eligible for the program\u2019s benefits don\u2019t even know about them.\n\n\u201cA lot of the community isn\u2019t aware of what they\u2019re entitled to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if they do, they don\u2019t know where to go to find a dentist.\u201d\n\nRuth Sandoval is one of those low-income people, a mostly Spanish-speaking mother of two in Los Angeles. She said she had no idea she and her two children could even get dental care as part of their Medi-Cal program. \u201cIt has been hard to find a dentist; it\u2019s very hard to find one,\u201d Sandoval said.\n\nShe went to a clinic in LA for a different health problem and discovered a dentist on staff. She\u2019s grateful for that, she said, because she wouldn\u2019t have a dentist otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to us, we were so happy to find her there,\u201d Sandoval said.\n\nMost low-income Californians aren\u2019t that lucky. Only about half of the children eligible for dental coverage actually see a dentist, said Jenny Kattlove of the Santa Monica-based Children\u2019s Partnership advocacy group.\n\nShe said the severity of the dental problem was accurately outlined in the Little Hoover report, saying it lays out \u201can ambitious but necessary path\u201d toward revamping the entire low-income dental system.\n\nPeople think of dental care as just getting a teeth-cleaning, and that it\u2019s not seen as a health issue.\n\n\u201cLook, when children don\u2019t get the oral health care they need, they suffer in pain,\u201d she said. \u201cUntreated dental problems actually can lead to death, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more health-related than that.\u201d\n\nNava said access problems may only get worse as more Californians are added to the Medi-Cal rolls. In mid-May, an estimated 170,000 undocumented children will become eligible for full Medi-Cal benefits, including dental care, and Nava worries that they won\u2019t get it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The report makes grim reading.
