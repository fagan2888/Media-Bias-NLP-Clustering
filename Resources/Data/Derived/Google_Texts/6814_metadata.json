(Photo: Center for Investigative Reporting)\n\nThe Veterans Administration cannot investigate itself.\n\nThere are a lot of big questions that remain around the Tomah VA clinic, where chief of staff Dr. David Houlihan prescribed opiates to veterans at such high rates that the vets called the place \"Candy Land\" and him the \"Candy Man.\" But one thing that seems to have been clearly demonstrated is that the VA's internal Office of the Inspector General failed the clinic's patients \u2014 and its obligation to serve the public interest. After a lengthy investigation that found opiate prescriptions at \"considerable variance\" from other clinics that raised \"potentially serious concerns,\" the inspectors found no wrongdoing and recommended no action.\n\nThat was a failure. The seriousness of the issue was made abundantly, tragically clear last summer, when Marine veteran Jason Simcakoski of Stevens Point died of an overdose while in the clinic's care.\n\nStory: Whistleblower: Tomah VA site sit-in ends with no meeting\n\nStory:Baldwin's handling of VA report 'frustrating' for widow\n\nStory:Baldwin fires aide over Tomah VA report\n\nThe investigation was completed in secret, and its failure to recommend action would have been a secret, too. But one lawmaker, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, responding to a constituent's concern, made an open records request and got the report in August.\n\nAnd what did Baldwin do then? Not much, it appears.\n\nBuy Photo U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (Photo: Daily Herald Media)\n\nHer office gave the report to Ryan Honl, the former VA employee and whistleblower who had been agitating for action on the matter. (Honl on Tuesday staged a 10-hour sit-in at the Tomah clinic to draw attention to the need for changes there.) But Baldwin did not apparently take any action to re-open an investigation, to call for accountability for Houlihan, or simply to ask why the clinic's extremely steep increase in opiate prescriptions, even though it was noted within the report, did not rise to the level of any further action.\n\nThis was a failure of Baldwin's. In her op-ed last weekend, she wrote that she \"take(s) full responsibility for any mistakes we made.\" But there are still some big, unanswered questions.\n\nShe has fired a top aide who was involved in the case, but she declined to comment on it. Reports of that firing say the aide, Marquette Baylor, was offered a severance deal that requires her not to discuss it, either.\n\nAnd Baldwin hasn't said whether she actually read the report herself.\n\nColumn:Tammy Baldwin: We can do better for Wisconsin veterans\n\nEditorial: Tomah VA wrongdoing betrays our veterans: Our View\n\nBuy Photo Ryan Honl staged a sit-in protest Tuesday at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center. (Photo: Megan McCormick/Gannett Central Wisconsin Media)\n\nTo be clear, Baldwin did not run the investigation that found no cause for action. The problems within the VA bureaucracy \u2014 and not just at Tomah \u2014 appear to have been very deep and systematic. All that will take time to sort out.\n\nFor now, Houlihan has been removed from the job and a new investigation launched. This is promising, and we sincerely hope the attention now being paid to this issue by the public and by elected officials will spur actual changes. Baldwin's voice will be part of that movement.\n\nBut Baldwin's office also failed to act on information only she had. We have a right to expect a full explanation and accountability for that, too.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1CAZxYL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Inspectors, senator should have acted on alarming report showing a sharp increase in prescriptions of opiates to veterans at the facility.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Inspectors, senator should have acted on alarming report showing a sharp increase in prescriptions of opiates to veterans at the facility.", "title": "Questions remain for Baldwin on VA failure: Our View", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2015/01/29/tammy-baldwin-tomah-va-opiates-simcakoski/22509565/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Inspectors, senator should have acted on alarming report showing a sharp increase in prescriptions of opiates to veterans at the facility.", "title": "Questions remain for Sen.
