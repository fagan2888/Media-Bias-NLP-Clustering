That\u2019s why rich taxpayers \u2014 or their advisers \u2014 have combed through the fine print of the tax code to figure out ways to lower what they owe the federal government without triggering the alternative minimum tax.\n\nMany use deductions as a handy tool. More than 90 percent of taxpayers earning at least $200,000 a year itemized their deductions in 2013, according to the most recent tax data available from the IRS. That compares to only 30 percent of all Americans.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Taxes\n\nThere are other strategies, too. Here are nine techniques affluent taxpayers use during tax time, some of which everyday Americans can employ, too.\n\n1. Maximize retirement accounts.\n\nHere\u2019s a strategy that the affluent and regular folks can both benefit from: maxing out retirement account contributions, says Kevin Reardon, owner of Shakespeare Wealth Management in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. \u201cYou might think this is obvious, but we have seen numerous high net-worth clients not maximize 401(k) accounts,\u201d he says.\n\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s are funded with pre-tax dollars which reduce taxable income over the year. Traditional IRAs and SEP IRAs, used by self-employed workers and small-business owners, are also tax deductible. Additionally, taxpayers can consider doing a tax-free Roth conversion to shelter future taxes, says Reardon.\n\n2. Tax loss harvesting.\n\nSelling investments at a loss can help come tax time, according to Robert Cheney, a wealth adviser at Westridge Wealth Strategies in Palo Alto, California. \u201cAsset classes like emerging markets and commodities have dropped and those losses can be harvested to offset taxable gains and income,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are some limitations. Your taxable income can only be reduced by up to $3,000 in a given year using this strategy. Any extra losses can be carried forward for future years and used first against capital gains and then ordinary income.\n\nRelated: 31 Tax Deductions You Don\u2019t Want to Miss\n\nThe IRS won\u2019t count a loss if you buy the same or nearly identical asset within 30 days of selling the asset that took a loss. Also, administration costs that come with buying and selling an asset can add reduce the overall tax benefit.\n\n3. Donor-advised funds (DAF).\n\nThis is an account that helps taxpayers manage charitable contributions, says Taylor Schulte of Define Financial in San Diego. Irrevocable donations are made to this account, which is often specially named for the family. The donor gets an immediate tax deduction, but is not forced to make any grants. Instead, they can invest and grow the assets and make donations to their favorite charities at any time.\n\nTaxpayers get a federal income tax deduction up to 50 percent of adjusted gross income for cash contributions from the account and up to 30 percent for appreciated securities. Besides cash, taxpayers can contribute stocks, bonds and mutual fund shares along with more complex assets like real estate, limited partnership interests, private C and S-Corp stock, and other privately held assets.\n\n4. Donations from IRAs.\n\nOlder taxpayers can make donations directly from their individual retirement accounts (IRAs), a move that is also tax savvy. Americans who are 70.5 years or older are required to take a minimum distribution from their IRA or Roth IRA funds. However, these distributions can be rolled over directly to a charity, reducing a taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income by that amount, up to $100,000.\n\n\u201cThis is great news for those who are at the upper tiers of income which may trigger a higher Medicare B premium or Medicare tax,\u201d says Carol Petrov, vice president of financial planning and client services at Kendall Capital in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nRelated: How Much Do US Presidents Pay in Taxes?\n\nLast year, there were 1.1 million returns with a tax-free IRA distribution worth $31.99 billion, according to estimates from H&R Block\u2019s Tax Institute using historical IRS data.\n\n5. Income shifting.\n\nIncome shifting is moving income from higher-bracket taxpayers to lower ones, such as children. There are different way to go about this, with limits. For example, only the first $2,100 of an investment gain that is shifted to a child is taxed at the child\u2019s rate \u2014 known as the kiddie tax. The rest is taxed at the parents\u2019 rate, says Reardon.\n\nOther ways to shift income include transferring income-producing assets to a trust. Any income paid out of the trust will be taxed to the beneficiary rather than you. Taxpayers can also gift income-producing assets to family members, up to the gift tax exclusion amount. Lastly, a taxpayer can offer a no-interest or low-interest loan to a relative to lower income.\n\nRelated: Tax Trouble: 32 Celebrities Who\u2019ve Tangled With the IRS\n\n6. Choosing wise investments.\n\nOpt to invest in exchange-traded funds, which aren\u2019t as actively invested and are less likely to have long-term capital gains. \u201cThey allow you to control your tax destiny,\u201d says David Demming, president of Demming Financial in Aurora, Ohio. \u201cETFs are a home run relative to mutual funds in controlling taxes.\u201d\n\nIf you are considering mutual funds, put cash into short-term, tax-free mutual funds, says Demming. \u201cThe interest is both higher and tax exempt,\u201d he says.\n\nHere\u2019s another idea that some well-off investors try: buying an annuity. The income from the annuity accumulates tax free until the funds are taken out, and the interest is not taxable in the current year. The thinking goes that you will receive the taxable payouts from the annuity when you are older and in a lower tax bracket.\n\n7. Capital gains tax.\n\nHere\u2019s a popular tax strategy often employed by the well-heeled and often a lightning rod in politics: the capital gains tax. \u201c(It) is approximately half as large as the income tax,\u201d says Demming. \u201cOwning assets that produce capital gains, as opposed to income, will save you substantial taxes.\u201d\n\nDemming said the capital gain and dividend rates are between 15 percent and 20 percent, compared with the marginal rates of 25 percent to 39.6 percent for many affluent taxpayers.\n\n8. Move debt.\n\nTo get a bigger mortgage interest deduction, Demming recommends shifting all consumer debt, such as auto loans, credit card and other debt, to a home equity line of credit. The interest is tax-deductible for those who itemize deductions, up to $100,000 (or $50,000 each for married persons filing separately).\n\n9. Oil and gas drilling investments.\n\n\u201cAccredited investors can invest in oil and gas drilling partnerships and reduce their taxable income by 90 percent of the investment amount,\u201d says Cheney of Westridge Wealth Strategies.\n\nFor example, intangible drilling costs, which include almost everything except the drilling equipment and make up to 85 percent of an investment, are fully deductible in the first year. The remaining tangible drilling costs are fully deductible but must be depreciated over seven years.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "No one enjoys paying their annual tax bill to Uncle Sam, including the wealthiest amon", "title": "9 Ways the Rich Maximize Their Tax Breaks (Some You Can Use, Too)", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/24/9-Ways-Rich-Maximize-Their-Tax-Breaks-Some-You-Can-Use-Too", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02152012_Wealth_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/24/9-Ways-Rich-Maximize-Their-Tax-Breaks-Some-You-Can-Use-Too", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02152012_Wealth_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "No one enjoys paying their annual tax bill to Uncle Sam, including the wealthiest amon", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1570\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s a popular tax strategy often employed by the well-heeled and often a lightning rod in politics: the capital gains tax.\nCapital gains tax.\nEmployer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s are funded with pre-tax dollars which reduce taxable income over the year.\nYour taxable income can only be reduced by up to $3,000 in a given year using this strategy.\n\u201c(It) is approximately half as large as the income tax,\u201d says Demming."}
