Why? Because this was a postmodern business cycle, brought on not by monetary tightening but by private-sector overreach, and hence harder to turn around than, say, the 1979-82 slump. Nonetheless, as Menzie Chinn notes, a constant talking point on the right has been that slow growth showed the damage done by Obama policies. And not just at Heritage or whatever; people like Ed Lazear or John Taylor demonstrated the reality of the hack gap by asserting that the private sector wasn\u2019t creating jobs because Obama was looking at them funny; also Obamacare.\n\nHow could you test this? Well, when I began talking about postmodern recessions, I argued that the 2007 slump was the third such example \u2014 that 1990-91 and 2001 were also postmodern recessions, followed by jobless recoveries. I\u2019ll leave 1990-91 aside for now, because I\u2019m lazy, and just note that we now have enough information to make a clear comparison between the recovery that began in 2001 and the one that began in 2009. Since the claim has been that Obama is scaring and punishing the private sector, let\u2019s look at private employment. It looks like this:\n\nPhoto\n\nOr if you look at the change in employment following the business cycle trough, it looks like this:\n\nPhoto\n\nBy any standard I can think of, the Obama-era job recovery has been stronger than the Bush-era job recovery. Now, I don\u2019t think that reflects excellent policies; and I would argue that in some ways the depth of the preceding slump set the stage for a faster recovery. But the point is that the usual suspects have been using the alleged uniquely poor performance under Obama to claim uniquely bad policies, or bad attitude, or something. And if that\u2019s the game they want to play, they have just scored an impressive own goal.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141206081148, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 6, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Comparing Postmodern Recoveries ( 20141206 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Obama > Bush, for what it\u2019s worth.", "title": "Comparing Postmodern Recoveries", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/comparing-postmodern-recoveries/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Obama > Bush, for what it\u2019s worth.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 6, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1417871508, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-12-06T13:11:48-05:00"}, "utime": 20141206131148, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141206, "pdate": 20141206, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Obama > Bush, for what it\u2019s worth.", "title": "Comparing Postmodern Recoveries", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/comparing-postmodern-recoveries/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/comparing-postmodern-recoveries/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Comparing Postmodern Recoveries", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Well, when I began talking about postmodern recessions, I argued that the 2007 slump was the third such example \u2014 that 1990-91 and 2001 were also postmodern recessions, followed by jobless recoveries.\nNonetheless, as Menzie Chinn notes, a constant talking point on the right has been that slow growth showed the damage done by Obama policies.\nBecause this was a postmodern business cycle, brought on not by monetary tightening but by private-sector overreach, and hence harder to turn around than, say, the 1979-82 slump.\nSince the claim has been that Obama is scaring and punishing the private sector, let\u2019s look at private employment.\nBut the point is that the usual suspects have been using the alleged uniquely poor performance under Obama to claim uniquely bad policies, or bad attitude, or something."}
