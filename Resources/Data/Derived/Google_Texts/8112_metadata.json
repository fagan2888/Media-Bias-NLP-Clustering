Bill Walker\u2019s administration gave early on for expansion.\n\nThat won\u2019t be easy. There are 9,175 applications \u201cout of time frame,\u201d meaning they\u2019ve been waiting to be processed for more than 30 days, said acting Division of Public Assistance Director Ron Kreher.\n\nSome Medicaid applications submitted by low-income residents waiting for coverage through the state are from before October 2014.\n\nThat number is down from 9,239 from a couple weeks ago. When work started in January, there were a little less than 10,000 outdated applications waiting, Kreher said.\n\nThe crew is \u201cworking this body of work from both ends,\u201d tackling the newest and the oldest application first, because \u201cwhen the day goes by another application slips into backlog status,\u201d Kreher said.\n\nBetween January and March, Kreher\u2019s team logged more than 100,000 hours of overtime \u2014 some voluntary, some mandatory \u2014 processing Medicaid applications, he said. In February, the staff got through 10,000 of them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a heap of work, especially for a short month,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s essentially doing almost 400 eligibility determinations a day. ... In order to be prepared for expansion, we\u2019re trying to eliminate the backlog.\u201d\n\nIn March, the division got through 11,000 applications. As of last month, 121,955 Alaskans, including 3,804 Juneauites, were enrolled in the federal health care program, according to DHSS numbers.\n\nThe department anticipates 20,000 more Alaskans would enroll in the first year of expansion, which would include those who make up to 138 percent of the poverty level (about $20,000 a year for a single adult).\n\nDespite an anticipated increased workload, Kreher said he thinks the division, which also processes applications for the state\u2019s food stamp and Denali KidCare programs, among others, will be able to handle the added strain on its resources.\n\nThe division has cleared the decks of 300 eligibility technicians in order to make the July deadline, he said. On top of that, another 60 people from within the division and more from other offices in the department have been helping get through the applications, many of which are turned into one of 17 offices in paper form.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to fund voluntary overtime so we\u2019ve got well over 330 or so people who are helping us out,\u201d Kreher said.\n\nBetween December and March, DHSS spent $825,000 on voluntary paid overtime to get through the pending applications.\n\n\u201cIn this budget environment it\u2019s not likely\u201d the division will be able to hire more employees to take care of the backlog in anticipation for expansion, Kreher said.\n\nStill, \u201cI\u2019m very confident we\u2019ll be able to handle the flow of work through expansion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe federal government does not have data on states\u2019 ability to keep up with application backlogs once they expand Medicaid.\n\nOf the 29 states (plus Washington, D.C.) that have expanded Medicaid, most \u201chave no backlog,\u201d according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cMost states that we reached out to recently have cleared their backlog or have substantially reduced their backlog, and are on a path to ensure timely enrollment,\u201d said CMS spokesman Jibril Boykin in an email.\n\nWhen asked which expansion states are still working to clear up a backlog, he said \u201cCMS does not have this type of information available.\u201d\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, which also keeps data on Medicaid expansion, did not respond to a request for information on state backlogs.\n\nComplicated process\n\nRoughly 42 percent of Alaska\u2019s Medicaid applications are being processed within the state\u2019s 30-day time frame, Kreher said. The average out-of-date application is 120 days old, but \u201ca lot of those applications are from before October\u201d 2014, when the state went live with a new Medicaid application processing system \u2014 a program glitch makes the ages of old applications iffy, he said.\n\nThe saga of getting the new processing system live is one of many reasons the division is constantly playing catch-up, Kreher said.\n\nAlaska\u2019s Resource for Integrated Eligibility Services, or ARIES, is the computer program technicians use to determine eligibility. It went live in October 2014, a year after it was supposed to, Kreher said, and after 20 months of development. It cost the state $22 million, but almost $20 million of that was federal money.\n\nARIES was supposed to be online in October 2013, when the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online health insurance marketplace went live. But, for a variety of reasons, that didn\u2019t happen, Kreher said.\n\n\u201cAlmost for a year we were having to do these complicated eligibility determinations manually,\u201d he said. \u201cThat really stretched the amount of time it took to do these applications.\u201d\n\nWork slowed down further as technicians encountered complicated combined family structures that required multiple manual eligibility determinations, Kreher said.\n\n\u201cMultiple tax filing units, which is not uncommon, adds to the level of effort,\u201d he said. \u201cIt literally tripled the amount of time, ... other work was held up. As soon as you start to create a backlog of work it grows really quickly.\u201d\n\nThe division worked to clear out the piling applications. In June 2014, \u201cwe had a moment of relief. ... We had pretty much eliminated much of the backlog,\u201d Kreher said. \u201cStaff was taking annual leave.\u201d\n\nBut that didn\u2019t last long, he said. The division was \u201cgetting massive amounts of (application) transfers\u201d from the federal online marketplace \u2014 \u201c2,000 to 3,000 of these account transfers all at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor reasons I have still not sussed out, the backlog started to creep up on us again,\u201d Kreher said. \u201cBecause the system still had not gone live, we were still dealing with this manual process. In the subsequent three months, another backlog started to creep up and staff had been on overtime and we had to impose mandatory overtime.\u201d\n\nOnce AIRES was ready to go, staff needed to be trained on the program, Kreher said. Employees had to stop determining Medicaid eligibility to get comfortable with the new system.\n\nOnce they finished training, \u201cthen you don\u2019t get a lot of productivity out of them for a month\u201d as they\u2019re learning the ropes, Kreher said.\n\n\u201cThe backlog was created by a strain on our resources,\u201d he said. \u201c(Technicians) couldn\u2019t get more work (done) and we couldn\u2019t request more people to do the work. ...\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like a Lemony Snicket book \u2013 \u2018A Series of Unfortunate Events.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome of the backlog can be attributed to user error \u2014 about 30 percent of the paper applications the division receives in its 17 offices around the state are incomplete and must be sent back to the applicant to be finished.\n\nThe applications are mailed in and dropped off by applicants and submitted by hospitals and clinics who help people fill them out. Bartlett Regional Hospital helps about 500 people per year complete Medicaid applications, spokesman Jim Strader said. The Front Street Community Health Center declined to comment.\n\n\u201cWe get them from all sorts of places,\u201d Kreher said. \u201cDepending on the nature of the source it can impact, if you will, the completeness of the application. ... If we get an incomplete application, we can\u2019t act on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncomplete\u201d can mean anything from a missing social security number or address to a blank page or two.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for people to forget to even sign the thing,\u201d Kreher said.\n\nThe application then must be sent back to the applicant so it can be completed and turned in again.\n\n\u201cA general rule is we get an application, it\u2019s reviewed, it\u2019s acted on as quickly as possible,\u201d Kreher said. \u201cAt the very least we give 10 days (for the applicant) to respond.\u201d\n\nThe division\u2019s workload is not split up by geographic area, Kreher said, so where you live doesn\u2019t determine how long it will take for your Medicaid application to be processed. But of the 17 offices \u2014 Juneau\u2019s is located in the state job center in the Mendenhall Valley \u2014 Fairbanks has the biggest backlog of applications, he said.\n\nThe division is working against the clock to be ready for expansion \u2014 if it happens. Gov. Walker made Medicaid expansion his No. 1 priority during his campaign and has said he will most likely call a special session of the Legislature to continue to push his legislation. Push back is coming from lawmakers who demand Medicaid reform before expanding the program.\n\nWalker\u2019s staff have answered questions in more than 20 legislative committee hearings on Medicaid expansion since the start of session.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically deploying any and every (method), so we\u2019re ready when Medicaid goes live this summer to have the decks pretty much cleaned out,\u201d Kreher said.\n\n\u2022 Contact reporter Katie Moritz at katherine.moritz@juneauempire.com.
