The parties are simply too far apart, and Congress\u2019 Republican majority has come to believe compromises themselves are a betrayal of deeply held principles. The list of issues in which some kind of agreement is even imaginable is vanishingly small.\n\nBut if we were to make such a list, tax reform would probably be on it. After the 2014 midterms, Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate said tax reform would be a real priority in the 114th Congress, and a joint op-ed from John Boehner and Mitch McConnell said addressing \u201cthe insanely complex tax code\u201d would be one near the top of the Republicans\u2019 to-do list. President Obama said he was more than happy to work with GOP lawmakers on a deal, and there was reason for cautious optimism.\n\nAnd yet, nothing has actually happened, and chances are, nothing will happen. To understand why, consider this interview CNBC\u2019s John Harwood conducted this week with Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. An excerpt from the transcript:\n\nHARWOOD: Do you agree, by the way, that tax reform can only be done with buy-in from both parties? BRADY: You know, I think at the end of the day, it will be bipartisan. Maybe not at every step in the process, as we lay this out, but at the end of the day, the major changes in American government almost always require buy-in from both parties. HARWOOD: Could you envision a tax reform that you could go along with that had many elements that you liked that did not decrease the top rate? BRADY: That\u2019d be difficult to accept, because I think that holds back investment, both by businesses, small businesses, and by families.\n\nHarwood reminded the Texas Republican that even some conservatives believe, given the contentious political environment, focusing on the top rate makes success a lot less likely. \u201cI\u2019d have to disagree,\u201d Brady replied.\n\nI can appreciate why tax reform seems like a dry topic, but this exchange helps capture why governing is so excruciatingly difficult right now at the federal level.\n\nRevisiting some of our previous coverage let\u2019s take a quick look at recent history . It\u2019s easy to forget, but soon after Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, Republican leaders agreed that tax reform was a real possibility. House Republicans gave the issue the special H.R. 1 designation, a symbolic bill number intended to convey its significance. Then-House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.), to his credit, invested three years of his life on a plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s federal tax code, and unlike the usual Republican m.o., he actually presented a real reform plan.\n\nSoon after, Boehner and his team killed the bill , concluding that it\u2019d be an unwelcome distraction from partisan priorities such as Benghazi and complaints about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBy March 2014, Republican officials thanked Camp for working so diligently on tax reform, then declared his plan dead . According to Camp\u2019s own GOP allies, his plan would receive no debate, no hearing, and no vote.\n\nAsked in the spring about the substance of Camp\u2019s tax-reform bill, Boehner said, quite literally, \u201c Blah, blah, blah, blah .\u201d\n\nThat was the last Congress. In this Congress, there\u2019s been just as much progress \u2013 which is to say, none. Why is that? Because tax reform itself follows a simple blueprint:\n\n1. Both parties see value in cleaning up the tax code and scrapping loopholes.\n\n2. Cleaning up the tax code and scrapping loopholes would generate new revenue.\n\n3. The parties have diametrically opposed visions on what to do with the money.\n\nAs Brady told Harwood this week, the money has to go towards tax breaks for the wealthy. Full stop. Any other possibility \u2013 investing in infrastructure, reducing the deficit, etc. \u2013 would be \u201cdifficult to accept.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The fight over tax reform helps capture why governing is so excruciatingly difficult right now at the federal level.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-bipartisan-compromises-remain-so-elusive", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The fight over tax reform helps capture why governing is so excruciatingly difficult right now at the federal level.", "title": "Why bipartisan compromises remain so elusive", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-bipartisan-compromises-remain-so-elusive", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/rtx224ck.jpg?itok=ONyEcNOn", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-bipartisan-compromises-remain-so-elusive", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/rtx224ck.jpg?itok=gRE59kbv", "height": 553}, "title": "Why bipartisan compromises remain so elusive", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The fight over tax reform helps capture why governing is so excruciatingly difficult right now at the federal level."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-13T08:40:25-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Why bipartisan compromises remain so elusive", "tags": "house-republicans,republicans,tax-policy,tax-reform,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "04/13/2016 08:40:25 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-bipartisan-compromises-remain-so-elusive"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "The fight over tax reform helps capture why governing is so excruciatingly difficult right now at the federal level.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Republicans, House Republicans, Tax Policy, Tax Reform"}, "article_summary": "Asked in the spring about the substance of Camp\u2019s tax-reform bill, Boehner said, quite literally, \u201c Blah, blah, blah, blah .\u201dThat was the last Congress.\nBut if we were to make such a list, tax reform would probably be on it.\nThe parties are simply too far apart, and Congress\u2019 Republican majority has come to believe compromises themselves are a betrayal of deeply held principles.\nHARWOOD: Could you envision a tax reform that you could go along with that had many elements that you liked that did not decrease the top rate?\nCleaning up the tax code and scrapping loopholes would generate new revenue."}
