One such way that physicians could do this, according to a new study, is by simply hanging up a letter in their office stating their commitment.\n\nAntibiotic resistance has been a growing and pressing issue. In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report rating the threats that certain resistant bacteria presented to the public. If antibiotic use isn\u2019t curbed in the near future, the United States and other parts of the world may see a rise in previously stifled diseases. Beyond that, the germs can come back with a vengeance, as they build resistance from exposure to antibiotics in the human body and on farms. In October, an antibiotic-resistant Salmonella outbreak from a Foster Farms chicken production plant in California led to twice the expected rate of hospitalizations.\n\nFor the study, researchers looked to a psychological \u201cnudge\u201d to shift doctors\u2019 prescribing habits \u2014 rather than confrontation or frequent reminders. \u201cMost quality improvement efforts have used audits or pay-for-performance incentives to try to change what providers do, but they ignore social influences that affect all people, including physicians,\u201d senior author Jason Doctor, of the University of Southern California Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, said in a statement. \u201cOur study is the first to apply the principles of commitment and consistency to prescribing behavior and finds a simple, low-cost intervention that shows great promise in reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescription.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cnudge\u201d came in the form of a large commitment letter showing a photo of the physician, and explaining their promise to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory infections like the common cold. The letter, which was posted in each exam room for three months, resulted in a 10 percent drop, bringing the rate of total antibiotic prescriptions down from 42.8 percent to 33.7 percent. On the other hand, antibiotic prescription rates increased in the control group from 43.5 percent to 52.7 percent.\n\nThrough a program like this, the researchers estimate that they can prevent up to 2.6 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, saving $70.4 million in the U.S., and slowing the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. \u201cThe results move beyond education posters,\u201d Doctor said in the statement, \u201cshowing how public commitments and active engagement can prompt greater personal motivation to perform a behavior, in this case reversing a tendency to prescribe antibiotics when they are not effective.\u201d\n\nSource: Meeker D, Doctor J, Knight T, et al.
