It\u2019s really just infuriating to have [Cruz] stand up there and spend his time on that.\u201d\n\nA report released Wednesday by the Department of Health and Human Services announced that individual insurance premiums will be lower than projected for 95% of Americans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been repeal, repeal, repeal, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been able to, or will be able to articulate an operable solution that is an alternative to Obamacare, and that\u2019s just it,\u201d Caleb Lihn told MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell. \u201cThey\u2019ve realized that there\u2019s good parts to it, and they\u2019re gonna help people, people like Zoe and our family, but they want to sort of brush those to the side and cherry pick one or two things that they think can be perceived as negative, and focus on those and use that to, you know, sort of carry on this misinformation campaign.\u201d\n\nLast September, Stacey Lihn gave a moving and emotional speech at the Democratic National Convention about how Obamacare secured the treatment her daughter, who has congenital heart disease, needed in order to live. Lihn\u2019s daughter Zoe had already had open-heart surgery twice and faced a third operation this year. Lihn spoke about the potential repercussions if Obamacare were to become abolished. \u201cIf Mitt Romney becomes president and Obamacare is repealed, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll hit her lifetime cap. There is no way we can pay for all the care she needs to survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare provides my family security and relief,\u201d Lihn told the crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina. Zoe successfully had her third open-heart surgery on Aug. 13.\n\nBefore the law\u2019s passage, Zoe\u2019s parents were told by their health insurers that their child had hit her \u201clifetime cap,\u201d meaning that she would no longer receive coverage. But the family later received a letter that arrived from their insurance company, \u201csaying that our daughter\u2019s lifetime cap had been lifted.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s home state senator, John McCain, spoke on the floor after Cruz finished his tirade and reminded people that voters re-elected President Obama and his policies last November.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d remind my colleagues that in the 2012 election, Obamacare as it\u2019s called - and I\u2019ll be more polite, the ACA - was a subject that was a major issue in the campaign. I campaigned all over America for two months, everywhere I could, and in every single campaign rally I said \u2018And we have to repeal and replace\u2019 Obamacare. Well, the people spoke. They spoke much to my dismay, but they spoke and they re-elected the President of the United States.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we give up our efforts to replace and repair Obamacare,\u201d the Arizona senator continued. \u201dBut it does mean that elections have consequences and those elections were clear in a significant majority that a majority of the American people supported the president and renewed his stewardship of this country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A day after Senator Cruz's 21-hour speech, aimed at blocking Obamacare, \u00a0Stacey and Caleb Lihn spoke out about how their\u00a03-year-old\u00a0daughter with a severe", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/taking-away-obamacare-morally-wrong", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "A day after Senator Cruz's 21-hour speech, aimed at blocking Obamacare, \u00a0Stacey and Caleb Lihn spoke out about how their\u00a03-year-old\u00a0daughter with a severe", "title": "Taking away Obamacare is 'morally wrong,' says a dad", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/taking-away-obamacare-morally-wrong", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/09/lihn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/taking-away-obamacare-morally-wrong", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/09/lihn.jpg?itok=kuZiZJmV", "height": 553}, "title": "Taking away Obamacare is 'morally wrong,' says a dad", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A day after Senator Cruz's 21-hour speech, aimed at blocking Obamacare, \u00a0Stacey and Caleb Lihn spoke out about how their\u00a03-year-old\u00a0daughter with a severe"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-25T23:33:20-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "clarehkim", "tags": "democrats,health,health-care-reform,republicans,the-last-word", "contentId": "http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/09/25/taking-away-obamacare-is-morally-wrong-says-a-dad/", "title": "Taking away Obamacare is 'morally wrong,' says a dad", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/taking-away-obamacare-morally-wrong", "date": "09/25/2013 23:33:20 EDT", "published": 1}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "A day after Senator Cruz's 21-hour speech, aimed at blocking Obamacare, \u00a0Stacey and Caleb Lihn spoke out about how their\u00a03-year-old\u00a0daughter with a severe", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bcd\"", "article_summary": "Lihn spoke about the potential repercussions if Obamacare were to become abolished.\n\u201cTo me, the access to health care, being cared for, and having care for a condition that you\u2019re born with, through no fault of your own, having those rights taken away from you, for me that\u2019s morally wrong,\u201d Caleb Lihn said.\n\u201cIf Mitt Romney becomes president and Obamacare is repealed, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll hit her lifetime cap.\n\u201dI think that Obamacare serves a purpose that is important.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been repeal, repeal, repeal, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been able to, or will be able to articulate an operable solution that is an alternative to Obamacare, and that\u2019s just it,\u201d Caleb Lihn told MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell."}
