Health News, a non-profit journalism website focused on covering state public health policy, penned this editorial over the weekend about the increasing difficult time reporters are having in getting questions answered by the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHoban recounted how she and her staff, since reporting what Hoban called unflattering news in May about DHHS, have been stonewalled by the agency\u2019s public affairs staff. The news group has resorted to public records requests in order to get information from the public agency.\n\nFrom Hoban\u2019s piece, published Sunday in the (Raleigh) News & Observer:\n\n[T]he closing of the lines of communication between DHHS and reporters in the past six months has been troubling. Ricky Diaz, the lead press officer at DHHS, has been quoted in many stories about issues in his department, but many reporters have increasingly voiced concern about the increased time it takes to get responses to requests for information \u2013 if they get a response at all. And while Diaz may be quoted, there have been few opportunities for exchanges between Secretary of DHHS Aldona Wos and other leaders in the department. Recently, the N&O reported that one of its reporters was blocked by \u201ca bodyguard\u201d in an attempt to ask Wos a question. And departmental employees were told to call police if activists who were bringing petitions to the Dix campus \u2013 where DHHS offices are located \u2013 stopped any employees or entered any of the department\u2019s public buildings. At NC Health News, we have had most media requests denied or unanswered since we ran a story in May that painted Wos in an unflattering light. We have resorted to making most requests in the form of open records requests with legal language that essentially compels the department to answer or face the prospect of litigation.\n\nYou can read Hoban\u2019s editorial in its entirety here, where she talks about the risk to public health that broken communication lines can cause.\n\nI\u2019ve experience similar difficulties in my role as a reporter with N.C. Policy Watch. Since Diaz, the agency\u2019s communication director, came to the agency this spring, I\u2019ve left numerous messages and sent emails asking for information, seeking clarification or posing questions about various DHHS programs. And I\u2019ve never heard back.\n\n(If Diaz\u2019s name sounds familiar, that\u2019s likely because the 24-year-old former McCrory campaign workers\u2019 salary of $85,000 and April bonus of $23,000 has been a hugely contentious issue in the state as of late.)\n\nTake the recent infographic of DHHS successes (on the right) sent out Sept. 11 to reporters around the state. I asked that day for the back-up information and data used to create the graphic. I have yet to receive any type of response.\n\nMaking it harder to report on the public agency is DHHS\u2019 policy that all questions from media must go through Diaz and the communications office, according to this May 27 memorandum issued at the department.\n\nPublic records requests, which the agency is statutorily required to comply with, have been the primary way to get information out of the $17 billion state agency, the largest in North Carolina government.\n\nHoban references in her piece reporters being blocked from asking Wos questions by a bodyguard or security officers, including an Aug. 15 experience an N&O reporter had at a Raleigh speaking engagement.\n\nA cabinet secretary with assigned security detail is something that doesn\u2019t appear to have any precedence in North Carolina, so I asked for clarification about the situation, to see if Wos actually had a bodyguard or if there was an explanation.\n\nWas it a DHHS staffer acting in that capacity? Or an employee that Wos has hired herself?\n\nOf course, it\u2019s hardly the most pressing public health matter in the state but it still holds public interest considering the mounting questions about how DHHS is being managed.\n\nI emailed questions on Aug. 20 to Diaz and Julie Henry, another DHHS spokesperson, (click here to read the email). I never received a response.\n\nAn accompanying public records request for any and all documents related to the \u201csecurity needs, transportation or bodyguards\u201d used by Wos at public events was answered, however, on Aug. 21 by a DHHS attorney. The response? \u201cThere are no records responsive to your request.\u201d\n\nSo, it appears the question of whether or not public funds were used to keep reporters away from Wos will remain unanswered. If I do happen to hear back, I will, of course, update this post with the new information.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The news group has resorted to public records requests in order to get information from the public agency.\nYou can read Hoban\u2019s editorial in its entirety here, where she talks about the risk to public health that broken communication lines can cause.\nWe have resorted to making most requests in the form of open records requests with legal language that essentially compels the department to answer or face the prospect of litigation.\nI emailed questions on Aug. 20 to Diaz and Julie Henry, another DHHS spokesperson, (click here to read the email).\nOf course, it\u2019s hardly the most pressing public health matter in the state but it still holds public interest considering the mounting questions about how DHHS is being managed."}
