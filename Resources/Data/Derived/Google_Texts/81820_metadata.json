Given the negative surplus at HealthPlus Insurance Company, and significant decline in the financial condition of HealthPlus of Michigan, Inc., DIFS took regulatory action.\"\n\nMiller added there may be several groups interested in HealthPlus.\n\n\"HealthPlus has provided DIFS with sufficient information to indicate there are several serious parties interested in partnering with HealthPlus and willing to infuse capital,\" she said. \"The Director has given the companies 60 days to make material progress with another party to consummate a transaction. During the 60 days, DIFS will have staff at HealthPlus to monitor the progress of any transactions and monitor the financial results of the two companies.\u200b\"\n\nMiller did not elaborate on her statement and Kathy Bilitzke, manager of public relations for HealthPlus, directed all questions to Miller.\n\nHowever, in a Sunday story by Crain's Detroit Business, Bilitzke is quoted as saying that new rules mandated by the Affordable Care Act helped lead to miscalculations at HealthPlus.\n\nAs part of the regulatory action, the Department of Insurance and Financial Services has ordered HealthPlus Insurance Co. and HealthPlus of Michigan to stop selling new or renewal policies for its preferred provider organization business, according to Crain's.\n\nHealthPlus Partners, the HMO that serves Medicaid beneficiaries, is in compliance with statutory financial requirements, according to Miller.\n\nHealthPlus was formed in 1979 as a not-for-profit. The company employs more than 400 people in full- and part-time positions in Flint, Saginaw and Troy, according to the company's website.\n\nIn November, HealthPlus of Michigan announced that Nancy Jenkins, a former vice president of community programs and customer experience, would replace former President Bruce Hill and would become the interim president and chief executive officer.\n\nTim Herman, CEO of the Flint & Genesee Chamber of Commerce, couldn't comment on the financial situation but said HealthPlus has been very active as Chamber members and serves on the Chamber's Regional Leadership Council.\n\n\"They also have been a long-time, enthusiastic partner in our efforts to increase health and wellness in Flint and Genesee County,\" Herman said in an email. \"We wish them all the best.\"", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Eric Dresden | edresden@mlive.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "State orders HealthPlus to look for financial partner after company posts 2014 losses", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"State orders HealthPlus to look for financial partner after company posts 2014 losses\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/03/state_mandating_healthplus_loo.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/newsnow_impact/photo/17277271-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15485745\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-03-16T21:28:50Z\", \"author\": \"Eric Dresden | edresden@mlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@fl-app\",\"@fl-river\",\"@mlive-river\",\"@mm-business\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "HealthPlus Insurance Co. has 60 days to make progress on finding an outside financial partner after losing millions of dollars in the past few years.", "title": "State orders HealthPlus to look for financial partner after company posts 2014 losses", "image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/newsnow_impact/photo/17277271-standard.jpg", "creator": "@thedresden", "site": "@mlive", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, March 17, 2015,  7:45 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/newsnow_impact/photo/img-2714jpg-a61a44c5c50e9d18.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"ericdresden\", \"author_nickname\": \"Eric Dresden | edresden@mlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"11434484\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Flint News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "HealthPlus Insurance Co. has 60 days to make progress on finding an outside financial partner after losing millions of dollars in the past few years.", "title": "State orders HealthPlus to look for financial partner after company posts 2014 losses", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/03/state_mandating_healthplus_loo.html", "image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/newsnow_impact/photo/17277271-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, March 16, 2015,  5:29 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "HealthPlus Insurance Co. has 60 days to make progress on finding an outside financial partner after losing millions of dollars in the past few years."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f6e\"", "article_summary": "Given the negative surplus at HealthPlus Insurance Company, and significant decline in the financial condition of HealthPlus of Michigan, Inc., DIFS took regulatory action.\"\nThe Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services stepped in to try and find a financial partner for the company after it reported the losses.\n\"As of December 31, 2014, HealthPlus Insurance Company reported liabilities exceeded assets (negative surplus) of $4.8 million,\" Andrea Miller, communications manager for the Department of Insurance and Financial Services said in an emailed statement.\nFLINT TWP, MI -- HealthPlus Insurance Co. has 60 days to make progress on finding an outside financial partner after losing millions of dollars in the past few years.\n\"HealthPlus of Michigan Inc. reported significant operating losses and decline in surplus."}
