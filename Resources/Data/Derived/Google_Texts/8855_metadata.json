It was a speech that sparked the modern Conservative Movement, ignited a fire in the hearts of conservatives, and launched Ronald Reagan\u2019s public policy career.\n\nThis week, as part of a yearlong \u201cTime for Choosing: The Next Generation\u201d initiative, Young America\u2019s Foundation is releasing a series of videos in conjunction with the anniversary of this significant speech. The third video focuses on limited government.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt is no secret that government today is far overreaching and intrusive. This past year alone we have seen privacy breaches by the NSA, the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS, and the disastrous consequences of Obamacare on small businesses and families.\n\nObama has even said, \u201cI can take steps without legislation.\u201d This self-righteous statement underscores that he has no respect for the Constitution\u2013a document meant to protect the rights of all Americans and prevent our government and our leaders from trampling on those rights. Unfortunately, today we have a President and federal officials who are no longer accountable to the American people because they consider themselves to be above the law.\n\nConsider Obamacare, federal legislation mandating that all people purchase health insurance or be penalized with a fine. In addition to being forced upon the American people, Obamacare is a job killer, it has negatively impacted the American economy, and it is crushing our small businesses\u2013the backbone of America. And, after three years of preparation, the federal government couldn\u2019t even get its own Obamacare website to work properly. Nonetheless, Obama demands that all Americans allow the government\u2013which cannot even create a functioning website\u2013to control the most personal aspects of their lives, their health.\n\nRecent polling shows that approval of Congress is at an all-time low, and more than half of the American people are distrusting of the government. This is what can be expected when the government grows too big and encroaches upon the rights of the people.\n\nA half century ago, Ronald Reagan told the American people, \u201cNo government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. A government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth.\u201d Unfortunately, that statement is even more true today. We are facing the consequences of an expanding government and it is up to us\u2013the American people\u2013to hold our leaders accountable, should we wish to advance freedom for generations to come.\n\nAshley Pratte is the spokeswoman for Young America\u2019s Foundation", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Government Bureau is the Nearest Thing to Eternal Life We Will Ever See on This Earth", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A Government Bureau is the Nearest Thing to Eternal Life We Will Ever See on This Earth", "title": "A Government Bureau is the Nearest Thing to Eternal Life We Will Ever See on This Earth - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Historical-Figures/reagan-speech-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/10/22/a-government-bureau-is-the-nearest-thing-to-eternal-life-we-will-ever-see-on-this-earth/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Government Bureau is the Nearest Thing to Eternal Life We Will Ever See on This Earth", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Historical-Figures/reagan-speech-AP.jpg", "title": "A Government Bureau is the Nearest Thing to Eternal Life We Will Ever See on This Earth - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Ronald Reagan,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Ronald Reagan", "published_time": "2014-10-22T08:47:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda703\"", "article_summary": "A government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth.\u201d Unfortunately, that statement is even more true today.\nConsider Obamacare, federal legislation mandating that all people purchase health insurance or be penalized with a fine.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNext Monday, October 27 marks the 50th anniversary of Ronald Reagan\u2019s iconic \u201cTime For Choosing\u201d speech.\nUnfortunately, today we have a President and federal officials who are no longer accountable to the American people because they consider themselves to be above the law.\nAnd, after three years of preparation, the federal government couldn\u2019t even get its own Obamacare website to work properly."}
