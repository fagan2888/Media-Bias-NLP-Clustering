Physician groups have been the most vocal supporters of a permanent repeal of Medicare\u2019s Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula, but some say that they cannot support the GOP gambit against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe cannot support linking SGR repeal to changes in current law that will result in fewer people getting health insurance coverage,\u201d said Molly Cooke, president of the American College of Physicians, in a statement on Friday.\n\nDoctors\u2019 powerful trade associations huddled with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Reid McConnell sets up vote to begin debate on defense policy bill The Trail 2016: Dems struggle for unity Senate candidate taunts Sanders: Why don't you endorse Alan Grayson? MORE (D-Nev.) on Thursday to discuss the doc fix bill. Attendees for that meeting included representatives for the American Medical Association (AMA), the Physicians and the Surgeons.\n\n\u201cIt was a positive conversation with Sen. Reid,\u201d Shalgian said, refusing to elaborate further on the powwow with the Senate leader.\n\nAMA confirmed their group was part of Reid\u2019s sit-down about the doc fix. The prominent medical trade group said it is continuing efforts to work with Reid, Senate Republicans, and House members from both parties to enact permanent reform.\n\nOther lobbyists urged Democrats and Republicans to enter negotiations to find a feasible pay-for to end the doc fix.\n\n\u201cWe call on House and Senate leadership to immediately engage in a bipartisan process to reach bipartisan agreement on a budgetary solution that can pass both the House and the Senate,\u201d Cooke said.\n\nThe permanent doc fix bill was announced with much acclaim last month as both Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance, House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees signed off on a framework. But lawmakers have since struggled how to pay for the final fix, with advocates for hospitals and seniors warning Congress not to touch funding for their favored government programs.\n\nOn March 1, the Coalition to Protect America\u2019s Health Care, made up of hospitals, launched a month-long ad campaign at the Capitol South and Union Station Metro stations telling Congress to \u201cstop hospital cuts.\u201d\n\nBut the backlash by hospitals might not be enough to protect them from the budget ax.

Ron Wyden Ron WydenWeek ahead: Cyber Command in the spotlight Overnight Cybersecurity: House defense bill would elevate Cyber Command Dem introduces bill to block new government hacking powers MORE (D-Ore.), told a gathering of the Federation of American Hospitals this week that \u201ctough budget calls\u201d will be made to end the doc fix.\n\nDoctors also have been active in lobbying. The American Medical Association hosted its national advocacy conference in Washington this past week, bringing in hundreds of physicians to meet with lawmakers.\n\nThey were pushing members to sign onto the doc fix bill, which has attracted support from both parties with 83 co-sponsors in the House and three in the Senate.\n\nThe lobbying push for the fix will ramp up in the last week of March, when hundreds of surgeons will descend on Washington to visit congressional offices, according to Shalgian.\n\nThe bill in question would end the SGR, raise doctors\u2019 pay for five years and create incentives for doctors to move to new payment models, shifting the healthcare system away from fee-for-service.\n\nDoctor groups have heralded the bill\u2019s approach and have lined up behind it. Dr. Andrew Warshaw, president of the Surgeons\u2019 group, said physicians have been divided in the past over ObamaCare and other healthcare issues but see enough good in this legislation to provide unified support.\n\n\u201cWhat is close to unique about this moment of time is everybody agrees now\u2019s the time to get this done,\u201d said Dr. Warshaw, also of Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough that we do agree on, enough to say grace over, that we ought get to it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Doctors are shooting down the effort to link a \"doc fix\" to an individual mandate delay.", "description": "Doctors are shooting down the effort to link a \"doc fix\" to an individual mandate delay.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kevin Bogardus", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Doctors are shooting down the effort to link a \"doc fix\" to an individual mandate delay.", "title": "ObamaCare bill gets chilly reception", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/200256-obamacare-bill-gets-chilly-reception", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T12:18-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/200256-obamacare-bill-gets-chilly-reception", "dcterms.date": "2014-03-09T06:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Harry Reid, Ron Wyden,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-09T06:00:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/200256-obamacare-bill-gets-chilly-reception", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Doctors are shooting down the effort to link a \"doc fix\" to an individual mandate delay.", "card": "summary", "title": "ObamaCare bill gets chilly reception"}, "dcterms.title": "ObamaCare bill gets chilly reception"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca17f\"", "article_summary": "Lobbyists for the medical profession said the ObamaCare connection isn\u2019t helpful because the permanent doc fix can\u2019t happen unless the parties work together.\nMORE (D-Nev.) on Thursday to discuss the doc fix bill.\nOther lobbyists urged Democrats and Republicans to enter negotiations to find a feasible pay-for to end the doc fix.\nPowerful physician groups that are Washington\u2019s loudest voice for a permanent \u201cdoc fix\u201d are shooting down a Republican effort to link the bill to a delay of ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate.\nAMA confirmed their group was part of Reid\u2019s sit-down about the doc fix."}
