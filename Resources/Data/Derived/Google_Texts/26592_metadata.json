Republicans are already on the record crowing about it, because apparently they oppose \u201ccreate more jobs and grow more wages\u201d.\n\nThere is fodder to be had here and it\u2019s not by Republicans.\n\nWatch below:\n\nOn Meet the Press, Axelrod said it was a mistake for Obama to have said, \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot this fall, but make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\u201d\n\nThe President laid out specific policies that the Republicans have obstructed and noted that Republicans aren\u2019t running on killing Obamacare like they said they would (because it\u2019s working). He told voters \u201cthese policies\u201d are on the ballot this November 4th (my bold):\n\nI am not on the ballot this fall. Michelle\u2019s pretty happy about that. But make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them. This isn\u2019t a political speech, and I\u2019m not going to tell you who to vote for \u2013 even though I suppose it is kind of implied. But I have laid out my ideas to create more jobs and grow more wages. A true opposition party should have the courage to lay out theirs. There\u2019s a reason fewer Republicans are preaching doom on deficits \u2013 because they\u2019re now manageable. There\u2019s a reason fewer are running against Obamacare \u2013 because while good, affordable health care might still be a fanged threat to freedom on Fox News, it\u2019s working pretty well in the real world. But when push came to shove this year, and Republicans in Congress actually had to take a stand on policies that would help the middle class and working Americans \u2013 raising the minimum wage, enacting fair pay, refinancing student loans, extending insurance for the unemployed \u2013 the answer was \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese policies\u201d seem pretty good. What\u2019s wrong with \u201ccreate more jobs and grow more wages\u201d? Democrats should nail Republicans with this in rebuttal, because this is exactly what Republicans are pummeling them over.\n\nReince Priebus happily pounced on this line in order to attack Democrats on Meet the Press, saying it was bad news for Democrats if the President\u2019s policies are on the ballot box.\n\nThis would be true, if only Obama\u2019s policies polled badly with the people, but the policies Obama was talking about were economic policies that benefit working America, like raising the minimum wage. The President has challenged the opposition party to lay out their ideas, saying here are his ideas, now where are theirs?\n\nThese things are not bad news for Democrats. These things are why Republicans can\u2019t talk about anything but social issues and manufactured dramas, fear-mongering, and fictional Obama boogeyman stories. These things are why Republicans are resorting to \u201cAre you better off now?\u201d \u2014 without mentioning that it was their party that obstructed jobs bills, raising the minimum wage, equal pay for women, and more.\n\nThe President has to walk a fine line here because if he doesn\u2019t put these policies on the ballot to some extent, the Obama voters won\u2019t turn out and the party needs to motivate them. The President cut a general ad for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in which he rallied the troops by telling them, \u201cI need you to get involved\u2026. I can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d\n\nAxelrod, who is a brilliant strategist, is trying to keep the election local and avoid it being a national election about the President in order to help Democrats in peril. This is one reason the President isn\u2019t stumping for certain candidates. But there is a huge difference between selling a policy and selling a candidate. The Obama White House has not always been great at selling their policies, even though their policies are very popular with the people.\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of packaging the Democratic policies as populism, which should be easier to do than packaging Republican policies that benefit the top 1% as populism \u2013 a feat they continue to manage with the less informed voter.\n\nRepublicans continue to have no ideas except making Obama into a boogeyman and taking refuge in social issues they can\u2019t defend.\n\nThis election is about who has been fighting for the average American. Who has been trying to pass policies to help the average American earn a fair wage. Who has been trying to keep America safe and raise morale. Who has been trying to protect our children from the mad hatters in the NRA who run the Republican Party.\n\nDemocrats can respond to these Republican attacks by asking which policy, more jobs or better wages, Republicans are running against?\n\nDemocrats can continue (after letting the first point sink in) by saying that while they don\u2019t agree with the President on everything, they are shocked that Republicans do not support basic common sense like raising the minimum wage and they would love to debate \u201cthese policies\u201d with the Republican candidate on TV.\n\nJust because Democrats are nervous about the politics should not mean that they run away from the policies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Obama strategist extraordinaire David Axelrod  criticized President Obama for saying that his policies are on the ballot for the midterms.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Former Obama strategist extraordinaire David Axelrod  criticized President Obama for saying that his policies are on the ballot for the midterms.", "title": "No, It's Wasn't A Mistake for President Obama to Say These Policies Are On the Ballot", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/10/05/no-its-wasnt-mistake-obama-policies-ballot.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-05-at-2.55.48-PM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-07T10:08:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2014 Elections,Democratic Party,Featured News,PoliticusUSA Editorial,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "PoliticusUSA Editorial", "published_time": "2014-10-05T15:02:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-07T10:08:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2bc\"", "article_summary": "Former Obama strategist extraordinaire David Axelrod appeared on the Meet the Press to criticize President Obama for saying that his policies are on the ballot for the midterms.\nWatch below:On Meet the Press, Axelrod said it was a mistake for Obama to have said, \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot this fall, but make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot.\nHe told voters \u201cthese policies\u201d are on the ballot this November 4th (my bold):I am not on the ballot this fall.\nThis would be true, if only Obama\u2019s policies polled badly with the people, but the policies Obama was talking about were economic policies that benefit working America, like raising the minimum wage.\nThe Obama White House has not always been great at selling their policies, even though their policies are very popular with the people."}
