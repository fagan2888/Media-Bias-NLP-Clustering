Mr. Koskinen warned that it would get worse without an infusion of money and Americans may start to feel emboldened to cheat on their taxes.\n\nThe IRS chief said Congress didn\u2019t provide additional money to prepare for Obamacare and the tax penalty filings that began this year, so he shuffled at least $100 million from user fee funding that had been going to customer service.\n\n\u201cBecause of the zero funding for the Affordable Care Act and [the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act], the only way we could implement those statutory mandates \u2026 in the last year was to move a significant part of that support for taxpayer service into the IT accounts,\u201d Mr. Koskinen said.\n\nUnder Obamacare, Americans who don\u2019t have insurance coverage and don\u2019t qualify for an exemption are required to pay a tax penalty to enforce the law\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\n\nLast year was the first time the penalty was operational, and most Americans are just now paying their taxes for 2014, meaning the IRS is grappling with the issue for the first time.\n\nCongressional Republicans, trying to kneecap Obamacare, have refused to give the IRS more money to administer the program.\n\nMr. Koskinen said most of his budget goes to personnel so he has had to cut 3,000 positions from his agency this year, leaving him with 87,000 employees. He said that means fewer people answering calls, and fewer examiners and investigators reviewing filings to make sure Americans are paying their fair share of taxes.\n\nHe said Americans might decide it\u2019s easier for them to cheat, lowering the level of tax compliance. Mr. Koskinen said every percentage of lower compliance means $30 billion a year in less revenue to the federal government.\n\nRep. Ander Crenshaw, Florida Republican and chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that writes the IRS budget, said Mr. Koskinen should find better ways to use the money the agency is given before it comes back asking for more.\n\n\u201cStudy your budget line by line, prioritize your activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your opportunity to show this committee and to show all Americans that it\u2019s no longer business as usual at the IRS.\u201d\n\nCongress has cut IRS funding over the past five years as lawmakers express displeasure with the way the agency has operated.\n\nMr. Koskinen said he has to manage a careful balance between service and enforcement. He said a drop in either of those could leave the agency collecting less money.\n\nMr. Crenshaw, though, said the agency isn\u2019t prioritizing its mission correctly.\n\n\u201cWe deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level that will make the IRS think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a single dime to spare on anything frivolous or foolhardy or even mediocre.\u201d\n\nMr. Crenshaw said one example was the agency\u2019s decision last year to impose new rules on nonprofit groups even as it was pleading poverty and asking for more money to handle Obamacare and other enforcement priorities.\n\nThe IRS later scrapped its proposed rules and vowed to try again.\n\nThe agency\u2019s push for new rules grew out of the scandal that ensued with the IRS admission that it improperly targeted tea party groups\u2019 nonprofit applications for intrusive scrutiny.\n\nNearly two years after the scandal was revealed, Mr. Koskinen acknowledged that nearly a dozen groups have yet to be approved.\n\nOne group, the Albuquerque Tea Party, has been waiting since 2009. It has provided hundreds of pages of evidence to the IRS over the years, and officials say they have no idea why they have not been approved.\n\nThe groups have applied for status under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, which designates them as social welfare organizations. Groups under that designation can shield their donors but must abide by rules that prohibit them from making political activities a substantial portion of their work.\n\nMr. Koskinen\u2019s agency offered groups still awaiting approval a deal that they could get immediate approval if they promised to limit political activity to 40 percent of their budgets.\n\nConservative lawyers, however, argue that the law and regulations suggest groups should be able to spend 49.9 percent of their money on political activity, so agreeing to the 40 percent level would be ceding some of their rights to the government.\n\nJay Sekulow, chief council at the American Center for Law and Justice, which represents the Albuquerque Tea Party and at least one other group whose approval is still being blocked by the IRS, said the 40 percent deal wasn\u2019t much of a solution.\n\n\u201cThe suggested \u2018path\u2019 that the IRS commissioner suggests was available a couple of years ago was nothing more than an arbitrary standard that the agency unilaterally constructed out of thin air to placate Americans who have been unlawfully and unconstitutionally targeted by the IRS because of their political beliefs,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said.\n\nHe said they will continue to pursue the lawsuit against the IRS.\n\n\u201cThe IRS remains an agency incapable of self-governance or self-correction. Our federal lawsuit is moving forward,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said.\n\nIn its 2015 IRS funding legislation, Congress included provisions specifically preventing the agency from spending money to target groups for political views, as well as protecting confidentiality of tax returns and halting wasteful spending on conferences.\n\nPresident Obama removed all of those restrictions from his 2016 budget proposal, further irking Republicans at Wednesday\u2019s hearing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The IRS is blaming Obamacare for the agency's poor customer service, with Commissioner John Koskinen telling Congress on Wednesday that he has had to take money away from answering phone calls and instead spend it on technology and personnel to carry out President Obama's health care law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The IRS is blaming Obamacare for the agency\u2019s poor customer service, with Commissioner John Koskinen telling Congress on Wednesday that he has had to take money away from answering phone calls and instead spend it on technology and personnel to carry out President Obama\u2019s health care law.", "title": "IRS blames Obamacare for shoddy customer service", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/18/irs-blames-obamacare-shoddy-customer-service/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/17/f7cca34740a61c076e0f6a7067007928.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/17/f7cca34740a61c076e0f6a7067007928.jpg", "description": "The IRS is blaming Obamacare for the agency's poor customer service, with Commissioner John Koskinen telling Congress on Wednesday that he has had to take money away from answering phone calls and ins", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS blames Obamacare for shoddy customer service"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Internal Revenue Service, John Koskinen, Congress, Ander Crenshaw"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Koskinen said every percentage of lower compliance means $30 billion a year in less revenue to the federal government.\nMr. Koskinen said he has to manage a careful balance between service and enforcement.\nCongressional Republicans, trying to kneecap Obamacare, have refused to give the IRS more money to administer the program.\nNearly two years after the scandal was revealed, Mr. Koskinen acknowledged that nearly a dozen groups have yet to be approved.\nMr. Koskinen warned that it would get worse without an infusion of money and Americans may start to feel emboldened to cheat on their taxes."}
