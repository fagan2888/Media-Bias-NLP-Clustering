Truven Analytics released its list of Top 100 U.S. Hospitals on Wednesday, highlighting hospitals that they say excel in a range of financial and clinical measures based on their independent analysis of public data.

While metrics like 30-day readmissions and mortality rates weigh heavily on the results, Truven also places more emphasis on financial status than other rankings lists. For example, Truven analyzes hospital profitability as well as Medicare spending per beneficiary, something the consultant said is more important to measure as hospitals increase outpatient utilization.

Truven's list comes a few days after Healthgrades released it's Top 100 Hospitals rankings, though Healthgrades criteria puts extra weight on patient outcomes in key medical procedures.

According to Truven, hospitals on the list have profit margins that are 11 percent higher than other hospitals, though the gap varies depending on the hospital size and organization. For example, small and medium community hospitals on the list have profit margins more than 15 percent higher than similar organizations, while major teaching hospitals on the list have margins more than 6 percent higher.

In addition to naming its Top 100, Truven singled out 17 in the list that earned its Everest Award for showing the highest level of improvement.
