In 1985 Rupert Murdoch acquired six television stations in the nation\u2019s largest ten markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Washington, D.C., from John Kluge\u2019s Metromedia conglomerate. The deal, constructed before Murdoch had acquired 20th Century Fox, put the creation of a fourth network within reach. When Murdoch bought out Marvin Davis\u2019s stake in both Fox studios and the stations that year, the Australian newspaper king was suddenly America\u2019s newest multimedia mogul\u2014with major holdings in print, movies, and television.\n\nAt its debut in 1986, the Fox network broadcast but a night or two a week. Even when Fox became full-fledged, it provided just two hours of nightly prime-time programming. It offered magazine shows inspired more by the New York Post and daytime television than nightly news programs. In fact, Fox had built no indigenous news division to cover the news.\n\n\u201cA Current Affair\u201d was a syndicated scandal and entertainment TV show that originated in 1986 from News Corp\u2019s flagship local TV station WNYW Channel 5 in New York City. One of its stars was Steve Dunleavy. He wore a trench coat, chain-smoked like Bogart, and cut a memorable figure with a jutting chin and unavoidable pompadour. And he chased just about anything with two X chromosomes. The oft-recycled claim was that he had been in coital vigor with a Scandinavian heiress late one snowy night outside a bar when a city snowplow ran over\u2014and broke\u2014his foot. Dunleavy was said to be so soused that he continued his aerobic affections unabated.\n\nThe tabloid columnist Pete Hamill joked, \u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t his writing foot.\u201d\n\nDunleavy shone as a reporter for Murdoch\u2019s tabloid Mirror in Sydney before breaking stories for the National Star. He headed to greater glories on the Post. During the height of the scare over the Son of Sam serial killings in the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, Dunleavy wrote a florid front-page piece advertised by the headline \u201cGunman Sparks Son of Sam Chase.\u201d Readers learned right before the article\u2019s conclusion that the gunman was not the Son of Sam at all.\n\nAfter helping to launch \u201cA Current Affair,\u201d Dunleavy surfaced yet again for Murdoch on the early Fox weekend show \u201cThe Reporters,\u201d another hour of gossip and crime. \u201cIn its first couple of years, television was considered a foul little business that no self-respecting journalist wanted anything to do with,\u201d Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales wrote at its debut in 1988. \u201cFox Broadcasting is trying to bring those days back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Reporters\u201d didn\u2019t last long, but Dunleavy never lost his luster with Murdoch. Fox did not need to develop refined taste. The early reality Fox show \u201cCops,\u201d an exceptionally cost-effective production that taped raids by patrolling police officers on low-level criminals, frequently beat its competition in the ratings. \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d a spin-off of Tracey Ullman\u2019s comedy show, became a breakaway hit. \u201cMarried with Children,\u201d coarse by anyone\u2019s definition, helped brand the network as edgier and younger than its network elders and prefigured some of its recent successes, such as Seth MacFarlane\u2019s animated \u201cFamily Guy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, local Fox stations conjured up newscasts with a brisker, more tabloidy feel. By 1992 Murdoch decided that the local stations Fox owned and ran itself would no longer carry CNN\u2019s feed (which he had obtained from CNN founder Ted Turner at a dear cost). In 1995 Murdoch brought to New York one of his foremost British executives, Andrew Neil. To be precise, Neil was a Scot, like Murdoch\u2019s grandfather, but not stereotypically dour. The mirthful former reporter and editor for the Economist had served for nearly a dozen years as editor of Murdoch\u2019s Sunday Times; he was also the founding chairman of Sky TV, later merged into BSkyB, today one of the most important holdings the Murdochs control. Neil came to the U.S. to help guide the creation of Fox News.\n\nThe birth of Fox News sprang from Murdoch\u2019s decision to create a television empire around sports, as he had previously in Australia and the U.K. In 1993 Fox bought the rights to broadcast the games of the NFL\u2019s then dominant NFC division, swiping football from CBS for nearly $1.6 billion. \u201cWe\u2019re a network now. Like no other sport will do, the NFL will make us into a real network,\u201d Murdoch exulted to Sports Illustrated. \u201cIn the future there will be 400 or 500 channels on cable, and ratings will be fragmented. But football on Sunday will have the same ratings, regardless of the number of channels. Football will not fragment.\u201d\n\nHe was right. And he wanted a winning weekly bookend for football to strike at another top-rated CBS program. \u201cAt that stage, Rupert Murdoch had in mind to set up a Fox News answer to \u201960 Minutes,\u2019\u201d Neil told me. \u201cIt was to be an hour-long news show going out after the NFL football program on Fox.\u201d His costar was to be Judith Regan, a young woman who had sliced her way to the top-selling echelons of the book publishing business. Smart, and possessed of finely sharpened elbows, Regan had by this point been rewarded with her own imprint, ReganBooks, at Murdoch\u2019s HarperCollins publishing house. Neil started getting uneasy as Murdoch brought in a consultant to help punch up the concept of what news would look and sound like on Fox. The idea of creating a show yielded to the idea of creating an entire cable network\u2014a niche news channel.\n\nThe new network would speak to viewers who felt the rest of the press was too liberal, like the New York Times, even 60 Minutes itself. The consultant had been a political strategist for presidents Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush, the executive producer of a TV show starring Rush Limbaugh, and the head of financial news channel CNBC.\n\nHis name was Roger Ailes.\n\n*\n\nMSNBC launched at about the same time. It was a partnership of Microsoft and the giant manufacturing and finance conglomerate GE\u2019s NBC division. In short, its executives had very little idea of what they were doing other than amortizing NBC News\u2019s costs across an additional channel. A parade of executives came and left in the ensuing decade.\n\nUnder Ailes, Fox\u2019s vision was clear and pure. Its cultural sensibility offered a modern version of a \u201cMad Men\u201d world, where opinions were declarative: men were confident; professional women smart, young, and sleek. And it chased stories of dysfunction in Bill Clinton\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what television didn\u2019t do at the time,\u201d Ailes later told Esquire magazine. \u201cIt didn\u2019t reflect what people really thought. I mean, they\u2019re sitting there saying, \u2018Wait a minute, New York\u2019s going broke, Los Angeles is broke, the United States is broke, everything the government has run is broke, Social Security is broke, Medicare is broke, the military is broke, why do we want these guys making all these decisions for us?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe American news consumer of just fifteen years ago would not have been able to recognize the country\u2019s current media landscape\u2014the range of choices, the technological innovations, and in particular the cacophony. And no other news organization has done more in recent years to reshape that terrain than Fox. Just about every news organization either mimics or reacts against the way Fox presents the news and the values it represents.\n\nThat\u2019s not because Fox News breaks many big stories. It doesn\u2019t. (Part of the brilliance of its financial model is to have a lean reporting staff.) That\u2019s not because the channel draws the biggest audiences in news. Nor does it do so in television news, with some exceptions, though it is a dominant force in cable television.\n\nWhat Fox News does, instead, is to determine what it believes should be the story of the day. It is a choice intended not just to select its own coverage, but to force others to pay attention\u2014day after day. Fox News does so with an eye for episodes overlooked by other major news outlets. It particularly seeks storylines and themes that reflect and further stoke a sense of grievance among cultural conservatives against coastal elites.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From day one, Rupert Murdoch's baby was louder and angrier than its competitors.
