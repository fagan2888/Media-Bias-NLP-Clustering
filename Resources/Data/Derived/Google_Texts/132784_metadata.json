(Photo: Register file photo)Buy Photo\n\nIf anyone can identify with Tyler McCubbin, it\u2019s retired school teachers Larry Hoch and David Twombley.\n\nMcCubbin is the 26-year-old track coach and substitute teacher who was recently denied a full-time teaching contract at Dowling Catholic High School in West Des Moines. He was denied for one reason. He is openly gay.\n\nTwombley and Hoch are the self-described \u201cOld Farts Couple\u201d of Varnum v. Brien the unanimous 2009 Iowa Supreme Court decision that opened the door to marriage equality in the nation\u2019s heartland and beyond. When that door flew open, many legal benefits came rushing in as well.\n\nFor three decades before retiring, Hoch taught middle-school math in the lower Hudson Valley of New York; Twombley was a long-time music teacher in Iowa.\n\nThe two were respected, devoted educators. They kept their jobs for all those years not only because they knew their craft, but also because they knew how to keep a secret. In their 70s now and living in Urbandale, the two spent the better part of their lives hiding their sexual orientation.\n\nWhile McCubbin made no secret of his engagement to another man, Twombley and Hoch were the products of a different time. As teachers during an era when homosexuals were often prosecuted by overzealous law enforcement officials, both men said they never were under the illusion they could be honest about their sexual preference.\n\n\u201cI kept a log of everyone I\u2019d told so I could keep my story straight,\u201d Hoch said in interviews for the book \u201cEqual Before the Law: How Iowa Led Americans to Marriage Equality.\u201d\n\nMarried at age 39 in 1982 but divorced 10 years later after the birth of two children, he had watched teachers like himself lose their jobs. Not until his retirement in 1999 did he disclose to his family he was gay. Like Twombley, Hoch first told a brother.\n\n\u201cThe noose was no longer around my neck,\u201d he remembered.\n\nTwombley also hid his orientation from his bosses. To take his mind off the complications of living with this secret, he took up running at age 49 and raced three times in the Boston Marathon. He also obtained a pilot\u2019s license.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t resentful,\u201d he told us. \u201cFor a long, long time in my 20s, 30s, 40s, I just tried not to think about it.\u201d\n\nYears later, when Twombley finally went public with his homosexuality, he felt compelled to meet with one of his favorite former students, Joel Fry.\n\n\u201cOne of the sharpest trumpet players I ever had,\u201d Twombley said. \u201cA very mature, reliable kid with a great sense of humor.\u201d\n\nBy then, Fry, had married and become a member of the Iowa House.\n\nTwombley will never forget Fry\u2019s reaction during their meeting. Why did you choose to be gay?\n\nTwombley\u2019s response: \u201cI could no more chose my orientation than my eye color.\u201d\n\nAs a legislator, Fry supported a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to a man and woman. Though he remained dubious about Twombley\u2019s homosexuality, he told Twombley his old teacher was still the same person he looked up to as a teenager.\n\nThere is no disputing Dowling Catholic\u2019s legal right to deny McCubbin a teaching contract. His lifestyle is at odds with church teaching, and under Iowa law the school has the right to exercise that judgment.\n\nBut consider this: Would the students have been better served with a coach or teacher who couldn\u2019t be honest about himself? Isn\u2019t it likely they would have learned from McCubbin and positioned their views on his personal life into the proper context of their religion?\n\nWhile views have drastically changed since then, Dowling remains firmly anchored in the fog of don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell. Someday that fog will lift. Not at the proper pace, of course, but lift it will.\n\nSomeday, gay men and women will not have to live a lie to serve their God and teach at private schools like Dowling Catholic. The world is changing. And, believe it or not, so is the church. When Iowa\u2019s high court ruled on Varnum in 2009, the Iowa\u2019s Catholic bishops favored a constitutional amendment to right the wrong.\n\nHere\u2019s what Richard E. Pates, Catholic Diocese of Des Moines, said in a joint statement with Iowa\u2019s other three bishops:\n\n\u201cThis decision rejects the wisdom of thousands of years of human history. It implements a novel understanding of marriage, which will grievously harm families and children.\u201d\n\nGrievously harm families and children.\n\nWhen the Iowa Supreme Court justices launched into the research in preparation for Varnum, they were inundated with science that concluded just the opposite.\n\nThis is what Pates told the Register on the fifth anniversary of the decision:\n\n\u201cAccording to several indicators, there is a growing acceptance of same-sex marriage nationwide, and there\u2019s no reason to think it\u2019s not true in Iowa. I believe most people who support same-sex marriage do so in good will, but I think there is much more than good will involved.\n\n\u201cFirst, many of us can agree on this: God loves everyone, gay or straight. No one is excluded, and sexual identity is only one component of who we are. Gay people are welcome in the Catholic church. Many of them are hurting from hateful attitudes, and as Pope Francis has said, Christians should see themselves less as enforcers of rules than as doctors in a field hospital.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, all of us, not just gay people, are challenged to approach our sexuality in a responsible and mature manner.\n\n\u201cThis said, the church holds that marriage is the union of a man and a woman and is the best way to nurture and protect children. This position is based on the solid teaching of Scripture and our own tradition about its meaning, which is derived from the \u2018natural law\u2019 deeply embedded in the humanity of each of us by a loving creator.\n\n\u201cDespite what the Iowa court has ruled, we also believe that limiting marriage to a man and woman is best for the common good and the future of society.\u201d\n\nNo mistaking the change in tone. No mistaking the wishes of the Dowling students who walked out of school in protest of what they believed to be a wrong-minded decision to take back the job they\u2019d promised McCubbin before the truth popped up on Facebook.\n\nThose Dowling kids aren\u2019t going away. There are tons more like them. Someday they\u2019ll have more say in such decisions. It doesn\u2019t help McCubbin much or the students he might have had. Small consolation, Tyler, but you just took one for the team.\n\nTOM WITOSKY AND MARC\n\nHANSEN wrote for the Des Moines Register for more than 30 years before retiring in 2012.
