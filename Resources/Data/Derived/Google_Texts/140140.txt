The Lakers won just 21 games through a difficult 2014-15 season.

Injuries were a major factor, starting with Steven Nash (back) in training camp and ending with rookie Jordan Clarkson hobbled with an ankle injury.

The Lakers saw players sit for 339 games because of injury and 355 in total.

Kobe Bryant missed 39 games with a shoulder injury. Before he was lost for the season, the all-star guard rested for eight games -- not included in the injury tally.

Nash was waived late in the season, after missing 73 games.

Rookie Julius Randle broke his leg on opening night, leaving him out of commission for the following 81 games.

Nick Young was injured for 39 games with ankle, thumb and knee injuries.

Wayne Ellington lost one game due to a concussion, eight because of a separated shoulder and another eight after the tragic death of his father.

Ronnie Price was suspended for a game, lost one with a broken nose and the flu, an additional two with the same broken nose and a sore right elbow, followed by 27 to have the elbow surgically repaired.

Jeremy Lin missed seven games (upper respiratory infection, knee), Ryan Kelly 29 (hamstring), Wesley Johnson five (hip, ankle), Jordan Hill five (hip), Carlos Boozer three (upper respiratory infection, shoulder) and Clarkson just the one with the ankle injury.

Tarik Black was unavailable for a game when the Lakers initially claimed him off waivers from the Houston Rockets. He also sat out two with an ankle sprain.

Finally, Xavier Henry ruptured his Achilles' tendon, missing 16 days before the Lakers cut him to open a roster spot for Black.
