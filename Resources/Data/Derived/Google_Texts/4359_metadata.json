Most of the international terrorism casework that crosses my desk involves countries beyond Europe's borders,\" May said.\n\n\"So my judgment as home secretary is that remaining a member of the European Union means we will be more secure from crime and terrorism.\"\n\n(Editing by Guy Faulconbridge/Jeremy Gaunt)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - Bookmakers' odds have shifted sharply toward Britain voting to rema", "title": "Betting odds move sharply toward Britain staying in EU after Obama warning", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/25/Odds-move-sharply-towards-Britain-staying-EU-cut-after-Obama-warning", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/britain-eu-nordics_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/25/Odds-move-sharply-towards-Britain-staying-EU-cut-after-Obama-warning", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/britain-eu-nordics_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - Bookmakers' odds have shifted sharply toward Britain voting to rema", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f43\"", "article_summary": "In an opinion column in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Johnson accused the \"Remain\" camp of \"crowing too soon\".\nThe probability of a \"Remain\", or \"In\", vote implied by the odds was at its highest level since September 2015, Betfair data showed.\nBoth moves followed a direct intervention by U.S. President Barack Obama in favor of Britain staying in, but those advocating leaving sought to undermine his arguments and warned the \"In\" camp not to celebrate too early.\n\"Leaving the EU would not mean we could just close ourselves off to the world ...\nBut Home Secretary Theresa May, the interior minister who is in the \"Remain\" camp, said \"nobody should think leaving the EU is a silver bullet that is suddenly going to solve all our immigration problems\"."}
