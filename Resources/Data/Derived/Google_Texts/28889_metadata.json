(AP) - As the one-year anniversary of Derby toddler Anthony Muoio\u2019s lifesaving surgery approaches, his family paid it forward recently to Yale-New Haven Children\u2019s Hospital, which saved the young boy\u2019s life.\n\nAnthony will be 17 months old on Friday, one year after undergoing an intensive, nine-hour surgery to remove a life-threatening brain tumor.\n\nThe tumor was resting against an artery, threatening to cut off then 5-month-old Anthony\u2019s blood supply. Doctors successfully removed the tumor, and Anthony has experienced an \u201camazing recovery.\u201d He will continue with follow-up care for years, but recently graduated to having MRIs every six months instead of every three, according to his parents.\n\nTo celebrate the one-year milestone, Anthony and his parents, Sarah and Robert Muoio, and brother, Nico, paid a visit to the hospital, delivering 32 gift \u201cbags of hope\u201d and gift cards to the families of children facing medical crises of their own.\n\nAnthony delivered cookies and pumpkins to the nurses\u2019 station and hugged the respiratory therapist who took him off his ventilator last year. The family was also met in the hospital lobby by the priest who provided comfort and prayers during their trying ordeal.\n\n\u201cWe decided to pay it forward mostly because of all the love, support, and prayers that Anthony received in the hospital,\u201d said Sarah Muoio. \u201cHe was surrounded by an amazing doctor, nursing, and hospital staff. They carried us through his battle as a family. They put our son back in our hands better then we handed him over to them. They saved his life. We are forever indebted.\u201d\n\nThe gift bags come courtesy of donations made by people, dubbed \u201cAnthony\u2019s Army,\u201d who reached out to the Muoio family via Facebook during the two weeks they spent in the pediatric intensive care unit, following Anthony\u2019s surgery. The bags contained comforting items including blankets and toys for the children, notepads and pens for parents, snacks, water bottles, Anthony\u2019s Army wrist bands and post cards showing Anthony\u2019s progress, aimed at giving parents hope for their children\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWhen Anthony was in the hospital, we were surrounded by an \u2018army\u2019 of people who provided us with all we would need to get through our 14 days in the PICU,\u201d said Muoio. \u201cMy husband and I felt that a major part of Anthony\u2019s recovery was attributed to the homemade blankets that my mother had brought us from home. In a cold and scary ICU, they provided him warmth and comfort.\u201d\n\nMuoio said Anthony\u2019s Facebook page has attracted hundreds of followers watching Anthony\u2019s progress and donating to other families in need.\n\nOnce Anthony took a turn for the better, Muoio met other parents who didn\u2019t have the outside support her family received through friends and Facebook. That\u2019s why she decided to create the \u201cbags of hope\u201d to provide comfort to those struggling with the very issues her family endured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so meaningful for us to do this because not only do we want to raise awareness, we want to help others in Anthony\u2019s honor because so many people helped us,\u201d Muoio added.\n\nMuoio, who is director of Derby\u2019s Senior Center, said Anthony\u2019s \u201csmile and infectious personality\u201d pushed the family to do more.\n\n\u201cHe loves being around people, he volunteers with us all the time and he has really been the driving force in keeping us positive,\u201d Muoio noted. \u201cUntil he was diagnosed, we had no idea about pediatric brain tumors, so raising awareness is so important to us. The first thing the doctors told us was that five to 10 years ago, there was no cure for Anthony\u2019s condition. Someone raised awareness down the road, and medical advances sent us home from the hospital with our son. We so feel the need to continue that so other families can end up on our end of things.\u201d\n\nThe Muoios are currently shooting a documentary about Anthony\u2019s case with Yale, and have since developed a Website www.kickitforkids.org, to raise awareness.\n\nHospital child life specialist Leah Yazmer met the Muoios at Yale-New Haven Wednesday and expressed her gratitude for the donations.\n\n\u201cThis donation is extremely kind and thoughtful of you and your family in honor of Anthony\u2019s one year,\u201d Yazmer said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: New Haven Register, http://www.nhregister.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the one-year anniversary of Derby toddler Anthony Muoio's lifesaving surgery approaches, his family paid it forward recently to Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital, which saved the young boy's life.", "Author": "JEAN FALBO-SOSNOVICH", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/3/family-of-boy-recovering-from-surgery-provides-gif/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As the one-year anniversary of Derby toddler Anthony Muoio\u2019s lifesaving surgery approaches, his family paid it forward recently to Yale-New Haven Children\u2019s Hospital, which saved the young boy\u2019s life.", "title": "Family of boy recovering from surgery provides gifts"}, "twitter": {"title": "Family of boy recovering from surgery provides gifts", "description": "As the one-year anniversary of Derby toddler Anthony Muoio's lifesaving surgery approaches, his family paid it forward recently to Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital, which saved the young boy's life.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "DERBY, Conn.
