That assessment is at odds with Israel, which contends Tehran is on a faster course toward a bomb.\n\nHe expressed optimism about the blossoming diplomacy between his administration and Iran\u2019s new president, but said the U.S. would not accept a \u201cbad deal\u201d on the Islamic republic\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nThe president spoke to the AP on Friday, four days into a partial shutdown of the federal government that has forced 800,000 people off the job, closed national parks and curbed many government services.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden walk down Pennsylvania Ave. to pick up lunch at the Taylor Gourmet Deli (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nObama reiterated his opposition to negotiating with House Republicans to end the shutdown or raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling.\n\n\u201cThere are enough votes in the House of Representatives to make sure that the government reopens today,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty willing to bet that there are enough votes in the House of Representatives right now to make sure that the United States doesn\u2019t end up being a deadbeat.\u201d\n\nOn other points, Obama:\n\n\u2014Contrasted his tenure as a senator with the current crop of first-term Republican senators, saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t go around courting the media\u201d or \u201ctrying to shut down the government\u201d while he was in the Senate.\n\n\u2014Said he\u2019s considering keeping some American forces in Afghanistan after the war formally ends in late 2014, if an agreement can be reached with the Afghan government. He tried to do the same in Iraq but was unable to reach an agreement with its government.\n\n\u2014Suggested that the owner of the Washington Redskins football team consider changing its name because, the president said, the current name offends \u201ca sizable group of people.\u201d\n\nWith no sign of a breakthrough to end the government shutdown, Obama said he would be willing to negotiate with Republicans on health care, deficit reduction and spending \u2014 but only if House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, holds votes to reopen the government and increase the nation\u2019s borrowing limit.\n\nSome House Republicans are seeking health care concessions from Obama in exchange for approving government financing and want more spending cuts before raising the debt ceiling.\n\nThe Treasury Department says the nation will hit its borrowing limit around Oct. 17. Obama didn\u2019t specifically rule out taking action on his own if Congress fails to increase the debt ceiling, but said he doesn\u2019t expect to get to that point.\n\nObama, who successfully ran for president as a first-term senator, also spoke critically about first-term Republican senators, such as Ted Cruz of Texas, who have been leading efforts to shut the government if Republicans can\u2019t extract concessions from the White House.\n\nThe president said that when he was in the Senate, he \u201cdidn\u2019t go around courting the media. And I certainly didn\u2019t go around trying to shut down the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recognize that in today\u2019s media age, being controversial, taking controversial positions, rallying the most extreme parts of your base, whether it\u2019s left or right, is a lot of times the fastest way to get attention and raise money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not good for government.\u201d\n\nThe deadline for keeping the government open coincided with the Oct. 1 start of sign-ups for the insurance markets at the center of the health care overhaul Obama signed into law during his first term. Government websites struggled in the first week to keep up with high demand for the new marketplaces. It\u2019s not clear that more than a few managed to enroll the first day.\n\nObama said he didn\u2019t know how many people had enrolled. Administration officials have said they do not plan to release real-time data on the number of people enrolling, though some states running their own exchange websites are doing so.\n\nThe president predicted that when the six-month signup window for the insurance exchanges ends, \u201cwe are going to probably exceed what anybody expected in terms of the amount of interest that people had.\u201d\n\nIn the flurry of domestic issues consuming his second term, Obama has launched a diplomatic outreach to Iran, aimed at resolving the dispute over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Last week, he spoke by phone with President Hassan Rouhani, marking the first direct exchange between U.S. and Iranian leaders in more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cRouhani has staked his position on the idea that he can improve relations with the rest of the world,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd so far he\u2019s been saying a lot of the right things. And the question now is, can he follow through?\u201d\n\nBut Obama said Rouhani is not Iran\u2019s only \u201cdecision-maker. He\u2019s not even the ultimate decision-maker,\u201d a reference to the control wielded by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayotollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nGiven the supreme leader\u2019s broad influence, some countries, most notably Israel, have questioned whether Rouhani actually represents real change in Iran or just new packaging of old policies.\n\nObama also put distance between U.S. and Israeli assessments of when Iran might have the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Israeli officials have said Iran is just months away from being able to build a bomb, while Obama said Tehran was a year or more away.\n\nThe president used the same timetable in March, before traveling to Israel. The U.S. and Israel contend that Iran\u2019s nuclear program is aimed at building a bomb, while Tehran says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes.\n\nOn the 12-year war in Afghanistan, Obama said he would consider keeping some American forces on the ground after the conflict formally ends next year, but acknowledged that doing so would require an agreement from the Afghan government. He suggested that if no agreement can be reached, he would be comfortable with a full pullout of U.S. troops.\n\n\u201cIf in fact we can get an agreement that makes sure that U.S. troops are protected, makes sure that we can operate in a way that is good for our national security, then I\u2019ll certainly consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we will continue to make sure that all the gains we\u2019ve made in going after al-Qaida we accomplish, even if we don\u2019t have any U.S. military on Afghan soil.\u201d\n\nAll U.S. forces left Iraq at the end of 2011 after no deal could be reached to keep some there longer.\n\nObama, an avid sports fan, also weighed in on the controversy surrounding the Redskins as the name of Washington\u2019s NFL football team. The name has faced a new barrage of criticism for being offensive to Native Americans.\n\nThe president said he doesn\u2019t think Redskins\u2019 fans mean any offense by using the name. But he added: \u201cIf I were the owner of the team and I knew that the name of my team, even if they\u2019ve had a storied history, that was offending a sizable group of people, I\u2019d think about changing it.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2013 by The Associated Press.
