Click the image for a closer look at what may happen in your state:\n\nThe Obama administration has so far not released information about premium hikes for the 2015 enrollment year. Officials decided to withhold that information until late this week, after the midterm elections and just before people can begin the enrollment process for 2015.\n\nBut according to PwC\u2019s Health Research Institute, insurance premiums will rise in most states, and even when the average increase is in the single digits, that average reflects double-digit increases for some plans.\n\n\u201cThough average rate increases hover in the single-digit range, actual changes and premium prices vary significantly across states,\u201d PwC said. \u201cIn states with approved rates, average rates range from a 22 percent decrease to a 35 percent increase (in Colorado).\u201d\n\nWhile Colorado will likely see the highest increase, some premiums will fall in that state, and the average increase there is just 2 percent.\n\nOther states that will see some increases of 20 percent or more for some plans are Washington, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Kansas, Wisconsin, Indiana and Pennsylvania. But the average increase for most of these states is between 5 and 10 percent.\n\nPwC said seven states and Washington DC have announced final premium rates, and the average premium increase among these states is 3.5 percent.\n\nThe company said the average increase in insurance premiums for all states is 5.6 percent. States with the biggest average increases are Kansas and Louisiana \u2014 Kansas is expected to see premiums jump an average of 15.5 percent, and Louisiana will see an average hike of 15.2 percent.\n\nIowa, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, South Carolina and Virginia are all expected to see increases between 10 and 15 percent.\n\nThe increases take place in the backdrop of a slowing rate of growth for health care costs, something that many Democrats have credited to the passage of Obamacare in 2010. But others have said health care costs have been rising more slowly for the last decade, a sign that other factors are in play besides the law.\n\nEarlier this week, the Department of Health and Human Services said it only expects about 2 million more people to sign up for an Obamacare plan in 2015. That would put the total at 9.1 million enrolled people, which is about 4 million less than what the Congressional Budget Office estimated for 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "People shopping for health insurance under Obamacare starting this weekend can expect insurance premiums to be an average of 5.6 percent higher than last year, although that average reflects changes to premiums that will fall in some cases, and rise as much as 20 percent in others, according to...", "title": "Obamacare Shoppers May See Insurance Premiums Rise as Much as 20 Percent", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/11/11/obamacare-shoppers-may-see-insurance-premiums-rise-as-much-as-20-percent/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-11-at-2.21.53-PM-620x412.png", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "obamacare, health, care, insurance, premiums", "sailthru.tags": "government, health-care, obamacare, the-furnace, the-furnance, author-pete-kasperowicz, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 222, "gplus-count": 4, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/890999", "categories": "health-care,obamacare,the-furnance,government,the-furnace", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 38, "description": "People shopping for health insurance under Obamacare starting this weekend can expect insurance premiums to be an average of 5.6 percent higher than last year, although that average reflects changes to premiums that will fall in some cases, and rise as much as 20 percent in others, according to...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 2, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "People shopping for health insurance under Obamacare starting this weekend can expect insurance premiums to be an average of 5.6 percent higher than last year, although that average reflects changes to premiums that will fall in some cases, and rise as much as 20 percent in others, according to...", "title": "Obamacare Shoppers May See Insurance Premiums Rise as Much as 20 Percent", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/11/11/obamacare-shoppers-may-see-insurance-premiums-rise-as-much-as-20-percent/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-11-at-2.21.53-PM-620x412.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 412}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-11-11T14:27:42+00:00", "twitter-count": 283}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3283\"", "article_summary": "The company said the average increase in insurance premiums for all states is 5.6 percent.\nPeople shopping for health insurance under Obamacare starting this weekend can expect insurance premiums to be an average of 5.6 percent higher than last year, although that average reflects changes to premiums that will fall in some cases, and rise as much as 20 percent in others, according to a private estimate.\nPwC said seven states and Washington DC have announced final premium rates, and the average premium increase among these states is 3.5 percent.\nBut according to PwC\u2019s Health Research Institute, insurance premiums will rise in most states, and even when the average increase is in the single digits, that average reflects double-digit increases for some plans.\nBut the average increase for most of these states is between 5 and 10 percent."}
