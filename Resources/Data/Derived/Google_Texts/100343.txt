According to Fox News and several print media outlets tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people are about to be notified that their health insurance policies are being cancelled, thanks to Obamacare.

That could mean bad news for liberals just weeks before 2014 midterm elections, except the broadcast networks have refused to report it. ABC, CBS and NBC news programs failed to mention the latest wave of policy cancellations as of Oct. 9.

Fox News Channel’s chief national correspondent Jim Angle reported that because of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of individuals will be notified sometime no later than Nov. 1, that they are losing their health insurance.

Plans that could not meet regulations mandated under the Affordable Care Act will no longer be granted a reprieve in thirteen states and the District of Columbia and must therefore be canceled.

Although President Barack Obama promised time and again, “if you like your health care plan, you can keep it” many Americans found out differently in late 2013. The New York Times noted, “several million Americans were told that their insurance plans were not compliant with rules established by the Affordable Care Act.” Obama’s claim was named PolitiFact’s “lie of the year” in 2013.

This year, “Virginia will be hardest hit, with 250,000 policies to be cancelled, in spite of a pledge from the Democratic senator running for re-election,” Jim Angle reported for "Special Report with Bret Baier" Oct. 8.

The news broke within the past two weeks and was reported by several major newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Washington Post. The Times downplayed the cancellations saying they would affect “relatively few” people. But so far, the broadcast networks have helped the left by ignoring impending cancellations.
