Mary Fallin announced in November 2012 that Oklahoma would not expand its Medicaid program to cover more low-income Oklahomans, a key element of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nHospital association leaders launched their plan, Transforming Health Care: A Proposal for Oklahoma\u2019s Future, in November and have spent the past few months educating policy leaders about the plan\u2019s goals. Oklahoma Hospital Association President Craig Jones presented the plan in December to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority board.\n\nJones said during his presentation to the board Tuesday that although the state\u2019s political climate hasn\u2019t been open to expanding Medicaid, the money is available and other states have used it for alternative plans to increase coverage.\n\n\u201cObviously, there are concerns about \u2018Well, what\u2019s this going to cost the state?\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve run the numbers umpteenth different ways, and we are absolutely convinced \u2014 absolutely convinced \u2014 that it is a positive return for the state.\u201d\n\nInsure Oklahoma\n\nJones said Oklahoma has a health insurance program in place that it can use to cover more low-income adults. That program is called Insure Oklahoma.\n\nInsure Oklahoma is a state-based program created to bridge the health coverage gap for low-income working Oklahomans, according to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority. The program provides a premium assistance program for employers. For individuals who don\u2019t have access through an employer, they\u2019re provided limited coverage options, including paying a health insurance premium based on a sliding income scale.\n\nThe program is paid for with state tobacco tax money, matched with federal money.\n\nA waiver for Insure Oklahoma was scheduled to expire at the end of 2014, but the federal government agreed to extend the program until Dec. 31.\n\nInsure Oklahoma\u2019s income guidelines for its individual plan are capped at people who make 100 percent of the federal poverty level. Through the hospital association\u2019s plan, more low-income adults would be able to sign up for coverage through Insure Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2012, about 590,000 Oklahoma adults were uninsured, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nMany of these residents are in rural Oklahoma, placing a strain on hospitals in those regions, Jones said.\n\nThe cost of providing care for uninsured Oklahomans in 2012 was $550 million, with rural hospitals providing a lot of that care, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A state Board of Health member asked his fellow board members Tuesday to endorse a plan that would use federal Medicaid expansion dollars for an alternative plan to increase health insurance coverage options for low-income Oklahomans.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
