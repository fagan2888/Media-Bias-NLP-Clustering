From now on we are just going to keep on winning championships like we did way back when. We just want to continue our tradition of excellence. Right now it's a little over whelming. I'm sure it will hit me on the bus ride home, but right now I'm just excited and I'll wait to celebrate later,\" Melendez said.\n\nThis is Post 22's 39th state championship, by far the most in South Dakota history. Tournament M.V.P., Matt Minnick, and his boys won't have long to celebrate as they will now represent the Rushmore State at the Regional Tournament in Fargo beginning on Thursday. If they win that they will play in the Legion World Series.\n\n\"It's great knowing that. I'll have memories from this season for the rest of my life. Winning state this year and last year we are going to look back and know that this was a huge deal. It took everyone's effort.
