Francis has called for the elimination of barriers between the U.S. and Cuba, and Reuters reported late Thursday that the Vatican hopes his trip will help bring an end to the embargo.\n\n\n\nThe Vatican said it hoped that ending the embargo would bring about more freedom in Cuba.\n\n\n\nWhite House aides late Thursday acknowledged Francis's position on Cuba ahead of his visit to the U.S., where he will meet personally with Obama and address a joint session of Congress.\n\nThe Friday rule change will increase the number and types of trips that American airplanes and boats can make to and from the island just 90 miles offshore of Florida. People authorized to travel to Cuba will also be able to open and maintain bank accounts there and will be able to have their close relatives tag along for additional types of activities.\n\n\n\nAmerican companies in a range of sectors will also be allowed to set up physical shop in Cuba for the first time in decades. They will be able to hire Cuban nationals and interact with Cuba\u2019s banking sector.\n\n\n\nIn particular, the new rules make it easier for American telecommunications and Internet companies to flood into Cuba, which has been a core plank of the Obama administration\u2019s reopening. In addition to setting up businesses in Cuba, they will also be able to bring in more consumer tech devices and add training to repair, install and replace those devices.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a $2,000 limit on remittances to Cuba will be removed entirely.\n\n\n\nThe changes will take effect on Monday, when the regulations are formally published in the Federal Register.\n\n\n\nA draft of the changes was first obtained by Reuters.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The new rules will make it easier for U.S. businesses to have a presence on Cuba.", "description": "The new rules will make it easier for U.S. businesses to have a presence on Cuba.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jesse Byrnes", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The new rules will make it easier for U.S. businesses to have a presence on Cuba.", "title": "Administration unveils more Cuban policy changes", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/254155-report-white-house-plans-more-cuban-policy-changes", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cubaembassy_072015fr.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/254155-report-white-house-plans-more-cuban-policy-changes", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-18T08:20-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Jack Lew,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-18T08:20:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/254155-report-white-house-plans-more-cuban-policy-changes", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The new rules will make it easier for U.S. businesses to have a presence on Cuba.", "card": "summary", "title": "Administration unveils more Cuban policy changes"}, "dcterms.title": "Administration unveils more Cuban policy changes"}, "article_summary": "The changes will take effect on Monday, when the regulations are formally published in the Federal Register.\nThey will be able to hire Cuban nationals and interact with Cuba\u2019s banking sector.\nFriday\u2019s announcement comes as Pope Francis begins his weekend visit to Cuba, which will be followed by a trip to Washington and other U.S. cities next week.\nThe Vatican said it hoped that ending the embargo would bring about more freedom in Cuba.\nThe Obama administration will further roll back sanctions on Cuba, it announced Friday, allowing businesses to have a presence on the island nation and making it easier for people to travel there."}
