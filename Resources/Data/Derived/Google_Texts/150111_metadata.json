One of the nation\u2019s largest organizations of police officers put its weight behind lifting the ban.\n\nChuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, requested that the ban on \u201cconcealed carry\u201d be ended in a letter to Roger Goodell, commissioner of the National Football League.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s policy against concealed weapons \u201cweakens the safety and security of NFL players, personnel and fans,\u201d Canterbury wrote Goodell on Nov. 20.\n\nCanterbury said the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, selects targets based on the \u201camount of death\u201d the terrorist group can achieve, making crowded football stadiums appealing targets:\n\nWell-attended venues and areas are being deliberately targeted by these radical killers who do not intend or expect to survive the assault. Law enforcement, even when working actively with high skilled and trained security professionals, cannot be certain that all threats will be detected and neutralized.\n\nThe NFL did not respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment and apparently has not publicly addressed the FOP\u2019s letter.\n\nJim Pasco, the FOP\u2019s executive director, said the police organization believes that security is beefed up by off-duty and retired police officers who attend any sort of organized games.\n\n\u201cUnder federal law, off-duty and retired officers may carry their firearms, and in most any situation,\u201d Pasco said in an interview with The Daily Signal, adding:\n\nRestricted, obviously, by the constitutional right of people to say \u2018not here,\u2019 which is basically what the NFL has done. That being said, it is our reasoning that trained, qualified personnel with their weapons are force multipliers, which was the reason the federal law was passed in the first place so that police officers would be able to carry their weapons and thereby intervene, hopefully to good effect, in otherwise life-threatening situations.\n\nAlthough some might see the ban as a Second Amendment issue, Pasco said, FOP officials don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNo, this is a public safety issue here,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile we have no quarrel with the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nPasco said the FOP also is trying to reach out to team owners and state governments, noting that state law, as in Texas, can override the NFL\u2019s ban on concealed carry:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The NFL's ban on concealed carry \u201cweakens the safety and security of NFL players, personnel and fans,\u201d Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, argues.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The NFL's ban on concealed carry \u201cweakens the safety and security of NFL players, personnel and fans,\u201d Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, argues.", "title": "Police Group Flags NFL\u2019s Ban on 'Concealed Carry'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/120315_NFLGunBan_Gill.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-07T10:47:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1jDJ6F3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The NFL's ban on concealed carry \u201cweakens the safety and security of NFL players, personnel and fans,\u201d Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, argues.", "title": "Police Group Flags NFL\u2019s Ban on 'Concealed Carry'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/120315_NFLGunBan_Gill.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "firearms,terrorism", "published_time": "2015-12-06T15:16:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T10:47:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "terrorism stadiums, Law Enforcement, Fraternal Order of Police, NFL, concealed carry, terrorism, National Football League, FOP"}, "article_summary": "Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, requested that the ban on \u201cconcealed carry\u201d be ended in a letter to Roger Goodell, commissioner of the National Football League.\nThe NFL\u2019s ban on fans carrying concealed firearms has undergone new criticism in the weeks after the terrorist attacks in Paris, which included an attempted bombing of a soccer stadium.\nThe NFL\u2019s policy against concealed weapons \u201cweakens the safety and security of NFL players, personnel and fans,\u201d Canterbury wrote Goodell on Nov. 20.\n\u201cNo, this is a public safety issue here,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile we have no quarrel with the Second Amendment.\u201dPasco said the FOP also is trying to reach out to team owners and state governments, noting that state law, as in Texas, can override the NFL\u2019s ban on concealed carry:\nOne of the nation\u2019s largest organizations of police officers put its weight behind lifting the ban."}
