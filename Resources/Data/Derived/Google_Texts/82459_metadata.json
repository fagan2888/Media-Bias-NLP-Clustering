Then they compare notes and choose the two best placed, preferably front and center.\n\nThere, Clausen can\u2019t be stuck \u2014 never mind slowed down \u2014 with a view of any rhythm-challenged, hung over or just not-quite-so-fit riders.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s people in front of me, it gets in the way of my workout,\u201d she said on a recent Sunday morning, after an hourlong Soul Survivor class. \u201cI won\u2019t ride if I don\u2019t get the front row.\u201d\n\nShe even purchased a $54 white tank that read \u201cFRONT ROW.\u201d The shirt, she said, was \u201ca little obnoxious, but I\u2019m a crazy front-row person.\u201d\n\nAs the New Year\u2019s resolute join (or return to) gyms everywhere, pleased to log even the most desultory of workouts, a subset of people will have practically broken a sweat before class even starts in its efforts to land a front-row spot.\n\nFor classes where those places can\u2019t be bought or reserved, these die-hards arrive 20 minutes early to hover by the studio door, ready to throw down a water bottle to claim a spot.\n\nThe scramble happens only in the most sought-after classes, where a place up front is a status symbol, akin to sitting front row at a concert or fashion show. It shows you\u2019re fit enough to keep up and confident in your ability to lead a class \u2014 or to laugh it off if you miss a beat.\n\nBecause of studio design, not all classes have front rows. At Barry\u2019s Bootcamp, for example, treadmills line the walls and no single one is visible to the whole class, though there are ones where it is easier to hide from the instructor.\n\nLauren Boggi Goldenberg, the founder of Lithe Method, a Philadelphia cardio cheerleading workout that has a cult following, said that front-row denizens \u201care Type A, and they want to work as hard as humanly possible.\u201d\n\nThese Tracy Flicks of exercise class, Goldenberg said, tend to be \u201cdressed head to toe in the hottest brands,\u201d all but beg to be called out in class for their A-plus performance, and preen when that happens.\n\n\u201cYou can tell it\u2019s what they want,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you say things like: \u2018Look at Betsy. Look how low she\u2019s getting. I want you to mirror her.\u2019\"\n\nA CELEBRATED SPOT\n\nAnna Kaiser, the founder of AKT in Motion, an of-the-moment dance cardio workout, used to bring the back row to the front to change things up during class. That made some clients so reluctant that she has since amended to instructing them to switch sides of the room, something they are \u201cmore willing to do because they can maintain their coveted row,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of Kaiser\u2019s clients had little or no dance experience when they first set foot in her studio, she said, so their places in the front are to be celebrated \u2014 something she plans to do this quarter by selling a tank top that reads \u201cFront Line.\u201d\n\nPriya Rao, a freelance writer, said that it took her a couple of months to make her way to the front of AKT but that it was worth it.\n\n\u201cIt forces you to master the class at a quicker speed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get a better workout. You have to try to be as good as the instructor.\u201d\n\nPirkko Markula, a professor of sociocultural studies of physical activity at the University of Alberta, said that this is all straight out of Michel Foucault.\n\n\u201cAs Foucault would say, \u2018the gaze,\u2019 even if imaginary, makes us disciplined to work harder,\u201d Markula said. \u201cBased on my own research, the front-row people are the ones who believe that they possess the ability to follow the instructor, but have also built the perfect bodies.\u201d\n\nAt a sold-out and wait-listed New Year\u2019s Day morning class at Flywheel Sports in New York City\u2019s Flatiron district, the instructor Jesse Alexander urged those in front to pick up the pace.\n\n\u201cYou go faster, we go faster,\u201d yelled Alexander, one of the studio\u2019s top draws. \u201cThis is the foundation for your year.\u201d\n\nTara Farwana, who scored a front-row bike from a rider still wearing a red plastic wristband and traces of eye makeup from the previous night\u2019s revelry, said that she liked the accountability of the front row, even if on New Year\u2019s Day it was \u201cpainful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be 100 percent in it for 45 minutes, and it\u2019s done for the day,\u201d said Farwana, who began riding front row about a year ago after an instructor whose class she attended consistently suggested she make the leap.\n\nAt SoulCycle, which calls its workout \u201cdancing on the bike\u201d and encourages moving in unison, the sanctity of the front row is enshrined in the rules, painted on the wall of the studios. No. 5, titled \u201cThe Pack\u201d: \u201cThere is a direct correlation between your energy and your neighbor\u2019s ride. If you want to do your own thing, please don\u2019t ride in the front row.\u201d\n\nTHE HIGH DIVE\n\nIf that sounds elitist, well, many SoulCyclers (of all rows) support it.\n\n\u201cWhen the person in front of you is off, you have to be a meditative guru not to be bothered by it,\u201d said Tula Karras, a writer and editor who prefers to ride second row, center. She has braved the front row a couple of times, an adrenaline rush she likens to \u201cgoing off the high dive for the first time,\u201d and said it was her goal to ride there regularly.\n\nMany SoulCycle instructors insist on preapproval of their front rows, with new clients being asked whether they\u2019d like to take a back seat. In the minutes before class, the SoulCycle staff consults the \u201cmove list\u201d and considers front-row hopefuls.\n\nOccasionally, if no one makes the cut, \u201cstaff will come in and ride because it sets the tone for the whole class,\u201d said Gabby Etrog Cohen, a spokeswoman.\n\nAt a SoulCycle class on Sunday, when two women made the rare move of leaving class \u2014 and their front-row bikes \u2014 10 minutes early (class had started late), the instructor hollered for them to come back, then recruited two staff members to come finish in their places. Minutes later, congratulating the class on a steep climb, he said admiringly, \u201cYou\u2019re all front-row riders.\u201d\n\nMeg D\u2019Incecco, a public relations executive, remembers down to the bike number (4) the first time she braved the front row two years ago, in a class taught by an instructor who wasn\u2019t yet in demand. Soon after, she put herself on the \u201cmove list,\u201d hoping to ride front row in a sellout class.\n\n\u201cI remember seeing the front-desk staff confer with the instructor, and he glanced over at me and then looked back at them and nodded,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so honored and excited that he recognized me as a strong rider.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s still starry-eyed about it: \u201cI kept looking at myself in the mirror during class, thinking, \u2018I feel strong and beautiful.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNot everyone\u2019s front-row experience is such a marquee moment. Sam Zafar, who works in health care communications, booked a bike in the front because it happened to be the only one available with a SoulCycle instructor she wanted to try, but then she struggled to keep up.\n\n\u201cShe would call out, \u2018Sam, left foot,\u2019 multiple times, and she didn\u2019t even remove her mic,\u201d Zafar said of the instructor, who at the end of class told Zafar with a smile that she needed more practice to ride in the front.\n\nThough she said she hasn\u2019t seen that level of pressure at any of the other studios she\u2019s tried, Zafar now avoids the front row everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one hour of the day when I can decompress, so I don\u2019t want to be stressed about following or worrying about people silently hating me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018I WAS CHOSEN\u2019\n\nPatricia Moreno, who teaches Equinox\u2019s popular IntenSati class, which fuses martial arts with mantras, asks the occasional newbie in the front row, \u201cDo you mind if I switch you so you\u2019re less pressured?\u201d\n\nMoreno moves around the class a lot, leaving her front row de facto in charge.\n\n\u201cI need people in the front row who can carry the choreography when I\u2019m gone,\u201d said Moreno, whose following is rabid enough that fans know their front-row chances are best at Equinox\u2019s 19th Street location in New York City, where the longer, narrower group-exercise studios offer a longer front row.\n\nFor those for whom the front row isn\u2019t VIP enough, SoulCycle has a new badge of honor: riding the podium, aka the instructor\u2019s bike, or roughly the gym equivalent of being Courteney Cox pulled onstage to dance with Bruce Springsteen.\n\nD\u2019Incecco, who started out as a backrow rider, was recently invited up. She said she is not the selfie-taking type, but after class she nonetheless took one and shared it on Facebook, where it became her most-liked picture of 2014.\n\n\u201cYou can see the joy and pride in that picture,\u201d D\u2019Incecco said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018I was chosen.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/shutterstock_119462194-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff13\"", "article_summary": "By Courtney RubinGreccia Clausen, an accountant in New York City, approaches her quest for a front-row bike at SoulCycle like the numbers game it is.\nIn the minutes before class, the SoulCycle staff consults the \u201cmove list\u201d and considers front-row hopefuls.\nSoon after, she put herself on the \u201cmove list,\u201d hoping to ride front row in a sellout class.\nEvery Monday at noon, when the booking window opens, she and a friend each try to grab two front-row bikes.\nAt a SoulCycle class on Sunday, when two women made the rare move of leaving class \u2014 and their front-row bikes \u2014 10 minutes early (class had started late), the instructor hollered for them to come back, then recruited two staff members to come finish in their places."}
