Raw video: Carson speaks to voters in Hollis

Now, he’s thinking of running for president.

“I think the people are actually waking up and deciding that maybe they do have something to say about our country,” he told News 9.

Carson also stopped by the Hollis Pharmacy, giving the more intimate audience there a dose of populist self-reliance.



“I actually believe that the problems that we face are solvable problems, with the application of common sense,” he said.



While Carson was a groundbreaking surgeon and won the Presidential Medal of Freedom, if he decides to run, many believe even his stellar resume could get lost in the mix against other more experienced candidates.



But backers say his outsider status is exactly what would make him an attractive choice.



“It’s going to be a crowded field, but you see this man is totally different. One, is that he’s not a politician. This guy is the real deal. He’s a real human being,” one supporter said.



Not only did Carson’s most ardent supporters believe he can out-pace the Republican field, they also see him as the antidote to any higher ambitions harbored by a certain former first lady.



“Campaign strategy to defeat Hillary Clinton? Let her talk,” he said.



For his part, Carson said he won’t be making the decision about a possible White House bid until early May.



“I’m taking all of this in. Every place I go, I’m taking this in. I’m watching the donations coming in, and it’s definitely having an effect on my thinking,” he said.
