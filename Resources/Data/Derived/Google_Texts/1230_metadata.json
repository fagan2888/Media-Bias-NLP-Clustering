Certainly a worthy mission, minus one major omission: the publishing giant left Israel off the map.\n\n\u201cThis product has now been removed from sale in all territories and all remaining stock will be pulped,\u201d says @HarperCollins\n\nThe atlas illustrates Syria, Jordan, even the West Bank and Gaza, but gives no mention of Israel.\n\nCollins Bartholomew, the subsidiary of HarperCollins specializing in maps, originally defended the decision, telling UK-based publication The Tablet that the inclusion of Israel would have been \u201cunacceptable\u201d to the company\u2019s Middle Eastern customers. The deletion was necessary to appease \u201clocal preferences.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the company came under fire.\n\n\u201cThe publication of this atlas will confirm Israel\u2019s belief that there exists a hostility towards their country from parts of the Arab world,\u201d Bishop Declan Lang, chairman of the Bishops\u2019 Conference Department of International Affairs, told The Tablet. \u201cIt will not help to build up a spirit of trust leading to peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nJane Clements, director of the Council of Christians and Jews, added that the exclusion of Israel risked \u201cde-legitimizing\u201d the nation in students\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201cMaps can be a very powerful tool in terms of de-legitimizing \u2018the other\u2019 and can lead to confusion rather than clarity,\u201d Clements said. \u201cWe would be keen to see relevant bodies ensure that all atlases anywhere reflect the official UN position on nations, boundaries and all political features.\u201d\n\nThe omission was also contradicted in the book\u2019s online description boasting \u201cin-depth coverage of the region and its issues,\u201d aiming to help students understand \u201cthe region\u2019s challenges [and] its socio-economic development.\u201d\n\nHarperCollins has since retracted its original defense, pulling the books from further sale.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HarperCollins wanted to sell atlases created specifically for schools in the Middle East.
