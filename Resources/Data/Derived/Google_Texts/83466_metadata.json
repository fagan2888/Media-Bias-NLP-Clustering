Our chief meteorologist Jay Trobec leads things off by breaking down the small details that made all of the difference with these events. From the forecasts weeks in advance to real-time weather analysis, we show you our continuing coverage and commitment to you in the special.\n\nWe break down the cause of recent extreme weather across the Plains and how we turned the corner from last year's drought. Brian Karstens and I take you inside our new technology, which gives you a simpler layout with more interaction and detail. We're also upgrading our team of HD cameras around South Dakota, exclusive tools that show us what radar sometimes misses.\n\nAnd finally, Scot Mundt's predictions. Like last year, Scot widens his focus to include Aberdeen, Pierre, Rapid City and the Hills, along with Sioux Falls.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "From ranchers hit hard by the October blizzard to the ice storm that crippled Sioux Falls in April, it&#39;s been a historic weather year in KELOLAND.", "title": "Doppler Special Preview", "url": "http://www.keloland.com/news/article/weather/doppler-special-preview", "image": "http://assets.keloland.com/images/images/default-source/agriculture/crops/barley/53935.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521498541203189}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.3.5630.0 PE", "description": "From ranchers hit hard by the October blizzard to the ice storm that crippled Sioux Falls in April, it&#39;s been a historic weather year in KELOLAND."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a53\"", "article_summary": "Like last year, Scot widens his focus to include Aberdeen, Pierre, Rapid City and the Hills, along with Sioux Falls.\nFrom ranchers hit hard by the October blizzard to the ice storm that crippled Sioux Falls in April, it's been a historic weather year in KELOLAND.\nFrom the forecasts weeks in advance to real-time weather analysis, we show you our continuing coverage and commitment to you in the special.\nWe're also upgrading our team of HD cameras around South Dakota, exclusive tools that show us what radar sometimes misses.\nWe break down the cause of recent extreme weather across the Plains and how we turned the corner from last year's drought."}
