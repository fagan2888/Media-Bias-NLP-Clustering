He scores inside and out, rebounds, passes, makes highlight-reel dunks and even throws shoes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d as NBA reporter Christopher Dempsey wrote in his column earlier this month, \u201cWill Barton doing Will Barton things.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Woody Paige and Mark Kiszla on if Barton a sixth man of the year candidate\n\nOn the season, the 6-foot-6 Barton is averaging career highs in points (15.7), rebounds (6.1), assists (2.3), steals (1.1) and blocks (0.4). But during the month of December, he\u2019s stepped up game with averages of 19.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists \u2014 all of this coming off the bench.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my game \u2014 rebounding, scoring, getting some assists, getting out and running, steals, anything,\u201d Barton said in a November interview with The Post. \u201cMy job is to go fill the stat sheet up.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets have never had an NBA sixth man of the year winner, but Barton is Denver\u2019s best chance since J.R. Smith finished second in the 2009 vote.\n\nSo, who are Barton\u2019s biggest challengers?\n\n\u2022 Ryan Anderson, New Orleans: The Pelicans\u2019 outside-shooting power forward is averaging 17.3 points and 6.4 rebounds off the bench. However, his biggest obstacle is the team\u2019s dreadful 9-19 record.\n\n\u2022 Alec Burks, Utah: The former Colorado Buffaloes star is putting up a career-best 14.4 points for the Jazz.\n\n\u2022 Enes Kanter, Oklahoma City: Although the 23-year-old center has moved to the bench, he is still putting up solid numbers (11.3 points and 8.0 rebounds), providing a big spark for the 20-9 Thunder.\n\n\u2022 Jeremy Lin, Charlotte: It\u2019s not quite Linsanity, more like, um, re-Lin-able? Jeremypendable? Or maybe it\u2019s just the hair. The 27-year-old point guard has found a niche as Charlotte\u2019s backup point guard, averaging 11.7 points, 3.1 assists and \u2014 this is key \u2014 a career-low 2.5 turnovers per game (per 36 minutes).\n\n\u2022 Victor Oladipo, Orlando: Losing his starting spot seemed to be a mixed blessing as Oladipo has put up better numbers coming in reserve. On the year, he\u2019s averaging 12.8 points and 3.9 assists for the 17-12 Magic.\n\nBarton should certainly get consideration for the NBA\u2019s most improved player award, too. He averaged just 6.8 points and 2.8 rebounds last year splitting time between Portland and Denver.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I saw that (coming), to be very honest,\u201d Malone told Post columnist Mark Kiszla Tuesday. \u201cI knew he would be a spark off the bench, with his energy, his passion, his pace at which he plays. He has an attack mentality.\u201d\n\nIf he wins the MIP award, he becomes the first Nuggets player since Chris Jackson (yup, pre-Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf days) was honored in 1993.\n\nAs this Denver squad continues to learn to play under coach Michael Malone, the team\u2019s success is dependent on how well Barton plays. Where he goes, the Nuggets go.\n\nCHEW ON THIS\n\n\u2022 Barton scored 17 for the Nuggets Wednesday, but Randy Foye went off for 31 to lead Denver past the Suns.\n\n\u2022 The Colorado Buffaloes\u2019 11-game winning streak ended Wednesday.\n\n\u2022 Several Broncos players think the fine for Steelers\u2019 Cody Wallace\u2019s late hit on David Bruton wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u2022 Brock Osweiler and the Broncos offense must play consistently to clinch a postseason berth.\n\nWATCH THIS\n\nThis guy found an insanely elaborate Easter egg in Battlefield 4.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nComic book writer Mark Millar turns 46.
