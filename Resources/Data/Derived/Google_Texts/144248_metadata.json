Piezoelectricity is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials, such as crystals, when pressure is applied to them. The students were challenged to generate and store enough energy to fly and land a remote-controlled helicopter on the football field using piezoelectricity.\n\nSara Garcia, a 10th grader at the Energy Institute High School, said the event could help her decide what kind of job she\u2019d like to pursue.\n\n\u201cI wanna go into an engineering field, but I haven\u2019t decided. It\u2019s between offshore or alternative energy,\u201d Garcia explained.\n\nRamanan Krishnamoorti, Vice Chancellor for Research and Technology Transfer at the University of Houston, noted there are more than 3,000 companies in Greater Houston associated with offshore technologies, in one way or another, was a plus for hosting the competition.\n\n\u201cThat kind of density does not exist anywhere else in the world. These are people who care, this is the future workforce that is gonna come and innovate and make a difference for that industry,\u201d Krishnamoorti underlined.\n\nBesides the Energy Institute High School, three schools that participated in the competition: Charles H. Milby High School, Westside High School and the Young Women\u2019s Preparatory Academy.\n\nThe team \u2018Underdogs\u2019, from Westside High School, won the first prize.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education News", "description": "The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Ocean Energy Safety Institute sponsored the event, which was held at the University of Houston.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Ocean Energy Safety Institute sponsored the event, which was held at the University of Houston.", "title": "Houston-Area Students Compete In Energy And Offshore Exploration Competition | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/03/06/140338/houston-students-compete-in-energy-and-offshore-exploration-competition/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04175101/Photo-for-story-on-BSEE-Tech-Challenge-03-04-2016-1200x800.jpg", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04175101/Photo-for-story-on-BSEE-Tech-Challenge-03-04-2016-1200x800.jpg", "height": 800, "width": 1200, "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04175101/Photo-for-story-on-BSEE-Tech-Challenge-03-04-2016-1200x800.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 469385080, "twitter": {"description": "The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Ocean Energy Safety Institute sponsored the event, which was held at the University of Houston.", "title": "Houston-Area Students Compete In Energy And Offshore Exploration Competition", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/03/06/140338/houston-students-compete-in-energy-and-offshore-exploration-competition/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04175101/Photo-for-story-on-BSEE-Tech-Challenge-03-04-2016-1200x800.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Al Ortiz", "wordCount": 303, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2016-03-06T07:00:31+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "university of houston", "published_time": "2016-03-06T07:00:31+00:00"}, "keywords": "Education News, News, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, high school, Ocean Energy Safety Institute, offshore exploration, STEM education, TDECU Stadium, university of houston", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "Besides the Energy Institute High School, three schools that participated in the competition: Charles H.
