According to a clause in the Affordable Care Act, Colorado legislators can waive the Affordable Care Act if they propose a better alternative.\n\nSenator Aguilar feels ColoradoCare is the best alternative. As the only practicing physician on the state legislator she is the force driving the bill.\n\n\u201cEverybody pays for it and everybody has it available to them, and that is what we are hoping to do with ColoradoCare,\u201d said Senator Aguilar(D).\n\nIf passed, ColoradoCare would replace deductibles, insurance payments and most co-pays. This would be made possible with an income based premium tax of about 6.6 percent for employers and 3.3 percent for employees.\n\nWith the 2016 elections just over a year away Senator Aguilar feels educating those now about this new form of healthcare will give them enough time to decide how they would like to vote.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "State Senator Irene Aguilar spoke in Grand Junction Monday night about a potential new healthcare plan that may be seen on the 2016 ballot.", "language": "english", "author": "Kalie Greenberg", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbc11news.com/home/headlines/State-Senator-Irene-Aguilar-visits-Grand-Junction-to-speak-about-ColoradoCare-327601241.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/hostiosgdh.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "State Senator Irene Aguilar spoke in Grand Junction Monday night about a potential new healthcare plan that may be seen on the 2016 ballot.", "title": "State Senator Irene Aguilar visits Grand Junction to speak about ColoradoCare"}, "twitter": {"description": "State Senator Irene Aguilar spoke in Grand Junction Monday night about a potential new healthcare plan that may be seen on the 2016 ballot.", "title": "State Senator Irene Aguilar visits Grand Junction to speak about ColoradoCare", "url": "http://www.nbc11news.com/home/headlines/State-Senator-Irene-Aguilar-visits-Grand-Junction-to-speak-about-ColoradoCare-327601241.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/hostiosgdh.jpg", "creator": "@KKCO11News", "site": "@KKCO11News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "State Senator Irene Aguilar visits Grand Junction to speak about ColoradoCare", "fb": {"app_id": 273301693001311, "pages": 90768390702}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "OGoetjjhPePd53ijDuLoQ1AzgnrgAmCP7xr713FCllw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "State Senator Irene Aguilar visits, Grand Junction to speak about"}, "article_summary": "According to a clause in the Affordable Care Act, Colorado legislators can waive the Affordable Care Act if they propose a better alternative.\nState Senator Irene Aguilar spoke in Grand Junction Monday night about a potential new healthcare plan that may be seen on the 2016 ballot.\nSenator Aguilar feels ColoradoCare is the best alternative.\nWith the 2016 elections just over a year away Senator Aguilar feels educating those now about this new form of healthcare will give them enough time to decide how they would like to vote.\nThe plan is called ColoradoCare and is designed as a unique healthcare system for the state."}
