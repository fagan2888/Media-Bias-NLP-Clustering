In addition, Saturn will be view at the beginning of the eclipse. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes within Earth's shadow (umbra). The Earth's outer shadow darkens the Moon slightly, then, the inter shadow begins to"cover" the Moon as the eclipse progresses. The Moon typically turns a reddish-brown color.

In recent years, the dark night skies over the towns have come to be recognized by locals as a natural resource worth preserving. The towns of Westcliffe and Silver Cliff have come together to protect a shared natural resource â€” their dark night skies.In the first effort of its kind, the towns worked side by side to ensure preservation of dark nights for the benefit of future residents. As a result of their efforts, the towns have earned Colorado's first International Dark Sky Community designation from the International Dark-Sky Association. This makes for great lunar eclipse viewing.
