Smith is chairman of Haury & Smith Contractors, Inc. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nMany of the nation\u2019s governors have been outspoken in their criticism of the Affordable Care Act and extremely skeptical of accepting the offer of Medicaid expansion on the program\u2019s traditional terms.\n\nGov. Bill Haslam was one of the governors who rejected expansion when it was first available nearly two years ago because he believed that expanding a broken, budget-devouring, Washington-driven health care system didn\u2019t make sense.\n\nInstead, he insisted that any plan would be market-based and designed specifically for Tennessee, and he went to work to develop proposals that had the potential to gain Tennessee an exception to traditional Medicaid from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAs he learned, pushing reform in Washington, D.C., is tough, slow business. After almost 18 months of effort, Tennessee received word on Dec. 12 that HHS would support the state\u2019s reform plan, Insure Tennessee.\n\nIf approved by the General Assembly, Insure Tennessee will begin providing coverage and access to health care for hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans who are in the workforce but currently lack health insurance. And the bargain Gov. Haslam struck stands up to fiscal scrutiny as a strong deal for taxpayers.\n\nThis plan does not create any new taxes for Tennesseans and will remain sustainable within the state budget. All it does is insure hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans.\n\nAs a businessman and a Republican, I find what Gov. Haslam has done impressive \u2014 the result of conservative priorities, good management and traditional Tennessee horsetrading.\n\nIn contrast to traditional Medicaid, Insure Tennessee will promote personal responsibility and incentivize choice of preventive and routine care rather than unnecessary use of emergency rooms. It requires those who can afford it to pay co-pays toward the cost of coverage \u2014 \u201cskin in the game,\u201d as the governor likes to say.\n\nThe proposal prepares enrollees to permanently transition to private, commercial health coverage. The policy fundamentally operates much more like the private health insurance possessed by just about every Middle Tennessean reading this column.\n\nThe governor should also be credited with forging ahead to find a solution rather than simply saying \u201cno,\u201d because Insure Tennessee addresses a number of challenges that would have worsened without this plan. My experience tells me that if you demand everything you want, you\u2019ll soon be out of business.\n\nThis plan addresses the needs of people who go to work every day, bringing access to doctors and care, helping Tennesseans live healthier lives and avoid expensive and prolonged illnesses that bankrupt families.\n\nNot only will Insure Tennessee be good for Tennesseans, it will also greatly benefit the economy, particularly by stabilizing hospitals and other providers who today are at economic risk. Insure Tennessee will raise the productivity of our entire state while combating chronic illnesses that burden the entire health care system.\n\nAnd it ensures that the billions of dollars that Tennesseans pay in Medicaid taxes will remain in our state to provide care for our own citizens. Today, we are exporting an enormous amount of money to pay for coverage costs in California, Massachusetts, New York and other states.\n\nMany Republicans in the General Assembly campaigned on practical conservative state management. This plan delivers on that promise and deserves to be approved by the legislature.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1IVNViT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Haslam follows through on market-based, unique health plan for Tennessee.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Haslam follows through on market-based, unique health plan for Tennessee.", "title": "Insure TN promises unique, conservative coverage", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/01/18/insure-tn-promises-unique-conservative-coverage/21868701/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Haslam follows through on market-based, unique health plan for Tennessee.", "title": "Insure TN promises unique, conservative coverage", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a6f990fd32d7ccf557491d79acdd07709b575ed/c=0-308-1273-1581&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/01/16/B9315893683Z.1_20150116132929_000_GQJ9MOILS.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Health care access", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Health care access", "title": "Insure TN promises unique, conservative coverage", "author": "Stephen B.
