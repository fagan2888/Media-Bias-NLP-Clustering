Just weeks after Eminence Independent Schools caught attention with its snow day spoof of popular Netflix series "Making a Murderer," Greater Clark County Schools followed suit with its own creative snow day announcement.

In a video posted by the district's official account Sunday night, Superintendent Andrew Melin's face is superimposed on rapper Drake's body as a parody of the song "Hotline Bling" — aptly titled "Snowline Bling" — plays in the background.

You know I'm callin' on your cell phone, to let you know no school today.

C-callin' on your cell phone, so stay at home. Go out and play.

I know that there's snow falling. Kids want to hear me say one thing.

I know that there's snow falling. Kids want to hear me say one thing:

There will be class today for you!

And while it might not actually be Melin busting out the moves in the oft-parodied video, that is really him singing.

Like many schools in the area, Greater Clark will be closed Monday due to the weather. A complete list of local closings can be found here.
