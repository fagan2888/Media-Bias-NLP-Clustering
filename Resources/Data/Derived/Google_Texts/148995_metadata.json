It also indicates that many of the most significant problems these candidates see in our political system are, short of massive change, largely intractable.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick, semi-complete overview of the creative ways some of the most competitive presidential candidates would edit the Constitution:\n\nJeb Bush: 10 Mystery Changes, Including A Balanced Budget Amendment:\n\nThe former Florida governor made a curious comment on amendments to The Washington Post last week during a discussion of Trump\u2019s suggested elimination of birthright citizenship.\n\n\u201cThere are like 10 things I would change in the Constitution with a magic wand,\u201d he said, adding that immigration reform will have to happen without a founding-document overhaul.\n\nA few days later, he walked back his magic-wand suggestion.\n\n\u201cNo, I said that there\u2019s all sorts of amendments, you know, the balanced budget amendment, there\u2019s all sorts of things that people can say as a candidate that you do but the likelihood of those happening is really not a policy,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long, long time. I would love to see a balanced budget amendment.\u201d\n\nCongress hasn\u2019t passed a balanced budget that the president then signed in recent memory, and some conservatives worry that a balanced budget amendment could result in automatic tax hikes. Still, it\u2019s one of the more popular changes to the Constitution in the Republican field.\n\nMarco Rubio: Nobamacare\n\nAlong with favoring a balanced budget amendment\u2014which he called for in between gulps of bottled water during his 2013 State of the Union response\u2014Rubio backs a \u201cRight to Refuse\u201d amendment that would block implementation of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act. And, along with Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, he backs a term limits amendment.\n\nJohn Kasich: Just a Balanced Budget Amendment\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

In 1993, the then-congressman co-sponsored legislation that would \u201climit citizenship at birth to persons born in the United States to a mother who is a U.S. citizen or legal resident.\u201d And during his successful 2010 gubernatorial bid, according to The Columbus Dispatch, he reiterated his support for a Constitutional amendment that would keep the children of undocumented citizens born in the United States from being citizens.\n\nSince then, though, he\u2019s rolled that stance way back. Earlier this month, he brushed off a question about his stance on the issue.\n\n\u201cI was a congressman, you put your name on a hundred bills just to make somebody happy,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nHis new stance? Opposition to birthright citizenship is just a \u201cstumbling block.\u201d Since then, the only constitutional amendment he\u2019s backed as a presidential candidate is one to mandate the Congress pass balanced budgets.\n\nScott Walker: Wait, what?\n\nScott Walker has largely kept his powder dry when it comes to reworking the Constitution. The proposal that\u2019s attracted most press is his stance to let states decide if they want to allow or bar same-sex unions. That position has put him on the far right end of the Republican primary field, and, according to The Washington Post, it\u2019s lost him the support of at least one billionaire.\n\nLast week, he confused basically everyone every time he talked about birthright citizenship. Earlier in the week, he told MSNBC that he supported ending birthright citizenship. Then on Friday, he told CNBC that he was \u201cnot taking a position on it one way or the other.\u201d Later, his campaign released released a statement suggesting shock that anyone could possibly be confused by his stance on the issue.\n\n\u201cDespite the best efforts to mischaracterize Governor Walker\u2019s position, he has clearly and consistently stated that we need to enforce the laws on the books, keep people from coming here illegally, and enforce e-verify to stop the jobs magnet before we address the issue of birthright citizenship,\u201d said campaign spokeswoman AshLee Strong. \u201cBy addressing the root problems\u2014in the right order\u2014we will end this collateral issue that only exists because we have a border that is not secure and a broken system.\u201d\n\nOn August 17, via Bloomberg, he told Iowa State Fair attendees that we should secure the border and \u201ctalk about what the next steps are after.\u201d\n\nThen, on This Week on Sunday morning, the candidate said he opposes changing the Constitution to keep the children of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S. from becoming citizens. That seems like a pretty clear stance, so he\u2019ll probably change it in the next week or so (Just kidding. Mostly).\n\nBen Carson: Meh.\n\nCarson\u2019s Constitution-meddling ambitions seem fairly tame. Like other Republicans, he favors the balanced budget amendment as well as an amendment instituting term limits for members of Congress. He also backs an amendment that would make it harder for Congress to pass legislation creating permanent entitlement programs.\n\nBernie and Hillary: Together At Last\n\nThe top two Democratic presidential contenders both want a constitutional amendment to reverse the Citizens United decision. Otherwise, they\u2019re not super imaginative about this stuff.\n\nRand Paul: No More Birthright Citizenship, Maybe?\n\nRand Paul also has a lot of ideas for monkeying around with the Constitution. But, like Walker, Paul is a little marble-mouthed when he talks about birthright citizenship. In 2010, he told RightWingNews that the 14th amendment wasn\u2019t supposed to count for children of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201c[T]he 14th amendment actually says that you will be a citizen as long as you are under the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cMany argue that these children that are born to illegal aliens are really still under the jurisdiction of the Mexican government. I think we need to fight that out in the courts. If we lose, then I think we should amend the Constitution because I don\u2019t think the 14th amendment was meant to apply to illegal aliens. It was meant to apply to the children of slaves.\u201d\n\nSince then, he\u2019s equivocated on the issue. He backed legislation from Louisiana Senator David Vitter that would have said the 14th Amendment didn\u2019t apply to the children of undocumented immigrants, but he\u2019s been a little vague about whether he actually thinks those rights should be taken out of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIf you are looking at border security, and we\u2019re going to have a secure border, then I\u2019m not sure we need to change citizenship,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cBirthright citizenship is a beacon for the world. So is what we did for the Dreamers. Birthright citizenship\u2014it is what it is. That\u2019s the way the law has been interpreted. But is it a good idea to do that with an open border? Probably not.\u201d\n\nPaul does support an amendment mandating term limits for members of Congress and requiring a balanced budget. And he favors an amendment intended to eliminate a perceived discrepancy between how congressional staff and other Americans get health care under the Affordable Care Act, that would \u201cprohibit Congress from passing any law that exempts themselves.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz: So Many Changes, So Little Time!\n\nCruz, always full of ideas, wants the Constitution to get a facelift.\n\nHe backs amendments that could dramatically alter the system of constitutional governance, many of which would curtail the power of the federal government and expand state governments\u2019 authorities. That includes repealing the 17th Amendment in full or in part, which would take away the responsibility for electing U.S. senators from individual voters and give it to state legislatures, which was the case before that amendment\u2019s ratification.\n\nCruz is also on the record favoring a so-called Madison Amendment that would make it easier for state legislatures to amend the Constitution, as well as a balanced budget amendment and \u201ca strong constitutional amendment that puts into law term limits.\u201d\n\nHe told radio host Michael Medved that he could get behind a constitutional amendment totally eliminating birthright citizenship in an interview last week\u2014even though, in 2011, then-candidate Cruz suggested such an effort would be a fool\u2019s errand, according to The Houston Chronicle.\n\nCruz also wants to change the Constitution so states can ban same-sex unions. Fun!\n\nMike Huckabee: A little bit of everything\n\nPerhaps no other candidate has approached changing the Constitution with such energy and verve as Huckabee. Like Bush and others, he favors a balanced budget amendment. He\u2019s also backed an amendment to ban abortion, arguing that overturning Roe v. Wade wouldn\u2019t go far enough. In an interview with Beliefnet during his 2008 presidential bid, he compared abortion to slavery to bolster his case.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019d today say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s nonsense. Slavery is wrong, period,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018It can\u2019t be right somewhere and wrong somewhere else. Same with abortion.\u201d\n\nAnd, naturally, according to CNN on June 26, 2015, Huckabee favors a Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.\n\nShortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the issue came down, Huckabee predicted that its opponents would \u201cgo the path of Dr. Martin Luther King\u201d and argue that \u201can unjust law is no law at all.\u201d\n\nAnyway, Huck also favors \u201ca constitutional amendment to prohibit eminent domain for what is essentially private development\u201d as a way of blocking the 2005 Kelo v. City of New London ruling that many argue eroded private property rights. And he has registered his support for canning the 16th Amendment, which lets the federal government tax income.\n\nYou may notice one tiny little candidate missing from this list: Donald Trump, currently and by all counts the Republican front-runner.\n\nTrump favors eliminating birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants but has said he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d need a constitutional amendment to pull that off\u2014even though the right to citizenship for all persons born in the U.S. is, well, part of the Constitution. To be clear, there\u2019s not 100 percent consensus on that point; Constitution scholar (in his own mind, anyway) former Senator Rick Santorum has said he thinks you could take that right away just by passing a law, rather than amending the entire founding document.\n\nBy that logic, maybe some of these massive overhauls to our system of government aren\u2019t as complicated as their proponents may think.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "woodruffbets"}, "keywords": "GOP, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, constitutional law, 2016, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, u.s. poli, Donald Trump, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, immigration reform, Ted Cruz, 2016 Election, Google", "publicationDate": 201508240500, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Several Republican presidential candidates talk about the importance of following the Constitution to the letter, until they don\u2019t.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Constitution Change the GOP Believes In", "tags": "gop,entity:person/marco_rubio,entity:person/mike_huckabee,entity:industryterm/constitutional_law,entity:event/2016_election,entity:person/bernie_sanders,entity:person/hillary_clinton,topic:politics,entity:person/donald_trump,entity:person/scott_walker,entity:person/jeb_bush,immigration_reform,entity:person/ted_cruz,obsessional:2016-election,syndication:syndication-google", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Constitution Change the GOP Believes In\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/24/constitution-change-the-gop-believes-in.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/24/constitution-change-the-gop-believes-in/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48013717.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/24/constitution-change-the-gop-believes-in\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-24T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Betsy Woodruff\",\"tags\":[\"gop\",\"marco_rubio\",\"mike_huckabee\",\"constitutional_law\",\"2016_election\",\"bernie_sanders\",\"hillary_clinton\",\"politics\",\"donald_trump\",\"scott_walker\",\"jeb_bush\",\"immigration_reform\",\"ted_cruz\",\"2016-election\",\"syndication-google\"]}", "news_keywords": "GOP, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, constitutional law, 2016 election, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, US Politics, Donald Trump, Scott Walker", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Betsy Woodruff", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-08-24T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/betsy-woodruffhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/24/constitution-change-the-gop-believes-in", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Several Republican presidential candidates talk about the importance of following the Constitution to the letter, until they don\u2019t.", "title": "Constitution Change the GOP Believes In", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/24/constitution-change-the-gop-believes-in.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/24/constitution-change-the-gop-believes-in/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1440411528941.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/betsy-woodruff", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "I would love to see a balanced budget amendment.\u201dCongress hasn\u2019t passed a balanced budget that the president then signed in recent memory, and some conservatives worry that a balanced budget amendment could result in automatic tax hikes.\nLike other Republicans, he favors the balanced budget amendment as well as an amendment instituting term limits for members of Congress.\nSame with abortion.\u201dAnd, naturally, according to CNN on June 26, 2015, Huckabee favors a Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.\nBernie and Hillary: Together At LastThe top two Democratic presidential contenders both want a constitutional amendment to reverse the Citizens United decision.\nLike Bush and others, he favors a balanced budget amendment."}
