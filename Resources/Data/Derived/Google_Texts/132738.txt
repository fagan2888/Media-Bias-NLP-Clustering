PUEBLO, Colo. -

Pueblo police are asking for the public's help identifying a man who is suspected of breaking into a car and stealing a credit card.

Investigators say the man forced his way into a 2000 Honda Civic that was parked in the Rawling's Library parking lot. Once inside, police say he took a number of personal items, including the victim's wallet.

The stolen credit-card was later used to buy $392 worth of merchandise at a Walmart on the south side of Pueblo, as well as $293 worth of food at a Panda Express and $152 worth of fuel at a convenience store.

A photo of the suspect was taken by a surveillance camera at the south side Walmart. He is described as a Hispanic male in his 40's, wearing a white tank-top, light blue baseball cap and reading glasses. He also has several tattoos on his arms.
