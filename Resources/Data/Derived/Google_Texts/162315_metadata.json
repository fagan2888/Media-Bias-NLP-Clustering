But months after its passage, they\u2019re worrying whether those rights will be implemented or will turn out to be merely ink on paper.\n\nThe causes for concern are many. Men hold an overwhelming near-lock on decision-making in politics, and activists say they are doing little to bring about equality. Violence against women in public space has grown over the past three years of turmoil since the 2011 ouster of autocrat Hosni Mubarak. And some activists say the increasingly repressive political climate is stifling chances for democratic reforms that would bring women\u2019s rights.\n\nAn incident in March underlined how far activists say they still need to go to change public attitudes. After a female student at Cairo University came under mass sexual assault by male students, the university\u2019s president, Gaber Nassar, criticized her for the way she was dressed. A well-known TV presenter, Tamir Amin, went on a tirade on his show, saying the student was \u201cdressed like a belly dancer.\u201d She was wearing black pants, a long-sleeved pink shirt and a head-scarf.\n\nAmid an uproar on social media, both Nassar and Amin apologized for their comments. But Amin still went on to say women should wear \u201cappropriate\u201d clothing when they go out.\n\nThe following week, a law criminalizing sexual harassment was referred to the presidency for review, though the text has yet to be released.\n\nThere have been multiple mass sexual assaults on women during protests the past three years. In one notorious incident in 2011, security forces dragged a female protester to the ground, pulled up her top to reveal her blue bra and stomped on her chest. Other female protesters at the time were forced to undergo humiliating \u201cvirginity tests\u201d when detained by the military.\n\nWomen have also been caught up in the violence since the military ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi last summer and security forces launched a heavy crackdown on his Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists. Last weekend, a 22-year-old female journalist, Mayada Ashraf, with the newspaper Al-Dustour, was shot to death while she covered clashes between police and Morsi supporters in the Cairo district of Ein Shams. Police have arrested 20 protesters, accusing them of shooting her \u2014 but witnesses have raised questions whether it was actually security forces who killed her.\n\nAround 50 other women were among hundreds killed during clashes since the violent dispersal of the pro-Morsi protest camps on Aug. 14, and around 240 are among the 16,000 people arrested in the crackdown on Morsi\u2019s followers, according to security officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to journalists.\n\nViolence is a \u201cvery intimidating weapon\u201d against women participating in public life, said Dalia Abdel-Hameed, gender rights researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an independent rights group.\n\nMore broadly, the crackdown has fueled at atmosphere where criticism is not tolerated. Secular pro-democracy activists and prominent figures critical of the military-backed interim government have been jailed and are on trial for breaking laws barring unlicensed protests. In the media, critics of the government are muted, which has an impact on calls in general for democratic reform, including for women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cIf there is no democratic climate, how would you benefit from these beautiful laws?\u201d said Abdel-Hameed. \u201cIt will be the same as under Mubarak: you have a beautiful law but it\u2019s not implemented.\u201d\n\nWomen activists fought hard for gains in the constitution passed in a January referendum, which was a rewrite of a 2012 constitution largely drafted by Islamists during Morsi\u2019s one-year presidency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Egypt women: Rights on paper, not yet on ground", "title": "Egypt women: Rights on paper, not yet on ground", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Egypt women: Rights on paper, not yet on ground", "title": "Egypt women: Rights on paper, not yet on ground", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/08/egypt_women_rights_on_paper_not_yet_on_ground/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/mideast-egypt-womens-rights.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Egypt women: Rights on paper, not yet on ground", "title": "Egypt women: Rights on paper, not yet on ground", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/mideast-egypt-womens-rights.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Dean", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1416\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsCAIRO (AP) \u2014 Women activists say they won a major step forward with Egypt\u2019s new constitution, which enshrined greater rights for women.\nMen hold an overwhelming near-lock on decision-making in politics, and activists say they are doing little to bring about equality.\nBut Amin still went on to say women should wear \u201cappropriate\u201d clothing when they go out.\nViolence is a \u201cvery intimidating weapon\u201d against women participating in public life, said Dalia Abdel-Hameed, gender rights researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an independent rights group.\nAnd some activists say the increasingly repressive political climate is stifling chances for democratic reforms that would bring women\u2019s rights."}
