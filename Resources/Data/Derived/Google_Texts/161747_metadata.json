Athletes and race crews will stay at Copper Mountain that night before the start of Stage 3 near that resort\u2019s Burning Stones Plaza.\n\nStage 4 will see the world\u2019s top cyclists climbing up and over Independence Pass out of Aspen, through Buena Vista and Fairplay before climbing Hoosier Pass into Breckenridge.\n\nThe 126-mile Stage 4 \u2014 the longest of the race \u2014 includes a loop around Breckenridge before the downtown finish.\n\nThe Aug. 21 Stage 5 time trial, which loops 8.5 miles around Breckenridge, will feature the start of the Pro Challenge\u2019s first-ever women\u2019s racing before the cycling circus moves down to the Front Range.\n\nArapahoe Basin and Copper Mountain are freshman hosts of the race, but both resorts are no strangers to throwing parties.\n\nArapahoe Basin is planning camping, music and festivities to welcome the racers at the end of Stage 2. Copper will have a day-long festival Aug. 19, with music and events in the resort village. And Breckenridge, which joins Aspen as the only community to host the race for all five years, is planning a week-long cycling bender with concerts, citizen races and events that fit around the host ski resorts\u2019 parties.\n\nRace officials estimate the race delivers an economic impact of about $130 million, with spectators flocking to high-country downtowns and mountain passes to cheer the passing cyclists. The route selection has evolved over the years as organizers seek to concentrate visitor spending in regions instead of spreading the impact across a wider swath of hosts.\n\nIt\u2019s already working for Breckenridge.\n\nThe resort town has used the Pro Challenge to trumpet its vibrant biking scene, helping to bolster its summer business. The town has seen taxable spending by visitors in August climb to $32.12 million in 2014 from $19.78 million in 2011, the first year it hosted the Pro Challenge.\n\n\u201cWe hope to be the place where spectators can come and set up a base camp to see most of this year\u2019s race,\u201d Oshlo said.\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "USA Pro Challenge route positions Summit County for a business win", "title": "USA Pro Challenge route positions Summit County for a business win", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/28/usa-pro-challenge-route-positions-summit-county-for-a-business-win/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150428_021200_summit-county.jpg", "height": 683}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150428_021200_summit-county.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-28T13:14:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T05:13:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "USA Pro Challenge"}, "article_summary": "While the strongest cyclist won\u2019t be crowned until the peloton sweeps through Denver in the fifth Colorado-traversing USA Pro Challenge bike race, Summit County is already celebrating its victory as a four-day host of the seven-stage race this summer.\nThe resort town has used the Pro Challenge to trumpet its vibrant biking scene, helping to bolster its summer business.\nPro Challenge officials Tuesday announced the specifics of the 616-mile route for this year\u2019s Aug. 17-23 race, which will bring three stage finishes and two stage starts, including the time trial, to Summit County.\nSummit County wins this year\u2019s Pro Challenge.\nArapahoe Basin and Copper Mountain are freshman hosts of the race, but both resorts are no strangers to throwing parties."}
