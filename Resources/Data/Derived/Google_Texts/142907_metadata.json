Among the findings in the report was that the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or ObamaCare) would prompt 2 million workers to leave the workforce.\n\nFox News, as Stewart showed, jumped on the findings. Sean Hannity said this about the report on Wednesday night: \u201cAnd yesterday, we learned that the CBO is projecting that this debacle will cost nearly 2.5 million jobs.\u201d That\u2019s wrong. However, the night before, Hannity, at least in introducing the topic, proceeded more carefully:\n\nHANNITY: All right, President Obama, no matter what you say about FOX News, guess what? We\u2019re not going to stop reporting the truth!\n\nFor example, today the CBO released numbers that prove \u201cObamacare\u201d is the utter mess we\u2019ve been telling you about. The headline from The Washington Post \u2014 glad they finally caught up \u2014 \u201cCBO, health care law will mean 2 million fewer workers.\u201d And Reuters, \u201c\u201dObamacare\u201d to cut work hours by equivalent of 2 million jobs, CBO.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday night\u2019s edition of \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d guest-host Martha MacCallum asked guest Chris Stirewalt:\n\nSo, Chris, you know, with all of the talk about the 2.3 million jobs that would be lost, I mean, this is something that really, truly affects so many more people across this country.\n\nWrong again. Sure, there was \u201ctalk\u201d about jobs \u201clost\u201d \u2014 ill-informed talk. The CBO found that people would likely voluntarily withdraw from the labor force; saying that jobs would be \u201clost\u201d implies that such withdrawal would be involuntary. Now let\u2019s take an excerpt from Wednesday night\u2019s O\u2019Reilly Factor, in which Fox News Chief Political Correspondent Carl Cameron abridged things as follows:\n\nO\u2019REILLY: Should I be concerned about what the CBO guy just said? CAMERON: Well sure, I mean to translate what he said is that folks particularly of lower incomes who are under Obamacare will qualify for subsidies whether they are working or not. And they may decide to work a little bit less or not at all because their healthcare will be guaranteed. CBO says they could cut their hours. Stop working in order to qualify for the subsidy or avoid losing it and it\u2019s about two million people that could drop out of the workforce shrink the workforce for the next three years.\n\nFair! And here\u2019s Fox News\u2019s Shannon Bream on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d:\n\nAnd we saw the CBO numbers earlier today. And essentially, they say 2 million plus fewer people will be working as full- time employees. Now, the White House says that is because of choices, because they have options to work fewer hours and have subsidized health care through Obamacare.\n\nFair and balanced!\n\nOn her Wednesday night program, Fox Host Greta Van Susteren asked a guest: \u201cSo will Obamacare discourage people from working?\u201d Double fair and balanced! The truth is that digging through the Fox News prime-time archive on Nexis yields plenty, plenty of instances in which Fox News anchors doing their best to nail the details on this sensitive and politically explosive report, not to mention some instances \u2014 pounced upon by Stewart \u2014 in which they\u2019re just essentially winging it.\n\nBut any efforts by Fox News staffers to properly portray the findings, however, are undermined by FoxNews.com, where this headline still rules the roost: \u201cObamaCare could lead to loss of nearly 2.3 million US jobs, report says.\u201d\n\nIt all drives at the layers of Fox News. There\u2019s the tendentious and bombastic Hannity; the often-lauded work of \u201cSpecial Report\u201d; the lawyerly ways of Van Susteren; and the anything-goes ethic at Fox News web properties.
