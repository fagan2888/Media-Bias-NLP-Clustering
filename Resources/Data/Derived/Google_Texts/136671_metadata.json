Following the nomination last week, HELP chair Lamar Alexander said Califf\u2019s credentials are impressive and that the committee will \u201cmove promptly\u201d to consider his nomination. In fact, Califf may \u201cget more scrutiny from the President\u2019s party, than the other side of the aisle,\u201d said Nate Brown, a partner in Akin Gump\u2019s health care and life science practice. He added patient groups were a little leery of Califf\u2019s lack of public health experience when he joined FDA in February. But Brown said the most likely obstacle to his confirmation is the Senate\u2019s jam-packed calendar.\n\nCaliff\u2019s appointment was promptly cheered by the conservative Manhattan Institute, the branded drug industry lobby BIO, the generic drug lobby GPhA and advocacy groups such as the Friends of Cancer Research and Faster Cures. Public Citizen was a lonely detractor, citing Califf\u2019s close financial relationships with the drug and device industries during his more than three decades at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhile Califf would have little time to leave his mark during Obama\u2019s waning tenure, it\u2019s a busy time for FDA, as the Senate works on its version of the House passed 21st Century Cures bill. He\u2019d also have a key role in negotiating the next round of user fee agreements with industry, which are supposed to be approved by OMB next fall and ready for Congress in early 2017.\n\n\u2026It would be unusual for Califf to stay on as commissioner under a new president, even a Democrat, but sources indicated that if anyone has a shot it\u2019s Califf. \u201cThe default is that regardless of which party wins [in 2016] he\u2019s gone,\u201d Steven Grossman, president of health policy and consulting firm HPS Group, said. Grossman pointed out that David Kessler is the only FDA commissioner to serve across two administrations. But Califf, Grossman said, \u201chas the makings of someone that would at least be considered.\"\n\nHappy Monday and welcome back to Prescription PULSE where we recall that on this week in 1982, CDC used the term \"AIDS\" for the first time and released the first case definition of AIDS: \u201ca disease at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, occurring in a person with no known case for diminished resistance to that disease.\u201d http://1.usa.gov/1DeO2qi\n\nCAP: YOU DON\u2019T NEED CONGRESS TO GET DRUG PRICES DOWN \u2014 The Center for American Progress argues that many of the proposals it released Friday to tamp down drug prices could be carried out by the private sector and would not require lawmakers to buck the entrenched pharma lobby on the Hill. The proposal depends heavily on an independent, third party organization \u2014 like the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute or the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review \u2014 that would gauge the comparative effectiveness of a new drug and, based on that, recommend a price range. \u201cA lot \u2026 can and should be done independently of government,\u201d CAP\u2019s VP for health policy Topher Spiro said on a call with reporters. ICER, Spiro pointed out, is already doing similar work. If payers and drugmakers negotiate a price that is \u201cunreasonable\u201d \u2013 more than 20 percent higher than the max recommendation \u2014 then CAP recommends that the government bust the patents on any drugs based on federally- funded research and let the generic companies make the meds. Even that would be within the government\u2019s existing \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d in cases when the benefits of the federally-funded research are not \u201cavailable to the public on reasonable terms,\u201d according to CAP.\n\n... But it would require a major change in the government\u2019s use of those rights, which the George W. Bush administration threatened to invoke before it got a massive discount on Cipro in the wake of the 2001 anthrax attacks but has otherwise been extremely reluctant to use.\n\n... The other big proposal which CAP likened to the medical loss ratio for insurers \u2014 that drug companies be required to spend a certain fraction of their revenue on R&D or else pay rebates to NIH \u2014 would require Congress to act. Details in the report: http://ampr.gs/1Mh6i5S\n\n\u2026 PhRMA said the proposals would thwart innovation \u201cby imposing arbitrary caps on pharmaceutical prices \u2026, impede the development of new medicines for patients and cost countless jobs across the country.\u201d The group also posted a new slide deck Friday highlighting progress made against deadly diseases and putting the cost of medicine in the context of overall health spending: http://onphr.ma/1NBmj8f\n\nTHIS WEEK: RETIREE GROUP STEPS UP FIGHT AGAINST PHARMA CARVEOUT \u2014 The Alliance for Retired Americans will launch a new grass-roots campaign to persuade lawmakers to reject pharma\u2019s push for a carveout from a streamlined patent review process in patent reform legislation. The life sciences industry says the carve out is necessary to protect against abuse in the appeals process.\n\n... The retiree group, which is allied with the AFL-CIO, will hold events in Illinois, Minnesota and Vermont to target those states' senators and mobilize members. \"Hopefully the more sunlight we shine on it the more ability we'll have to stop it,\" the group's Executive Director Rich Fiesta told POLITICO.\n\n\u2026 LIFE SCIENCES GROUPS UPSET WITH ISSA \u2014 Our Pro Tech colleague Adam Sneed reports that two California-based life sciences organizations took Rep. Darrell Issa to task over his claims earlier this month that the industry spread \u201cmisinformation\u201d in the patent reform debate. He also said the industry won\u2019t get the carve-out it wants, prompting Biocom and the California Life Sciences Association to write Issa voicing their \u201cdisappointment\u201d over his comments.\n\n\u201cThese remarks seem to suggest a lack of understanding of the extraordinary value and complexity of life sciences innovation,\u201d the groups wrote, adding that the inter-partes review process \u201cthreaten[s] future investment in innovation and ultimately the ability of patients to have access to breakthrough medicines and technologies.\u201d The letter: http://bit.ly/1OjNAxL\n\nPRECISION MEDICINE MOVES FORWARD: A group of tech and science luminaries issued recommendations to NIH concerning the Precision Medicine Initiative on Thursday our eHealth colleagues report. Their report envisions recruiting a million participants over around four years, for starters. The authors hope the initiative can recruit a diverse set of individuals; it specifically mentions children, the elderly, and prisoners. The longitudinal studies, researchers said, could solve some major medical problems. \"We still are fundamentally na\u00efve,\" said Rick Lifton of Yale, \"We lack knowledge about the environmental and demographic factors that contribute to disease.\" By following large cohorts over long periods of time, the research could do for some diseases \u2014 like diabetes \u2014 what the Framingham Heart Study has done for heart disease: identify interventions that diminish risk.

That will include how these near copycats of branded biologic medicines can achieve an interchangeable designation that will allow for automatic substitution for their more expensive counterparts. Guidance will also address biosimilar labeling. Woodcock, however, wouldn\u2019t guarantee the agency would be able to get the policies out this year even though they are on its 2015 guidance agenda.\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle expressed disappointment and frustration with the agency\u2019s pace on implementing the biosimilars pathway which was created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act in the hopes of spurring cheaper medicines and savings for the government and consumers.\n\n\u2026 On another biosimilars topic, Woodstock during her testimony may have helped biosimilar companies in their pleas to get CMS to change a proposed rule that would give all biosimilars of the same branded drug the same billing code, thus reimbursing them at the same rate. Woodcock said unique billing codes would help the agency distinguish between different products to track safety.\n\nMedPAC MULLING MORE SUNSHINE FOR INDUSTRY \u2014 At their September meeting, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, which advises Congress, mulled potential next steps for CMS's Open Payments database, which provides data on payments and transfers of value from pharmaceutical and medical device companies to physicians. Improvements might include requiring public reporting of payments made to other health professionals or organizations besides doctors. Another suggestion was to conduct analyses to explore the relationship between physician prescribing behavior and the payments received from manufacturers. http://1.usa.gov/1W8VYkS\n\nHHS TO LOOSEN RESTRICTIONS ON BUPRENORPHINE PRESCRIBING \u2014 The agency announced last week that it plans to revise regulations that currently restrict qualified doctors from prescribing the opioid replacement drug to 30 patients in the first year and 100 after that. It came during a conference Thursday and Friday convened by HHS focused on opioid prescribing practices, increasing access to naloxone, which can treat overdose victims, and expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, like buprenorphine. A recent HHS report found 2.5 million people need treatment for opioid abuse but fewer than 1 million are receiving it. The agency also announced $1.8 million in grants for rural communities to purchase naloxone supplies. The HHS release: http://1.usa.gov/1izyQ0S\n\nSENATORS PRESS FDA ON OXYCONTIN FOR KIDS \u2014 Eight senators including Joe Manchin sent a letter on Friday to FDA Acting Commissioner Stephen Ostroff asking for the full backstory for the agency\u2019s approval of OxyContin for use in children as young as 11. They want to see the studies the approval was based on and why the agency sidestepped a review by an independent advisory committee, among other things. The letter follows a written request to Senate HELP Committee leadership for an investigation of the approval. http://1.usa.gov/1iCqCVU\n\nPATHOLOGISTS PITCH HYBRID CMS/FDA OVERSIGHT OF LDTs \u2014 The College of American Pathologists has proposed a split responsibility for laboratory developed tests \u2014 high risk LDTs would face premarket review by the FDA (which they don\u2019t at present), moderate and low risk lab tests would remain under the purview of CMS and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Framework of 1988. FDA issued guidance last year saying it would ultimately bring all LDTs under its review, sparking a backlash from some doctors and the lab test developers. The pathologists' proposal: http://capatholo.gy/1Y9nhxy\n\nCATCHING OUR ATTENTION: NOT ALL FDA REVIEWRES SUPPORTED \u201cFEMALE VIAGRA\u201d \u2014 Bloomberg takes a look at new FDA documents on the agency\u2019s review of Addyi (flibanserin), the controversial new drug for women with low sexual desire, which reveals internal disagreement among agency drug reviewers over whether to approve the drug. http://bloom.bg/1MdYB06\n\nPOLITICO\u2019S WHAT WORKS D.C.: Join POLITICO Magazine for the next in their What Works series, focusing on the future of Washington, D.C.
