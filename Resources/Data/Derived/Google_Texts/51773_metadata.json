While that\u2019s not the best concept in the world, it does allow the narrator to get to the point, disparaging the history of various Democratic candidates.\n\nRep. Allyson Schwartz is recognized as a liberal who voted to raise taxes over 60 times. Then they turn to John Hanger, who is painted as a looney liberal who wants to legalize marijuana, there\u2019s even a helpful \u201ccuckoo\u201d sound effect in case you missed the point.\n\nThe ad then focuses on Rob McCord and Tom Wolf, who are identified as multi-millionaires who want to cut Medicare by $715 billion (this claim concerns the candidates\u2019 support of Obamacare which proponents assert reduced waste in the program rather than cut funds).\n\nFinally, the voiceover ends by listing the accomplishments of Governor Corbett during his time in office.\n\n\u201cOur opponents have run to the extreme left of the electorate trying to win this primary,\u201d the Governor\u2019s campaign manager Mike Barley stated. \u201cFrom higher, job-killing taxes, to the proliferation of illegal drugs to their unwavering support of President Obama and his hallmark legislative disaster Obamacare, they are proving every day that they are out of touch with hardworking Pennsylvanians.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the ad suggests that the Corbett campaign believes Allyson Schwartz is their most likely opponent. They chose to lump her in with the most liberal candidate in the race, John Hanger, and only dealt McCord and Wolf glancing blows by comparison.\n\nIt\u2019s highly possible that this focus will change given the new polls showing Wolf in the lead. The ad also completely neglected some top-tier candidates like Katie McGinty and recent entrant Jack Wagner.\n\nTo listen to the ad click here.\n\nFebruary 26th, 2014 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Governor, Top Stories | 5 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Corbett-Cawley campaign hit their Democratic opponents in its latest radio spot.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-gov-corbett-releases-radio-ad-audio/55528/", "description": "The Corbett-Cawley campaign hit their Democratic opponents in its latest radio spot.", "title": "PA-Gov: Corbett Releases Radio Ad (AUDIO)"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "tom corbett,ad,radio,governor,election,2014", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd825\"", "article_summary": "PA-Gov: Corbett Releases Radio Ad (AUDIO)Written by Nick Field, Contributing WriterGovernor Corbett is out with his latest radio commercial today, a one-minute spot that takes aim at several of his Democratic opponents.\nFinally, the voiceover ends by listing the accomplishments of Governor Corbett during his time in office.\nRep.
