As thousands of geeks and techies converge on Austin for the annual South by Southwest festival – starting today with interactive events – some are literally airing their beef with Sen. Ted Cruz over his stance on net neutrality.

It’s almost like a flying Tweet that calls out Cruz by name and states, “Don’t Be an Enemy of the Internet”

The difference is over the Federal Communications Commission’s recent decision to regulate the Internet as a public utility and enforce a rule that Internet providers deliver all content equally and without preference. Phone and cable companies had wanted to allow certain enterprises to pay more and have their data use prioritized.

Cruz called it more government regulation that he believes will stifle innovation. He dubbed it “Obamacare for the Internet.”

The banner was commissioned by net neutrality advocates Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, and the Free Press Action Fund.

Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer accused Cruz of siding with cable companies over consumers.

“Texans love their freedom,” Greer said. “The Internet is rising and showing its power. Any politicians standing in its way should know by now that they are standing on the wrong side of history, and will pay the political cost for selling out their constituents.”

UPDATE: The net neutrality group might need another plane.

It should be pointed out that Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is attending the SXSW Interactive Festival and on Monday is opening a tech office in Austin to focus on digital engagement, also opposed the FCC’s rule.

He has said in interviews that regulation of the Internet is the wrong way to go.
