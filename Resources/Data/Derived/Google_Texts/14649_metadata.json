Beal, Jr., president of Related Properties, was similarly pessimistic about luxury development on 57th Street during a ULI panel about residential housing Oct. 22 at the Javits Center.\n\nNoting that zoning that accommodates dense structures has pushed land prices north, Beal said the logistics left developers with no option by to build luxury condos to make a profit.\n\nHe acknowledged that while many luxury buyers are foreigners looking to park their money in New York City, he questioned how long they can prop up the luxury market.\n\n\u201cPeople are priced out domestically,\u201d he said. \u201cNot everyone is a hedge fund manager.\u201d\n\nBeal said, even in the midst of the economic crash in 2008-2009, New York condo prices remained expensive, but warned, \u201cI think we\u2019re at the top of what should be produced there now,\u201d he said of new development on West 57th Street.\n\nLast month, Extell Development\u2019s Gary Barnett told Crain\u2019s New York Business that he believes the luxury market may be nearing a dip.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, [but] I think we\u2019re seeing the beginnings of a slowdown,\u201d Barnett said during a tour of a model apartment at One57, where a penthouse is reportedly in contract for $90 million.\n\nA full pipeline of development could create an over-supply of luxury homes that would cause the entire market to contract, the developer believes.\n\nIndeed, a recent report from the New York Building Congress forecasts that $32.9 billion will be spend on construction this year and nearly $11 billion of that will be on luxury apartments.\n\nMost of the money being spent in the residential space will be put towards the construction of ultra-luxury condominiums, according to data cited by the Building Congress.\n\nDevelopers will spend 60 percent more on new homes, while adding only 22 percent more units in 2014, an indication that apartments will be geared towards wealthy buyers.\n\nIn his interview with Crain\u2019s, Barnett wanted that over-supply will leading to longer selling times as developers try to hold out for the eight-figure price tags they need to justify the cost of land and construction of the building.\n\n\u201cIf this keeps up for another year, if we start seeing more and more buildings come into the market that we don\u2019t know about \u2026 we will get an oversupply,\u201d Barnett said said.\n\nBut rather than seeing land prices fall, Barnett believes that many development parcels will be held off the market.\n\nWhile the developers appear jittery, most brokers still seem to be upbeat about the luxury condo market.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with (Ofer Yardeni) on high-end condo sales,\u201d CBRE\u2019s Stephen Siegel said at the Expo panel, arguing that luxury apartments in Manhattan are still cheap compared to other global cities.\n\nAt a panel hosted by the Brown University Club of New York City later the same day, Eastdil Secured broker Doug Harmon also dismissed the notion of a bubble, pointing to the lack of new supply in the years following the 2008 crash.\n\nResearchers, on the other hand, are beginning to sound more cautious.\n\nIn an interview with Real Estate Weekly, CityRealty\u2019s director of research and communications said she sees challenges ahead for Manhattan\u2019s luxury condo market.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to make a projection on it,\u201d said Gabby Warshawer, \u201cbut I think (the trend) is going to be definitely tested in the market in the coming year.\u201d\n\nWarshawer pointed to the bulking supply of luxury residences that are rapidly becoming available and admitted that, if the high-paced purchasing does not continue, there could be a mild bog in the near future.\n\nFor premium residences that exceed $10 million in price, $2.9 billion has changed hands over the opening three quarters of the year. That\u2019s a 150-percent bump from last year\u2019s opening three quarters.\n\n\u201cReally, what we\u2019ve seen this year kind of represents a market life,\u201d continued Warshawer. \u201cOf the buildings that are on the market right now that are very high priced, many of the units in them are in contract.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5e0c\"", "article_summary": "While the developers appear jittery, most brokers still seem to be upbeat about the luxury condo market.\n\u201cCondo development is on life support,\u201d he told a packed audience at the Expo, adding that the much-touted luxury condo market on 57th Street \u201chas just stopped\u201d.\nAt a celebrity-heavy panel at last week\u2019s NYC Real Estate Expo, most industry leaders agreed that luxury condo development is heading in the wrong direction.\nIn an interview with Real Estate Weekly, CityRealty\u2019s director of research and communications said she sees challenges ahead for Manhattan\u2019s luxury condo market.\n\u201cIn my opinion, there is no bubble.\u201dAmong real estate executives, Sturner\u2019s opinion is an increasingly rare one."}
