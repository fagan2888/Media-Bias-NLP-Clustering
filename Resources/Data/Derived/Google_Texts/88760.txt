“I've heard Ted Cruz say ... ‘Come debate me anywhere anytime,’ and I think Ted Cruz would go overseas to debate the president,” King said in an interview with The Hill's Molly K. Hooper.

Earlier on Wednesday, Cruz called out Obama for attacking Republicans while on a trip outside the U.S.

King has endorsed Cruz in his presidential bid.
