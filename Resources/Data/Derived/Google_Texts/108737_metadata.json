And one more thing he wanted you and his fellow conservatives to know. He\u2019s not \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mediaite.com, Carson made his case known recently while speaking at the Republican National Committee\u2019s winter meeting in California. As for all those minuses against him (Calling Obamacare \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\u201c; suggesting last year\u2019s Veterans Affairs scandal was a \u201cgift from God\u201c; and saying present-day America \u201cvery much like Nazi Germany\u201d), Carson dismissed them as items hyped up by \u201cthe liberal media.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand by those\u201d remarks, Carson told the crowd, according to The National Journal. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything crazy at all.\u201d\n\nThe Journal pointed out that Carson remained his controversial self while stating the country has lost that sense of urgency after chatting about the bravery of America\u2019s founding fathers, who he said were \u201cwilling to die for what they believed.\u201d The sense of urgency, he argued now belongs to enemies of the US like the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got the wrong philosophy but they\u2019re willing to die for what they believe,\u201d Carson said of ISIS, \u201cwhile we\u2019re busily giving away every value and every belief for the sake of political correctness.\u201d\n\nSeeing the impact of his comments, Carson quickly added that the media would take what he said out of context.\n\n\u201cThey are just so ridiculous,\u201d Carson said about the reporters in the back of the room.\n\nApparently Carson got on a roll, which extended to an interview he did with Fox News. The Washington Times reports that the neurosurgeon turned conservative made claims in the interview that the US\u2019 war with ISIS shouldn\u2019t have any laws because\u2026. the rules of war are \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the president wants to have a good legacy, this would be a good time to start it,\u201d Carson told Fox News that if there are going to be any established rules for war, the main one ought to be \u201cno war.\u201d \u201cWe have people trying to manage the military who know nothing about the military, who know nothing about military strategy. Our military needs to know that they\u2019re not going to be prosecuted when they come back because somebody says, \u2018you did something that was politically incorrect.\u2019 There is no such thing as a politically correct war.\u201d\n\n11 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
