That means corruption cost Floridians upwards of $20 billion during that period.\n\nThe researchers hypothesized that the most corrupt states \"are likely to spend less on items that provide fewer opportunities for corrupt officials to collect bribes, such as education, welfare, health and hospitals.\"\n\nThe research proved that hypothesis correct.\n\n\"The harmful impact of corruption on education,\" says the report, \"persists even after expenditures on educatoin is divided into subcategories: elementary and secondary education and higher education.\"\n\nGov. Rick Scott is touting the state's new $20.7 billion K-12 budget, the largest in state history, but per-pupil spending is still $177 less than its highest point in 2007-2008.\n\nIn fact, the Census Bureau released a report earlier this month ranking Florida among the 10 states that spend the least per student.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-06-23/news/fl-rscol-oped0623-20140623_1_corrupt-officials-corruption-index-rhonda-swan", "site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "type": "article", "description": "A new study ranking Florida among the top 10 most corrupt states in the country barely made the radar for most media outlets because the mundane facts and figures weren't sexy.The study by...", "title": "Rhonda Swan: Want to see corrupt officials?
