You\u2019ll get it right this time. Buy the beautiful house, associate with interesting, beautiful people. Drive a new car. A fast one. Get rich, naturally. You want to cut everything away, leave behind all your old things, all your old acquaintances. Slip out quietly as night falls, or just as the sun\u2019s rising. A clean slate, no past. Head someplace else, somewhere far away. You want to have control this time. Be your own architect. Press \u201cStart\u201d once more. A new life. A new career, in a new town. We\u2019ve all thought of that right? It\u2019s what we were promised, after all.\n\nAin\u2019t the American Dream grand? Michael, one of three playable characters in \u201cGrand Theft Auto V,\u201d yells this periodically during firefights, typically when you\u2019re rampaging against cops. In a nutshell, that context is all you need to understand the wicked smirk specific to the GTA franchise\u2019s exaggerated vision of America. It\u2019s always hard to pin down exactly what the ultra-successful series is. \u201cGTA\u201d is equal parts incisively clever and on the nose. It pushes boundaries with some of the most mature content in mainstream video games while channeling that content toward juvenile ends, tapping into latent teenage dreams of anarchy. The games acerbically critique American consumerism while also offering a world in which driving up on a sidewalk and running down civilians is cause for laughing out loud.\n\nThroughout, one thing has been consistent. In its continual mining of classic American crime dramas, from \u201cThe Godfather\u201d to \u201cScarface\u201d to \u201cHeat,\u201d the GTA franchise automatically inherits that tradition\u2019s outlaw take on undying American Dream tropes. The upward mobility, the rags to riches, all with a pistol in one hand and a bag of money in the other. Through its knowing recalibration of this traditional structure, \u201cGTA\u201d would like to position itself as subversive. And, no doubt, its vision of America has always been an amusingly satirical one, that proclamation of \u201cAin\u2019t the American Dream grand?\u201d delivered with a healthy amount of sarcasm. But it\u2019s also fantasy fulfillment. As much as this newest iteration of \u201cGTA\u201d skewers American culture, it also captures how the GTA franchise as a whole plays into a more contemporary tradition \u2014 a new, digital American frontier in which to play out our inherited myth over and over. One that urges us to press \u201cStart\u201d once more, but on the pretense of what is, ultimately, a batch of false promises.\n\n***\n\nThere has always seemed to be promise in the American landscape \u2014 its expansiveness seemed to suggest unlimited potential for self-reinvention. It\u2019s big enough for you to keep diving deeper inward, and this has become woven into the stories we tell ourselves about American identity. This is, of course, all over the place, but just take a look at three iconic American artists. Fitzgerald gave us one of the holy texts of American Dream iconography with \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d one of the archetypal stories of a man fleeing to one coast to recreate himself in a new image, to start again as someone else. There was something more diffuse in the stories of Kerouac, a wanderlust that ping-ponged between those two dream-state destinations of New York and California. And, of course, there\u2019s always Springsteen, perhaps the most iconic American artist to poeticize the lure and possibilities of the open highway.\n\nBut lately the idea of taking off and starting anew in another town feels a bit outmoded. We\u2019ve inherited the failure \u2014 Gatsby winds up shot in a pool, Sal Paradise no longer really believes in Dean Moriarty, and the characters of \u201cBorn to Run\u201d never make it past the city limits but instead wind up in the bar of \u201cGlory Days.\u201d That\u2019s the symbolic stuff, but the act of traveling through America has changed, too. The prices of airfare dropped, allowing middle-class Americans to traverse their continent in a few hours, abstracting the distance. Road trips became something of a stereotype. For different reasons, the recent film adaptations of \u201cOn the Road\u201d and \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d were more or less conceptual failures, but what they had in common was that they felt heavily inert for stories that were supposed to be so dynamic. Their sense of wonder now scans as quaint, a forced premise covering up attempts at escape we inherently understand as failed experiments.\n\nDigital culture has, as it does with most things, accelerated this process. These kinds of classic American tales of reinvention might not end with the characters finding what they\u2019re looking for, but at least those characters were able to work off of an initial sense of wonder. There is very little mystery left in driving around America when you can search a million photos of the Grand Canyon online, or when you hew rigidly to the route laid out by the automated Google Maps voice as you roll through the desert. You can travel anywhere you want before you actually go there. Inevitably, this changes how it feels to arrive at a new place \u2014 leaving you with that nagging sense of having been there before, of having lived this moment before. Digital culture demystifies something that strains to remain legendary, demoting an enigmatic frontier to the banality of a default desktop photo.\n\nThe effect of digital culture isn\u2019t just how it alters our old dreams, but also what it offers as an alternative. If physical space feels finite even when we couldn\u2019t possibly see it all in person, the new worlds we create for ourselves feel truly limitless. The Internet, of course, is the main venue in question, with its countless portals to wherever we wish to go, with the way it fragments us from a single person into a Facebook self, a Twitter self, etc. What is perhaps less considered is how open-world video games have, for a not-inconsequential portion of a certain generation, supplanted that notion of discovering yourself somewhere in the American continent.\n\nThere\u2019s still plenty to be said for the experience of driving across America, but increasingly, it\u2019s the virtual worlds that trigger our imagination. We no longer have to be concerned about arriving at the opposite coast and realizing that we still have ourselves to deal with when we arrive. Now we can acutely craft how we present to others with our various profiles, or disappear entirely into characters in some sprawling digitized world. Mostly, these kinds of games still operate in a fantasy/sci-fi vein, offering the player a world entirely dissociated from our own. We require different things out of video games than other art \u2014 we seek an active performativity, and games like \u201cSkyrim\u201d or \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d deliver.\n\nThere\u2019s something else to the GTA franchise, though, something that hits on multiple levels. It\u2019s an open, virtual world that we\u2019ve created, but a vivid reflection of the real one, which complicates things severely. Digital culture contributed to the downfall of our myths, but it can build them up in even more extreme forms. When the aura of the American frontier fades, all it takes is a sunset rendered in graphics, all the colors punched up to their more delirious selves, and suddenly we have new places again.\n\n***\n\nWhen \u201cGrand Theft Auto III\u201d \u2014 the first entry in the franchise to take the world to full 3D as we now know it \u2014 was released in 2001, its creators at Rockstar Games expected another cult hit, but not a major hit. It wound up being the highest-selling game of that year. When \u201cGrand Theft Auto V\u201d was released this past September, it made over a billion dollars in three days, which isn\u2019t just a record for video games but for all forms of entertainment, period. As a recent Grantland article pointed out, with more than 29 million copies sold, the reimagined Los Angeles of \u201cGTA V\u201d \u2014 dubbed Los Santos \u2014 has a player base milling around in it that\u2019s more than triple the population of real-life Los Angeles. Has there ever been another game that received as much hype before its release alongside such a massive succession of considered essays on the experience of playing it?\n\nPeople still wring their hands over the game\u2019s teenage dreams of rebellion, or over its rabid political incorrectness. With a cultural footprint like that, though, we have to be dealing with something beyond leftover adolescent wish fulfillment. Something bigger, more endemic.\n\nFor those of us raised on the teleology of level-based side-scrollers, open-world games are revelatory.\n\nAs a genre, they allow us to disappear into something. Live a different life. It\u2019s effective because the worlds are so sprawling and intricate as to feel like true alternate existences. That\u2019s long been half the fun of the GTA franchise. You don\u2019t have to do anything. Each iteration deepens its world, and drives that point home. \u201cGTA V\u201d has, as expected, taken everything to the next level, including this. It added far more atmospheric stuff to occupy your time \u2014 the \u201cStrangers & Freaks\u201d encounters playing on cartoon versions of California full of drug burnouts and the fame-obsessed, bounty-hunting gigs, arms-smuggling.\n\nAs you drive through Los Santos, lots of what happens to you seems unrelated to the game\u2019s main point. Someone will get mugged, and you have the option to help them. You\u2019ll stumble across armored vehicles you can rob for a few thousand dollars. You might witness someone stick up a clothing store, and you can either let them run away or gun them down. This is all outside the main storyline, which itself is somewhat amorphous. Where past \u201cGTA\u201d entries had players encounter a spectrum of different criminals, they still operated on a basic structure, point A to point B. There\u2019s less direct momentum to \u201cGTA V.\u201d Between its three characters and the fact that you spend the bulk of the game actually working for yourself or the government, it feels more like you\u2019re wading into these lives rather than racing alongside them.\n\nCoupling the largest and most complex world of any of the GTA games with this even wider-open nature of gameplay, \u201cGTA V\u201d is the most immersive of the series and the one that best represents the moment where the new escapism of open-world gaming dovetails with an inherited American mythology. Playing any game entails some level of physical and psychological immersion. You don\u2019t think \u201cI need to press R1 to take cover, then L2 to aim, then R2 to fire at this thug before he takes away enough of my health meter that I lose and have to start the mission over.\u201d You think \u201cI need to kill him before he kills me.\u201d \u201cGTA V\u201d welcomes that immersion, letting you move through its world with a new level of grace, whether it\u2019s the smoothness of its weapon wheel and aiming system, or the responsiveness of its driving mechanics. You are inhabiting a new skin and a new place, but the game hardly lets you see the seams as you traverse this new existence.\n\nThe other reason the experience feels so natural is that, for a time, \u201cGTA V\u201d seems to promise that it will never end. Surely the massiveness of its world, the variety of its activities, would guarantee that there would be unlimited potential. The setting of the game makes \u201cGTA V\u201d feel theoretically limitless even if that\u2019s demonstrably untrue physically. Playing \u201cGTA V\u201d is a radical and twisted form of virtual self-reinvention, taking place in a world that is itself a twisted reinvention of our real one.\n\nThe Internet and digital culture are simply facts of our lives and times, and many of us spend much of our days navigating the digital and cyber landscapes far more than any literal landscape. What goes on there, what identities we create out there \u2014 whether in the play realm of video games or the social and professional realms of the Internet \u2014 is very much legitimate. We know the frontier of \u201cGTA V\u201d is a constructed one, but the fact that it is created purely to lose yourself in \u2014 as opposed to the actual American landscape, which will exist with or without your cares \u2014 makes it feel like a more appropriate method of escape and performative reinvention. The artificiality of it all is part of the deal. It\u2019s what makes the escapism legible to us in the 21st century. \u201cGTA V\u201d succeeded in delivering a world that hit all these pleasure centers and intellectual concerns alike. So, why, ultimately, does it still feel unsatisfying?", "article_metadata": {"description": "When real travel stops feeling revelatory, the digital road takes its place \u2014 for good or ill", "author": "Ryan Leas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When real travel stops feeling revelatory, the digital road takes its place \u2014 for good or ill", "title": "Move over, Kerouac! \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d is the American Dream narrative now", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/05/move_over_kerouac_grand_theft_auto_is_the_american_dream_narrative_now/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/gtav_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When real travel stops feeling revelatory, the digital road takes its place \u2014 for good or ill", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/gtav_1.jpg", "title": "Move over, Kerouac! \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d is the American Dream narrative now", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Move over, Kerouac! \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d is the American Dream narrative now", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Gaming, Grand theft auto, Video Games", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced28\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, Gaming, Grand theft auto, Video Games, Entertainment NewsYou want to begin again.\nDigital culture contributed to the downfall of our myths, but it can build them up in even more extreme forms.\nMichael, one of three playable characters in \u201cGrand Theft Auto V,\u201d yells this periodically during firefights, typically when you\u2019re rampaging against cops.\nThe other reason the experience feels so natural is that, for a time, \u201cGTA V\u201d seems to promise that it will never end.\nDigital culture demystifies something that strains to remain legendary, demoting an enigmatic frontier to the banality of a default desktop photo."}
