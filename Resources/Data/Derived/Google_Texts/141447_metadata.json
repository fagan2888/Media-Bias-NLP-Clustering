Asha Kowtal and Thenmozhi Soundararajan have rallied the roughly 80 million Dalit women around the world to tell them they don\u2019t have to suffer in silence.\n\nManisha was pulled into a car, raped twice, and threatened with death if she didn\u2019t go back to her perpetrators within 10 days.\n\nHer aunt had also been raped, killed, with her body thrown into a ditch. Police looked the other way.\n\n\u201cThe law is not meant for us. \u2026 I am all alone,\u201d actress Uma Thurman read from Manisha\u2019s story during the 2014 Women in the World Summit at Lincoln Center in New York City.\n\nBy \u201cus,\u201d Manisha is referring to the Dalit population, roughly 80 million women around the world who are traditionally part of India\u2019s Untouchable caste.\n\nAsha Kowtal, general secretary of the All India Dalit Women Rights Forum, says that Manisha\u2019s story is not only typical, but it\u2019s widespread \u2014 and silenced \u2014 simply because they were born into the lowest caste. Even though official statistics report that four Dalit women are raped every day, Kowtal says that number is vastly underreported. Many women don\u2019t report rape in the first place because local authorities will not pursue their cases.\n\nModerator Cynthia McFadden, senior legal and investigative correspondent for NBC News, cited a disturbing statistic that even when a rape case makes it to court, the perpetrator is punished only one percent of the time.\n\n\u201cWho has the right to tell us that we are condemned by God?\u201d demands Thenmozhi Soundararajan, an American director, singer, writer, and transmedia artist who is a second-generation Dalit woman whose parents left the caste system.\n\nSoundararajan stresses the difference between the \u201cBollywood India\u201d and the \u201cactual India.\u201d In the \u201cactual India,\u201d there is no rule of law. It\u2019s an India where doctors conduct \u201ctwo-finger tests\u201d after girls and women report rapes to \u201cmorally assassinate character of a victim,\u201d she says. It\u2019s an India where a rape survivor showed a judge video footage of her rape that was circulated around her village, but the judge simply laughed and said \u201cNow you have proof that you enjoyed yourself.\u201d\n\nTheir movement replaced the word \u201cuntouchable\u201d with the term \u201cDalit,\u201d simply to give women a claim to their humanity.\n\n\u201cEven if no one else recognizes us as human, we will shout in on the rooftops. \u2026 The shame is not on the women, the shame is on India,\u201d Soundararajan says.\n\nIn the past two months, the two women said that the Dalit women\u2019s movement recently participated in a march in India where they visited rape victims to empower and energize them. Women and children of all ages marched the entire day in 90-degree heat to confront the equivalent of a town mayor, and he ran away from them. The women took matters into their own hands, charging into his office, and wrote \u201cSHAME\u201d on his wall.\n\nKowtal rallied the Women in the World audience to join in one of the marchers\u2019 chants :\u201cDalit women fight!\u201d\n\nStories of rapes in India seem to appear on a near-daily basis, stemming from the 2012 Delhi bus rape that galvanized the nation to recognize the widespread problem of sexual violence in the country. Even though the attention that the 2012 rape case garnered is vitally important, Kowtal stresses that caste-based sexual violence is different. It\u2019s a full-fledged human-rights crisis that has been perpetuated throughout centuries. There are no Dalit journalists or major company heads, so Dalits are essentially voiceless. They are routinely stripped, beaten, spit on, raped with objects, and even burned alive, Soundararajan says. Their minds and bodies are constantly violated.\n\nKowtal and Soundararajan have given Dalit women a platform to have their voices heard. Soundararajan says that it\u2019s not enough for one woman to be free \u2014 they all must be free to earn the self-respect they deserve.\n\n\u201cWe have to end the silence,\u201d Kowtal says.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dalit women are widely targeted by rapists simply because they are part of the Untouchable caste.
