“Be honest and true, boys/Whatever you do, boys/Let this be your motto through life,” a woman recites as a battalion of lads flit like fish through a watery underworld, grasping at gold coins raining down. Cut to the pier above, where the wealthy are toasting their sun-kissed summer by tossing away their money in Atlantic City, circa 1884. Thus begins the origin story of Nucky Thompson, a very good boy (played by Nolan Lyons) until Commodore Louis Kaestner, the power broker who becomes his mentor, gets hold of him in HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire.” Nearly 50 years later, the adult Nucky (Steve Buscemi) is fighting to go legit by courting the Bacardi Rum family in Cuba in the series’s fifth and final season, debuting Sunday. But as he gazes down at boys diving into the Havana harbor, his mind returns to his stormy New Jersey childhood, now a world apart in every conceivable sense.

The next night on HBO, Mr. Buscemi, with the help of the documentarian Liz Garbus, reminisces about his own relative youth as a New York City firefighter in “A Good Job: Stories of the FDNY.”
