(AP) - George Hugo Boldt was not a man anyone would mistake for a revolutionary.\n\nHe was a bespectacled and conservative Republican, a former Army officer who grew up in Montana and kept his close-sheared haircut intact throughout the turbulent \u201860s and beyond.\n\nAmong his many conservative credentials, Boldt was known as the federal judge who in 1970 held a group of Vietnam War protesters called the Seattle Seven in contempt of court and sentenced them to prison for six months.\n\nThe only thing about Boldt that could be considered radical was his fondness for plaid sports jackets and bow ties.\n\nAnd yet .\n\nThe court ruling Boldt handed down 40 years ago this week is a decision now recognized as one of the most sweeping documents of economic and social reform in Pacific Northwest history.\n\nThe central question in United States v. Washington concerned tribal fishing rights, but ripples from the decision went far and wide.\n\nIt changed the empty concept of \u201ctribal sovereignty\u201d into something that needed to be taken seriously - or else. And it transformed the way state and tribal governments interact.\n\nFor Washington Indian tribes, it marked the beginning of a renaissance, fueled by money, power and pride.\n\nFor four decades, the Boldt Decision has shaped political issues in Washington, from those that are purely tribal-based - gambling, tribal sales of cigarettes and gasoline, and tribal law enforcement, for example - to broadly based issues that involve environmental regulation and land use throughout the state.\n\nThe decision had consequences for native tribes not only in Western Washington but also throughout the United States - and to some extent for indigenous people around the world.\n\n\u201cPeople from New Zealand and Australia come to ask us, \u2018How did you do this?\u2019 \u201d said Billy Frank Jr., a Nisqually fisherman made famous by the case. \u201cHow did you get the United States government to be on your side?\u201d\n\nThe answer, said University of Washington fisheries professor Richard Whitney, who recently appeared with Frank for a filmed chat about the Boldt Decision in its 40th year, is that there was nothing radical about the ruling.\n\nIt was, in fact, a conservative reading, he said, a strict law-and-order interpretation entirely in keeping with Boldt\u2019s character and his view of the law.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the most significant decisions of the century,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cNot just because of the fishing situation, but because of the fact that a federal judge would look at the law and say, this is what the law requires, and everybody has to live up to it. Not just the tribes and not just the state, but everybody.\n\n\u201cThat principle - that we are going to abide by the law - is what keeps this country alive,\u201d Whitney said.\n\nBoldt\u2019s tough reaction to the Seattle Seven - plus the fact he himself was a sport fisherman - gave tribes serious misgivings when it was announced in 1970 that he would be the judge to preside over the high-profile fishing case.\n\nHank Adams, who had served as the tribes\u2019 unofficial tactician and political organizer through most of the 1960s, considered trying to have Boldt removed, but then thought better of it.\n\nAn Assiniboine-Sioux, Adams played a key role in elevating the fishing dispute on the Nisqually and Puyallup rivers to the national stage.\n\nFor years, state fisheries managers had restricted net fishing on Puget Sound rivers at certain times of the year to protect salmon runs. Indian fishermen routinely ignored the restrictions, arguing they had a treaty right to fish whenever and however they pleased. And they got arrested.\n\nBeginning in 1964, Adams, Frank, Ramona Bennett and other Indian activists began turning the arrests into media events, organizing rallies and inviting Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Dick Gregory and other celebrities to the riverbanks to help sway public opinion.\n\nThe demonstrations sometimes erupted into brawls, with television cameras capturing the action for the national news.\n\n\u201cThe timing was everything,\u201d Bennett said Wednesday at a celebration of the Boldt Decision held at the Squaxin Island Tribe\u2019s casino complex. \u201cIt was in the middle of the peace movement and the civil rights movement.\n\n\u201cThere was a change going on,\u201d she said, \u201cand we got to be part of that change.\u201d\n\nAt the anniversary celebration - attended by more than 1,000 tribal members from across the state - Bennett, Frank and Adams regaled the crowd with reminiscences of the Fish Wars, describing armed confrontations with police, beatings and repeated jailings.\n\n\u201cWe got dragged out of the river and into the jail,\u201d Frank said. \u201cWe were willing to die for these rights, and we still are.\u201d\n\nIn 1970, the federal government filed United States v. Washington on behalf of the tribes, arguing the state was denying tribes rights guaranteed in treaties signed in the 1850s.\n\nThe treaties confined the tribes to reservations but contained a phrase that became critical at trial: \u201cThe right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations, is further secured to said Indians, in common with all citizens of the territory.\u201d\n\nThe 203-page decision Boldt delivered Feb. 12, 1974, is complex, but the part most shocking at the time was his formula for deciding how many of the salmon and steelhead should go to the tribes and how many to non-Indians.\n\nBoldt interpreted the words \u201cin common with\u201d to mean the tribes were entitled to up to 50 percent of the harvestable catch, an almost inconceivable change considering tribal members made up less than 1 percent of the state population and non-Indian fishermen routinely were taking 95 percent of the fish.\n\nIt was hard to tell who was more stunned by Boldt\u2019s ruling: the state or the tribes. Attorneys representing the tribes had floated the idea that the phrase \u201cin common with\u201d could mean 50 percent, but even they thought it was a stretch.\n\nFor thousands of sport and commercial fishermen, the ruling was a bombshell. It cut their catch in half and put most out of business.\n\nBoldt was mocked on bumper stickers - \u201cCan Judge Boldt, not Salmon;\u201d \u201dA dead Boldt is a good Boldt.\u201d - and was hanged in effigy in front of federal courthouses.\n\nForty years later it is difficult to imagine the extent of the outrage and indignation the Boldt Decision caused.\n\nFawn Sharp, currently president of the Quinault Indian Nation on the Olympic Peninsula, had barely learned to walk when Boldt handed down his ruling.\n\nBilly Frank Jr. , left, greets old friends during the 40th anniversary celebration of the Boldt Decision on Wednesday near Shelton.

Koepfler, staff photographer).\n\nShe doesn\u2019t remember the day of the decision, but she said she would never forget the anger and resentment she felt from white people for years afterward. Sharp recalls being afraid to go to the white fishing town of Westport because Indians had their tires slashed there.\n\n\u201cWestport was like a no-no place,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of fear.\u201d\n\nBoldt also ruled that tribes had the right to regulate the fishing of their members, independent of state laws and regulations. That, in the eyes of many non-Indians, was an unacceptable and un-American position because it granted a small portion of the population \u201cspecial rights\u201d over others.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have superior rights,\u201d said Jack Metcalf, a state senator at the time and later a U.S. representative. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a hereditary aristocracy that has more rights than other people.\u201d\n\nMany nonnative fishermen refused to obey federal bans on fishing, and the state refused to enforce them. Slade Gorton, the Washington State attorney general at the time, vowed to appeal the ruling (which he did without success) to make sure it was vacated.\n\nJames Johnson, then an assistant attorney general and now a member of the Washington State Supreme Court, called Boldt\u2019s decision \u201can aberration\u201d and said he was confident it would be overturned.\n\nThe state\u2019s resistance led the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to compare Washington with states in the Deep South that refused to abide by federally mandated desegregation.\n\n\u201cExcept for some segregation cases . the district court has faced the most concerted official and private efforts to frustrate a decree of a federal court witnessed in this century,\u201d appellate court justices said of the Boldt Decision.\n\nThe irony of the Boldt Decision is that the 50/50 allocation formula, which appeared to be the most revolutionary aspect, turned out to be largely meaningless, at least as it related to salmon.\n\nA handful of well-financed Indian fishermen profited in the years immediately following the ruling, but by then the salmon fishery in Puget Sound was so nearly destroyed by development and logging there was little left to fight over. The tribes\u2019 annual harvest is lower now than in 1974.\n\nMore significant was the extent to which Boldt\u2019s decision reinforced the notion of tribal sovereignty and elevated the legal status of the treaties.\n\nBoldt said the state and tribes should \u201cco-manage\u201d fishing resources off the reservations. Further readings of the case established that the state has an obligation to protect fish habitat, to ensure the tribes\u2019 rights to fish in perpetuity.\n\nThat created a powerful legal incentive to protect the environment and include tribes in land-use decisions.\n\nThe Boldt Decision and its allocation formula were extended to include shellfish, including the multimillion-dollar geoduck harvest.\n\nThe legal status it gave the treaties and the concept of tribal sovereignty figured prominently in the Puyallup Land Claims Settlement and the state\u2019s accords, which made possible the tribes\u2019 highly profitable gaming operations.\n\nAs the tribes celebrate the anniversary of the Boldt Decision this week, yet another federal court sub-proceeding is in the news - one that could cost the state an estimated $1.9 billion.\n\nThe treaty tribes argued that hundreds of culverts installed at road crossings by the state block fish from passing through them and therefore reduce the amount of harvest available to the tribes. Last year, a federal court judge gave the state a 17-year deadline to fix the fish-blocking culverts.\n\n\u201cWe prefer to collaborate with the state,\u201d said Frank, head of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission since it was founded immediately after Boldt. \u201cHowever, the state\u2019s unwillingness to work together and solve the problems of these salmon-blocking culverts in a timely manner left us with no alternative except the courts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fight never stops,\u201d Frank said. \u201cYou fight for your culture, your way of life.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News Tribune, http://www.thenewstribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "George Hugo Boldt was not a man anyone would mistake for a revolutionary.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/9/boldt-decision-has-rippling-effects-40-years-later/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "George Hugo Boldt was not a man anyone would mistake for a revolutionary.", "title": "Boldt decision has rippling effects 40 years later"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "George Hugo Boldt was not a man anyone would mistake for a revolutionary.", "card": "summary", "title": "Boldt decision has rippling effects 40 years later"}, "Author": "ROB CARSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "George Hugo Boldt, Washington Indian, Billy Frank Jr, Richard Whitney"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1272\"", "article_summary": "Forty years later it is difficult to imagine the extent of the outrage and indignation the Boldt Decision caused.\nBilly Frank Jr. , left, greets old friends during the 40th anniversary celebration of the Boldt Decision on Wednesday near Shelton.\nThe Boldt Decision and its allocation formula were extended to include shellfish, including the multimillion-dollar geoduck harvest.\n\u201cThe timing was everything,\u201d Bennett said Wednesday at a celebration of the Boldt Decision held at the Squaxin Island Tribe\u2019s casino complex.\nThe central question in United States v.
