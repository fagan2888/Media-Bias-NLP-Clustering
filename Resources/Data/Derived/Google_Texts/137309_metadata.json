Republicans plan to launch a fresh assault on the Common Core education standards, press antiabortion regulations, cut personal and corporate income taxes and take up dozens of measures challenging the power of labor unions and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nBefore Election Day, the GOP controlled 59 partisan legislative chambers across the country. The increase to 68 gives Republicans six more statehouses than their previous record in the modern era, set after special elections in 2011 and 2012.\n\nRepublicans also reduced the number of states where Democrats control both the governor\u2019s office and the legislatures from 13 to seven.\n\nRepublicans in at least nine states are planning to use their power to pass \u201cright to work\u201d legislation, which would allow employees to opt out of joining a labor union. Twenty-four states already have such laws on the books, and new measures have been proposed in Wisconsin, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Ohio, Colorado, Kentucky, Montana, Pennsylvania and Missouri.\n\nDemocrats and union officials warn Republicans against going too far, just a few years after bills targeting public-sector employee unions sparked protests in Wisconsin and Ohio. \u201cThese bills have proven time and time again to decrease wages and safety standards in all workplaces,\u201d said Stephanie Bloomingdale, secretary-treasurer of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO.\n\nA new round of the culture wars is also inevitable in 2015. Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the antiabortion Susan B. Anthony List, said she expects measures banning abortions after 20 weeks will advance in Wisconsin, South Carolina and West Virginia. Missouri, too, is likely to take up some abortion-related bills.\n\nIn Tennessee, voters gave the legislature new powers to regulate abortion, and state House Speaker Beth Harwell, a Republican, has said her chamber will take up three measures requiring mandatory counseling, a waiting period and stricter inspections of clinics.\n\nConservative activists also are targeting Common Core, the national education standards adopted by 46 states and the District of Columbia over the past few years. Opposition from parent and community groups has become a hot political issue on the right over the past year, leading three states \u2014 Indiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina \u2014 to drop out of the program.\n\nSome states will attempt to join those three in leaving the program altogether. Others will try to change testing requirements or prevent the sharing of education data with federal officials. In recent interviews, several Republican governors who support Common Core say they expect debate in their forthcoming legislative sessions.\n\n\u201cThe biggest concern and opposition you hear from conservative legislators is, \u2018We don\u2019t want Washington dictating curricula,\u2018 \u201c said Utah state Sen. Curtis Bramble, a Provo Republican.\n\nRepublicans also are likely to take up measures diluting the power of the EPA, which has proposed state-by-state targets for reducing carbon emissions. A dozen states have challenged proposed EPA regulations on power plants in federal court.\n\nNew Republican governors in states such as Arkansas and Arizona and legislators in North Carolina, North Dakota and elsewhere will prioritize cutting personal or corporate income tax rates. States that have experienced a revenue boom from energy taxes will have to contend with falling receipts as the price of oil declines. Tax revenues in other states are coming in slower than expected, presenting a challenge in many of the 49 states that require balanced annual budgets.\n\n\u201cWith the increasing costs of Medicaid and education, balancing the budget is going to be a challenge,\u201d said South Dakota state Sen. Deb Peters, a Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee.\n\nBut Republicans also caution that they have to use their newfound political power to govern effectively and avoid overreach.\n\n\u201cIf [Republicans] go too far, they\u2019re not going to be the speaker and the majority leader two years from now,\u201d said Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican whose party took total control of the state legislature in November. \u201cThere\u2019s a very narrow window to demonstrate that they can lead, that we can lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats are going to articulate an agenda that\u2019s forward-thinking,\u201d said Michael Sargeant, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Republicans, especially those considering possible presidential bids, such as Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, \u201care worried about taking on some of these fights, because [Democratic constituencies] are going to fight back.\u201d\n\nSo there will be exceptions to the coming conservative juggernaut. Despite conservative opposition to Obamacare, some Republicans are debating whether and how to accept federal Medicaid expansion. Republican governors of Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, North Carolina and Tennessee have said they will try to convince their legislators to accept federal funding, while Democratic governors in Montana and Pennsylvania will work with Republican-controlled legislatures, too.\n\n\u201cWe were one of the states that sued on [the Affordable Care Act]. I thought it was both bad policy and I thought it was unconstitutional. The courts said I was wrong,\u201d said Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican who is advocating a modified expansion plan. \u201cEven though I have serious disagreements with the law, this is the current law. How do we as a state make the best of it?\u201d\n\nLegislators said they are closely watching the Supreme Court, which will decide this year whether health-care subsidies under the ACA are constitutional in states that did not create their own exchange. \u201cIf the Supreme Court decides the Obamacare subsidies and employer penalties do not apply in states with federal health-care exchanges, then that will generate a huge new discussion in state legislatures,\u201d said Tennessee state Sen. Brian Kelsey, a Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee.\n\nLegislators also will debate myriad less-partisan issues that have arisen as technology advances, from cybersecurity policies and regulations on electronic cigarettes to ride-sharing services. And the daunting specter of growing pension liabilities is likely to lead to contentious confrontations amid stretched budgets.\n\nLawmakers in a handful of states are considering how to regulate and tax the electronic cigarette industry; so far, three states have banned e-cigarettes from smoke-free workplaces, and Minnesota and North Carolina levy taxes on them. The e-cigarette industry, eager to avoid lawsuits and public relations disasters, has encouraged at least some regulations. In Utah, Weber and Davis counties have implemented e-cigarette legislation and action is expected in the 2015 Legislature.\n\nSeveral states are grappling with the rise of ride-sharing services, such as Uber, Lyft and Sidecar. Outgoing Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, is likely to sign a measure regulating the emerging industry, and Uber is negotiating a similar agreement with Nevada regulators.\n\nOthers will debate \u201cright to try\u201d legislation, which would allow people with terminal illnesses access to experimental drugs before those drugs win final approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana and Missouri already have versions of such laws on the books.\n\nAnd as marijuana legalization takes effect in two more states, in addition to the two states where the drug was already legal, legislators in most states are expected to debate a rash of drug law reforms. Pure legalization bills will be introduced in 18 states, while decriminalization bills will be introduced in 15, according to a tally maintained by the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project.\n\nStates will lobby the new Republican-led Congress on a handful of issues that impact budgets. A bipartisan group of legislators has urged Congress to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act, which would allow taxation of online sales, though GOP control in Washington makes passage unlikely. Thirty-nine governors, Democrats and Republicans alike, have encouraged Congress to extend funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which provides states about $13 billion for medical coverage for about 8 million children from low-income families. And states want Congress to pass a long-term extension of the Highway Trust Fund, which top Republicans in Washington have said is a priority.\n\n\u201cState legislatures need a long-term funding solution for their transportation infrastructure. If Congress does not act, states will have to look at other funding solutions,\u201d said Mick Bullock, a spokesman for the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nMounting budgetary challenges from earlier years will dominate legislative attention in a handful of states. About half of all states are operating at or above their maximum prison capacity, according to corrections experts, putting pressure on legislatures to alleviate overcrowding. Some states will have to deal with increasingly underfunded pension plans, which could threaten to swamp state budgets over the long term. In Illinois, where the state pension is funded at less than 40 percent, Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner, a Republican, made pension reform a cornerstone of his campaign this year.\n\nThe American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization that helps Republican legislators coordinate measures between states, supports moving public pensions from a defined benefit system to a defined contribution system.
