Is that what\u2019s happening at Mercy?\n\nA: \u201cYes. And the more difficult answer is sort of. Out of the 18,000 patients we see each year, about 27 percent were considered uninsured. But because Colorado expanded Medicaid coverage \u2013 which covers about 50 percent of the cost of treatment \u2013 about 10 percent of our patients who weren\u2019t covered before are eligible now, which leaves about 17 percent uninsured.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a growing population who signed up in public-health exchanges who are starting to look and act as if they are uninsured. They predominantly purchased high-deductible policies because they were shopping premiums where they could take advantage of the tax credits, not coverage or what they could afford to pay out-of-pocket. Some of them have deductibles of $6,000 per person or $12,000 per family, and only 11 percent hit the deductible last year, so the remaining 89 percent were out-of-pocket for every dollar spent on health care.\u201d\n\nQ: Word is, Mercy is getting a new electronic records system. Is is going to allow physicians and nurses to spend more time with patients and less time typing in information?\n\nA: Mercy will be installing a new Epic Electronic Health Record software in November 2016 as part of the Centura Health network of 15 hospitals in Colorado. It will cost Centura $300 million, and Mercy\u2019s share will be $30 million, he said. An Epic \u201clight\u201d version will be available to independent practitioners in the community at a discounted rate if they want to have record-keeping that\u2019s compatible with Mercy\u2019s system.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about best-of-breed systems,\u201d Gessel said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just be happy to not get the worst-of-breed system. It is supposed to be easier to use, but I don\u2019t know if it will improve the day in the life of a clinician.\n\n\u201cAll major hospitals in Colorado, not just Centura, will be using the same system, so if you have to be transferred to a hospital in Denver from Mercy, they\u2019ll already have your records. This is the best system on the market today and probably for the next five years.\u201d\n\nQ: I hear Mercy is looking at expanding its palliative care program. What will you do?\n\nA: In the U.S., we spend half of our lifetime\u2019s worth of medical expenses in the last six months of our lives, Gessel said.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019m passionate about, even though it doesn\u2019t help the bottom line. We\u2019ll be breaking ground on our new hospice home in the spring.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20150804/NEWS01/150809823/", "site_name": "The Durango Herald", "image": "http://durangoherald.com/storyimage/DU/20150804/NEWS01/150809823/AR/0/AR-150809823.jpg?maxw=1000&imageversion=16by9", "type": "article", "title": "Mercy CEO shares with us his insights into health care"}, "fb": {"app_id": 263076300371367, "pages": 205518469520233}}, "article_summary": "A: Mercy will be installing a new Epic Electronic Health Record software in November 2016 as part of the Centura Health network of 15 hospitals in Colorado.\nThis is the best system on the market today and probably for the next five years.\u201dQ: I hear Mercy is looking at expanding its palliative care program.\nWhen Tom Gessel, president and CEO of Mercy Regional Medical Center, visited the Rotary Club of Durango on Tuesday, he found no shortage of questions on everything from palliative care to electronic record keeping and the effect of the Affordable Care Act on hospitals.\nIs is going to allow physicians and nurses to spend more time with patients and less time typing in information?\nOut of the 18,000 patients we see each year, about 27 percent were considered uninsured."}
