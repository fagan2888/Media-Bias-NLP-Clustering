(CNN) - While most of us spend Super Bowl Sunday in front of the TV, President Barack Obama typically spends it on TV - and that tradition will continue this year when he speaks with Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly during the network's Super Bowl pregame show on February 2.

Fox News on Thursday announced plans for the presidential interview.

The interview might be more lively than other sit-downs with Obama since O'Reilly hasn't interviewed him in three years and since Fox News is the television home of opposition to the Obama administration. But it's entirely logical for the President to do the interview - it's an opportunity to be heard by one of the biggest television audiences of the year.

Obama's first pre-Super Bowl interview was with NBC's Matt Lauer in 2009. Since then he has spoken with CBS's Katie Couric in 2010, O'Reilly in 2011, Lauer again in 2012, and CBS's Scott Pelley in 2013.

Fox said that this year's interview would be televised live by the Fox network (which is a sister of Fox News) around 4:30 p.m.ET on the day of the game. Afterward, O'Reilly will tape a second interview with the President that will be shown on his Fox News program, "The O'Reilly Factor," the next day.

Unlike, say, the "CBS Evening News," which is anchored by Pelley, last year's pre-Super Bowl presidential interviewer, "The O'Reilly Factor" is centered around O'Reilly's own point of view. Fox could have chosen an interviewer like Bret Baier or Chris Wallace to conduct the Obama interview instead. The choice of O'Reilly instead is a reminder that he remains the biggest personality at the news channel, attracting about three million viewers a night.
