Denver police on Sunday evening were searching for the person who stole a gold-colored Subaru in northwest Denver earlier in the day, apparently not noticing a 2-year-old boy in Broncos-themed clothing sitting inside.

The thief got away after ditching the car in an alley in the 3800 block of Pecos Street and Quivas Way.

Police found the boy safe in the car about an hour after it was stolen. Paramedics checked the boy to rule out injuries.

“There was no one (else) in the car. The motor was running,” police spokesman Eranda Piyasena said.

“We do not have a suspect description,” he said. “We are looking at all aspects of this, including what the motive could have been.”

The 2007 vehicle was in the driveway in front of a house in the 4400 block of Clay Street at about 2:20 p.m. The boy’s father had left it as he went to grab something, Piyasena said.

That’s when the thief took the vehicle.
