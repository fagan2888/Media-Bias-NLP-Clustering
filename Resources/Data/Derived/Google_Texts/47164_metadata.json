Headquartered in Carson, California, Dermalogica also has operations in the U.K., Australia, Ireland and Canada. The company's products are sold in more than 80 countries worldwide.\n\nThe deal was announced just a week after Coty Inc., a maker of skin lotions and fragrances, inked a $12 billion agreement with Procter & Gamble Co. to acquire beauty products that had been put up for sale. Unilever was reportedly one of the potential bidders competing with Coty.\n\nUnilever, a conglomerate known for making of Dove skin creams, has shed food brands in recent years and is apparently banking on personal hygiene products instead. Under chief executive Paul Polman, the London company has focused on its health and beauty business while selling slower-growth food brands, such as its Ragu and Bertolli pasta sauce business. At the time, Unilever president Kees Kruythoff said the pasta sauce sale represented the final steps in reshaping the company's portfolio in North America.\n\nShortly afterward, Unilever followed up with the sale of its Slim-Fast diet food business to Kainos Capital. More recently, the company bought Kate Somerville Skincare LLC, a Los Angeles-based brand, from JH Partners LLC in May.\n\nAaron Gruber and Mark Greene of Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP are representing Unilever on the Dermalogica purchase.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/consumer_goods_retail/unilever-grows-personal-care-portfolio-with-dermalogica-256968-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/dermalogica-snippet.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Unilever Grows Personal Care Portfolio with Dermalogica"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd171\"", "article_summary": "Unilever Grows Personal Care Portfolio with DermalogicaThe company recently inked another skincare deal for Kate Somerville, which was sold by JH PartnersUnilever (NYSE: UL) has taken over Dermalogica, a skin care company known for cleansers, exfoliants, toners, masques, eye treatments, acne treatments and moisturizers.\nShortly afterward, Unilever followed up with the sale of its Slim-Fast diet food business to Kainos Capital.\nAaron Gruber and Mark Greene of Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP are representing Unilever on the Dermalogica purchase.\nAt the time, Unilever president Kees Kruythoff said the pasta sauce sale represented the final steps in reshaping the company's portfolio in North America.\nUnilever, a conglomerate known for making of Dove skin creams, has shed food brands in recent years and is apparently banking on personal hygiene products instead."}
