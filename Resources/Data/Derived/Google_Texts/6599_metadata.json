This idea is particularly compelling to millions of evangelicals who see themselves and their values as being under siege in a rapidly changing society.\n\nAcross the country, these opponents of LGBT equality are working to persuade state legislatures to pass laws known as Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRAs) \u2014 statutes that ostensibly allow individuals to deny goods and services to LGBT people on the basis of their religious beliefs.\n\nThey are named and loosely modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\n\nBut that law was intended as a shield to protect religious liberty. These new laws, such as the one enacted and then modified under intense public pressure in Indiana last year, are intended as a sword to promote discrimination against the LGBT community in the public sphere.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby added a powerful tailwind to the RFRA movement. The 5-4 ruling allowed a large, family-owned corporation to opt out of a requirement under the Affordable Care Act to provide its employees with insurance coverage for contraceptives because of the owners\u2019 religious beliefs.\n\nThe new RFRAs are being championed by extreme religious-right groups that \u2014 as these profiles reveal \u2014 want to reverse the recent progress toward equal protection under the law for the LGBT community. If they had their way, the country would return to the era when gay people remained in the closet and the government claimed the right to say what could go on between consenting adults in their bedrooms.\n\nThese groups are clever \u2014 and cynical.\n\nThey know that, as Americans have grown more accepting of LGBT people, they can no longer rely on discredited stereotypes to stymie the march toward full equality. So they have wrapped their bigotry in the cloak of religious freedom.\n\nThe public should not be fooled.\n\nReligious liberty is a cherished constitutional value, enshrined in the First Amendment. But, as earlier efforts to offer biblical justification for slavery and Jim Crow segregation have taught us, religious liberty should not be used as an excuse to discriminate.\n\nThe danger of these laws goes far beyond the way in which courts may ultimately balance them with statutory and constitutional protections against discrimination. The peril also lies in the atmosphere of bigotry and discrimination that will be created by legitimizing the very idea that LGBT rights threaten religious liberty.\n\nThe reality is that few cases of discrimination will ever find the ear of a sympathetic lawyer, and even fewer will find their way into a courtroom.\n\nMost people who face discrimination on a daily basis have nowhere to turn. That\u2019s why we must push back against these laws and this false narrative.\n\nIt\u2019s why we must expose them for what they are \u2014 excuses to discriminate against other Americans for who they are and who they love.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s why we must expose the groups behind these laws as extremists that despise the LGBT community.\n\nDownload the report (.pdf)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Southern Poverty Law Center", "description": "The hardline groups promoting \u2018religious freedom restoration acts\u2019 to justify anti-gay discrimination.", "title": "'Religious Liberty' and the Anti-LGBT Right", "url": "https://www.splcenter.org/20160211/religious-liberty-and-anti-lgbt-right", "image": "https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/10426930_10152512727559700_2647771730634151427_n.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The hardline groups promoting \u2018religious freedom restoration acts\u2019 to justify anti-gay discrimination.", "creator": {"identifier": "@splcenter", "id": 65698096}, "url": "https://www.splcenter.org/20160211/religious-liberty-and-anti-lgbt-right", "image": {"src": "https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/rfraprotesting-revised-gettyimages.jpg"}, "title": "'Religious Liberty' and the Anti-LGBT Right", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The hardline groups promoting \u2018religious freedom restoration acts\u2019 to justify anti-gay discrimination.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But that law was intended as a shield to protect religious liberty.\nReligious liberty is a cherished constitutional value, enshrined in the First Amendment.\nBut, as earlier efforts to offer biblical justification for slavery and Jim Crow segregation have taught us, religious liberty should not be used as an excuse to discriminate.\nThe peril also lies in the atmosphere of bigotry and discrimination that will be created by legitimizing the very idea that LGBT rights threaten religious liberty.\nYet, while the majority of Americans support LGBT rights, these gains have produced a strong backlash."}
