That\u2019s a 30 percent plunge. Since Monday, the price per barrel of domestic sweet crude dropped from $63.13 to $54.25, a 14 percent slide.\n\nFor consumers, this might seem like welcome news, but, for Wall Street, the numbers tell a different story.\n\nHere to help us make sense of the downward trend is Nick Timiraos of The Wall Street Journal, who\u2019s joining us from Washington, D.C.\n\nSo, this is a good thing for consumers. The price of gas is dropping at the pump. They feel like they have more money in their pockets, right?\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS: Yes, that\u2019s absolutely right. I mean, in June, U.S. consumers were paying on average $3.68 a gallon for gas. Now, we\u2019re down below $2.60.\n\nSo, this is a surprise windfall and it really benefits the middle class because the middle class and lower income households spend a higher share of their income and gas accounts for a higher share of their spending than it does for the average.\n\nSo, it really is a middle class tax cut on the order of $125 billion a year if prices are sustained at these levels.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK. So, if people have more money in their pockets and they go out and perhaps they do a little bit more holiday shopping or they juice the economy up a little bit more, what\u2019s happening to Wall Street?\n\nWhy does Wall Street start to tumble even though people have more money in their pockets?\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS: Well, because, this has been a big surprise.\n\nA 45 percent drop in the price of crude oil since June \u2014 that\u2019s going to create a lot of volatility, and Wall Street doesn\u2019t necessarily like that.\n\nThe reason \u2014 one of the big reasons oil has fallen is because of a slow-down in demand in Europe, Japan where there are worries about deflation.\n\nAnd then, of course, in China, which has been a huge economic growth story for the past 15 years.\n\nSo, these concerns that the rest of the world might be slowing down, that\u2019s what\u2019s really cause something concern on Wall Street.\n\nAnd then you also had some tremendous energy investment in the United States because a lot of the surge in the supply of oil has been brought about from fracking in North Dakota and Texas.\n\nAnd so, you\u2019ve had a lot of small companies raise a lot of debt from the new fracking boom.\n\nAnd with oil prices falling, it calls into question the business prospects for some of those companies.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, is there kind of a tipping point or a basement that\u2019s necessary for the price to be at, for an oil company to say, you know what, it makes sense for to me to dig a hole in the ground and invest $1 million to find another well or to extract oil from another well?\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS: Yes. No, we are testing those prices right now.\n\nI mean, a few months ago when oil was at $80, people said, well, maybe $70 would be the break-even, maybe $60 a barrel would be the break-even.\n\nNow, we\u2019re down below $60 a barrel.\n\nSo, we\u2019re going to find out over the next few months, already you\u2019re seeing drill well counts, the number of drills in the ground in the U.S. going down.\n\nSo, it is going to be a test here to see at what price will investment slow and will production slow for these new frackers along the middle continent of the United States.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And as a ripple effect, we\u2019re also seeing the Russian economy or the Iranians, other oil producers are up in arms about this, right?\n\nNICK TIMIRAOS: Yes, I mean, this is not good news at all for Venezuela.\n\nNot good news for Vladimir Putin and Russia. But it\u2019s great news for the U.S.\n\nI mean, even though the U.S. has had an energy boom and so there are more risks now to a drop in oil prices than in the past for the United States, the rewards still outweigh those risks.\n\nThis is still net positive for the United States economy because we still are on net an importer of oil.\n\nAnd so, when oil prices go down, that\u2019s going to be great for consumers.\n\nAnd consumers really \u2014 you know, they have been hanging in there during this so-called economic recovery, but they haven\u2019t been feeling great.\n\nAnd now, we\u2019re beginning to see better consumer confidence numbers. Retail sales figures this week reported for the month of November were great.\n\nAnd so, there\u2019s a lot of optimism now and there are a lot of U.S. benefit \u2014 U.S. businesses that benefit, frankly from this \u2014 airlines, trucking companies.\n\nAnd so, we should begin to see better prospects for U.S. growth here.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right.
