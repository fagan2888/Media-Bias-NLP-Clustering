Just don\u2019t let him attempt a shot all match.\n\nLouisville City FC forward Matt Fondy came into Saturday night\u2019s match against the Charleston Battery as the United Soccer League\u2019s top scorer with 22 goals.\n\nThe Battery defense smothered the talented striker all night as Fondy did not record a single shot on goal in more than 90 minutes of action. Meanwhile, the Battery got goals from Justin Portillo and Dane Kelly \u2014 both on set plays \u2014 as Charleston defeated Louisville City FC, 2-0, before a crowd of 3,978 at MUSC Health Stadium.\n\nThe victory all but assured the Battery (11-6-10, 43 point) of a spot in the USL playoffs with one game remaining in the regular season. A win over Charlotte next Saturday night will give the Battery the third seed in the USL Eastern Conference and a home game in the opening round of the postseason.\n\nNot only is Fondy the top scorer in the USL this season with 50 points (22 goals and six assists), but Louisville had the top offensive club with 54 goals coming into the match.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to buckle down since the middle of July,\u201d said Charleston Battery captain Jarad van Schaik. \u201cWe\u2019ve played well the last four or five matches, we\u2019ve really buckled down defensively, got a couple of shutouts and tonight\u2019s effort was great. You have to know where (Fondy) is all the time. He\u2019s right on that offside line all the time and it\u2019s hard to mark him because he works so hard.\n\n\u201cIf you go to sleep one time, he\u2019ll punish you. The back four did a great job tonight. They marked him well. I\u2019m really proud of those guys.\u201d\n\nBoth of Charleston\u2019s goals came after questionable calls from the referee that went in the Battery\u2019s favor.\n\nThe first came in the 64th minute when Kelly was taken down just outside the 18-yard box by what appeared to be minimal contract from a Louisville defender.\n\nPortillo smashed the free kick, which deflected off of a Louisville player and into the net for a 1-0 lead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on those set plays all week,\u201d Portillo said. \u201cI felt pretty confident when I was standing over the ball. Their keeper was kind of standing in the middle so I knew the back-post was going to be open. I hit it there and luckily the ball hit off of someone and it went in.\u201d\n\nLess than 20 minutes later, Kelly scored off a set play when he headed in a ball from van Schaik. Kelly had a similar chance in the first half, but his header went wide. This one slipped past Louisville keeper Greg Ranjitsingh for the score on the near post.\n\n\u201cWe had the one in the first half and Dane just missed on it, so I figured we\u2019d try the same thing,\u201d van Schaik said. \u201cThis time Dane was able to put the ball on frame.\u201d\n\nThe Battery extended theirs home streak without a loss to 23 matches. The Battery, which have not lost to a USL opponent since May of 2014, are 14-0-9 in their last 23 matches at home.\n\n\u201cWe did a really good job defensively, we shut down Fondy and they have trouble getting scoring from other guys,\u201d said Charleston coach Mike Anhaeuser. \u201cWe did exactly what we had to and you\u2019ve got to commend the guys. They played well and Louisville is a good team. We\u2019ll take the three points and I think that puts us in the playoffs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charleston Battery blank Louisville 2-0, Sports, \r\nSportsFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nCharleston Battery, \r\nCharleston Battery,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "What\u2019s the best way to shut down the league\u2019s top scorer?", "title": "Charleston Battery blank Louisville 2-0", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150912/150919708/charleston-battery-blank-louisville-2-0", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150912/PC20/150919708/AR/0/AR-150919708.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150912/PC20/150919708/AR/0/AR-150919708.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What\u2019s the best way to shut down the league\u2019s top scorer?", "title": "Charleston Battery blank Louisville 2-0", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150912/PC20/150919708/AR/0/AR-150919708.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150919708}}, "keywords": "Charleston Battery blank Louisville 2-0 , Sports, \r\nSportsFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nCharleston Battery, \r\nCharleston Battery", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T22:31:37Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T22:31:00Z", "author": "Andrew Miller"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "What\u2019s the best way to shut down the league\u2019s top scorer?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9170\"", "article_summary": "Louisville City FC forward Matt Fondy came into Saturday night\u2019s match against the Charleston Battery as the United Soccer League\u2019s top scorer with 22 goals.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to buckle down since the middle of July,\u201d said Charleston Battery captain Jarad van Schaik.\nMeanwhile, the Battery got goals from Justin Portillo and Dane Kelly \u2014 both on set plays \u2014 as Charleston defeated Louisville City FC, 2-0, before a crowd of 3,978 at MUSC Health Stadium.\n\u201cThis time Dane was able to put the ball on frame.\u201dThe Battery extended theirs home streak without a loss to 23 matches.\nPortillo smashed the free kick, which deflected off of a Louisville player and into the net for a 1-0 lead."}
