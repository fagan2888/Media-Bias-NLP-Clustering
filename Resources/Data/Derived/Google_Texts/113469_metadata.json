Most notably, he writes that its suggested reform of Medicaid \u201cmakes a lot of sense and is similar to proposals made earlier by progressive commentators,\u201d and describes its aim of enacting a uniform annual deductible for Medicare as a \u201ccommon sense proposal.\u201d\n\nBut much of Jost\u2019s review is filled with ideological pique\u2014there are various harrumphs about \u201cnostrums\u201d and \u201ctalking points\u201d and \u201chobby horses.\u201d His article contains some factual and analytical inaccuracies, but also a few good points worth discussing.\n\nSingapore And Switzerland\n\nJost, like many observers of health policy, likes to make comparisons between the United States and other countries. But for some reason, he believes that comparisons to Switzerland and Singapore are illegitimate. \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d he writes, \u201cis that we are not Switzerland and we are certainly not Singapore, and we cannot have their health systems.\u201d\n\nThis is a rather facile argument, and one that Roy addresses on the third page of his executive summary. \u201cOf course,\u201d Roy writes, \u201cthe U.S. is neither Switzerland nor Singapore. Each country has its own political system, its own culture, and its own demography. Those differences, however, are not large enough to erase the gains that would accrue here by adapting the most relevant features of the Swiss and Singaporean health care systems to that of the United States.\u201d\n\nRegina Herzlinger, in 2004, compared Switzerland to demographically similar U.S. states on health-care cost and quality, and she found Swiss expenditures \u201cconsiderably lower\u201d and health outcomes \u201croughly equal or better.\u201d\n\nSwitzerland was, in fact, the model used by the designers of both the original health insurance exchange in Massachusetts, and the one incorporated into the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Switzerland\u2019s health insurance system is, quite simply, the ACA exchanges applied to the entire population. If the ACA\u2019s exchanges are good enough for 64-year-olds, it\u2019s certainly conceivable that they\u2019re good enough for 65-year-olds. And if the ACA\u2019s exchanges are good enough for those at the poverty line, it\u2019s also plausible that they\u2019ll be good enough for those below it.\n\nJost writes that \u201cSwitzerland and Singapore are hardly libertarian health care utopias,\u201d as if Roy is not aware of that fact. But Roy acknowledges this in nearly every article he has written on the topic. Roy has used that very phrase, \u201clibertarian utopias,\u201d on countless other occasions. For example, in a March 2012 article for the Atlantic, Roy wrote, \u201cNeither Switzerland nor Singapore could be described as libertarian utopias.\u201d (He has no intention of charging Jost a royalty.)\n\nIndeed, the fact that Singapore regulates provider prices\u2014as most European countries do\u2014makes its model even more compelling, because Singapore spends approximately 4 percent of GDP on health care, compared to around 10 percent for the typical European nation. Clearly, something other than price controls is at work in Singapore, and the distinguishing characteristic of the Singaporean system is its reliance on consumer-driven health plans: health savings accounts and catastrophic coverage.\n\nMost health policy researchers rely on OECD databases to make international health-policy comparisons, and Singapore is not a member of the OECD; this is perhaps why the Singaporean health care system is often overlooked. It is long past time for this oversight to end.\n\nReforming The ACA Exchanges\n\nThe Universal Exchange Plan contemplated by Roy makes some effort to liberalize the ACA exchanges, so as to offer consumers a broader range of affordable coverage options. For example, at the behest of the pharmaceutical industry, ACA plans must contain one branded drug for each therapeutic category or class included in the law\u2019s essential health benefits, regardless of cost-effectiveness. Under Roy\u2019s proposed reforms, insurers would have broader latitude to deploy evidence-based medicine when paying for branded medications.\n\nIn addition, the Plan would make greater use of health savings accounts and catastrophic coverage. It would broaden the ACA\u2019s age-rating bands from 3:1 to 6:1. Jost claims that such a change \u201cwould certainly result in serious rate shock for older Americans.\u201d This is misleading, on several counts.\n\nFirst, subsidy-eligible individuals on the ACA exchanges would not pay more for their health coverage under a widened age band, because the subsidy scheme fixes the percentage of income that subsidy-eligible individuals would pay for premiums out-of-pocket. Second, Jost entirely ignores the fact that widening the age band would substantially reduce premiums for younger individuals. This is especially important given the fact that, in 2010, 55 percent of the uninsured were under the age of 35. In contrast, only 34 percent of those enrolled in exchange-based plans were younger than 35.\n\nJost highlights the fact that the benchmark plan under Roy\u2019s proposal would have a deductible of $7,000 for a person of average age. But he neglected to mention that such coverage would also include an annual HSA subsidy of $1,800. Older individuals would see lower deductibles and higher HSA subsidies. The plan would convert the ACA\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies for low-income individuals into additional HSA subsidies. Furthermore, Medicaid-eligible individuals with high medical costs would have the option of remaining in the legacy Medicaid program until 2027.\n\nIt is fair to say that widening the ACA\u2019s age bands would reduce cross-subsidies for a small subset of the near-elderly. Those nearing retirement who purchase coverage on the non-group market\u2014who also have incomes above the exchange subsidy threshold\u2014would see their artificially-lowered premiums increase. In order to address this issue, Roy has revised the Plan to include a transitional fund that will offer extra premium subsidies to this population.\n\nJost worries that allowing seniors to opt out of the Medicare program\u2014as they could do before 1993\u2014would result in \u201cincreasing Part B premiums for those left behind.\u201d But as he notes earlier in his article, the Universal Exchange Plan would merge the Part A and Part B benefits into a unified premium and deductible. As part of this process, the Plan would adjust Medicare premiums such that adverse selection would not affect the remaining Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nWhile we calculate that these reforms would reduce the average cost of commercial premiums\u2014by 17 percent on average for individuals and 4 percent for families by 2023\u2014Jost is correct in noting that these lower premiums are not the primary driver of the proposal\u2019s fiscal savings.\n\nThe plurality of the plan\u2019s reductions in future federal health spending is driven by the fact that it would gradually migrate future retirees onto the reformed ACA exchanges. Because the ACA exchanges do not subsidize coverage for upper-income individuals, the net effect of the Plan is to redistribute federal spending from wealthy retirees and upper-income workers to the low-income population.\n\nImproving Health Outcomes\n\nJost claims that \u201chow Parente and Roy modeled an improvement in health outcomes, something the CBO never attempts, is a complete mystery,\u201d and complains that he can find \u201cno description of the methodology, or for that matter of the inputs, applied in this analysis.\u201d\n\nThe health-outcome inputs turn out to be rather unmysterious. They are described on pages 20 and 21 of \u201cTranscending Obamacare\u201d:\n\nIn order to gauge the impact of the Plan on [the Medicaid-eligible population], we employed two indices developed by Stephen Parente and colleagues at the University of Minnesota. The first index is the Patient to Provider Access Index (PAI). The PAI, based on a survey of patient-provider access published by the Parente group, indicates the degree of provider choice available in a given health plan, relative to Medicaid\u2019s provider network. A higher score indicates broader access to health care providers. The second index is the Medical Productivity Index (MPI). The MPI was developed by analyzing the Medicare National Claims History File (NCH) and the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) in order to correlate a patient-level measure of health to the specific health care services that a patient receives.13 As with the PAI, the MPI is benchmarked to health outcomes under Medicaid.\n\nFootnote 13, included in that passage, cites Parente\u2019s fuller description of the Medical Productivity Index, the proxy for improved health outcomes.\n\nIt should hardly be surprising that a proposal to offer Medicaid enrollees exchange-based commercial insurance would result in improved health outcomes. The evidence is overwhelming that commercial insurance offers superior health outcomes to Medicaid, even after adjusting for health status and socioeconomic factors.\n\nFurthermore, while the Oregon Medicaid Experiment showed no meaningful improvement in health outcomes for Medicaid enrollees relative to being uninsured, coverage expansion with commercial plans has performed better. Sommers and colleagues persuasively observed an improvement in mortality after the 2006 coverage expansion in Massachusetts, under which approximately 88 percent of the coverage expansion was achieved through private insurers: employer-sponsored insurance, exchange-based coverage, and other non-group commercial insurance.\n\nWe appreciate why calling attention to Medicaid\u2019s poor health outcomes elicits a reaction from the ACA\u2019s strongest supporters; after all, the new law leans heavily on Medicaid to expand coverage to the uninsured. But Medicaid\u2019s problems with access to care are real, and they must not be ignored.\n\nReducing Health Policy Complexity\n\nJost concludes by contending that the Universal Exchange Plan would increase the complexity of the U.S. health-care system. On the contrary: the proposal would substantially reduce the complexity of American health care.\n\nThe reformed exchanges would be less complex than their ACA forebears, because they would be less prescriptive. They would require fewer regulations. After reform, it would be substantially easier for insurers to offer affordable, exchange-compliant plans.\n\nGradually, the Plan\u2019s reforms would bring four large federal programs\u2014Medicaid, Medicare, the ACA exchanges, and the Veterans Health Administration\u2014under one system, the reformed exchanges. Not only would this reduce the complexity of the U.S. health care system, but it would substantially improve its equity and efficiency. It would focus our taxpayer resources on the poor and the sick, and it would reduce the amount of disruption that covered enrollees face under the ACA, as their eligibility for various programs changes over time.\n\nJost claims that single-payer health care is simpler than a market-based system. This comes as news to anyone who bills Medicare for health care services, let alone those who are tasked with managing and governing the program. It\u2019s telling that in September, Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected a referendum, 62 to 38 percent, that would have replaced their health care system with a single payer.\n\nComplexity is a necessary part of any health care system in a country as large and diverse as our own. But the nimbleness and flexibility needed to handle health care\u2019s complexity resides in the private sector.\n\nRefining The Plan\n\nAs noted above, we will continue to revise the Plan as constructive feedback comes in\u2014from both the left and the right. Roy is compiling an index of these revisions online. In that spirit, we welcome Jost\u2019s contribution to the debate about the future of health reform, and we will continue to strive to be worthy of it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/11/06/yes-we-can-transcend-obamacare/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Yes, We Can Transcend Obamacare"}, "description": "Yes, We Can Transcend Obamacare | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e5a\"", "article_summary": "Complexity is a necessary part of any health care system in a country as large and diverse as our own.\nNot only would this reduce the complexity of the U.S. health care system, but it would substantially improve its equity and efficiency.\nIt\u2019s telling that in September, Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected a referendum, 62 to 38 percent, that would have replaced their health care system with a single payer.\nThis comes as news to anyone who bills Medicare for health care services, let alone those who are tasked with managing and governing the program.\nJost writes that \u201cSwitzerland and Singapore are hardly libertarian health care utopias,\u201d as if Roy is not aware of that fact."}
