It is a “flagrant violation of the United Nations charter, which stipulates respect for the national sovereignty of states and non-interference in their domestic affairs,” the statement added.

“The international community and, in particular, the Security Council, should act to put an end to the adventures of the Turkish leadership, which represents a threat to world security and peace.”

ISIS fighters are pressing to capture the Kurdish town of Kobane, on Syria’s border with Turkey, and at least 186,000 people from there and surrounding villages have already fled across the border.

While Thursday’s measure did not spell out what action Turkey will take against ISIS, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said after the vote “we will do whatever we can so that Kobane does not fall.”
