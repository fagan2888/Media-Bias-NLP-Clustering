They're absolutely right. It is an obscene amount of money,\" Clooney said in excerpts released on Saturday. The interview will air on Sunday.\n\nBernie Sanders, a U.S. Senator from Vermont and Clinton's rival in the race for the Democratic nomination to run for the White House in the Nov. 8 election, has pounced on former secretary of state Clinton over the big-ticket event and for accepting large sums of money for her campaign.\n\n\"The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right. It's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics. I agree completely,\" Clooney said.\n\nIn response to the dinner, the Sanders campaign on Friday evening sent out an email to supporters asking them to help reach their fundraising goals by chipping in $3.53 apiece, instead.\n\n(Reporting by Alana Wise; editing by Grant McCool)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Actor and director George Clooney, a supporter of Hillary Clint", "title": "Clinton backer George Clooney condemns 'obscene' sums in White House race", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/16/Clinton-backer-George-Clooney-condemns-obscene-sums-White-House-race", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/16/Clinton-backer-George-Clooney-condemns-obscene-sums-White-House-race", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Actor and director George Clooney, a supporter of Hillary Clint", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe144a\"", "article_summary": "It is an obscene amount of money,\" Clooney said in excerpts released on Saturday.\n\"We had some protesters last night when we pulled up in San Francisco and they're right to protest.\nIn response to the dinner, the Sanders campaign on Friday evening sent out an email to supporters asking them to help reach their fundraising goals by chipping in $3.53 apiece, instead.\n\"The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right.\nThey're absolutely right."}
