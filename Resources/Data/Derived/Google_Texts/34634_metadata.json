The way that we\u2019re going to change Washington is to bring more people to recognize \u2013 to have the humility to recognize \u2013 that there are good ideas on both sides of the aisle\u2026 \u201cI will vote for the Democratic leader that I think best represents our capacity to get things done and move things forward. \u2026\u201d\n\nDuring a rowdy Republican primary, Perdue was a prominent vote of no confidence for Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and his future bid to lead Senate Republicans. But Nunn argued that, immediately after the July 20 primary runoff, Perdue went to Washington, met with McConnell and \u201cpledged to be a good team player.\u201d (The source for said observation: Sen. Saxby Chambliss, who was in the meeting.)\n\nSaid Nunn: \u201cThe only team I\u2019m playing for here is Georgia.\u201d\n\nThe Reid issue is an ideological benchmark on the Republican side. The only sharp attack that Perdue leveled at Nunn on Thursday (without any mention of her name) was this:\n\n\u201cThis race is very simple. If you like what\u2019s going on in Washington, then vote for my opponent. Because you know she\u2019ll be nothing more than a proxy for Harry Reid and Barrack Obama. And nothing will change.\u201d\n\nBut in the case of Reid and McConnell, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Georgia\u2019s rookie senator would not necessarily have a choice \u2014 there are no expected challenges to the leaders\u2019 perches.\n\nOther notes:\n\n\u2014 Both candidates had carefully prepared opening remarks. This was the heart of Perdue\u2019s introduction:\n\n\u201cIf you look at the debt that we have today, $18 trillion almost. But that\u2019s not the worst of it. What we\u2019re not talking about is another $86 trillion coming at us in future unfunded liability. The total is over $100 trillion. That\u2019s $1 million for every household in our country. It\u2019s the greatest threat to our national security and our very way of life.\u201d\n\nBut Perdue never mentioned the name of Chambliss, who just a year earlier stood on the same stage and accepted the Chamber\u2019s applause for his bipartisan approach to federal debt reduction \u2014 a fact that was left for Nunn to point out later in the proceedings.\n\nThe format of the event was such that candidates could determine for themselves how lively the event would be. For her part, Nunn quickly served notice that she would be on the attack \u2014 with this segue that took her from a volunteer-oriented biography to a shot at Perdue\u2019s temperament, and that of Washington:\n\n\u201cLike you, I\u2019ve sat through lots of business meetings and church meetings and PTA meetings, and people don\u2019t always get along. And y\u2019all know that. But I\u2019ll tell you, they keep at it. They don\u2019t walk out. They don\u2019t shut down. They keep going, and they solve real problems.\u201d\n\n\u2014 In a discussion of military spending and the protection of Georgia bases, Perdue waxed downright poetic:\n\n\u201cDuring the Cuban missile crisis, I was riding my bike after football practice, and listening and watching. About every four or five minutes, a KC-135 tanker or a B-52 took off, going to do the racetrack route around Cuba.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s always important to find that first good line for your autobiography. Nunn, meanwhile, used the opportunity to make her sole reference to her dad:\n\n\u201cNot to brag, but there was never a base closure during his 24 years in the Senate. And that\u2019s not a coincidence.\u201d\n\nBut Nunn then took a more serious turn, which her campaign spinners would later highlight:\n\n\u201cThe government shutdown, which David said that he was for, furloughed 4,000 folks here at Robins. So we need to work together to preserve and protect our military bases and, in a broader sense, our military capacity as a nation.\u201d\n\nModerator John Pruitt, the former Channel 2 Action News anchor, offered Perdue time for a rebuttal. Perdue said none was necessary:\n\n\u201cI think that speaks for itself. The situation we had in Washington was over Obamacare. What I was saying was that we cannot default on our interest payments. This was one of the things that was sacrosanct.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Lost in the chatter of the Perdue-Nunn meeting was the fact that the Georgia Chamber on Thursday essentially endorsed Republican incumbent Nathan Deal in the race for governor. The fact of the endorsement was no surprise, but the timing was. Jason Carter was not in the house, but it\u2019s hard to say whether his presence would have mitigated this glowing introduction from Ernest Greer, vice president of the Chamber:\n\n\u201cWe Georgians love people who exude hard work and industry. And for what this governor has done for this state, in bringing focus to what we are doing as a community and as a state, and our cities \u2013 we owe it to our governor that he spends another four years in office.\u201d\n\nDeal never mentioned Carter name, but did reference his Democratic opponent\u2019s criticism that the state Department of Economic Development had become a shelter for political appointees. Said Deal:\n\n\u201cDespite what some would say, these are professionals. They don\u2019t just go to ribbon-cuttings. They work extremely hard to make the ribbon-cuttings possible.\u201d\n\n***\n\nBookmark this page: Our crack web staff is compiling polling, fundraising and race projections for the Senate and governor\u2019s races here.\n\n***\n\nHere\u2019s the ad you\u2019ll be seeing a lot of in the Atlanta area for the next couple weeks: Emily\u2019s List attacking David Perdue for a gender discrimination lawsuit against Dollar General. It\u2019s got a cool $1 million behind it.\n\n***\n\nPentagon brass on Thursday seemed to nudge President Barack Obama toward widening the mission in Iraq after the beheading of American journalist James Foley. From the Washington Post:\n\nIslamic State cannot be defeated without addressing \u201cboth sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border\u201d between Iraq and Syria, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Thursday. \u2026\n\nA senior Defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity following the news conference, said that no decision has been made to expand airstrikes into Syria, and the White House has not requested any new military options.\n\nGeorgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee and most certainly a hawk, then went on CNN to lay out the ISIL threat in dark terms:\n\n\u201cThis is not going to stop in Baghdad if we don\u2019t stop ISIL now. This is going to continue on to American soil eventually. The time to stop it is now. The place to stop it is on the ground in Iraq.\u201d\n\nChambliss believes his prescription for wider airstrikes \u2014 no U.S. boots on the ground, still \u2014 can be done without a new war authorization from Congress, which would be hard to come by:\n\n\u201cThe president has the authority under the Constitution to defend Americans. And we have Americans on the ground in Iraq who are threatened by ISIL. I think he can probably take as much action as he thought necessary to protect those Americans that are on the ground. But I will tell you also I would look forward to a debate in the U.S. Senate on this issue.\u201d\n\nOn WABE-FM 90.1, Chambliss spoke with Denis O\u2019Hayer on ISIL and also war materiel going to local police departments. He took a similar position to Obama, that the policy needs a review:\n\n\u201cI think if we are going to give it to \u2019em then it just makes sense that they\u2019ve got to be trained. That\u2019s pretty sophisticated equipment. It\u2019s MRAPs and other vehicles are not the run-of-the-mill type of vehicles that are used in any type of police activity. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s too easy to access it, but I do think that we definitely need to review the policy and we need to make sure that if local law enforcement are going to receive the equipment, they get the training.\u201d\n\nChambliss said the National Guard could provide this training, and he did not think Congress should pass Rep. Hank Johnson\u2019s bill to limit the equipment transfers. Or any bill:\n\n\u201cCongress tends to sort of mess things up when we get involved in the weeds and in the details of something like that. And I don\u2019t mean to be dodging it, but I just think the right kind of relationship between the Department of Defense, the National Guard and local law enforcement agencies can solve this problem.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWe noted this week that Democrat Jason Carter\u2019s campaign committee was missing any close allies of Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who has been fairly cool to a Carter candidacy. Reed spokeswoman Melissa Mullinax reiterated to our AJC colleague Katie Leslie that Reed is all about Michelle Nunn this year \u2014 but those efforts will help Carter by extension:\n\n\u201cSenator Carter\u2019s campaign committee is a solid list of Democrats from across the state and the Mayor wishes them well. The Mayor is focused on running the capital city of the state and delivering concrete results for the people of Atlanta. Mayor Reed did not seek, nor was he asked, to participate on Senator Carter\u2019s campaign committee. But reporters like to dabble in political intrigue, so some may continue their efforts to create drama where none exists. \u201cThe Mayor has said since January that his focus this year would be on helping Michelle Nunn win the open Senate seat, which he thinks is essential for Democrats to maintain their majority in the United States Senate. And I think you\u2019ll see that anything Mayor Reed does for Michelle will accrue to the benefit of the statewide ticket. \u201cThe path to victory for any statewide Democrat requires an intensive, ground campaign focused on registering, communicating with and turning out 600,000 to 900,000 new minority voters.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee sees John Barrow\u2019s dog and raises him \u2026 a monkey.\n\nIts new ad features a female narrator with a monkey on her shoulder, discussing an oft-lampooned use of federal money: a study on the effects of cocaine on monkeys. It came from the 2009 stimulus law, which was also the year when the ad points out Barrow voted 85 percent of the time for Obama-endorsed bills.\n\nAs factcheck.org noted the other day, Barrow\u2019s support for Obama\u2019s position has since plummeted. It was 29.5 percent in 2012 and 35 percent in 2013. Politifact tackled the monkey issue in 2012, ruling that the study was not in the stimulus bill itself, though NIH used some of the pot of scientific research funds for it as a way to test drug addiction without using human subjects.\n\n***\n\nWe told you Thursday about the AFL-CIO\u2019s election endorsements, pointing out that all of its favored candidates were Democrats. This came from an initial news release of statewide offices and U.S. House candidates, but this morning the union coalition revised and extended its remarks, putting out a full list that included state legislative races \u2014 and a couple of Republicans.\n\nState Sen. Josh McKoon, R-Columbus, who has an opponent; and state Rep. Bill Hitchens, R-Rincon, who does not, are Georgia AFL-CIO approved this fall.\n\n***\n\nYour fun 2016 read of the day via the Washington Post: Rand Paul goes to Guatemala to do eye surgeries, followed by reporters, cameras and a bodyguard named Axel.
