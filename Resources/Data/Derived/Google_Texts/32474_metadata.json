So as part of the Affordable Care Act, the Oregon health system is paying to have teachers play a game called The Good Behavior Game in poorer schools \u2014 even though on the surface it has nothing to do with health.\n\nThe hope is that kindergarteners who play the game today won\u2019t start smoking and taking drugs when they get to high school \u2014 and hence save the health system millions of dollars.\n\nTeacher Cami Railey sits at a kidney-shaped table, surrounded by four kids at Danebo Elementary in Eugene.\n\nShe\u2019s about to teach them the \u201cSssss\u201d sound and the \u201cAaaa\u201d sound.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil\n\nBut first \u2014 as she does every day \u2014 she goes over the rules of the Good Behavior Game.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to earn your stars today by sitting in the learning position. That means your bottom is on the bottom of your seat, backs on the back of your seat. Excellent job, just like that. Jaden, can you skooch your chair in just a little bit?\u201d Railey asks.\n\nThe Good Behavior Game runs in the background of the class \u2014 think of it like background music.\n\nSo, for exhibiting good learning behavior, like sitting quietly; keeping their eyes on the teacher; and working hard, the kids get a star and some stickers.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil\n\nAnd for negative behavior, like being disrespectful or daydreaming, they get frowny faces.\n\n\u201cRaise your hand if you can tell me what happens if we get four frownies. What happens?\u201d Railey asks.\n\n\u201cWe lose the game,\u201d Kelina Kearney responds.\n\n\u201cWe lose the game if we get four frownies. Are we going to get four frownies?\u201d\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil/OPB\n\nKindergartener Kelina Kearny shakes her head.\n\nOnce the rules are introduced, Railey can start the lesson in earnest. \u201cGet ready sound: sssss. Yessss. Again. Get ready sound \u2026. \u201c\n\nRailey has used the technique for years.\n\n\u201cSo The Good Behavior Game is not a curriculum, but it\u2019s a tool that teachers use while they\u2019re teaching a curriculum. And the purpose of the Good Behavior Game is to help keep kids on task and focused and it\u2019s to encourage students to make positive behavior choices and to increase their academic and social success in the classroom.\u201d\n\nAnd Railey is not just hoping that it\u2019ll improve their success.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil\n\nThere\u2019s more than 20 years of research supporting the game\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nThe nonprofit, nonpartisan group Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy, found that by age 13, the game reduced the number of kids who started to smoke by 26 percent \u2014 and reduced the number of kids who started to take hard drugs by more than half.\n\nBy age 19, kids who had played the game were 21 percent more likely to graduate from high school.\n\n\u201cThe Good Behavior Game is more than just a game that you play in the classroom. It\u2019s actually been called a behavioral vaccine,\u201d says Jennifer Webster, disease prevention coordinator for Trillium Community Health Plan.\n\nThe fact that a kindergarten teacher in Eugene is using the Good Behavior Game isn\u2019t unusual.\n\nWhat\u2019s unusual is that one of Oregon\u2019s new Coordinated Care Organizations \u2014 the Trillium Community Health Plan \u2014 is setting aside nearly $900,000 a year to get teachers to play the game.\n\n\u201cI mean it teaches kids self control and delayed gratification. And these things have been shown to reduce substance abuse in the future. It reduces behavioral disorders almost immediately,\u201d Websters says.\n\nThe money will pay for teachers to play the game in 50 classrooms in Lane County. These are classrooms where at least 70 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced lunches.\n\n\u201cTrillium recognizes there is an intersection of health and education. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re not only looking at prevention as a way to control costs. We want these kids, when they grow up, to live longer and healthier lives and be productive members of the community. So it\u2019s an investment that has a financial component, but it also has a quality of life component,\u201d says Trillium spokeswoman, Debi Farr.\n\nThat financial component is not small.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority estimates that tobacco use cost Oregonians $2.4 billion dollars in 2009. That was for the medical treatment of sick smokers and the loss of productivity.\n\nPut another way, the state estimates each pack of cigarettes that someone smoked, cost Oregonians about $13.\n\nSo what does the Bethel School District think about working with the local health service?\n\nSuperintendent, Colt Gill says focusing on prevention is a fantastic idea.\n\n\u201cWe hear over and over again, would you rather spend \u2018x\u2019 number of dollars on a person who is in prison every day or would you rather spend a tenth of that cost on their education to prevent them from ever taking that road in life. And that\u2019s the path that we\u2019re trying to go down, that prevention road.\u201d\n\nSome have questioned having health organizations get involved in areas not traditionally related to health \u2014 like the classroom.\n\nBut Trillium prevention coordinator Jennifer Webster doesn\u2019t see the risk.\n\n\u201cThis is really what needs to be done. I mean, if we\u2019re really going to achieve the triple aim of reducing costs, and improving care and improving outcomes, what we really need to focus on is prevention. that\u2019s what going to really make the triple aim successful. So I actually don\u2019t see this as a risk at all,\u201d says Webster.\n\nBack in the classroom, I put the tough questions to kindergartener Kalina Kerney.\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil: \u201cDo you think kids like learning more when you play the Good Behavior Game?\u201d\n\nKelina Kearney: \u201cYes\u201d\n\nKristian Foden-Vencil: \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n\nKelina Kearney: \u201cBecause every time when we guess something, we get more and more stars.\u201d\n\nNot all the $900,000 Trillium is spending goes for the Good Behavior Game. Some of the money is earmarked to pay pregnant smokers to give up the habit.\n\nThere\u2019s also a plan to have kids try and buy cigarettes at local stores \u2014 then reward store owners who refuse to sell to them.\n\nTrillium estimates it spends about $1.33 per member, per month on such prevention efforts. The hope is that over time, these efforts will save money.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/series/vitalsigns/paying-for-kids-to-play-can-save-money-later/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/gwskw7nkkuqr1h9jazf3.jpg", "description": "As part of the Affordable Care Act, the Oregon health system is paying to have teachers play a game called", "title": "Paying For Kids To Play Can Save Money Later"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>As part of the Affordable Care Act, the Oregon health system is paying to have teachers play a game called \"The Good Behavior Game\" in poorer schools, even though on the surface it has nothing to do with health.</p>", "title": "'Good Behavior' More Than A Game To Health Care Plan", "image": {"src": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_348,q_90,w_620/gwskw7nkkuqr1h9jazf3.jpg"}, "creator": "@OPB", "site": "@OPB", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "org_id": "OPB", "fb": {"pages": 17790154938}, "google-site-verification": "KMaJ_LFRGDv_xknYuKImf3uF3H8gkUuIblN-HIVIjAM", "sniply-options": "block", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb95\"", "article_summary": "Kristian Foden-VencilBut first \u2014 as she does every day \u2014 she goes over the rules of the Good Behavior Game.\nThe Good Behavior Game runs in the background of the class \u2014 think of it like background music.\n\u201cThe Good Behavior Game is more than just a game that you play in the classroom.\nThe fact that a kindergarten teacher in Eugene is using the Good Behavior Game isn\u2019t unusual.\n\u201cSo The Good Behavior Game is not a curriculum, but it\u2019s a tool that teachers use while they\u2019re teaching a curriculum."}
