As I listen to the reactions from Planned Parenthood and its supporters (such as this piece from Cyndi Lauper), I\u2019ve been struck with the misleading propaganda that the abortion giant has been using to convince the American people of something that has actually not happened.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, while certainly not the only dissenting voice, has been the most vocal voice against the high court\u2019s decision. A glance at their Facebook page might have you believe that something unusual and tragic has happened. When, in fact, nothing has changed at all. Planned Parenthood asserted last week many false statements:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that in 2014 we\u2019re still fighting about women\u2019s access to basic health care like birth control.\u201d \u201cThis is about our health and our lives. This is about our fundamental right to have control over our own bodies. This is about justice \u2014 and we\u2019re fighting back.\u201d\n\nNow if that were true, we should be horrified, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s one thing to be upset with a ruling or a law; it\u2019s another to make up things to manipulate people. All of the reactions like this are actually just carefully planned rhetoric designed for emotional manipulation.\n\nThere is not one woman in this nation who has different rights than she had on June 29.\n\nOn the issue of health insurance, I find myself reeling at the comments. As a woman currently paying off hundreds of dollars of medical bills that I acquired with full employer-paid insurance coverage, I am sickened by the comments I hear.\n\nThis past year I dislodged a rib at the same time I had a continuing back problem. I had a few days I woke up barely able to move I had strained it so much. After medical visits, my doctor referred me to a physical therapist. I have a decent Blue Cross policy, but even that didn\u2019t help me. It turned out that I have to pay a full $1000 cash before it pays for anything beyond and office visit copay. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t get to see a physical therapist, and it\u2019s also why I am still paying for a pricey chest X-Ray from my bronchitis, as well as blood work and other basic health care needs.\n\nSee, it\u2019s called a deductible. And most people have one, regardless of their coverage. That\u2019s how the nation works, how insurance companies work. That\u2019s why my treatment dragged out for months when it could have been weeks. I paid, out of pocket, as much as an abortion costs to maintain my basic health while I listened to entitled people saying it is an injustice they don\u2019t have free birth control (including abortifacients) with no copay.\n\nBeing upset with decisions is one thing. I was quite upset my insurance was such that I couldn\u2019t get the care I needed without paying $1000. As a matter of fact, I have asthma and pay a copay for my monthly asthma medication, as well. Why is it that medicine that helps me breathe should cost me but birth control should not?\n\nThe fact is that there are many forms of birth control that show up on $4 prescription lists at places like Wal-Mart. It\u2019s not the fancy kind, I get it, but you know what? I can\u2019t get the fancy stuff. I have a $100 copay to get some patches I can put on that area of my back that troubles me. Those patches still sit at the pharmacy because it\u2019s just too much extra money. I did find one medication that worked. Blue Cross and my doctor\u2019s office fought for three months to get it approved because it was expensive. They wanted me to take a steroid first, to essentially make me swell up and get sicker because the proven medication with few side effects was expensive for them to cover.\n\nNone of my issues was life threatening, but you know who else can\u2019t get fancy medications sometimes? Poor people with cancer or lupus or other seriously threatening diseases.\n\nIt\u2019s arrogant and self-righteous to declare rights or choices have been taken away in this decision. No one\u2019s choice has been removed. No one\u2019s. Not even mine. I could have maxed out a credit card to get the medications and see the physical therapist This issue is not about women\u2019s health. My boobs not getting cancer would be about women\u2019s health. This isn\u2019t about basic health care. My breathing is about basic health care. This is about greed and selfish attitudes and a multi-million dollar organization, Planned Parenthood, who received over $540 million in its last reported year alone from government grants and funding, wanting more.\n\nIf people were actually fighting to get poor women cancer treatment and actual basic health care, we might have an issue. No one\u2019s choice has been taken away. No laws got changed. You still have a right to take an abortifacient. You have a right to kill your unborn child\u2014in most states up until full term. I hate those choices. I think they are wrong. But the fact remains, they are still every woman\u2019s choice. And that didn\u2019t change.\n\nThe other thing that hasn\u2019t changed is the mass of emails I get from Planned Parenthood, which now urge me to donate more money to \u201cjoin the dissent\u201d against this horrible injustice the Supreme Court has perpetuated on women. I hope even pro-choice women are smart enough to realize Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t need their money because of the Supreme Court decision.\n\nFind a place that funds real medical care for poor and needy women and put your donation there. But stop accusing the nation of taking away rights. No one is obligated to pay for anything for us. The American Dream is that if we work hard enough we can obtain it, not that if we demand it we get it free. That is actually the antithesis of being American. The birth control and abortion issue has now been reduced to \u201cyou owe it to me.\u201d That\u2019s the biggest lie of all.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "10 Like7 Tweet1 +12It\u2019s been a week since the Supreme Court released its decision on Hobby Lobby, and the rhetoric has fallen in ugly places.
