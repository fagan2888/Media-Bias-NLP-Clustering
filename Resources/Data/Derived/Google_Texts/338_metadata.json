Both U.S. Freeskiing and U.S. Snowboarding stacked rosters late Monday with four men and women on each of the halfpipe and slopestyle teams.\n\nTorin Yater-Wallace of Aspen got that call. The 18-year-old skier who suffered a collapsed lung during early December training and was unable to compete in the five Olympic qualifying finals since, was nominated to U.S. Freeskiing\u2019s first-ever Olympic halfpipe team. Yater-Wallace, who won the Olympic test event in Sochi last season, joins Nevada\u2019s David Wise, Crested Butte\u2019s Aaron Blunck and Boulder\u2019s Lyman Currier on the Colorado-deep pipe team.\n\nAnnalisa Drew, 20, of New Hampshire, also got the nod to compete in the ski halfpipe, joining Maddie Bowman, Brita Signourney and Angeli VanLaanen, who will ski in the Olympics after a lengthy battle with Lyme disease.\n\nPark City, Utah\u2019s Joss Christensen was tapped for the ski slopestyle team, joining Colorado skiers Bobby Brown and Gus Kenworthy as well as Indiana champion Nick Goepper.\n\nDarkhorse 16-year-old Julia Krass of New Hampshire earned a spot on the women\u2019s ski slopestyle team after a win at the final qualifying events in Park City last week. She joins Breckenridge\u2019s Keri Herman, Vermont\u2019s Devin Logan and Montana 15-year-old slopestyle phenom Maggie Voisin, who will likely be the youngest competitor in Sochi.\n\n\u201cEach of the freeskiing athletes added to our nominations brings the potential for success in Sochi,\u201d said Jeremy Forster, the director of freeskiing and snowboarding in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cThey each distinguished themselves during the Grand Prix qualifying series with some amazing performances, all the way through the last qualifying events this past weekend.\u201d\n\nU.S. Snowboarding had fewer discretionary positions open for the Olympic team. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s halfpipe team was filled following a three-event qualifying push at Mammoth Mountain last week.\n\nDefending Olympic halfpipe champion Shaun White joins Greg Bretz, Danny Davis and Steamboat Springs\u2019 rookie Taylor Gold on the Sochi squad. Kelly Clark, the winningest snowboarder ever hopes to extend her untouchable gold-medal streak at Sochi, leading Olympic veteran Hannah Teter and newcomers Kaitlyn Farrington and 17-year-old Steamboat Springs native Arielle Gold.\n\nWhite joins Sage Kotsenburg and Chas Guldemond on the first-ever U.S. Olympic snowboard slopestyle team. Although U.S. Snowboarding has yet to make a formal announcement, Alaska\u2019s Ryan Stassel, who won one of three contests at Mammoth, announced on his Facebook page late Monday that he had received that coveted call to join the U.S. Olympic slopestyle team.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Jamie Anderson, who dominates slopestyle, easily locked her Sochi position at Mammoth. She leads 16-year-old Vermont rookie Ty Walker, who mathematically secured her Sochi spot at Mammoth. While not formally announced, both Idaho\u2019s Jessika Jenson and California\u2019s Karly Shorr announced on their Facebook and Twitter pages late Monday that they would be joining U.S. Snowboarding\u2019s Olympic slopestyle team.\n\nCalifornia ski cross racer John Teller \u2013 who notched his third World Cup victory at France\u2019s Val Thorens ski area last week, the only World Cup ski cross wins ever by an American \u2013 will compete in the second-ever ski cross Olympic contest in Sochi. (Teller will likely be the only American competing in Sochi\u2019s ski cross.)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sochi Winter Olympics", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Olympics", "description": "U.S Freeskiing and U.S. Snowboarding\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds Olympic coaches enlist athletes who didn\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdt make the cut mathematically, but have strong shots at Olympic medals.", "title": "U.S. freeskiing, snowboarding teams stacked with Colorado athletes", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/2014/01/21/more-colorado-athletes-included-on-u-s-olympic-team-in-sochi/26107/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/files/2014/01/torin-yater-wallace-at-aspen-x-games-2013-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "U.S Freeskiing and U.S. Snowboarding\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds Olympic coaches enlist athletes who didn\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdt make the cut mathematically, but have strong shots at Olympic medals.", "title": "More Colorado athletes included on U.S. Olympic Team in Sochi", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/2014/01/21/more-colorado-athletes-included-on-u-s-olympic-team-in-sochi/26107/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/olympics/files/2014/01/torin-yater-wallace-at-aspen-x-games-2013-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@jasonblevins", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "U.S Freeskiing and U.S. Snowboarding\u2019s Olympic coaches enlist athletes who didn\u2019t make the cut mathematically, but have strong shots at Olympic medals."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2183\"", "article_summary": "Both U.S. Freeskiing and U.S. Snowboarding stacked rosters late Monday with four men and women on each of the halfpipe and slopestyle teams.\nPark City, Utah\u2019s Joss Christensen was tapped for the ski slopestyle team, joining Colorado skiers Bobby Brown and Gus Kenworthy as well as Indiana champion Nick Goepper.\nThe 18-year-old skier who suffered a collapsed lung during early December training and was unable to compete in the five Olympic qualifying finals since, was nominated to U.S. Freeskiing\u2019s first-ever Olympic halfpipe team.\nDefending Olympic halfpipe champion Shaun White joins Greg Bretz, Danny Davis and Steamboat Springs\u2019 rookie Taylor Gold on the Sochi squad.\nWhite joins Sage Kotsenburg and Chas Guldemond on the first-ever U.S. Olympic snowboard slopestyle team."}
