But the likelihood that she'll be voted into Saudi government is better than the likelihood that a woman in the United States will be elected to Congress. In terms of female representation in the highest legislative bodies around the world, the United States ranks a very meh seventy-first. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, we fall short not only of progressive countries like Sweden and Norway, but also of nations like Sudan, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"[We] are right behind Saudi Arabia,\" Director of the Electoral Integrity Project Pippa Norris confirmed at the Forum on Women in Politics in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. \"I should emphasize that.\" Her audience\u2014\"scholars, social scientists, political practitioners, and the public,\" who had assembled at the invitation of Federal Election Commission Chair Ann Ravel \"to consider why\u2026women remain significantly under-represented in politics at all levels of government,\" groaned.\n\nMost Popular\n\n\"The proportion of women in politics in America is average,\" Norris continued. \"It's a B+. We can do better.\"\n\nDebbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women in Politics (CAWP), delivered a harsher judgment: Thirty-seven women have served as governors in the United States, she said. The total number of women ever elected to the Senate is fewer than the number of men in the Senate right now. \"There is no level of elected office that has over 25 percent of the population being female,\" she said. \"Our numbers are pretty sad.\"\n\nTurning toward her fellow panelists, Walsh expressed a shared sentiment: \"Why aren't the numbers better?\"\n\nPresident of Bellwether Research and Burning Glass Consulting co-founder Christine Matthews was rueful, framing the complex problem in straightforward terms: \"Like a Facebook relationship status, it's complicated.\"\n\nWalsh agreed. Citing her research at CAWP, she explained that women are less often encouraged to run and do not seek elected office in the same numbers that men do.\n\n\"Our shorthand for that is that women run to do something and men run to be somebody.\" Share\n\nTweet\n\n\"When we ask women who serve in state legislatures and men who serve there as well [for] the number one reason that [they] ran for office the very first time, the men will tell us that they have a longstanding interest in politics and a career in politics. Women tell us it's because of a public-policy issue,\" Walsh said. \"Our shorthand for that is that women run to do something and men run to be somebody.\"\n\nGiven such motivations, determined women often do not seek public office, preferring to work toward reform from quieter offices. Walsh is frank: \"[I]f I want to solve a problem, and I'm looking at Congress, I may not say, 'Oh, well there's the place to go fix something that's broken.'\"\n\nHarvard professor and New Yorker writer Jill Lepore situated the issue in the broader realities of communal existence. Women today are ever more reluctant \"to be seen, to be exposed,\" she said. \"They don't want to expose themselves or their families to the kind of harassment that we all know women face whenever they say anything or write anything in the public sphere.\"\n\nInstead, they would rather invest in communities, volunteering and donating to those causes that matter. They choose to \"work around\" government. Walsh urged them to reconsider. It's only after women are \"on the inside\" and \"a voice that is part of the decision-making [process] about how resources are allocated\" that they can make real and important and necessary change.\n\nVictoria Budson, of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard University, was firm. We do not need women in elected office to look better on the global stage or to model democratic values or to be \"nice\" to what amounts to over half of our citizenship. We need them because representative governments just work better.\n\n\"When we don't have descriptive representation, we often get it wrong,\" Budson said. \"When the first draft of the Affordable Care Act was put forward in Congress, for example, it [did not include] mandatory coverage for mammograms or pap smears\u2014the two more regularized functions for adult women in the United States.\"\n\nBudson tried to be generous. \"I have no expectation that that was done on purpose,\" she said. But she maintained that it is impossible for good and great and empathetic men to legislate the existences of women\u2014even when the stakes are so high. \"We need a Congress that mirrors the experiences of the citizenry\u2014not just for equality, but for effectiveness.\"\n\nConcluding, Budson put out her call to arms: \"Hold your female friends accountable for their talent. When you have smart, competent women in your midst, which all of you do, ask them to run\u2014and say why.\"\n\nWe're counting on them.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/16/160x160/square-54ae8c90ddacd-elle-hillary-clinton-21cloo-h-elh.jpg", "description": "\"Like a Facebook relationship status, it's complicated.\" (And more insights from this week's Forum on Women in Politics.)", "title": "Why Don't More Women Run for Office?", "og": {"site_name": "ELLE", "description": "\"Like a Facebook relationship status, it's complicated.\" (And more insights from this week's Forum on Women in Politics.)", "title": "Why Don't More Women Run for Office?", "url": "http://www.elle.com/life-love/news/a28348/why-dont-women-run-for-office/", "image": {"url": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/02/54ae8c90ddacd_-_elle-hillary-clinton-21cloo-h-elh.jpg", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/02/54ae8c90ddacd_-_elle-hillary-clinton-21cloo-h-elh.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/02/54ae8c90ddacd_-_elle-hillary-clinton-21cloo-h-elh.jpg"}, "description": "\"Like a Facebook relationship status, it's complicated.\" (And more insights from this week's Forum on Women in Politics.)", "site": "@ElleMagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Don't More Women Run for Office?"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-13T15:45:00-04:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Why Don't More Women Run for Office?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1020430032, affiliate-data=pt=300297&ct=OnSiteELM&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "google-site-verification": "_9K14mnjQnY1H1YpyTiLdbU_MrfASP05oqmwHL_t3yw", "sailthru.tags": "Life & Love", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "section": "Life & Love", "published_time": "2015-05-13 07:45:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-13 21:39:38"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/16/768x384/landscape-54ae8c90ddacd-elle-hillary-clinton-21cloo-h-elh.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ccc\"", "article_summary": "\"Our shorthand for that is that women run to do something and men run to be somebody.\"\nGiven such motivations, determined women often do not seek public office, preferring to work toward reform from quieter offices.\n\"There is no level of elected office that has over 25 percent of the population being female,\" she said.\nCiting her research at CAWP, she explained that women are less often encouraged to run and do not seek elected office in the same numbers that men do.\nWe do not need women in elected office to look better on the global stage or to model democratic values or to be \"nice\" to what amounts to over half of our citizenship."}
