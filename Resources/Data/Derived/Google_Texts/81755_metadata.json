It may yet collapse on its own weight.\n\nI feel sorry for the younger generation (just out of college). They have less of a chance to get a good job with benefits. Many companies continue to downsize because of Obamacare.\n\nSo these young people get less work. But they\u2019ll have to pay more for health care, which they may never see \u2013 assuming they can register for it, which we now know is a huge assumption.\n\nLast week, one liberal blogger described how he had been all for Obamacare. He was one of the few ones (relatively speaking) who managed to get through the computer system and register online. Lo and behold, his insurance costs were going to go through the roof, as was the deductible. So he said, forget it. He even said he won\u2019t pay the fine, either. Well, good luck with that.\n\nIn PJ Media this week, Roger Simon writes, \u201cOver $1,500 a year for a $6,300-plus deductible? What healthy 30-year-old would waste his or her money?\u201d\n\nObamacare seems simple to understand in a sentence: You pay more, but you get less. Not to mention the loss of freedoms, the institution of a massive governmental bureaucracy and the potential annihilation of health care as we know it.\n\nAt the very least, fairness would demand that all the politicians have to live under it. It\u2019s grossly unfair to force the rest of us into a system that doesn\u2019t seem to work, while the elite class is exempt from it. For now, they\u2019re even exempting the big companies from it (for a year).\n\nAll of this reminds me of the classic anti-communist novel, \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d by the great British writer George Orwell (1903-1950). The short book is a parable of the Soviet Union.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not calling anyone a communist. But Dr. Paul Kengor, Grove City College professor, documents in his book \u201cThe Communist\u201d that Obama was mentored by Frank Marshall Davis, a member of the Communist Party USA (#47544). This is part of the public record.\n\nHere\u2019s a spoiler alert. In Orwell\u2019s novel, you will recall, the animals revolt against the tyrannical farmer (Mr. Jones, a human), who represents the czar. But then as the animals look forward to sharing everything equally, the pigs in charge ultimately live high off the hog, so to speak.\n\nAfter killing the farmer, the animals declare, \u201cRemove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished forever.\u201d\n\nThe animals post \u201cSeven Commandments\u201d \u2013 the final one stating, \u201cAll animals are equal.\u201d\n\nBut as the plot develops, it becomes clear that the pigs (representing Josef Stalin, Leon Trotsky and other Soviet leaders) have become an elite class.\n\nAt the end of the book, as the other animals \u2013 who do all the work and underfed \u2013 look into the farmhouse, they see the pigs enjoying a great meal. They can barely distinguish the pigs from the humans, whose regime they had rebelled against.\n\nThe Seven Commandments had been changed to just two: \u201cALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS.\u201d\n\nToday, we seem to have an elitist class and the \u201choi polloi\u201d \u2013 the rest of us. As long as Obamacare is implemented as the law of the land, then it ought to apply to the president, his family, his staff, the senators and members of the House of Representatives and their staff. The law (and tax) should be good enough for the Supreme Court and their staff.\n\nI\u2019ve heard some congressmen complain that their staff members can\u2019t afford it. Well, what about the rest of us?\n\nIn an earlier draft, I wrote only the Amish should be exempt, since they don\u2019t take part in the medical system. But on second thought: We all should be exempted!\n\nMeanwhile, the Bible says differing standards are unfair and unjust: \u201cDiffering weights and differing measures \u2013 the Lord detests them both\u201d (Prov. 20:10). Psalm 94 criticizes \u201cthose who frame injustice by statute.\u201d Paul strongly criticizes Peter in Galatians 2:14 for forcing a standard on the Gentiles that he himself was not living by.\n\nOur nation\u2019s birth certificate declares that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d Are we to assume that under Obamacare, some are created more equal than others?", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2013/10/obamacare-and-animal-farm/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Now that we\u2019ve had just a few weeks of the mess that is Obamacare, it brings home how grossly unfair it is for the political class to impose it on the rest of us and not have to abide by it (for as long as it lasts).
