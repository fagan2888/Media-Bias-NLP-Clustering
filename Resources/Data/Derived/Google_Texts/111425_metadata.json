The partnership is supported by a grant from Higher Education for Development, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\n\u201cThe Ebola crisis is a perfect example of why this project is so important,\u201d said Michael Reece, associate dean of the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington and IU\u2019s coordinator of the public health component of the project. \u201cIt\u2019s a textbook example of the value of IU\u2019s global emphasis and leadership.\u201d\n\nMore than 1,300 people have contracted the Ebola virus in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone since the outbreak began in March, and more than half of them have died. There is no vaccine or cure for Ebola, and past outbreaks have been fatal in 60 percent or more of cases.\n\nThe World Health Organization warned today that the outbreak could spread further. The Peace Corps and nongovernmental organizations withdrew volunteers and staff from the region. Liberia closed schools and most hospitals, and President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said areas could be quarantined.\n\nThe infection spreads through contact with bodily fluids, with health care workers often at high risk. U.S. medical missionaries Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who contracted the illness in Liberia, were being flown to Atlanta for treatment. Brantly is an IU School of Medicine graduate.\n\nWith IU\u2019s support, the Center for Excellence in Health and Life Sciences trained selected community workers in a Certificate in Public Health program through a partnership with Liberia\u2019s Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. The initiative has also provided advanced education for leaders in Liberia\u2019s nursing profession and upgraded curriculum, equipment and textbooks for medical education.\n\nWith the Ebola outbreak, the public health students have become \u201ctrainers of trainers\u201d and served as a bridge between health care facilities and local communities. Others involved with the IU project have dived into basic public health duties, such as sharing information about how Ebola is spread and systematically tracing the contacts of people who have contracted or been exposed to the virus.\n\nBut the efforts face challenges as a result of Liberia\u2019s underdeveloped transportation and communications systems, which were left weakened by many years of civil war.\n\n\u201cThe feedback from people on the ground is that there has been a real challenge in getting access to everything from medical supplies to diagnostic tests to basic things like latex gloves,\u201d Reece said.\n\nAmos Sawyer, a faculty member at IU\u2019s Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, chairs the Governance Commission of the Liberian government and was in the country two weeks ago.\n\nHe said Liberia is a small country, with only about 3.6 million people, and the impact of Ebola is impossible to overstate. \u201cJust about everybody in the country would have known, or known of, somebody who\u2019s been stricken with the virus,\u201d he said.\n\nSawyer said the crisis has cast a harsh light on the country\u2019s lack of public health capacity. \u201cClearly Liberia needs many more health professionals in the area of preventive care,\u201d he said. \u201cThe work that Indiana University is doing is very, very important.\u201d\n\nReece said a valuable lesson from the experience \u2013 and a focal point of the IU collaboration \u2014 is that Liberia desperately needs stronger academic institutions that can provide training for doctors, nurses, educators and it needs public health professionals who can take the lead in responding to a crisis.\n\n\u201cIf we want these approaches to be sustained, our belief is that we really need to help them train their own people,\u201d he said.\n\nRead about Tiawanlyn Gongloe, a graduate of Indiana University and its School of Public Health-Bloomington who is working on Ebola education and contact tracing in Liberia, on the IU Health & Vitality Viewpoints blog.\n\nTags: Ebola, Liberia, public health\n\n", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f29\"", "article_summary": "Tags: Ebola, Liberia, public health\nWith the Ebola outbreak, the public health students have become \u201ctrainers of trainers\u201d and served as a bridge between health care facilities and local communities.\nSawyer said the crisis has cast a harsh light on the country\u2019s lack of public health capacity.\nWith IU\u2019s support, the Center for Excellence in Health and Life Sciences trained selected community workers in a Certificate in Public Health program through a partnership with Liberia\u2019s Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.\nThe partnership brings together Indiana University with the University of Massachusetts Medical School, the University of Liberia, and the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts in Liberia."}
