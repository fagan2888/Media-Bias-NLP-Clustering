Most New Yorkers consider his police career to be praiseworthy, in spite of the justifiable anger in minority communities over his stop-and-frisk policy. Since we haven\u2019t had another terrorist attack, Kelly can claim credit for his counterterrorism efforts. Surely, he knows no one is indispensable. Our nation survived the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln, JFK and Martin Luther King Jr. New York City will survive the end of the Bloomberg-Kelly regime. Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio has said he will not get rid of stop-and-frisk, but end abuses that Kelly not only permitted, but actually encouraged. What really annoys me and many others is the argument, repeated ad nauseam by Kelly and Bloomberg, that the current stop-and-frisk strategy saved lives. The ends don\u2019t justify the means if constitutional rights are being violated. Michael J. Gorman , NYPD retired\n\nReady for his closeup\n\nManhattan: I have not been a Ray Kelly fan since he put our lower Manhattan neighborhood under lockdown after 2001. As your article demonstrates, the police commissioner has never found a microphone or interviewer he didn\u2019t embrace \u2014 in this case, Playboy magazine. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t demand to be the centerfold. I, for one, welcome his departure \u2014 and that of the soda king known as Mike Bloomberg. John Ost\n\nSick of Rudy\n\nCollege Point: Re \u201cRudy: I\u2019ll push frisk appeal\u201d (Nov. 15): Let\u2019s not forget that Rudy Giuliani\u2019s approval ratings on Sept. 10, 2001, were his lowest since becoming mayor. It was truly disgusting to see him desperately jump on the coattails of President George W. Bush and the tragedy of 9/11. And to recall his failed effort to bully his way into a third term, then to see him make money milking the 9/11 lecture circuit, turns my stomach. This disgraceful man\u2019s political opinions should not be relevant in anybody\u2019s world, let alone to the Daily News. Richard Thomas\n\nSeconding the nomination\n\nLong Beach, L.I.: I am responding to the article about Kathleen Cashin (\u201cMayor Bill, here\u2019s your chancellor,\u201d Op-Ed, Nov. 13). As a student at Brooklyn College 22 years ago, I had the good fortune of having Dr. Cashin as my instructor. She had the reputation of running a tight but fair ship, and I found her to be someone to look up to. When the going got tough for me, she was the reason I forged on. I admired her strength and sense of righteousness. She told us that when it came to the children, she would do what was necessary to provide them with the best education. I only hope Bill de Blasio selects her as chancellor. New York would be lucky to have someone with her skills and determination heading the public school system. Beverlee Bertinetti\n\nNot on my dime\n\nManhattan: To the ignorant people who say Bill de Blasio should live in Gracie Mansion because it\u2019s \u201ctradition\u201d: Put up or shut up. I can\u2019t afford my own rent, so why would I pay the rent for a guy earning $225,000 a year? That\u2019s beyond obscene. Put it on the ballot next November and let the people decide the issue. Otherwise, de Blasio will prove he is the new Bloombucks \u2014 an out-of-touch emperor who lives large off the little people. Janice Amato\n\nCrime pays\n\nBellerose: I do not believe that Eva Rosenbluh is going to pay back what she stole from the Social Security system (\u201cScam granny goes free,\u201d Nov. 15). I would bet anything that she will stall and stall. And how come there was no penalty attached to the plea agreement? Sounds like a pretty good deal. Sell your house at a profit, move to Florida. I bet that will catch on. Paul Dellacona\n\nSelling snake oil\n\nBronx: The President danced a pretty good jig at his latest news conference, but if he were seriously concerned about the financial and health future of Americans, he\u2019d trash his signature piece of legislation. All his news conference did was set up insurance companies to take the blame for a disaster that should never have become law. Patricia O\u2019Hanlon\n\nMoving the goal posts\n\nStaten Island: President Obama admits that he was wrong when he said, \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance, period\u201d (\u201cObama\u2019s sorry story,\u201d editorial, Nov. 15). So far, approximately 5 million have lost their insurance. So what does he say to them? He tells them that they can keep their insurance through 2014 \u2014 a time frame that coincides with the 2014 elections. How convenient. Martin T. Reda\n\nTapped out\n\nGlendale: Mr. President, our hearts go out to the people in the Philippines. But how can you go on TV and ask us to send donations via the White House when we cannot afford your Obamacare? Debbie McBride\n\nJust say no\n\nPutnam Valley, N.Y.: To Voicer Donna Farrington: My husband and I couldn\u2019t agree with you more. With Hil comes Bill \u2014 God forbid. I am of the opinion that Hillary Clinton as President would be a threat to our national security. I will never forget her arrogance when, during testimony on Benghazi, she told Congress, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d She will be a continuation of President Obama\u2019s socialist policies and the downward spiral of our wonderful country. I hope voters will remember the Benghazi four and let her know that her ilk is not wanted. Anne Cioffi\n\nCheap shots\n\nEdison, N.J.: Voicer Nancy Kennedy is 100% correct regarding the recent writings of Stanley Crouch and the insults he has thrown at Gov. Chris Christie. Crouch also called Bill O\u2019Reilly a half-liar, based on no facts. Can you imagine Crouch on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program? He\u2019d be laughed off the show. Crouch is an educated idiot. Morris R. Resner\n\nTalking turkey\n\nBrooklyn: To Voicer Michele Dempsey: I agree totally. It is a shame what the retailers are doing to Thanksgiving. It\u2019s nice to save money, but not at the expense of ruining an all-American holiday. Everyone should boycott all stores on Thanksgiving Day. It\u2019s a day for being with our families and friends and for giving thanks for what we have. Let the craziness start on Black Friday. Leave Thanksgiving alone. Maria Soberanis\n\nThe war on Thanksgiving\n\nOakland Gardens: I totally agree with Voicer Michele Dempsey about retail stores that are open on Thanksgiving night, taking workers away from their families on a family holiday. It\u2019s bad enough when they have to get to work at 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. Kmart is even worse. It will open all day on Thanksgiving, for a total of 41 straight hours, leaving its workers no time at all to spend with their families. Then we wonder why there\u2019s no family spirit anymore? Julia M. Maley\n\nFire facts\n\nBroad Channel: Voicer Stephanie Ortiz, you have been misled. If you truly believe that only white firefighters get assigned to the busier firehouses, you should make an official visit request to my busy firehouse in Crown Heights. I can introduce you to quite a few minority firefighters. Most of them are good men, and people who share your opinion degrade what they have accomplished. Eric Mundy\n\nEnough about Roberts\n\nBrooklyn: Am I the only one who finds Robin Roberts\u2019 perpetual boasting that she beat breast cancer a bit over the top and self-aggrandizing (\u201cCancer test shocker for ABC reporter,\u201d Nov. 11)? As a man who\u2019s had breast cancer, I think she should bring to light the fact that men can develop it, too \u2014 but I have yet to hear that from her. There are other people \u2014 celebrities and ordinary citizens \u2014 dealing with breast cancer and beating it. Roberts, who\u2019s probably very well off, got the best medical treatment. Let\u2019s see someone who has really been in the trenches, financially and medically, as a spokesperson for breast cancer. Dennis Pascale\n\nNot fit to print\n\nWhitestone: Re \u201cA-Rod\u2019s ladies room romp\u201d (Nov. 13): Needless to say, that day\u2019s paper went straight into the garbage. The Daily News\u2019 job should be to educate us on newsworthy stories, not gossip. Perhaps the time has come to look for a new morning paper, or perhaps just tune to the TV news.
