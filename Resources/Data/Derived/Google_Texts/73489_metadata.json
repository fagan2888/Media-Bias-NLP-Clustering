But others weren\u2019t as fortunate.\n\nDan Krofta, 49, and Joshua Langley, 44, wore torn and bloodied military fatigues as they shuffled and groaned in the zombie parade.\n\n\u201cWe used to be zombie warriors, and we kind of got taken over,\u201d Langley said.\n\nThe two once dressed as the good guys, but now they like being zombies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a blast scaring the crap out of people,\u201d Krofta said.\n\nJared Greenfield, a 22-year-old from Littleton who dressed in military fatigues, disagreed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy if you came as a zombie,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who want to survive come as survivors to practice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver\u2019s Zombie Crawl brings the undead to life", "title": "Denver\u2019s Zombie Crawl brings the undead to life", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/17/denvers-zombie-crawl-brings-the-undead-to-life/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__BN20151017_Z00_BNCD18ZOMBIECRAWLp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151017__BN20151017_Z00_BNCD18ZOMBIECRAWLp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-17T19:08:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T08:34:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The zombie-slaying duo found themselves outnumbered and surrounded by thousands of the walking dead Saturday at the 10th annual Zombie Crawl on the 16th Street Mall.\nThe 14-year-old from Lakewood dressed as a survivor of the zombie apocalypse, as marked by the duct-taped \u201cX\u201d on his shirt and pants.\nDan Krofta, 49, and Joshua Langley, 44, wore torn and bloodied military fatigues as they shuffled and groaned in the zombie parade.\nXannon Zito, dressed in camouflage and armed with a plastic toy gun, didn\u2019t hesitate when the mob of moaning, blood-thirsty zombies approached his position in downtown Denver.\nHe held a toy gun and carried extra tape in case he needed to help treat any survivors who were attacked."}
