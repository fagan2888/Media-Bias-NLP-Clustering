After all, the group has, according to BuzzFeed, distributed food to Hispanic parishioners in need at a San Antonio church.\n\nBut for all the LIBRE Initiative gives, there is also a price and they call that \u201cloyalty.\u201d\n\n[moko_youtube src=\u201dwuQnKoSayoQ\u201d]\n\nBefore Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, savvy conservatives identified a gap they could exploit. They could build goodwill with Latinos frustrated with the Obama administration, assisting them with smaller issues such as driver\u2019s licenses and tax preparation, while promoting the Koch agenda.\n\nMake no mistake. The end goal of the LIBRE Initiative is to disenfranchise Latino voters and to turn them against other Latinos on the issues that matter to them.\n\nThe LIBRE Initiative bills itself as bipartisan, but in fact they support conservative policies that hurt Latinos. They oppose the Affordable Care Act, which offers guaranteed access to HPV testing and mammograms for Latinas.\n\nThey also claim to be for immigration reform, but LIBRE Initiative director Daniel Garza called Obama\u2019s executive action \u201cpandering\u201d and \u201cdangerous,\u201d and he opposes DAPA, a program that extends protections to the families of DREAMers.\n\nThe Associated Press sums up the LIBRE Initiative thusly:\n\n\u201cIts organizers pitch conservative ideals while offering tutorials on U.S. immigration law, support for overhauling the broken immigration system that stops short of campaigning for the Senate\u2019s bipartisan bill and collecting donations for the unaccompanied children crossing the United States-Mexico border illegally. In effect, it is a shadow GOP \u2014 one with a gentle emphasis on social services and assimilation.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the long and short of it: The LIBRE Initiative\u2019s strategy is to provide short-term solutions for the problems conservative policies created in the first place so that they might win over Latino voters.\n\nAnd to that we Latinos must say, \u201cNo gracias.\u201d\n\nH/T: Associated Press, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Media Matters", "article_metadata": {"description": "What would you think if I told you the Koch brothers were funding a \u201cgrassroots\u201d group founded to \u201cempower Hispanics\u201d and advance \u201cfreedom and prosperity?\u201d", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "What would you think if I told you the Koch brothers were funding a \u201cgrassroots\u201d group founded to \u201cempower Hispanics\u201d and advance \u201cfreedom and prosperity?\u201d", "title": "Koch Brothers\u2019 LIBRE Initiative Tries To Buy Latino Support At Latinos\u2019 Expense", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Koch.jpg", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/koch-brothers-libre-initiative-tries-to-buy-latino-support-at-latinos-expense/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "What would you think if I told you the Koch brothers were funding a \u201cgrassroots\u201d group founded to \u201cempower Hispanics\u201d and advance \u201cfreedom and prosperity?\u201d", "title": "Koch Brothers\u2019 LIBRE Initiative Tries To Buy Latino Support At Latinos\u2019 Expense", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Koch.jpg"}, "creator": "@jpbrammer", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "affordable care act,conservative,DREAM act,dreamers,gop,healthcare,immigration,koch,libre initiative,Mexican,obama,obamacare,republicans", "published_time": "2015-06-03T08:47:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1129\"", "article_summary": "The LIBRE Initiative bills itself as bipartisan, but in fact they support conservative policies that hurt Latinos.\nPerhaps there are some who could look at the LIBRE Initiative, a group backed by Koch bucks, and take it at face value.\nThe end goal of the LIBRE Initiative is to disenfranchise Latino voters and to turn them against other Latinos on the issues that matter to them.\nBut for all the LIBRE Initiative gives, there is also a price and they call that \u201cloyalty.\u201d[moko_youtube src=\u201dwuQnKoSayoQ\u201d]Before Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, savvy conservatives identified a gap they could exploit.\nAnd to that we Latinos must say, \u201cNo gracias.\u201dH/T: Associated Press, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Media Matters"}
