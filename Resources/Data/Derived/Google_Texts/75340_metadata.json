Is Baffled", "article_keywords": ["baffled", "born", "yakima", "mothers", "washington", "defect", "times", "dept", "likely", "health", "babies", "baby", "anencephaly", "typically", "tube"], "article_url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/anencephaly-4-times-more-likely-babies-born-washington-health-dept-baffled-282492", "article_text": "Though a mother\u2019s love for her child is always unconditional, it doesn\u2019t stop her from worrying that her baby will be born with a defect \u2014 the aftermath of discovering that is not only fearsome but can be difficult, too. Yet a spate of births in Washington has left mothers and health care providers baffled, as far too many babies have been born with anencephaly, a rare and deadly defect.\n\nSince 2010, 30 babies have been born with the defect in which parts of their brains and skulls were missing, NBC News reported. The defects have occurred in Benton, Yakima, and Franklin Counties, where rates have been four times higher than those of the nation as a whole. The complication is considered a neural tube defect, and typically occurs within the first month of pregnancy.\n\nFor this reason, many mothers, including 23-year-old Jocelyn Robles, already know that their baby will be born this way. Her baby will also die moments after birth. \u201cI\u2019d rather go through with it and cherish whatever time I have,\u201d she told KOMO News. \u201cEven if it\u2019s an hour, a few minutes. Anything is better than nothing. And I\u2019m going to see my baby, at least for a little bit.\u201d\n\nRobles was among other moms and concerned community members at a public hearing, where they were able to ask the state\u2019s Health Department about the defective births. They inquired about everything from nitrates in the water supply to prevalence among Hispanic women, and folic acid intake to location of the cases. Yet the Health Department was mostly unable to answer them. \u201cWe would love to find a smoking gun, and have things align; if you find a cause, you can prevent. If you can\u2019t find a cause, you can\u2019t prevent,\u201d said Dr. Juliet VanEenwyk, the state epidemiologist who moderated the forum, the Yakima Herald-Republic reported.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anencephaly typically occurs in one of every 4,859 babies. When the neural tube fails to close during fetal development, the baby\u2019s exposed brain and skull are left vulnerable to fluid in the amniotic sack, which subsequently breaks down nervous system tissue. Thus, large parts of the cerebellum, and the back of the cerebrum, are missing. Still-births are common among babies with anencephaly, but if the mothers are lucky, they may get a few hours with their children.\n\nHealth officials will continue to look at the risk factors some of these parents were exposed to. The CDC says that some of these risks may include a low intake of folic acid before pregnancy and being a Hispanic mother, among other more obscure risks like the environment. They also admitted it could be difficult getting people, whose conceptions were years ago, to remember certain things, such as the diets and the environments they were living in.\n\nThere is no cure for anencephaly. When asked about the Department\u2019s lack of answers, Robles told KOMO News that it was \u201cvery frustrating. I wouldn\u2019t want someone \u2026 to have a baby and go through that. It\u2019s just hard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "anencephaly, washington anencephaly,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Three Washington counties have seen higher rates of the rare and deadly birth defect, anencephaly, than the rest of the country.", "title": "Washington Sees Baffling Cluster Of Rare, Deadly Birth Defect", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/anencephaly-4-times-more-likely-babies-born-washington-health-dept-baffled-282492", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/anencephaly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three Washington counties have seen higher rates of the rare and deadly birth defect, anencephaly, than the rest of the country.", "title": "Washington Sees Baffling Cluster Of Rare, Deadly Birth Defect", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/anencephaly-4-times-more-likely-babies-born-washington-health-dept-baffled-282492", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/anencephaly.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/14/anencephaly.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-14T16:14:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-14T16:14:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Three Washington counties have seen higher rates of the rare and deadly birth defect, anencephaly, than the rest of the country."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf62c\"", "article_summary": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anencephaly typically occurs in one of every 4,859 babies.\nYet a spate of births in Washington has left mothers and health care providers baffled, as far too many babies have been born with anencephaly, a rare and deadly defect.\nThe complication is considered a neural tube defect, and typically occurs within the first month of pregnancy.\nSince 2010, 30 babies have been born with the defect in which parts of their brains and skulls were missing, NBC News reported.\nStill-births are common among babies with anencephaly, but if the mothers are lucky, they may get a few hours with their children."}
