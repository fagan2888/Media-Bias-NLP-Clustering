While here in Arizona 2014 may have brought us one record we did not want.Globally 2014 was the warmest year on record by over a full degree above the average. For a full report check out Erin Jordan's story about global temperatures back in 2014.The good news for the United States is that 2014 was not the warmest year ever, however it was warmer than normal. The US finished 2014 as the 34th warmest year ever. The average temperature was 52.6\u00b0, which is half a degree above the 20th century average. It was the warmest year ever for three states: California, Nevada and Arizona. While no states saw the coldest year ever; Arkansas and Illinois had their sixth coldest years on record and Indiana had its seventh coldest year ever. Overall the western states were well above normal and the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Valley had a cooler then normal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of precipitation the contiguous US had a slightly wetter than normal year. The US average 30.76\" of rain, .82\" above the 20th century average. 2014 was the 40th wettest year for the US and the 7th wettest year ever for Wisconsin and Michigan. The northern half of the country was wet while the southern half was dry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere in Arizona 2014 was the warmest year on record and the 43rd driest year on record. Southeastern Arizona was actually slightly wetter than normal, but not by that much (thanks to tropical moisture in late summer). In terms of the temperatures we keep the state warmth down here as well as we had the warmest year on record too.\n\n\n\nAll records for the US began in 1895 and go up until the latest year.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015.
