Just under 30 percent of cancers in women are breast cancers. \u2022 White women are slightly more likely to develop breast cancer than African-American women. However, in women under 45, breast cancer is more common in black women than white women. \u2022 Overall, black women are more likely to die of breast cancer. Asian, Hispanic and Native American women have a lower risk of developing and dying from breast cancer. \u2022 A woman's risk of breast cancer approximately doubles if she has a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter) who has been diagnosed with breast cancer. \u2022 About 85 percent of breast cancers occur in women who have no family history of breast cancer. \u2022 The most significant risk factors for breast cancer are gender (being a woman) and age (growing older).

Charities Inc., a 501(c)3 under which the alliance operates.\n\nA recently established allocation committee is designed to provide patients in Marion County with assistance with daily expenses. Applications are available on the website.\n\nAmy Roberts is a licensed clinical social worker for the Robert Boissoneault Oncology Institute in Ocala. She serves as a community navigator for the institute as well as for the alliance.\n\n\u201cThe Marion County Cancer Alliance is a community program where anyone who can provide resources and knowledge is welcome,\u201d Roberts said.\n\n\u201cAs a social worker, I partner with the alliance to help anyone, regardless of who their doctor is, to connect them to those resources and programs. Someone may get a referral through the website, and they are encouraged to contact me. I can do an assessment and refer them and guide them to help with transportation, bills, screenings and care,\u201d she added.\n\nSince its inception, the alliance has facilitated a partnership with the Marion County Public Library to create a mini cancer resource center. A Kids & Cancer Summit regarding the human papillomavirus is also offered, with education provided by the University of Florida and the Marion County Health Department.\n\nThe Cancer Alliance of Marion County meets from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on the third Wednesday of September, November, February and May at the Marion County Sheriff's Office, Emergency Operations Center, 692 NW 30th Ave., Ocala.\n\nThe group welcomes professional cancer care providers to discuss community needs assessment, improve existing programs and create solutions to gaps in cancer healthcare.\n\nThere also is a need, Koontz said, for attorneys to assist patients with legal, insurance and employment issues.\n\n\u201cFrom primary care to palliation, our goal is to empower you with cancer-related information through a user-friendly, upbeat local website,\u201d Koontz said.\n\n\u201cWe just don't want people to be struggling and not know there is help available. Marion County is a giving, caring community,\u201d Roberts added. \u201cThere are so many programs out there. The amazing thing about the alliance is we are all there for the patient and the family.\u201d\n\nTo contact Roberts, call 732-0277.\n\nFor information about the alliance or how to be involved, call Koontz at 690-3764 or 812-4378, or visit www.crushcancermc.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Cancer Alliance of Marion County is all about making a difficult journey a little easier for patients with breast cancer and all other types of cancer.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-69C37E45-692A-4857-9BBC-7DDBD9FB72B3-pubOS"}, "og": {"site_name": "Ocala.com", "description": "The Cancer Alliance of Marion County is all about making a difficult journey a little easier for patients with breast cancer and all other types of cancer.", "title": "Alliance helps cancer patients, families", "url": "http://www.ocala.com/article/20141010/articles/141019976", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.gainesville.com/global/images/fb/OS.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 160}, "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20141010, "fb": {"admins": 100004135120432, "app_id": 162010827183725}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-141019976-pubOS"}}}, "article_summary": "\u2022 Besides skin cancer, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women.\nThe Cancer Alliance of Marion County is all about making a difficult journey a little easier for patients with breast cancer and all other types of cancer.\n\u2022 For women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer.\n\u2022 A woman's risk of breast cancer approximately doubles if she has a first-degree relative (mother, sister or daughter) who has been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\u201cThe Marion County Cancer Alliance is a community program where anyone who can provide resources and knowledge is welcome,\u201d Roberts said."}
