Lew said Thursday.\n\nLew, in an interview with Globe, said Obama signed a spending bill that included provisions loosening restrictions on the kind of risky trading that contributed to the financial crisis because he didn\u2019t want to shut down the government. He noted that Obama pledged to veto any attempts by the Republican Congress to further weaken core elements of the financial law in his State of the Union address earlier this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was, on the whole, more important to get the funding bill and get the funding for very important priorities that were in the funding bill and to have stability for the economy than to get into the kind of divisive process that would have come from a veto,\u201d Lew said.\n\nLew was in Boston to kick off the tax season and visit Action for Boston Community Development Inc., a nonprofit social services agency that helps low-income residents prepare their tax returns at no cost.\n\nHis visit was made in part to call attention to new requirements for 2014 tax returns related to the Affordable Care Act, the federal law also known as Obamacare.\n\nTaxpayers will have to report whether they had medical insurance coverage. Those who received coverage through the health insurance exchanges created by the law and those who didn\u2019t obtain coverage will have to answer additional questions and provide additional income documents.\n\nAfter talking to tax preparers across the country, Lew said he doesn\u2019t expect the health care law to cause problems. \u201cI\u2019m getting the sense that things are getting off to a good start,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe start with the new Republican-controlled Congress may not be going quite as well. The president remains at odds over issues such as immigration, raising the minimum wage, and the future of the financial reform.\n\nCongressional Republicans have made it clear that they want to roll back the Dodd-Frank law, named for its sponsors, former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd and former Massachusetts representative Barney Frank.\n\nThe law, passed after the financial system\u2019s near-collapse, resulted in tougher regulations on banks and financial institutions and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has taken on everything from college debt to debit card fees.\n\nRepublicans have argued that regulations are too strict, adding costs and making it hard for banks to do business, which hurts the economy. But Lew said Republicans are ignoring recent history and lessons from Wall Street\u2019s meltdown.\n\n\u201cJust because the economy is doing better now we can\u2019t forget where we were, and we can\u2019t go back,\u201d he said.\n\nObama\u2019s enthusiasm for financial reform, however, was called into question by some Democrats, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, when he signed the spending bill that weakened Dodd-Frank.\n\nWarren was more recently able to scuttle the nomination of a Treasury undersecretary who had strong ties to Wall Street.\n\nIn a statement after the State of the Union address, Warren voiced support for Obama\u2019s message that \u201cthe White House will push back hard against efforts to roll back critical Wall Street reforms.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.1349929923", "eomportal-id": 590267, "description": "The Obama administration remains committed to the financial reforms passed since the 2008 economic crisis, despite allowing changes last month that watered down the Dodd-Frank law aimed at reining in Wall Street\u2019s riskiest practices US Treasury Secretary Jacob J.
