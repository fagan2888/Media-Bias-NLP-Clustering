On average, the price hike was $39 per prescription, although one out of 10 consumers said they faced higher out-of-pocket costs of at least $100.\n\n\u201cWe were absolutely shocked\u201d by the finding that one-third of Americans were coping with higher medication costs, said Lisa Gill, an editor at Consumer Reports\u2019 Best Buy Drugs. \u201cWe had anecdotal evidence, but we didn\u2019t know to what degree. That represents millions of people.\u201d\n\nRelated: America\u2019s 10 Top Selling Medications\n\nAbout four out of 10 Americans regularly take one prescription, and the average is five medications, she added.\n\nWhile the increased costs might not seem like a lot to Americans with middle-class jobs and a healthy cash flow, it can be fairly devastating for seniors who are living on fixed incomes or who rely on Social Security checks for the bulk of their income. Clearly, Americans are feeling the pressure on their checkbooks, given that drugs used to treat common health issues ranging from asthma to allergies are among those with recent price increases. Prescription drug spending rose 12.6 percent last year, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nSome presidential candidates, such as Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, are vowing to tackle the high price of medications as part of their campaign promises. But in the meantime, drug costs continue to rise.\n\nIt\u2019s not always the pharmaceutical company that\u2019s to blame, Gill noted. Reasons for price increases can range from everything to drug shortages to an insurer dropping a previously covered medication, she said.\n\nRelated: Americans Want Medicare to Negotiate Better Deals on Drugs\n\nHere are four strategies recommended by Consumers Union\u2019s Gill that consumers should try if they are hit with a suddenly painful drug price hike.\n\nShop around. \u201cNot all pharmacies charge the same price,\u201d Gill said. \u201cIf you are given a price at a pharmacy that\u2019s higher than what you are accustomed to, step away from the pharmacy counter and make a few calls.\u201d\n\nThe first call on your list should be Costco, if you have one near your home. A survey of drug prices that will be published next year by Consumer Reports found that Costco by and large has the lowest drug prices. One little known fact is that consumers don\u2019t need a Costco membership to use the pharmacy.\n\nNegotiate. \u201cThere is no other consumer product where you have an opportunity to negotiate other than homes and cars \u2013 and pharmaceuticals,\u201d Gill said. \u201cAsk for the lowest possible price.\u201d\n\nThe hitch here is that it likely won\u2019t work if you are paying with insurance or if you are Medicare part D and haven\u2019t yet hit the \u201cdonut hole\u201d -- the gap in drug coverage that kicks in once older Americans have spent up to a limit of $2,800 on medications.\n\nRelated: Wonder Drugs Blow a $1 Billion Hole in VA\u2019s Budget\n\nUse your insurer\u2019s preferred pharmacy. Many Americans aren\u2019t aware that their health-care insurance companies pick pharmacies as their \u201cpreferred\u201d providers, which means those drug stores may offer a lower price, Gill said. That also goes for Part D plans, she added.\n\nPatient assistance programs. These programs are geared for people who aren\u2019t insured or who are underinsured and are having trouble paying for medications, Gill said.
