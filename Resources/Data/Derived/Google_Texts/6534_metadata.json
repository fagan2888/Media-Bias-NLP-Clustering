He is the author of Push Back and a noted expert on the Judeo-Christian ethos. An inspiring public speaker and advisor, he appears regularly on TV, radio and publishes widely acclaimed articles. He is president of Caucus for America and the first rabbi to publicly endorse Ronald Reagan.\n\nBarack Obama declared six years ago that the ultimate goal of his presidency was to fundamentally transform America.\n\nThis has been not only his agenda, but for decades the goal of America\u2019s political left wing. To transform a country one must first transform its people. Transformation takes place by changing the values by which people live and by changing their self-perception of who they are and what they are supposed to become.\n\nCommon Core does exactly that.\n\nCommon Core is to education what Obamacare is to health care.\n\nThe purpose of both programs is to take away one\u2019s individual choice, be it regarding health care or local influence on education. Both programs are transformative since they assault the most fundamental American liberties, the freedom to choose one\u2019s doctor and medical remedies, and the freedom to educate one\u2019s children by local values.\n\nBoth programs give federal bureaucrats control over these most important aspects of life. They disenfranchise us as patients and parents. Controlling the lives of \u201cthose below\u201d is the animating principle of Leftism and the elitists who wish to do the controlling.\n\nA communist society takes choice away from the people and places it in the hands of a centralized apparatus removed from the people. In other words, it deprives the individual his liberty.\n\nThrough centralization, the individual loses not only his liberty but is socially engineered to think a certain way and act in conformity and lock-step with how the ruling elite want its new underclass to act.\n\nCommon Core seeks to create a common-ness among people, what the Communists refer to as \u201cthe masses.\u201d America\u2019s students are being groomed today to be future members of the \u201cCommie Corps,\u201d advocates and robots of a trans-individual system.\n\nAmericans have succeeded because of our special Judeo-Christian outlook on life, local control, and the confidence in a rugged individualism that inspired us to be the best we can be.\n\nCommon Core changes all that. Our children will be trained by educators not to be rugged but common; not masters of our own fate but subjects of a ruling bureaucracy; not the possessors of a unique Judeo-Christian outlook but proponents of a transnational, socialist worldview.\n\nOne of the hallmarks and goals of socialist Marxism is to strip a country of its unique culture, history, attitudes, and self-perception. The first order of business for the Russian communists was to denude Russia of its Russo-ism as did Mao when stripping his country of its unique Chinese heritage.\n\nThus, throughout the curriculum of Common Core, American heroes are minimized and castigated, our history maligned, our historic values seen as an affront to multiculturalism. Much of Common Core is an indictment of America. It indicts so as to remove.\n\nToo often far more information is supplied about Islam and too little about Christianity and Judaism. For many in the ruling clique, the Biblical religions and Testaments of Christianity and Judaism are pass\u00e9 and the problem while Islam and its Koran are seen as the new universal religion requiring our veneration.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton epitomize this attitude of deference, often referring in their remarks to the \u201cHoly Koran\u201d and \u201cthe Prophet,\u201d majestic references they rarely extend to Christianity or Judaism.\n\nBy transforming the values of our children, as well as their perception of themselves as individuals, the ruling elites will be able to transform America completely and create transnational citizens, pupils educated to conform to the social engineering from above.\n\nCommon Core is the ultimate vehicle in erasing excellence for mediocrity and individuality for conformity. Common Core reflects the arrogance of the social engineers and their condescension and little regard for their \u201csubjects\u201d below. Common Core is the thief that robs individual students of their potential.\n\nBecause of Obamacare, many outstanding doctors are leaving the practice of medicine. Understandably, they wish not to be pre-programmed, mere medical clerks of the government\u2026 as if they were postal workers. It is an affront to the creativity, integrity, and the personal spirit they were trained to give to their craft.\n\nSimilarly, we now hear of outstanding teachers who are leaving our schools and teaching due to the imposition of Common Core.\n\nAs with the students, their individuality is being snatched away through mandates of a new centralized education system. They will no longer be able to teach in a manner that reflects their innate talents, their unique intuition and experience, their personal insight. As with anything socialist and Marxist, the personal is crushed. It extinguishes the fire in the provider and levels and deadens the spirit in the receiver.\n\nCommon Core will stifle the potential of our youngsters and make them much too common. It will transform America by making our would-be heroes and achievers into but robots of the Commie Corps.\n\nRabbi Aryeh Spero is author of \u201cPush Back\u201d and president of Caucus For America.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
