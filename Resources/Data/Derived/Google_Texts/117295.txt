One man is in the hospital following what officers are calling a vicious dog attack Sunday afternoon.

About 1:40 p.m., police responded to the 1200 block of NW 45th to a report of a dog attacking a homeowner.

Upon arrival, police located an adult male being mauled by a St. Bernard. Two bystanders attempted to pull the dog off the man but they were unsuccessful. An officer then deployed his taser and the dog released its hold on the man.

“We were afraid the dog was going to kill him,” said the victim’s wife Shelley Hudson about the dog named Atlus.

“The dog kept biting deeper and deeper, almost gnawing on his arm. My husband was of course screaming in pain,” Hudson said.

Police said the dog turned and charged at the officer. The officer discharged his handgun and the dog was hit and he retreated.

Officers said the homeowner was “gravely injured as a result of the dog attack”. He was taken to a local hospital in serious condition.

Hudson said her husband is going to be OK but that he can't feel his arm or fingers.

The couple had adopted the dog, who was abused in the past. The dog had bitten her husband about a year and a half ago, but had not shown signs of aggression since, she said.

The dog was treated at the scene and was taken to a veterinarian clinic for further treatment.

The dog was put down, Hudson told News 9.
