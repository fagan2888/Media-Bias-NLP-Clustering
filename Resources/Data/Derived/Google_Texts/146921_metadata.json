At the time, the chief justice changed the mandate to a tax, thus giving our legislative branch the constitutional justification of this law and legit under the commerce clause, even though the word tax is not written in the law.\n\nStrike two was another foul ball. The ACA says tax credits apply to health care recipients in exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Under the interpretation by the executive branch, the states not having their own exchanges and on the government exchange were given subsidies on signing up for insurance. Again, the chief justice changed the wording to read \u201cexchanges established by the states or by way of the federal government\u201d is constitutional when the four simple words really don\u2019t say it.\n\nStrike three was when the Supreme Court backed a social shift on same-sex marriage. The chief justice said, \u201cCelebrate the availability of new benefit. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution says nothing about marriage or abortion.\n\nRobert Meale\n\nWoodstock", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Northwest Herald", "og": {"url": "http://www.nwherald.com/2015/07/09/letter-three-strikes/aopdhk4/", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/images/avatar-facebook.png", "site_name": "Northwest Herald", "description": "To the Editor:", "title": "Letter: Three strikes"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nwherald", "image": "http://www.nwherald.com/images/avatar-twitter.png", "description": "To the Editor:", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Letter: Three strikes"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1071875123", "fb": {"pages": 13044672572}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "ae14617d-52fd-4cd4-bd5e-1a4d8e28e511"}}, "keywords": "#071015lte", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The chief justice said, \u201cCelebrate the availability of new benefit.\nTo the Editor:The Supremes (U.S. Supreme Court), a coequal branch of our Republic, is changing law and not interpreting the constitutional value of laws passed by the legislative branch and signed by the executive branch.\nIt had nothing to do with it.\u201dThe Constitution says nothing about marriage or abortion.\nStrike three was when the Supreme Court backed a social shift on same-sex marriage.\nAgain, the chief justice changed the wording to read \u201cexchanges established by the states or by way of the federal government\u201d is constitutional when the four simple words really don\u2019t say it."}
