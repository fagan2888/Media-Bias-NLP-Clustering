But, sorry to say, we won\u2019t use them.\n\nI ride my bike a lot, but does anyone really expect that with more bike paths, we\u2019ll see appreciably fewer cars on our roads?\n\nAnd light rail sure hasn\u2019t changed the world. It\u2019s not a bust, but it\u2019s no indisputable boom, either. On some lines, you\u2019ll sometimes see one, maybe two passengers per carriage.\n\nWhy? Because we love our cars. We get in at one place; we get out at another. No fares, no transfers, no sweat.\n\nBut if our typical mode of transportation is not going to change, the way we pay for it has to. Why? Because while the Colorado Department of Transportation had $1.6 billion to spend in 2007, today its budget is $400 million less. That\u2019s $800 million short of what CDOT says it needs just to maintain par, which isn\u2019t saying much.\n\nCDOT itself grades the overall condition of more than 9,000 miles of highway across Colorado as only a C-plus.\n\nYet, as if we can just shut our eyes real tight and wish our weaknesses away, for more than 20 years we haven\u2019t supported an upward adjustment in the gas tax, which is CDOT\u2019s main source of funding. This year, our state legislators finally apportioned money for CDOT after almost a decade of drought, but because of restrictions due to the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights, it got only half of what originally was allocated.\n\nThe two biggest imperatives for improvement are Interstate 70 and I-25. They are Colorado\u2019s indispensable spinal columns. CDOT\u2019s Communications Director Amy Ford calls them \u201cabsolutely critical priorities.\u201d But they also are the biggest chokepoints in the state. They need relief.\n\nTechnology is on the cusp of achievable alternatives, but we\u2019re not there yet. So how about adding new lanes until then? The common comeback to that controversial concept is the pessimistic projection, \u201cBuild it and they will come.\u201d\n\nNewsflash: They\u2019re coming anyway. Our population is growing at a rate twice the national average. Deflate the mountains and shield the sun, maybe Colorado won\u2019t be the utopia it is and the growth will slow. But we can\u2019t do that, and \u201cthey\u201d will come whether we expand our highways or not.\n\nMeantime, the longer we do nothing, not only do our own frustrations grow but also the further we fall from any affordable solution. Right now, the price tag for an asphalt fix along the mountain corridor of I-70 alone \u2014 absent any alternative form of transportation, like rail, which would cost more than half of the entire state budget for a whole year \u2014 is somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion. And like everything from the veterans hospital to Denver International Airport, those figures might be on the low side.\n\nA lot of Coloradans are complaining now about a fairly new concept in our state: toll lanes. Not tollways like E-470, but paying a price, a toll, to ride in the fast lane while other lanes \u2014 theoretically more congested \u2014 cost nothing. It\u2019s just starting now on the Boulder Turnpike. Soon, it will be on eastbound I-70 from Empire to Idaho Springs, and eventually on C-470, I-70 to DIA, and more of I-25 north to Fort Collins.\n\nThe strategy is, let drivers who are in a hurry pay for improvements that make hurrying possible. If a toll lane jams up, the toll goes up and some drivers drop out. If it\u2019s underused, the toll goes down and more drivers pull in. Another part of the strategy? State-run express buses to reduce the cars\u2019 congestion.\n\nColorado roads might never earn an A, but C-plus isn\u2019t anywhere near satisfactory. So I\u2019m all for what the state is doing. There\u2019s no other way to finance what we need \u2026 unless the money magically materializes when we shut our eyes real tight.\n\nGreg Dobbs of Evergreen was a correspondent for ABC News for 23 years, then for HDNet television\u2019s \u201cWorld Report.\u201d\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dobbs: The reality of Colorado growth and traffic solutions", "title": "Dobbs: The reality of Colorado growth and traffic solutions", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/17/dobbs-the-reality-of-colorado-growth-and-traffic-solutions/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__OP19DOBBSp1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__OP19DOBBSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-17T11:26:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T05:26:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A lot of Coloradans are complaining now about a fairly new concept in our state: toll lanes.\nBecause while the Colorado Department of Transportation had $1.6 billion to spend in 2007, today its budget is $400 million less.\nDeflate the mountains and shield the sun, maybe Colorado won\u2019t be the utopia it is and the growth will slow.\nCDOT itself grades the overall condition of more than 9,000 miles of highway across Colorado as only a C-plus.\nAnd like everything from the veterans hospital to Denver International Airport, those figures might be on the low side."}
