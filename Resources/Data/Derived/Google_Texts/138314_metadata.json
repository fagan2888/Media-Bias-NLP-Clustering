These are folks where the decision has already been made that they need hospitalization.\u201d\n\nJansen said the supply is outpacing demand.\n\n\u201cThey (St. Luke\u2019s) have reduced their beds. They went from a 48-bed hospitalization down to 26 or 27 beds. They had three psychiatrists who resigned or retired,\u201d Jansen said.\n\n\u201cIf they are full, we have to look at other options, like state institutions, and their rates are quite a bit more expensive,\u201d Jansen said.\n\nThe average cost per day in Racine is $519 but can be as high as $1,142 per day in state institutes, according to Jansen.\n\nInpatient care for psychiatric emergencies and medical detoxification are a significant portion of the division\u2019s budget. Last year the division funded 558 hospital admissions, according to its annual report.\n\nShortage of psychiatrists\n\nMeanwhile, the shortage of psychiatrists is a nationwide problem, according to Sita Diehl, director of state policy and advocacy at the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nAnd with more people insured by the Affordable Care Act, the demand for services increases.\n\n\u201cPeople have been toughing it out with their major depression, bipolar disorder or anxiety disorder, and once they get insured, then they go for services,\u201d Diehl said.\n\nWisconsin meets just 20 percent of all need for mental health care, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation based on a comparison of psychiatrists and the overall population.\n\nDr. Ashok Shah, a private Kenosha psychiatrist, said the shortage is not likely to change quickly.\n\n\u201cWe see depression, anxiety, substance and alcohol abuse and psychosis. The need for psychiatrists is definitely there,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThere are not enough physicians that want to work in inpatient settings. It\u2019s a busy field, and the reimbursement is not sustainable for physicians to continue.\u201d\n\nDiehl said one problem is that psychiatrists typically spend 50 minutes with each patient \u201cwhere a regular physician will spend just a couple of minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who dedicate themselves to service through the county clinics are heroes,\u201d Diehl said. \u201cThey are there because they really care \u2014 not because they want to make a doctor\u2019s salary.\u201d\n\nA 2014 assessment by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services estimated 49 percent of people with mental illness in Wisconsin did not receive treatment in 2011 and in children the number was closer to 46 percent.\n\nSeeking a solution\n\nSupervisor Dayvin Hallmon, chairman of the Human Services Committee, is trying to look ahead to solutions without increasing the budget.\n\n\u201cIt gives us a chance to have that conversation and find some answers and take the lead on fixing this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a statewide and national problem, but I think we are positioned very neatly to take the lead on this in an interesting way.\u201d\n\nHallmon hopes to get the state and federal officials involved in a solution.\n\nJansen is preparing a presentation to the County Board at the Committee of the Whole scheduled for 7 p.m. Wednesday in the County Administration Building, 1010 56th St.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of Wednesday\u2019s meeting is to say, \u2018Here is what we\u2019ve discovered; here is where lies the problem; here\u2019s some things that we know as a community we have to really take a look at.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"robots": "index,follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 424648924332198}, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Kenosha County Department of Human Services is over budget on mental health by $2.1 million, and now the County Board is getting involved.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep paying, paying and paying and the budget going up, up and up.\u201dLaurie Staves, chief financial officer for the Kenosha County Human Services Department, said the second quarter numbers don\u2019t show the whole picture.\nDr. Ashok Shah, a private Kenosha psychiatrist, said the shortage is not likely to change quickly.\n\u201c(With) savings in other mental health and Alcohol and Other Drug Addiction areas, we come down to $1.2 million,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnytime someone is having a mental health crisis and ends up in the hospital emergency room, our crisis workers are involved and law enforcement is involved."}
