I still believe we're a lot better than we were last year. Hawaii is a lot better than last year, and the main reason is their quarterback. We're still going to win a lot of football games. I really believe that. We had a couple unfortunate incidents happen to us that we have to make sure we don't do. That kind of turned the tide of the game for us.\"\n\nMum's the word\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacIntyre said he received no explanation from the officials regarding the chaotic ending to Saturday's contest, offering only a succinct \"No comment,\" when asked to share his review.\n\nTo recap, after Phillip Lindsay was stopped at roughly the 8-yard line with the clock winding down and no timeouts, the line judge marking the spot tossed the ball to the umpire, who inexplicably marked the spot at the six. When the umpire tossed to the ball in to the referee, it deflected off a Hawaii defender and bounced away, allowing precious seconds to tick away.\n\nBy the time the ball finally was marked \u2014 erroneously at the six, which would have counted as a first down \u2014 the Buffs didn't have enough time to get off a final desperate play. Yet much of the chaos could have been avoided had CU not squandered a pair of timeouts early in the second half.\n\n\"Both of them were third downs and shorts, and we wanted to make sure we got them,\" MacIntyre said. \"I was thinking they were going to measure them and different things like that, so we called timeout. We got both of them, which was key in the deal, but there's no doubt you would've liked to have those back for sure.\"\n\nNotable\n\nRunning back Michael Adkins remains hopeful of building off his breakout performance (22 carries, 90 yards) after an injury-riddled 2014. \"It was good getting back out there and playing in again,\" he said. \"The line was able to spring me a couple times and I could do some good things out there. We just have to keep building on that.\" ... MacIntyre reported no significant injury issues from game No. 1.\n\nPat Rooney: rooneyp@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/prooney07", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-09-05T20:57:38-0600", "sailthru.author": "By Pat Rooney \n \n  BuffZone.com Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28766348:view"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "With plenty of material to work with and learn from, the University of Colorado football team went back to work Saturday.", "title": "CU football: Buffs back to work with UMass ahead", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0905/20150905__06DCSCFBLw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-09-06T13:17:27-0600", "endDate": "2025-09-05T20:54:45-0600", "news_keywords": "Buffzone, cu, college sports, university of colorado, boulder, colorado", "byline": "By Pat RooneyBuffZone.com", "pubDate": "2015-09-05T20:59:59-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-05T20:57:38-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU football: Buffs back to work with UMass ahead", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0905/20150905__06DCSCFBLw~1_300.jpg", "description": "With plenty of material to work with and learn from, the University of Colorado football team went back to work Saturday.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "With plenty of material to work with and learn from, the University of Colorado football team went back to work Saturday.", "title": "CU football: Buffs back to work with UMass ahead"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0905/20150905__06DCSCFBLw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "\"I said after the game I still believe this is a good football team.\nMacIntyre hopes to improve clock managementWith plenty of material to work with and learn from, the University of Colorado football team went back to work Saturday.\nYet much of the chaos could have been avoided had CU not squandered a pair of timeouts early in the second half.\nWe're still going to win a lot of football games.\n\"Every time you come back out to practice after a game, win or lose, you get the corrections done from the last game, and then you move on to the next game,\" MacIntyre said."}
