Bobby Jindal, a likely 2016 Republican presidential candidate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut Giuliani also said that his office secretary had reported receiving death threats since POLITICO first published his remarks late Wednesday night. Giuliani didn\u2019t tell CNN whether he had alerted police to those calls, and a New York Police Department spokeswoman contacted Saturday said it is department policy not to release any information about potential victims.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s remarks about Obama, made during a private dinner in midtown Manhattan featuring Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, have put the entire 2016 Republican field on the spot. Walker didn\u2019t address the former mayor\u2019s comments during the event in New York and on Saturday told the Associated Press he didn\u2019t know whether Obama loved the country.\n\n\u201cYou should ask the president what he thinks about America,\u201d Walker said during a visit to Washington, where he is attending the National Governors Association\u2019s winter meeting. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked him, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell issued a statement late Friday putting a slight bit of distance between the former Florida governor and Giuliani. \u201cGov. Bush doesn\u2019t question President Obama\u2019s motives. He does question President Obama\u2019s disastrous policies,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking with NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to question people\u2019s motives. \u2026 I don\u2019t question his motives. And I try not to question the president\u2019s motives as being a good American or a bad American.\u201d\n\nAt the NGA meeting, Republican governors distanced themselves from Giuliani\u2019s remarks, with Utah Gov. Gary Herbert calling them \u201cill-advised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always hard to say what\u2019s inside somebody\u2019s heart or in their mind, and I think the better thing to judge is what the president has done or what he has not done, rather than the motivation he may have,\u201d said Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterize any of that that way,\u201d said former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour of Giuliani\u2019s choice of words.\n\n\u201cI think everybody in elected office loves their country,\u201d said independent Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, who was a Republican until 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy of Connecticut, speaking at the White House on Friday afternoon, defended the president. \u201cFor the number of hours to go by without Rudy Giuliani having called the president to apologize for what is a despicable statement is really quite amazing. Quite frankly, no one in their right mind could question that the president loves his country.\n\n\u201cFor candidates for president, or possible candidates for president, who have not rejected outright what Mr. Giuliani said about our president I think speaks volumes about them as well.\u201d\n\nObama aides have been more than willing to weigh in on the Giuliani comments. On Thursday, the White House featured the hashtag #ObamaLovesAmerica in a tweet about the designation of three national monuments. And at a Democratic National Committee winter meeting on Friday, Obama concluded his speech listing a series of party priorities by noting: \u201cIt\u2019s about making this nation we love more perfect.\u201d\n\nEdward-Isaac Dovere contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "His remarks about Obama have put the 2016 Republican field on the spot.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His remarks about Obama have put the 2016 Republican field on the spot.", "title": "Giuliani says he's received death threats over Obama remarks", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/rudy-giuliani-says-hes-received-death-threats-over-obama-remarks-115384.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/21/150221_rudy_giuliani_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Rudy Giuliani", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/darrensamuelsohn"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd2a\"", "article_summary": "Giuliani says he's received death threats over Obama remarksRudy Giuliani says he is getting death threats at his office in the wake of controversial comments that President Barack Obama doesn\u2019t love America.\nStory Continued BelowBut Giuliani also said that his office secretary had reported receiving death threats since POLITICO first published his remarks late Wednesday night.\nGiuliani\u2019s remarks about Obama, made during a private dinner in midtown Manhattan featuring Wisconsin Gov.\nHe does question President Obama\u2019s disastrous policies,\u201d she said.\nBush doesn\u2019t question President Obama\u2019s motives."}
