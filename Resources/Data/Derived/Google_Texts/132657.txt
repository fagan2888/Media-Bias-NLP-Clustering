BROOKFIELD (WITI) -- Officials at Brookfield East High School are considering the implementation of a new policy giving school administrators the power to breathalyze students at school events.

"We're incredibly concerned with student safety," said Principal Andy Farley. "Continuance of trying to improve our safety procedures at our school events."

Officials would only be allowed to breathalyze students for what they call "reasonable suspicion" including the smell of alcohol on a student's breath, stumbling, and slurred speech.

If a students tests positive, he or she will be ejected from the event and a parent or guardian will be called to pick them up immediately. In addition, the student could face sanctions such as suspension or expulsion.

"Our administration will be trained by, and will partner with, Brookfield Police Department. They'll offer training on how to use it," explained Farley.

One student said the new policy shouldn't be a worry for fellow classmates.

"It doesn't really bother anyone. It's not going to change anything because people know they're not supposed to come to school under the influence anyway," said Julia Tennessen. "I think it does send a message but I think kids aren't really worried about it anyway because nobody really comes to the games under the influence."

The school would notify law enforcement about students who are caught under the influence. The policy would apply to visiting students, as well.
