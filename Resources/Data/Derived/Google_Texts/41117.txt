SAVANNAH | John Barrow is coming home to Athens.

Days after losing his seat in the U.S. House, Rep. John Barrow has decided to sell his Augusta home. Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo confirmed Monday that

Barrow planned to move back to Athens, where Barrow’s children live and he still has a family home. Barrow moved to Augusta two years ago to stay within the shifting boundaries of his district.

The Democratic congressman was defeated by Republican challenger Rick Allen in the midterm elections last Tuesday after serving five terms in eastern Georgia’s 12th District. By the weekend, a “for sale” sign had been posted outside Barrow’s house in Augusta.

“He always made a commitment, after the lines kept being redrawn, to always live in the district,” Carbo said. “It kept him away from his family for an extended period of time. He’s decided to relocate to his hometown to be closer to his kids and his family.”

Athens was part of the 12th District in 2004 when Barrow, a longtime Athens-Clarke County commissioner, was first elected to Congress. During his decade in Washington, Barrow ended up moving twice after Republican state lawmakers redrew his district to carve out his home address. Barrow bought a house in Savannah in 2006, then sold it to move to Augusta in early 2012. By then the district had been retooled to favor Republicans.

This year, Barrow tried to beat the odds as he did two years ago by running as an independent who openly disagreed with fellow Democrats on issues such as health care, the environment and gun control. Allen, an Augusta construction company owner, won a decisive 55 percent of the vote with a campaign that portrayed Barrow was two-faced rather than independent.

Barrow was among 10 Democratic incumbents who lost their House seats in the election. He was also the last white Democratic congressman from the Deep South states of Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina.
