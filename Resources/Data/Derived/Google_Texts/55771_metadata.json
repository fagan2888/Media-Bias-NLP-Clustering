Ted Cruz (R-TX) spoke to the press in the nation\u2019s capital Tuesday morning to address the horrific terror attacks in Brussels. He mourned with the victims\u2019 families, then pinned the blame on failed leadership both at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s attacks in Brussels underscores this is a war,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis is not a lone war. ISIS has declared jihad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is way past time we have a president who will acknowledge this evil and will call it by its name and use the full force and fury to defeat ISIS,\u201d he continued. \u201cUntil they are defeated, these attacks will continue. Their target is each and every one of us.\u201d\n\nCruz, one of five remaining presidential candidates, urged America needs a leader who is not afraid to speak about terrorism in bold terms.\n\n\u201cWe need a president who sets aside political correctness,\u201d Cruz insisted. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another lecture about Islamophobia.\u201d\n\nMore than a change in rhetoric, Cruz noted we need a more robust security process. The Brussels attacks, Cruz said, are \u201cthe fruit of a failed immigration policy in Europe.\u201d\n\nHe called the president\u2019s plan to allow thousands of Syrian refugees into the States woefully wrong. We need \u201cserious vetting,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked to address his rival Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion on Monday that the U.S. withdraw from NATO, Cruz appeared visibly disgusted.\n\n\u201cTrump is wrong\u201d when he says that we withdraw from NATO and retreat from Europe, Cruz said. \u201cTrump\u2019s proposal to withdraw from NATO is sadly consistent with his statement he intends to be neutral with Israel.\u201d\n\nCruz also slammed the president\u2019s trip to Cuba, before suggesting Obama book the next available flight to Brussels.\n\nIt will be interesting to hear President Obama\u2019s tone at this morning\u2019s press conference from Cuba and how it compares with Cruz\u2019s unequivocal response.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No stuttering. .05/27/2016 10:15:15AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "No stuttering.", "title": "Cruz: \"We Don't Need Another Lecture on Islamophobia\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/22/cruz-we-dont-need-another-lecture-on-islamophobia-n2137788", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/78/cccdd58b-14a8-483d-89b7-0e172755ad56.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "No stuttering.", "title": "Cruz: \"We Don't Need Another Lecture on Islamophobia\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/03/22/cruz-we-dont-need-another-lecture-on-islamophobia-n2137788", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/78/cccdd58b-14a8-483d-89b7-0e172755ad56.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Cruz: \"We Don't Need Another Lecture on Islamophobia\", Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe don\u2019t need another lecture about Islamophobia.\u201dMore than a change in rhetoric, Cruz noted we need a more robust security process.\nAsked to address his rival Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion on Monday that the U.S. withdraw from NATO, Cruz appeared visibly disgusted.\n\u201cToday\u2019s attacks in Brussels underscores this is a war,\u201d Cruz said.\nThe Brussels attacks, Cruz said, are \u201cthe fruit of a failed immigration policy in Europe.\u201dHe called the president\u2019s plan to allow thousands of Syrian refugees into the States woefully wrong.\nSen.
