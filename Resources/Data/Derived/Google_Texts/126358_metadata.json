State officials said this week they are hopeful that this year's launch will be better than last year's, when the state's new health exchange website was a technological disaster. Here are a few things to know about open enrollment.\n\nWho must sign up for new plans?\n\nAnyone who buys health insurance through MassHealth or the Health Connector must re-enroll. This includes anyone who has subsidized plans and anyone who is buying a plan on the individual commercial market through the state's health insurance exchange. It also includes anyone who the state put in temporary MassHealth plans last year.\n\nWhy do I have to re-enroll?\n\nMassachusetts is required by federal law to offer plans that meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, through an exchange that is ACA-compatible. Because of problems with the state's health connector website last year, only about 35,000 people so far have been able to sign up for health plans that qualify under the ACA.\n\nWhen can I sign up?\n\nThe state's new website MAhealthconnector.org goes live at 8 a.m. on Saturday. You have until Dec. 23 to sign up for coverage effective Jan. 1. Open enrollment runs through Feb. 15.\n\nWhat can I use the state website for?\n\nAssuming the website functions as advertised, consumers will be able to browse health plans, complete an application online, find out what program or subsidy they qualify for, select a plan to purchase and pay a premium.\n\nWhat if I run into trouble?\n\nNavigator organizations are available to provide in-person and over-the-phone assistance. Visit https://bettermahealthconnector.org/get-help/ for more information. Sites in Western Massachusetts include: Caring Health Center in Springfield; Ecu-Health Care in North Adams; Casa Latina in Florence and the Hilltown Community Health Care Centers in Worthington.\n\nAdditionally, the Health Connector will have its customer service open this weekend from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 1-877-623-6765. Its regular business hours are Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday 9 am to 3 p.m. MassHealth customer service will be open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 1-800-841-2900.\n\nWhat browser can I use to access the state website?\n\nThe site works best with Chrome version 30 or better, Firefox version 30 or better, and Internet Explorer version 10 or better. If you have an old Internet browser, you may be instructed to update your browser.\n\nHow long will it take to fill out an application?\n\nState officials estimate that the average user will take 10 minutes to browse and an hour to fill out an application. You can save your work at any point and come back to it later.\n\nWill the website actually work this time around?\n\nThat remains to be seen. But according to Health Connector officials, it has been extensively tested, with success rates of at least 94 percent.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@homepage','affordable-care-act','health-care-connector','health-insurance-exchange'", "title": "What you need to know about open enrollment for Massachusetts Health Connector plans", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"What you need to know about open enrollment for Massachusetts Health Connector plans\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/11/what_you_need_to_know_about_op.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/health-connectorjpg-5f4963351e2d0ba8.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14493381\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-14T18:36:17Z\", \"author\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"health-care-connector\",\"health-insurance-exchange\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.masslive.com/politics_impact/photo/16339738-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@#!/shiraschoenberg", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary", "description": "Open enrollment begins Saturday through MAhealthconnector.org.
