I hate Microsoft Word the way Winston Smith hated Big Brother. Our reasons are, alarmingly, not dissimilar. Microsoft Word is a tyrant of the imagination, a petty, unimaginative, inconsistent dictator that is ill-suited to any creative writer's use. Worse: it is a near-monopolist, dominating the word processing field. Charlie Stross\n\nLinux only needs one 'killer' game to explode, says Battlefield director It would only take one \"killer\" game for the Linux platform to explode its way into mainstream gaming, DICE creative director Lars Gustavsson told Polygon, revealing that the development studio would \"strongly\" like to get into Linux. \"We strongly want to get into Linux for a reason,\" Gustavsson said. \"It took Halo for the first Xbox to kick off and go crazy...\" Polygon\n\nMicrosoft CEO search reveals board rifts Microsoft search for a new chief executive is exposing divisions of opinion among directors over the 38-year-old company's future direction and what it needs in its next leader.

The WSJ\n\nA hundred bucks says you won't read this story Our new hundred-dollar bill, like every other single piece of American folding money, is born in this rotary boiler. It's a perfect sphere, an angry kettle fifteen feet across, spinning high off the ground between two stained concrete towers. Most people swear out loud when they see it for the first time. A network of gears, each tooth the size of a fist, churns away in the darkness behind it.
