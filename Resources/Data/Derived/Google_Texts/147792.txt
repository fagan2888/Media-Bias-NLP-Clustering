Video USMC Pvt. Shane Martin Pulls Off Christmas Eve Surprise

Marine Pvt. Shane Martin is a good son. He sent his mother Toni a bouquet of flowers to make up for the fact he couldn't come home for Christmas. But it turned out the flowers were just a smokescreen for a surprise homecoming Martin was able to pull off on live television, with a little help from his sister.

A little background: the Martin family lives in Livonia, Mich., and was bereft at the thought of spending Christmas without their youngest, Shane. A television reporter from Detroit station WXYZ was interviewing the family about what promised to be an empty Christmas ("How tough is this for you right now?") when guess who walked through the front door?

I dare you not to cry.
