In the middle of the swirling chaos, an unanswered text message led a friend to speculate that he must be dead. He felt like he might be. His life was missing something essential \u2014 flow, lack, absence. He quit his job. He also realized that he was one of a dying breed, a person immersed in digital technology who remembered a time before email and smartphones. He wrote a book to examine what we were losing.\n\nIn \u201cThe End of Absence: Reclaiming What We\u2019ve Lost in a World of Constant Connection,\u201d Harris considers what we\u2019re giving up as we are perpetually buzzed by communication \u2014 namely: attention, personal memory, authenticity, genuine communication and time that\u2019s truly free. In this philosophical journey, he contemplates what we might save before it\u2019s too late.\n\nSalon talked to him about after-hours email, the buzz of a retweet and the vision of Neil Postman.\n\nYou describe a personal revelation at the beginning of the book that inspired you to write this. Take us back to that moment you had and talk about why you thought this was important to write about.\n\nYeah, I was working as an editor at the city magazine [Vancouver magazine], and, like a lot of office workers, I was experiencing digital overload. So I had two monitors on my desk with dozens of windows open. I had my phone that was just constantly pinging at me. And I was living like this for years and had really lost any idea of, I guess, what the value of solitude or reverie really would be, except when you lose those things, you usually aren\u2019t aware that you\u2019ve lost them. I was manically in this state of digital distraction. And then I was having this sort of exhausted day once, and someone who had been trying to get to me through text message for about five minutes grew irate and sent me a text message saying, \u201cAre you alive or what?\u201d You meant it facetiously, but I actually read it literally in that moment, and I just sort of looked up and had this kind of, Oprah would call it an \u201caha! moment,\u201d and I realized actually this isn\u2019t my life; this isn\u2019t what I want to do. I don\u2019t want to stare at glowing rectangles. I want to be able to commit myself at least occasionally to going deep into things. So I ended up quitting my job. I dove into this project, and that\u2019s about 18 months of work that became the book, \u201cThe End of Absence.\u201d\n\nA lot of people \u2014 when they hear people talk about their fears about technology and where we\u2019re headed and what it\u2019s doing to our sociology and what it\u2019s doing to our lives, some people will respond, \u201cIt\u2019s just a tool. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s the problem.\u201d That feeling that like, \u201cWe\u2019re in control. The computer\u2019s not in control, so why are you freaking out about this stuff?\u201d\n\nA couple of people while I was working on the book have called me a Luddite, but I think people who use that word \u201cLuddite\u201d actually don\u2019t know what a Luddite is, because if you look at what the Luddites really were historically, they weren\u2019t so much anti-technology as they were pro-human. They were actually fighting for workers\u2019 rights at an age when mechanical tools were being used by a manufacturing elite to really trample human rights. So I feel like I am in the Luddite position in that truer sense, because it isn\u2019t about technology good or technology bad, and I would never take that stance. It\u2019s just technology is a dangerous, beautiful tool that we have; you\u2019re right. And we need to become intelligent about the way that we use those tools. I think that we\u2019ve gone through this very giddy ride of absorbing new communication technologies, and what we\u2019re hitting now is a point where we have to start becoming intelligent about our media diets in the same way that we had to become intelligent about our food diets after we got a super abundance of sugar and fats at our disposal.\n\nThat sounds really helpful and hopeful. I mean, I think that a lot of people out there who would just say, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s too late. We\u2019re too far gone.\u201d I think that at the workplace, it\u2019s just so expected that we\u2019re going to be on all the time. How can we convince the supervisors of the people we work with that that\u2019s not always the best thing?\n\nWell, I mean I did write about that recently. You know, there was something that came out of France recently; maybe you read about it. There was this false news story that France was outlawing email after 6 p.m. It was completely false, but it became a sort of myth that was bouncing around the Internet. Oh, the lazy French are refusing to answer email after 6 p.m. from work. But I think like a lot of myths, that myth about the French told us something about ourselves.\n\nAnd there was a Gallup poll released just a month or two ago showing that most American workers believe that answering emails after work is a positive thing. They actually like that, because they believe that they\u2019re becoming free to work where and whenever they like. However, we have to ask, ultimately, are you actually getting more free time? And we don\u2019t seem to be actually getting more free time. We seem to just have higher rates of insomnia and higher rates of screen time. I mean, the average amount of screen time right now for teenagers is six to eight hours a day. They\u2019re basically online as much as they are offline. When you add the eight hours of sleep in there. So yes, we\u2019ve arrived at a sort of, at a state of perma-readiness. And what that means is we\u2019re constantly being ushered away from any moments of solitude or absence that we might have, and I think that\u2019s very dangerous, because it\u2019s those moments of solitude where we do our best thinking. So we might, I think we\u2019re working very hard by responding to a thousand little emails every day, but our managers should really ask themselves whether that\u2019s good work that\u2019s being done or whether it\u2019s just a lot of work that\u2019s being done.\n\nGood point. You talk a lot about this being our Gutenberg moment, and that we\u2019ve had big, sweeping technological changes before when the printing press came in, and this is just one of them. And people say, \u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201d This is just another transition period. But how is this rapid technological transformation different than others?\n\nIt\u2019s different, because this is a moment and not a slowly booming era. In Gutenberg\u2019s day, in 1450, the printing press comes out, but most people aren\u2019t actually literate until the 19th century. So you actually have hundreds of years of slow change. It takes centuries before the printing press\u2019s real power is unveiled. Whereas the amount of massive change happening today takes place in a single generation. So instead of a Gutenberg era or a Gutenberg shift, we have this Gutenberg moment, is what I called it in the book. And in a way, that\u2019s frightening, but in another way, it\u2019s actually hopeful, because it means you actually have people living on both sides of the moment at the same time. So I think anybody born before 1985 can remember being an adult in a pre-Internet world. So we have this great chance to actually talk with people who are younger about the world that was before. It doesn\u2019t mean that that world was better than their world. In a lot of ways, digital natives may have an exciting, fantastic new experience that we can\u2019t, that older people can\u2019t comprehend. But the exciting thing for me is the fact that we could actually have a conversation between those two generations and that we had such massively different experiences.\n\nOne thing that I notice when I talk to other educators in general, teachers and other librarians, is the sense that when it comes to technology, the kids will lead us. There\u2019s the sense that, \u201cWell, they already know how to do this stuff, so they can teach us.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t need any help using the Internet. I think they need help seeing themselves use the Internet, which is why I think we need media studies programs not just in a few universities but in high schools and elementary schools too. I think we\u2019re totally failing right now, actually, at bringing critical studies in communication and technology into younger levels of education.\n\nThat\u2019s a good point. What do you think we should be teaching them?\n\nTeaching children? You know, I wouldn\u2019t be prescriptive about it myself; I\u2019m not smart enough for that. I would just say in the same way that we have a language arts program that media arts or media studies should be built into that language arts program, and we definitely need to help children see their technological use in a historical perspective, to see that this is not the only way that the world works and that there are other goggles, other technology goggles that you can put on in front of your eyes. It really ends up being about creating intelligent media use instead of saying, \u201cThis is bad\u201d or \u201cThis is good.\u201d\n\nAnd something that you talk about in the book, you have a section, you have a chapter on confession and go into a lot of detail about kind of horrific instances when children have gone online for some kind of [positive] validation, when they should know that that\u2019s not going to happen [and what they get back is hostility]. Why do they seem so tech-literate but then also kind of naive, like they think they\u2019re going to get something [good] back then they already know that people are mean out there.\n\nIt\u2019s not only teenagers, of course, but teenagers do provide the biggest example, I guess. Everyone wants to be loved. Everyone wants to be approved. I mean, gosh, I went online and looked at my GoodReads rating this morning for the book. So we do have to be aware that these technologies create \u2014 or rather, they capitalize on our desire to be approved. We\u2019ve created these giant approval matrixes, really. It\u2019s no wonder that Facebook only lets you like things. It won\u2019t let you dislike things. We love to judge each other by giving each other star ratings and thumbs ups or whatever. But we also, even more importantly, we\u2019re all sort of these nervous children hoping we\u2019ll become approved. Online technologies create a sort of algorithmic approval system and discourage us from creating an internal approval system and I think that\u2019s one of the most insidious things that it does. It discourages us from thinking about our lives and our work from a position of solitude. It becomes a very, I guess, stereotypically adolescent frame of mind where you\u2019re constantly hoping for the approval of others instead of finding it from your own heart or own sense of self.\n\nRight. When you talk about the importance of being alone it sounds like one thing that we may lose is our ability to create our own moral compass to figure out what we think is valuable and right. We\u2019re just looking for what other people think is valuable all the time.\n\nAnd we end up giving them what we think will create a positive response instead of giving them what we actually believe or what we actually think. It sort of makes politicians of all of us, in a way.\n\nRight. That\u2019s so strange.
