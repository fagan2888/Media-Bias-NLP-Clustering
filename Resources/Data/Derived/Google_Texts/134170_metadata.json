The committee will hold a hearing on how the tax code affects the country\u2019s health care system Thursday, which could a potential venue to discuss the bill, said Sandra Ramos, a spokeswoman for the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, which signed the letter.\n\n\u201cTo provide much-needed relief, we support allowing employers to provide employees with a defined financial contribution toward the cost of health care coverage,\u201d they write. \u201cUnder this approach, employers could provide employees with a set dollar amount to use on a tax-preferred basis when purchasing health care coverage.\u201d\n\nThe bill would end IRS penalties on small business that offer tax-free HRAs to employees, which can result in thousands of dollars in fines for the companies.\n\nGroups among the signatories include the Chamber of Commerce, the Healthcare Leadership Council and the Small Business Council of America.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, the movement for nixing this nonsensical fine has tremendous momentum,\u201d CAHC President Joel White said in a statement. \u201cNot only does the bill have bipartisan, bicameral support, but more than 60 national and multi-state organizations are on board.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "Dozens of employer groups and health care advocacy organizations are urging the leaders\u00a0of the Ways and Means Committee to advance a bill they say would make it easier for small business owners to cover health care costs for employees.
