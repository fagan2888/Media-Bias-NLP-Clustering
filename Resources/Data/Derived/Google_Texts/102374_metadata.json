This post is part of a Denver Post series on TV options today \u2014 from new and existing companies. The stories may be updated over time.

This is part of an ongoing series to help readers figure out if these real-life TV plans from local TV providers and online video services might better fit your lifestyle.\n\nGet free TV for free: For TV service, start with a good HDTV antenna to receive local broadcast channels. The one-time purchase means no monthly bills. Check for available channels in your city at the Consumer Electronics Association site at antennaweb.org.\n\nCenturyLink\u2019s Internet Basics plan , both which cost $9.95 a month. CenturyLink offers 1.5 mbps speeds, while Comcast offers up to 5 mbps.\n\nLow-income consumers might qualify Comcast\u2019s Internet Essentials or\n\nShave hardware, services:Look through your bill for additional fees. Do you really need cable phone service, especially if you also pay for mobile?\n\nAnd why rent a modem? Over time, it might be cheaper to buy one. Comcast, for example, charges $10 a month for modem rental. But Arris makes a Motorola-branded modem that works with Comcast and is $70. It doesn\u2019t work with Comcast\u2019s phone service.\n\nFree full-episode TV shows are scattered around the web if you visit the channel\u2019s sites, though again, you might be limited to a computer screen. ITunes, Amazon and other sites sell single episodes and might offer the latest episode free.\n\nHulu is a great resource, but the free version doesn\u2019t work with streaming boxes. However, if you buy a screen-mirroring device like the $35 Google Chromecast, you can view the video playing on a computer or mobile device to your TV.\n\nRead the series \u2192 Cable TV, satellite, streaming: See your options, lower your bill\n\nView RSS feed\n\n\n\nVisit the Denver Post special page on consumer TV options: Visit the Denver Post special page on consumer TV options: dpo.st/tvtoday", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "antenna,Budget,cable bill,CenturyLink,Comcast,cord cutters,Google Chromecast,hulu,modem,motorola,Sling,TV Today", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "TV customer: Seriously, I'm really on a budget | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/07/19/tv-customer-seriously-im-really-budget/17979/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/07/ComcastInternet-Essentials-Media-Library-1.jpg?fit=495%2C252", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "TV customer: Seriously, I\u2019m really on a budget", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/07/19/tv-customer-seriously-im-really-budget/17979/", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/07/ComcastInternet-Essentials-Media-Library-1.jpg?fit=495%2C252", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "TV options for cheap customers: Comcast and CenturyLink offers Internet to low-income users for $9.95.
