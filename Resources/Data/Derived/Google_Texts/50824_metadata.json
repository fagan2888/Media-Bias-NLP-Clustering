Governor LePage was not at the event hosted by the Androscoggin county Chamber of Commerce and held the Ramada in Lewiston. LePage\u2019s absence left Independent Eliot Cutler and Democrat Mike Michaud to go head-to-head for the first time.\n\nThe pair do share some common ground on issues like raising the minimum wage and expanding Medicaid in Maine under the Affordable Care Act. The most glaring point the two agree on is the notion that there needs to be a new tenant in the Blaine House on November 5. Michaud, who rarely acknowledged Cutler was in the same room with him during the debate, made that point clear at one point.\n\n\u201cI just asked Eliot whether or not, can we agree that the best thing for this state is to replace the dysfunction that we\u2019ve seen over the past 3 1/2 years and vote someone new in for governor and that\u2019s one thing we actually both agree on.\u201d\n\nCutler was quick to chime in, saying, \u201cWhat we don\u2019t agree on though is who would be a better successor.\u201d That line drew laughs and applauds from the crowd of more than 300 onlookers, many of them wearing the shirts and campaign buttons from both candidates.\n\nCutler spent much of the debate hammering Michaud, on a variety of issues. For most of the morning, Michaud refused to fight back, responding by ignoring the attacks and going on the offensive against Governor LePage, who wasn\u2019t in the room. For the third straight day, Michaud continued to attack what he calls \u201cthe failed policies\u201d of the LePage Administration. LePage skipped this debate to attend a groundbreaking event in Washington County, leaving his two opponents with a little one-on-one time.\n\nAfter the debate, Michaud was asked if he was hesitant to engage Cutler, one day after the Democratic Congressman publicly dismissed the Independent as a serious contender by saying he \u201chas no pathway to victory.\u201d Once again, Michaud ignored Cutler and went after the governor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for governor and it\u2019s this governor\u2019s failed policies that are so startling when you look at Maine. He\u2019s held Maine back in a lot of different areas. The fact more children are living in poverty today, more homelessness. Forbes has us 50th once again, 47th on economic growth,\u201d Michaud said without once mentioning Eliot Cutler.\n\nThe silent treatment doesn\u2019t seem to bother Cutler all that much. When asked about it after the debate he smiled and shrugged it off.\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t bother me and I think as I say, I don\u2019t really care what Mike thinks. I care what the voters see and think and I can\u2019t imagine that they came away\u2026believing that the next leader of this state should be Michael Michaud.\u201d\n\nCutler says he\u2019s more confident he\u2019ll win in November than he was at this point in 2010, when he came within a whisker of pulling the upset, even saying he, not Michaud, is the only candidate who can beat LePage.\n\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s this big \u2018anybody but LePage\u2019 cohort of voters. There\u2019s a big \u2018anybody but Michaud\u2019 cohort of voters. I can\u2019t find an \u2018anybody but Cutler\u2019 vote anywhere in the state of Maine.\u201d\n\nTo date, there is no polling data that corroborates the statement that there is an \u201canybody but Michaud\u201d faction of voters out there.\n\nA new poll out Friday shows the race to be a dead heat. The Rasmussen Reports Poll shows:\n\n(R) Paul LePage \u2013 41%\n\n(D) Mike Michaud \u2013 40%\n\n(I) Eliot Cutler \u2013 16%\n\nUndecided: \u2013 3%\n\n(Margin of Error 3%)\n\nTo read complete poll: http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2014/maine/election_2014_maine_governor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two of the three gubernatorial candidates faced off Friday morning in their third debate.
