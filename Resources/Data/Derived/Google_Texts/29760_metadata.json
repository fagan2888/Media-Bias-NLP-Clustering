This is just weeks after the reports of multiple cases in Davision County.\n\nThis latest case involves a child under the age of ten. Like the other cases in the state, the child was not vaccinated against Measles.\n\nAfter the announcement today, the the Sioux Falls Health Department hosted a measles vaccination clinic this afternoon. Health officials offered free measles vaccinations as well as checking the records to see whether people are up to date on their shots. Sioux Falls Public Health Director Jill Franken says the goal is to get as many people vaccinated as possible. That clinic ended just two hours ago and officials say 106 people were screened, and 85 received the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe Sioux Falls Health Department really is working with conjunction with the state. We're the ones that are performing this clinic today but the state has been really good to provide us with the free vaccines being used today,\u201d Franken said.\n\nThe child attended Holy Spirit Elementary, and was there on Thursday. If your child attends that school you should check their vaccination records. The President of Sioux Falls Catholic Schools says 99 percent of students are vaccinated, and that school will continue as usual on Monday.\n\nOf the 13 other measles cases reported, nine are Mitchell area residents and four out-of-state residents. All of those cases were unvaccinated and members of the same extended family group.
