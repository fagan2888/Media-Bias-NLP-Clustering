More significantly, masked behind the discussion over prosecutorial discretion is a flagrant violation of the Constitution\u2019s core separation of powers principle that Congress, not the president, makes the law.\n\nFirst the lies, damn lies, and statistics. President Obama said that deportations are up over 80 percent. Truth be told, his administration has manipulated the definition of \u201cdeportation\u201d in order to make that claim. Those caught and turned away at the border are now included in the total, whereas before they were not. Comparing apples to apples, the Los Angeles Times reported last April that deportations are down by more than 40 percent since Obama first took office, and the New York Times reported that there was a 26 percent drop in deportations in fiscal year 2013 alone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nObama also claimed that \u201cThe actions I\u2019m taking are not only lawful, they\u2019re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic President for the past half century.\u201d False again.\n\nPresidents routinely exercise prosecutorial discretion in individual cases because they seldom have the resources to enforce every minor violation of the law. But rarely has a President engaged in such a wholesale, categorical non-enforcement of the law as Obama did two years ago with the so-called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\u201cDACA\u201d) program (which was available to anyone up to the age of 35!), and now the massively expanded program announced on November 20.\n\nThe president\u2019s largest whopper was this: \u201cNow, let\u2019s be clear about what [the new program] isn\u2019t. . . . It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive\u2014only Congress can do that. All we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re not going to deport you.\u201d\n\nNot true by a long shot. Non-deportation alone would be an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, even if wholesale, categorical non-enforcement pushes the limits of that doctrine beyond the breaking point. But Obama\u2019s new directive (which was not even issued as an executive order, but merely a \u201cmemo\u201d from the Secretary of Homeland Security) would give lawful status to the millions of people who are beneficiaries of the new policy, and afford to them work authorization and other benefits that are specifically prohibited by U.S. law.\n\nAs the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service announced with respect to the predecessor DACA program, \u201cAn individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be present in the United States, and is therefore considered by DHS to be lawfully present during the period of deferred action is in effect.\u201d That\u2019s why hundreds of thousands of DACA applicants were deemed to have \u201clegal status,\u201d obtain work authorization, and also obtain driver\u2019s licenses (which were then used to open the door to a host of other benefits available only to citizens and those with lawful permanent residence). The new program will expand that number to millions, perhaps tens of millions.\n\nObama was right about one thing: \u201cOnly Congress can do that.\u201d Indeed, there are few areas of constitutional authority that are more clearly vested in the Congress than determinations of immigration and naturalization policy. The Supreme Court has routinely described Congress\u2019s power in this area as \u201cplenary,\u201d that is, an unqualified and absolute power.\n\nBut Obama went ahead and did it anyway. Contradicting even his own express statements over the past four years that he did not have the constitutional authority to do this.\n\nCongress is not without constitutional checks on a president who abuses the powers of his office. It has the power of the purse, and it can use that power to prohibit the expenditure of funds for carrying out the president\u2019s dictate to extend work authorization to those not lawfully authorized to work.\n\nAnd there may be litigation strategies that can be employed, as well. For example, lawfully authorized workers displaced by those to whom Obama has unlawfully extended work authorization have the kind of particularized injury that would give them legal standing to challenge the new policy. Workers compensation insurance carriers, too, might be able to challenge the policy, which forces them to extend coverage to those not legally able to work.\n\nWhatever path is pursued, it is critical that this constitutional crisis not go unanswered; the rule of law itself is at stake.\n\nEastman is the Henry Salvatori Professor of Law & Community Service at Chapman University\u2019s Fowler School of Law, the director of the Claremont Institute\u2019s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, and the chairman of the Federalist Society\u2019s Federalism & Separation of Powers Practice Group.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lies, damn lies, and statistics.", "description": "Lies, damn lies, and statistics.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lies, damn lies, and statistics.", "title": "Congress has options to answer Obama\u2019s dishonest executive amnesty", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/225412-congress-has-options-to-answer-obamas-dishonest-executive", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/225412-congress-has-options-to-answer-obamas-dishonest-executive", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-28T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "John C.
