Ann Romney sat down Friday with Fox News’ Bill Hemmer to discuss the new “MITT” documentary about her husband’s long journey for the White House.

“That was tough,” Romney said on losing the 2012 election. “It brings up all those feelings that you had. And I believe this, I really believe this, you know, we lost but truly the country lost by not having Mitt [Romney] as president.”

“How do you think President Obama’s doing?” Hemmer asked.

“I think I’ll be polite and nice and not comment on that,” Romney replied.

Romney added that she “always believed [Mitt] was going to be the president of the United States.”

“I just knew the country needed him, and I believed he was going to be there,” she said. “I knew he was going to make a huge difference for Americans lives. We spent so much time on the road we felt the hurt of so many people suffering without jobs. And I really believed Mitt was going to be there to help the country get back on its feet economically.”

Hemmer pointed out that Mitt Romney was leading the polls in New Hampshire for the 2016 presidential election, but Mrs. Romney was emphatic that there will not be another run.

“I run across people all the time and they’re still upset about the election, they are still really sad so I can understand that,” she said. “But no, we’re not up for doing this again.”
