That includes agricultural workers in Latin America and the Caribbean, whose livelihood is at risk, and the consumers of premium coffee, who may have to start paying even more to support their habit.\n\nIn the two years during which it\u2019s swept across the region, coffee rust, known locally as la roya, has already caused $1 billion in damage, according to USAID. \u201cThe current coffee rust outbreak is the worst in Latin America\u2019s history,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cIt is estimated that production will fall by as much as 15-40 percent in the coming years.\u201d Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nWhy is this such a big deal?\n\nThat fancy coffee you splurge on every morning will start to look like a bargain compared to how expensive it could wind up becoming, leaving consumers with the choice of either coughing up the extra money or switching over to gross, non-fancy coffee from Asia and other non-infected regions. Right now, Ric Rhinehart of the Specialty Coffee Association of America told the Associated Press, it\u2019s only small-scale specialty businesses that have been forced to raise their prices \u2014 larger companies, like Starbucks, say their broad range of suppliers has allowed them to source enough coffee to keep prices stable, for the time being. In a worst-case scenario, he added, you\u2019ll be paying \u201cextraordinarily high prices for those coffees, if you can find them at all.\u201d\n\nWhy is this really such a big deal?\n\nThe panic over coffee rust has less to do with concern over high-end taste buds and more to do with the serious threat the disease poses to Central American workers. Coffee-based agriculture is a major industry in the regions currently being hit; the outbreak, as the New York Times reported earlier this month, threatens to completely upend vital segments of the economy, to far-reaching effect:\n\nBig farmers hire fewer workers to pick the ripe coffee cherries that enclose the beans. Smaller farmers go into debt and sell livestock or tools to make up for the lost income. Sales fall at local merchants. Teenagers leave school to work on the farm because their parents can no longer hire outside help. At the very end of the chain are the landless migrant workers who earn just a few dollars a day. \u2026\u201cRoya has exposed the depth of the social and economic problems in terms of people\u2019s vulnerability to the market and to climate change,\u201d said Peter Loach, the Guatemala director of Mercy Corps, an aid agency. \u201cWhat makes it different and complicated is that it\u2019s a slow-onset natural disaster over two to three years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "We have climate change to thank for this, too", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "We have climate change to thank for this, too", "title": "A nasty fungus threatens to obliterate our supply of premium coffee", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/19/a_nasty_fungus_threatens_to_obliterate_our_supply_of_premium_coffee/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_108419948.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We have climate change to thank for this, too", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/shutterstock_108419948.jpg", "title": "A nasty fungus threatens to obliterate our supply of premium coffee", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "A nasty fungus threatens to obliterate our supply of premium coffee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Agriculture, Central America, Climate Change, Coffee, Guatemala, Starbucks, USAID", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf948\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe current coffee rust outbreak is the worst in Latin America\u2019s history,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\nIn the two years during which it\u2019s swept across the region, coffee rust, known locally as la roya, has already caused $1 billion in damage, according to USAID.\nThe panic over coffee rust has less to do with concern over high-end taste buds and more to do with the serious threat the disease poses to Central American workers.\nTopics: Agriculture, Central America, Climate Change, Coffee, Guatemala, Starbucks, USAID, Sustainability News, Business News, NewsA highly contagious fungal disease is wiping out Central America\u2019s coffee plants, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) warned Sunday, with dramatic implications for the coffee-dependent.\nThat includes agricultural workers in Latin America and the Caribbean, whose livelihood is at risk, and the consumers of premium coffee, who may have to start paying even more to support their habit."}
