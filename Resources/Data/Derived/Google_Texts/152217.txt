Alyssa Milano had a bottle of her pumped breastmilk confiscated while traveling out of London’s Heathrow Airport this past weekend. Although the confiscation was in line with the airport's protocol, Milano has brought attention to how impractical travel regulations are for nursing moms.

According to Heathrow Airport security protocol, individuals are not permitted to fly with more than 3 oz. of liquids. Although there is an exception to this rule in the case of breastmilk, this is only permitted if the mother is physically traveling with her child and plans on feeding the milk during the duration of the flight. But this past Friday, Milano attempted to board a plane out of London Heathrow without her daughter and had her 10 oz. of breastmilk confiscated.

Although Milano raised a fair point, the security guards stood by their decision to confiscate the breast milk. As explained on Heathrow’s website, any bottle containing over 3 oz. of liquid must be stored as luggage.

Milano’s story highlights the plight of breastfeeding women, especially when travelling. It was only last month that an Australian airlines went as far as to kick a woman off her flight because she refused to stop breastfeeding her son during takeoff, Gold Coast Bulletin reported. The mother met with both federal and local police after being escorted off the plane but did not face charges.
