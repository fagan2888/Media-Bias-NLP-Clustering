I'm on my way up to New York from Washington and ran into former Fed head Ben Bernanke waiting for the train.

Here's a 15 second interview with him. Is his life better now that he's no longer running the nation's central bank? "Absolutely." Does he think the Fed should be audited? Er, he doesn't want to do an interview.
