And, if you\u2019re interested in a career in healthcare, the news is good.\n\nIn the next decade, the state will need nearly 450,000 more workers in all areas of healthcare \u2013 from lab technicians to dental hygienists to medical support positions, according to, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s Health Workforce Needs: Training Allied Workers,\u201d a report released last week from the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC).\n\nAnd the reason for the growing need? According to the study, it is the combination of population growth, an aging demographic and expanded coverage under the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\n\u201cI think the one thing that was really interesting to us was that a large share of the jobs and future jobs in healthcare services will require a two-year certificate or a short-term certificate, not necessarily a four-year degree or higher,\u201d said Sarah Bohn, a research fellow at PPIC and one of the study\u2019s authors. She added, \u201cWe often talk about the need for more doctors and that\u2019s definitely a big component, but we also have this allied work force which includes a lot of the skilled professionals and others that are providing services.\u201d\n\nTo be more precise, the study showed that 40 percent of those needed jobs require some post-secondary training but less than a bachelor's degree. At the same time, education levels of the workforce aren't keeping up with the demand for these types of skilled workers.\n\nJennifer Fleischner, a nursing student at Pasadena City College, is optimistic about her future. She returned to community college after taking several years off to work in retail and care for her family. \u201cI started thinking about what I wanted to do with the rest of my life and I wanted to do something that was really a career, a profession.\u201d\n\nWith Fleischner and others interested in working in the healthcare field, the future of the workforce will rely heavily on the state\u2019s Community College System. And the state is responding in a positive way. This year, the state budgeted $50 million for career technical education, adopting a new \u201cshared investment\u201d funding model that will allocate the funds to regions for further distribution, instead of diffusing them among all community colleges.\n\nAlso lawmakers included $250 million in the 2014-2015 budget for the Career Pathways Trust program, a work-based learning grant program. The California Economic Summit's Workforce Action Team supported the initiatives.\n\nAccording to Bohn, the funding increases are a good start. \u201cThere are a lot of efforts under way that I think are great to try to expand the pathways from education to career and to address what are the growing and in demand fields within the state.\u201d\n\nBut more needs to be done to satisfy the demand and she suggested looking at the situation from a different angle. Bohn added, \u201cI want to think about it from the student perspective in the long term, thinking about where the state is investing their resources and where the colleges are investing their resources and encouraging policy makers to take the lens of the eventual economic success and well-being of the student.\u201d\n\nShe added that sometimes students aren\u2019t always aware of the opportunities available to them and which ones will best pay-off in the long run.\n\nFor Fleischner, she\u2019s looking forward to steady employment and a flexible work schedule. \u201cThere\u2019s a salary and a lot of demand and I can create my own schedule. Because one of the things that I thought I can do would be in-home health care, so I can freelance.\u201d\n\nShowing students the lucrative pathways available and boosting vocational programs across California will be essential to filling this skills gap and showing support for both the healthcare of Californians and the workers who fill those jobs.\n\nCategories: Workforce", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "State will need 450,000 more healthcare workers", "title": "Report: Skills gap to accelerate healthcare worker shortage in California"}, "keywords": "California economy, California business , California unemployment, California budget, California job openings, California recovery, Manufacturing in California, California economic, California jobs hiring, California small business, California budget cuts", "fb": {"admins": 427619149647, "app_id": 197215047053392}, "description": "State will need 450,000 more healthcare workers"}, "article_summary": "Report: Skills gap to accelerate healthcare worker shortage in CaliforniaCalifornia is facing a healthcare crisis, but it may not be what many think.\nAlso lawmakers included $250 million in the 2014-2015 budget for the Career Pathways Trust program, a work-based learning grant program.\nAnd, if you\u2019re interested in a career in healthcare, the news is good.\nAt the same time, education levels of the workforce aren't keeping up with the demand for these types of skilled workers.\nShe returned to community college after taking several years off to work in retail and care for her family."}
