The policy is intended to \u201csend a simple and strong message \u2014 tobacco use in sports will no longer harm our youth or our health,\u201d said Mark Farrell of the Board Of Supervisors, who sponsored the bill, according to CNN. Violators will be asked to leave the playing fields.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar image; baseball players, with their lumpy mouths, chewing and spitting their tobacco onto the field. But with scores of children looking up to these players as role models, both public health officials and the Giants team see the new policy as a step in a positive direction. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 6.4 percent of high schoolers and 1.7 percent of middle schoolers use smokeless tobacco. And studies have also shown that many of these kids not only chew tobacco but smoke it through cigarettes as well.\n\n\u201cThe home of the World Champion Giants has set an example that all of Major League Baseball and the rest of the country should quickly follow,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, according to CNN. \u201cWhen baseball stars use smokeless tobacco, the kids who look up to them are much more likely to as well. Our national pastime should have nothing to do with promoting a deadly and addictive product.\u201d\n\nLee signed the bill just a day before what would have been the 55th birthday of baseball hall of famer Tony Gwynn, who died last year from cancer in his salivary gland. It\u2019s widely suspected he developed the cancer from smokeless tobacco.\n\nSmokeless tobacco use is widespread throughout the MLB. While the Giants\u2019 manager Bruce Bochy said it \u201ccan be a good thing,\u201d he also noted that \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard to enforce. It\u2019s a tough habit to break.\u201d Other players echoed that sentiment. Matt Cain, the team\u2019s player representative and pitcher, told MLB.com that \u201ccoffee pouches (another product players chew) resemble tobacco pouches. I think the hard part will be policing it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "san, francisco, bans, chewing, tobacco, sports, venues, hoping, send, better, message, kids", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Baseball players visiting San Francisco's AT&T Park will no longer be allowed to use smokeless tobacco while on the field, a move that's expected to discourage kids from taking up the unhealthy habit.", "title": "San Francisco Bans Chewing Tobacco In Sports Venues, Setting An Example For Kids", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/san-francisco-bans-chewing-tobacco-sports-venues-hoping-send-better-message-kids-332730", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/10/san-francisco-giants.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Baseball players visiting San Francisco's AT&T Park will no longer be allowed to use smokeless tobacco while on the field, a move that's expected to discourage kids from taking up the unhealthy habit.", "title": "San Francisco Bans Chewing Tobacco In Sports Venues, Setting An Example For Kids", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/san-francisco-bans-chewing-tobacco-sports-venues-hoping-send-better-message-kids-332730", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/10/san-francisco-giants.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/10/san-francisco-giants.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-05-10T14:47:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-10T14:48:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Baseball players visiting San Francisco's AT&T Park will no longer be allowed to use smokeless tobacco while on the field, a move that's expected to discourage kids from taking up the unhealthy habit."}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen baseball stars use smokeless tobacco, the kids who look up to them are much more likely to as well.\nIt\u2019s a familiar image; baseball players, with their lumpy mouths, chewing and spitting their tobacco onto the field.\nIt\u2019s widely suspected he developed the cancer from smokeless tobacco.\nLong a tradition in baseball, players will no longer be allowed to use smokeless tobacco products in San Francisco sports venues, making the city the first in the country to implement such a restriction.\nSmokeless tobacco use is widespread throughout the MLB."}
