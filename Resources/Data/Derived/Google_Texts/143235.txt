Every year, under the Friday night lights, millions of high school football players are injured often the result of a tackle. This season some Oklahoma players have been hospitalized because of the game.

So far, this high school football season, at least three players have been airlifted from the field. One young man didn't survive.

The latest incident happened Friday in Deer Creek.

The OSSAA spoke to News 9 on their efforts to keep you children safe.

“It is part of football life. It's what you accept when you participate,” said Mike Whaley of OSSAA and a former football coach of 30 years.

Every year, under the Friday night lights, millions of high school football players are injured often the result of a tackle. This season some Oklahoma players have been hospitalized because of the game.

In September, Ben Hamm of Bartlesville Wesleyan Christian High School died.

"He'd had a history of concussions and he'd had a brain bleed before," said Jacob Hamm, Ben’s brother.

Hamm, a junior linebacker, suffered a head injury after what seemed like a routine tackle.

In October, Hudson Haws of Bethany High School suffered a spinal injury as the result of a tackle. And then Friday night, an Ardmore player was airlifted off the field during a playoff game.

All injuries are reported to Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association, which then shares the report with the National Federation of State High School Associations.

“I'm not sure that I could tell you that all the injuries we're seeing today in the last 6-7 months would have been things addressed by the rules committee in the last several years,” said Whaley.

That committee reviews each injury and its cause to see if a new rule or adjusted rule would prevent another player from falling victim.
