Texas Gov. Greg Abbott charges the Supreme Court is "more of a political body than it has ever been" â€” and "deserves to be swept up into the political process."At a Heritage Foundation event in Washington, D.C., Abbott also laid into the high court's Chief Justice John Roberts,"Chief Justice John Roberts is the tip of the spear in playing politics," Abbott said. "Chief Justice John Roberts knowingly, clearly and unabashedly re-wrote Obamacare twice. What we are seeing is nothing more than naked politics being played by the United States Supreme Court."He argues the Supreme Court has increasingly shown its partisan bent."Now, more than ever the United States Supreme Court has shed its clothing as being guardians of the law," Abbott charged, the Chronicle reports."The United States Supreme Court is more of a political body than it has ever been in the United States of America. And because, on its own, by its own fault, as an institution, it has chosen to be a political body, it deserves to be swept up into the political process."The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, have said theon the court vacated by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February rather than make a selection in "this hyper-partisan election year."Abbott said he agrees with their refusal to hold hearings for President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nomination Merrick Garland, the Chronicle reports."Why should they go through a dog and pony show when they have concluded that they are not going to consent to confirming this nominee?" he asked.
