Greg Davids, R-Preston, in a Tuesday letter to MNsure Chief Executive Allison O\u2019Toole.\n\nMNsure said in a statement that it is communicating with health insurers \u201cto determine the most appropriate solution for Minnesotans who may have been impacted by yesterday\u2019s rush.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent e-mail, Delaney said it\u2019s too early to say whether some sort of grace period might be offered.\n\nThe outside vendor that helps MNsure field calls is based in Burnsville, Delaney said, but has operations in Rockford, Ill. That city was hit by storms on Monday.\n\nWhereas MNsure had 154 agents answering more than 7,000 calls on Monday, Dec. 14, there were just 110 agents handling more than 10,000 calls on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe had all available agents on the phone,\u201d Delaney wrote. \u201cOur overflow vendor had 43 agents call in absent [Monday] due to ice storms.\u201d\n\nMinnesota launched the MNsure exchange two years ago to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires almost all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\n\nMNsure is an option for the roughly 300,000 state residents who buy health insurance on their own, rather than receiving coverage from an employer or the government.\n\nLong waits at the MNsure call center were the hallmark of MNsure\u2019s troubled debut in 2013, when daily averages in at least one case hit the two-hour mark.\n\nBack then, consumers who were stuck waiting on deadline day got the chance for a retroactive tax credit, Davids wrote, if they completed a special form or otherwise demonstrated an effort to enroll.\n\n\u201cMNsure should reinstate the retroactive tax credit and coverage policy for consumers who faced similar difficulties over the past weeks,\u201d Davids wrote. \u201cIn addition to hourlong call center waits, hundreds of consumers lost applications due to MNsure system failures and those fortunate to have completed an application are waiting weeks for their insurance cards.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Star Tribune reported that an estimated 600 people had to start their online enrollments over after hitting a faulty \u201csave and exit\u201d button, which in some cases lost the partial applications. MNsure said it has since fixed the problem, as well as one related to federal tax credits that discount premium costs.\n\nThis week, the Star Tribune reported that callers waited an average of nearly 50 minutes for call center help on Sunday \u2014 a problem that MNsure attributed to underestimating demand. In his letter Tuesday, Davids called the explanation an excuse that is \u201cbetter suited for a high school student turning in a late essay, not a $300 million taxpayer-funded enterprise.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, MNsure said the current open enrollment period began nearly two months ago on Nov. 1. A previous Dec. 15 deadline for January coverage was extended until Monday to give Minnesotans more time to enroll, the statement noted.\n\nOpen enrollment continues until Jan. 31, with deadlines next month for coverage that begins in February and March. The experience from previous years, MNsure said, has shown that call volume and demand are high on deadline days.\n\n\u201cIf Minnesotans contact us on a deadline day, or wait until the final hours to enroll in coverage, they will encounter delays,\u201d MNsure said. The statement added: \u201cThere will always be politicians that read headlines and try to cause problems rather than find solutions.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 40 call-center workers in Illinois didn't make it to work Monday, a deadline day.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "More than 40 call-center workers in Illinois didn't make it to work Monday, a deadline day.", "title": "MNsure says storm-related call-center shortage was a factor in Monday waits", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-says-storm-related-call-center-shortage-was-a-factor-in-monday-waits/363785881/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145144340525553.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145144340525553.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 40 call-center workers in Illinois didn't make it to work Monday, a deadline day.", "title": "MNsure says storm-related call-center shortage was a factor in Monday waits", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-says-storm-related-call-center-shortage-was-a-factor-in-monday-waits/363785881/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145144340525553.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145144340525553.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "storms in Illinois"}, "news_keywords": "MNsure,call waits,deadline,storms in Illinois"}, "article_summary": "MNsure spokesman Shane Delaney said Tuesday that the overflow vendor had 43 workers call in absent because of bad weather.\n\u201cWe had all available agents on the phone,\u201d Delaney wrote.\nThe experience from previous years, MNsure said, has shown that call volume and demand are high on deadline days.\n\u201cMNsure should reinstate the retroactive tax credit and coverage policy for consumers who faced similar difficulties over the past weeks,\u201d Davids wrote.\nMNsure\u2019s explanation came after Republicans on Tuesday called for the exchange to offer a grace period for people who encountered long waits before the deadline."}
