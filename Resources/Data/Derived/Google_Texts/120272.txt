I have no idea why National Review decided to run this Cato craziness, except that any attack on Rubio seems fair game. I'm not a Rubio fan, but arguments like this are just silly.

The centerpiece of Rubio’s proposal would “provid[e] every American with an advanceable, refundable tax credit that can be used to purchase insurance.” What does that mean? If you purchase a government-approved health plan, you could save, for example, $2,000 on your taxes. If you don’t, you pay that $2,000 to the government. That is exactly how Obamacare’s individual mandate works.

No. That is not how Obamacare's individual mandate works.

And if tax credits are now an individual mandate, then...

1. The term has no meaning

2. We all have a ton of individual mandates for everything that we could potentially get a tax credit for

There are no doubt people at Cato who would like to make that argument, but there's a big difference between money you could get and money you must pay. It actually tends to be the left that makes this type of argument. You could argue that the entire tax system is an individual mandate to be poor. It's a neat line and you could see Rubio or Cruz delivering it, but in this case it deliberately confuses the issue.
