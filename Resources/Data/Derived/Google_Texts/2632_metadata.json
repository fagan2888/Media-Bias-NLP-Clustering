John Kasich accompanied by former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a town hall Tuesday in North Canton, Ohio. \u2014Matt Rourke / AP\n\nMitt Romney hasn\u2019t officially endorsed a Republican presidential candidate \u2014 at least not nationally.\n\nOn the eve of Tuesday\u2019s primaries, the former Massachusetts governor hit the campaign trail with John Kasich in the Ohio governor\u2019s home state.\n\nWATCH: @MittRomney campaigns with @JohnKasich: \"This is the guy Ohio needs to vote for.\" https://t.co/W8z4nToRX8 https://t.co/cml89I2GeP \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) March 14, 2016\n\n\u201cThis is the guy that Ohio needs to vote for,\u2019\u2019 Romney said during a town hall Monday in North Canton. He will also join Kasich at a 6 p.m. town hall outside of Columbus.\n\nAs part of his anti-Donald Trump crusade, Romney hass said Republican voters should back the candidate with the best chance of defeating the GOP front-runner \u2014 whether its Kasich in Ohio or Marco Rubio is his home state of Florida.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s town hall, Romney used stark terms when juxtaposing Kasich with his Republican opponents.\n\n\u201cUnlike the other people running, he has a real track record,\u2019\u2019 the 2012 GOP nominee said of Kasich. \u201cHe has the kind of record that you want in Washington and that\u2019s why I\u2019m convinced that you\u2019re going to do the right thing tomorrow.

During his five-year tenure in the Buckeye State\u2019s corner office, Kasich accepted the expansion of Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act, unlike many of his Republican counterparts. He also closed Ohio\u2019s budget deficit, while cutting income taxes \u2014 but also cutting local aid and raising sales taxes.\n\nRomney has said he expects to endorse a candidate later this month, if a clear alternative candidate to Trump emerges. Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio hold their respective primaries for both parties Tuesday, with Arizona and Utah to follow next week.\n\nKasich \u2014 currently last among the four remaining Republican candidates with 63 delegates (Trump has 460) \u2014 has said if he doesn\u2019t win Ohio, \u201cit\u2019s time to call it over.\u2019\u2019 But the governor also said he thinks he can overcome his delegate deficit by the convention with the springtime slate of Northeastern primaries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMarch Madness, home court advantage,\u2019\u2019 Kasich told the Washington Post, referring to the upcoming primary schedule. \u201cIt starts to work for us. We will do well in places like Pennsylvania [\u2026] like Maryland and Connecticut and New Jersey and New York. And then we\u2019re going to hitch up a covered wagon and head west.\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Mitt Romney hasn\u2019t officially endorsed a Republican presidential candidate \u2014 at least not nationally.
