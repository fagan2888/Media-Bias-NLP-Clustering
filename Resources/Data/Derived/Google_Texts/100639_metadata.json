Who knows what could happen? But I\u2019m excited about it, though.\u201d\n\nTurns out, he wasn\u2019t joking. Not even a little.\n\nTebow has been been making regular trips to Scottsdale, Ariz., this summer to work out with trainer Ian Danney at Performance Enhancement Professionals, getting in reps in the gym and playing \u201cDanneyball,\u201d a version of beach volleyball created by Danney that uses a medicine ball. To work on his throwing, Tebow said he has also been making trips to Los Angeles to work with Tom House, a former MLB pitcher who has helped other NFL quarterbacks, including Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Carson Palmer.\n\n\u201cI feel great,\u201d Tebow told Fox 10 Phoenix, which obtained exclusive footage of his workouts in Arizona. \u201cI feel the strongest, healthiest, throwing the best I ever have. I\u2019m just really excited about the improvement.\u201d\n\nTebow, who was drafted by the Broncos in 2010 but played in only 17 games before Denver brought in Peyton Manning, signed on with the soon-to-launch SEC Network to serve as a host on \u201cSEC Nation.\u201d In recent months, though, he\u2019s made it clear that his long-term goal reside on the field, not in the studio.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite quotes is, \u2018I don\u2019t know what my future holds, but I know who holds my future,'\u201d Tebow told Fox 10. \u201cAnd that gives you peace to just continue to work and to go after what your heart desires. And when you do that, I think you don\u2019t have any regrets. I think that\u2019s the best way to live life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Carson Palmer,Drew Brees,Peyton Manning,quarterbacks,SEC Network,Tim Tebow,Tom Brady", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Former Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow has made trips to Arizona and Los Angeles to work with training and throwing specialists so he can return to the NFL.", "title": "WATCH: Tim Tebow in the gym, still working toward NFL comeback", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/21/watch-tim-tebow/28249/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/tebow-training.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Former Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow has made trips to Arizona and Los Angeles to work with training and throwing specialists so he can return to the NFL.", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/07/21/watch-tim-tebow/28249/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/07/tebow-training.jpg", "title": "WATCH: Tim Tebow in the gym, still working toward NFL comeback", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Former Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow has made trips to Arizona and Los Angeles to work with training and throwing specialists so he can return to the NFL."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17d8\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this summer, former Broncos quarterback and Heisman winner Tim Tebow told The Tennessean that he was working toward an NFL comeback.\n\u201cOne of my favorite quotes is, \u2018I don\u2019t know what my future holds, but I know who holds my future,'\u201d Tebow told Fox 10.\n\u201cI\u2019m training every day and feel like I\u2019m the best that I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Tebow told the paper in June.\n\u201cI feel great,\u201d Tebow told Fox 10 Phoenix, which obtained exclusive footage of his workouts in Arizona.\n\u201cI still love it, love playing, talking about it, and I\u2019m just excited about whatever the future holds."}
