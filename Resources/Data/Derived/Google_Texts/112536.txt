Mason City, IA

Animal welfare officials in Iowa are searching for the person who dumped newborn kittens in a gas station dumpster in Mason City.



A gas station employee saw someone throw a black garbage bag Thursday into the trash bin outside of the business. The bag contained eight kittens.



The kittens were taken to the Mason City Stray Animal Shelter, where they died.



Sybil Soukup, executive director of the Humane Society of North Iowa, says the kittens were so young that their umbilical cords were still attached.



Anyone with information is asked to call Mason City police at 641-421-3636.
