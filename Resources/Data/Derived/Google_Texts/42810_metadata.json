Department of Health and Human Services data for the 36 states using Healthcare.gov show that the lowest-cost bronze plan, on average, costs 26% more than the cheapest catastrophic plan. Yet bronze plans only cover about 5% more of the insured group\u2019s costs.\n\nSetting aside this group selecting catastrophic plans in a younger, healthier pool significantly alters the profile of eHealth\u2019s additions to ObamaCare\u2019s primary state risk pools \u2014 and not in a good way. The 42% young-adult share among eHealth enrollees \u2014 an over-representation relative to their 40% share of potential ObamaCare enrollment \u2014 falls to about 34% of entrants to primary risk pools, an IBD analysis finds.\n\nThe risk is that as premiums rise over time, these lower-priced catastrophic policies will look increasingly attractive to the young and healthy, leaving the main risk pool older, in poorer health and more costly.\n\nPremium Shift\n\nA possible preview of that future came in the past week as insurers announced 2015 rates. In Connecticut, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield proposed to lower its catastrophic plan premiums by 4.8% while raising premiums for its other plans by 12.4%, the Connecticut Mirror reported.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act specified that all insured would be grouped in a single risk pool, but HHS regulations adopted last year effectively created a separate catastrophic pool primarily for those up to age 30.\n\nThe apparent reason HHS made this change, despite warnings from liberal groups like Families USA, was to make coverage affordable for young adults who earn too much to qualify for subsidies. The Obama administration judged that the downside would be limited because people can\u2019t use subsidies to buy catastrophic coverage. Yet, catastrophic coverage is already looking like a better deal for some subsidy-eligible young adults earning about 250% of the poverty level or higher.\n\nCatastrophic coverage also is available to older people who qualify for a hardship because bronze coverage costs more than 8% of income. The White House extended that hardship to anyone receiving a plan cancellation notice.\n\nOn the federal exchange, about 89,000 people, or 12% of people signing up without subsidies, opted for catastrophic policies. Of those, 85% were age 34 or younger.\n\nOverall, HHS reported that young adults accounted for 28% of 8 million sign-ups. Once the numbers are adjusted based on paid enrollment and catastrophic selections, the young-adult share may fall to 25%.\n\nThe eHealth data are the most detailed available on ObamaCare plan purchases off the subsidized exchanges, but they have limitations.\n\nThe data cover 213,000 applications submitted during the open-enrollment period, just a fraction of a few million ObamaCare policies that have been sold off the exchanges.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that eHealth shoppers are younger and more tech-savvy than typical off-exchange buyers, who may go directly to a big insurance carrier with whom they have an established relationship.\n\nFurther, the data don\u2019t winnow out plans sold in a state by carriers who aren\u2019t participating in that state\u2019s exchange and who aren\u2019t included in ObamaCare\u2019s big risk pools.\n\nThe risk-pooling requirements go hand in hand with the law\u2019s guarantees that coverage will be available to all at a cost that doesn\u2019t take health status into account. To further discourage carriers from seeking out the most profitable customers or shying away from the sick, ObamaCare transfers payments from carriers with below-average risk to those who take on above-average risk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Much of the attention from the public and the press has been on who has signed up for ObamaCare exchange plans, but what happens in the off-exchange market is", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Much of the attention from the public and the press has been on who has signed up for ObamaCare exchange plans, but what happens in the off-exchange market is also important.
