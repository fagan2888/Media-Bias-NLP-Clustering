The catch-all bill funds the federal government through Sept. 30, 2016.\n\nThe type of expenditures vary quite a bit, covering benefit extensions for 9/11 first-responders and an increase in research dollars for the National Institutes of Health. The bill lumps together multiple spending bills.\n\nAt PolitiFact Arizona, we were most interested in Trump\u2019s claim that the omnibus \"funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment.\n\nMaybe because that\u2019s because Trump is wrong.\n\nThe omnibus bill does not fund undocumented immigrants \"coming in and through\" the border. In fact, it funds the very agency tasked with keeping undocumented immigrants out, U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\"The salary of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is contained in that bill,\" said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. \"If they weren\u2019t funded, they\u2019d have to stop patrolling.\"\n\nWhat Trump could have meant -- though it\u2019s not what he said -- is that undocumented immigrants in the United States may be benefitting from subsidies such as food stamps through their children. But again, that\u2019s not what he said.\n\n\"There\u2019s not ...a budget item for illegal immigration,\" said Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University.\n\nObamacare, Syrians entering the U.S.\n\nThis fact-check focuses on Trump's claim about undocumented immigrants. But since he also mentioned Obamacare and funding \"Syrians coming into the United States,\" we thought it might be useful to address those claims as well.\n\nMost of the spending associated with President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care is mandatory spending and not part of the omnibus. But the omnibus did include relatively small amounts of discretionary spending, which includes services such as community health clinics. The bill also funded the Health and Human Services Department, which received $75.2 billion.\n\nDe Rugy said the bill pays for \"only a little\" of the Affordable Care Act, namely administrative costs.\n\nThe omnibus provides humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees in Jordan. The bill also funds refugees, in general, settling in the United States. It does not specifically fund Syrian refugees.\n\n\"Those restrictions were left out of the omnibus. You\u2019re funding the normal immigration process,\" said Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition, which advocates for eliminating budget deficits.\n\nDartmouth College government professor Joseph Bafumi noted that these refugees \"could be Syrian.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, 1,682 Syrians entered the United States as of Dec. 31, 2015. Still, that\u2019s less than 3 percent of the 69,933 total refugees admitted to the United States for fiscal year 2015.\n\nOur ruling\n\nTrump criticized the \"omnibus\" spending bill passed by Congress and signed by Obama in December, saying it \"funds illegal immigrants coming in and through your border, right through Phoenix,\" among other things.\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. It actually funds the agency trying to keep people from crossing the border illegally.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is wildly wrong.
