Stress also has physical effects, increasing our risk for cancer, heart disease, and obesity. It turns out that job stress in particular can have a negative effect on your productivity at work \u2014 as a new study points out that high pressure jobs are linked to more sick days and mental illness among workers.\n\nThe researchers, out of Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, analyzed data from a Swedish national twin study involving 12,000 workers to see whether there was a link between mental health-related sick leave and high stress at work (referred to as psychosocial factors in the study). Among the 12,000 workers taking sick leave, about eight percent of them did it for mental health reasons; and the majority (three-fourths) of those were women.\n\nThe psychosocial factors that go into high stress at work included high demands with little control, as well as low levels of social support at the office. Many of these things you can\u2019t control \u2014 but the researchers found, interestingly, that certain workers had protective behaviors that prevented stress from getting out of hand. That included a healthy lifestyle, exercise in particular.\n\nPutting too much of a strain on employees, then, can ultimately backfire. A 2013 study found that moderate workaholics \u2014 people who worked hard, not smart \u2014 were actually less likely to perform well at their jobs. They placed so much physical and mental strain on themselves that they wore themselves out, resulting in memory, sleep, and stomach problems. The authors point out that lack of recovery time leads to a \u201cbreakdown at an emotive or cognitive level.\u201d\n\nSo how can you improve your situation at work? The reality is, we will spend most of our time in the office, paying bills, or running errands \u2014 but there are ways to work smart rather than hard. Time management can help you focus on one thing at a time without overwhelming yourself. Giving yourself limited time to work on a project will prevent you from procrastinating or wasting time, make you focus harder, and ultimately spend less time on it.\n\nThen there\u2019s sleep. Scheduling in two hours of rest or leisure every evening, booking eight or nine hours of sleep every night, and sticking to it will greatly improve your productivity and decrease stress levels. Proper sleep improves your immune system, memory, cognitive function, and protects you against a lot of chronic diseases.\n\nIf being in an office brings you down, go for a half-hour walk every day after lunch, and plan a relaxing physical activity before or after work. Exercise doesn\u2019t always have to be a pain; it can be your allotted time to release tension, take your time, and focus on breathing and meditating. Exercise has been proven repeatedly to be a great way to reduce stress.\n\n\u201cInterventions to reduce sick leave due to mental disorders that focus on improving the psychosocial work environment, especially reducing high psychosocial job demands, may prove effective,\u201d Lisa Mather, an author of the study, writes.\n\nAnd sometimes those interventions mean changing your work experience, not just adjusting your lifestyle outside of work. Whether that means taking walks, reducing distractions (scheduling time to stay away from the phone, e-mails, or meetings), improving your social connections at work, or simply realizing that not everything is in your control \u2014 improving the psychosocial balance at work will help lower those cortisol levels and give you more energy.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have to learn that sleep and rest are often more important than working that extra hour. The world is your oyster \u2014 but you have to take care of yourself first so you have the physical energy and mental capacity to do your thing.\n\nSource: Mather L et al.
