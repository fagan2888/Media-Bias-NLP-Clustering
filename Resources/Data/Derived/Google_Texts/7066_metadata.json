Among his votes were against removing the Confederate emblem from Georgia\u2019s state flag; in favor of a \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plate that helped fund anti-abortion groups; and in favor of strengthening parental consent laws to require a photo ID and for parents to accompany daughters under the age of 18 to abortion clinics \u2014 with no exception for rape or incest.\n\nMore relevant to the LGBT rights movement, Boggs in 2004 voted for legislation authorizing the referendum on the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in Georgia. It\u2019s unclear whether he still holds that position, or, like many other lawmakers, he has since evolved to support marriage equality.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of 27 progressive groups \u2014 including a trio of LGBT groups, the Human Rights Campaign, GetEQUAL Action, and the National Gay & Lesbian Task Force \u2014 wrote to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to urge them to reject Boggs.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Boggs\u2019s record on reproductive rights, civil rights, and LGBT rights is especially troubling in a nominee to the federal bench,\u201d the letter states. \u201cLitigants in Georgia, and the nation as a whole, deserve a judge whose commitment to equal justice is clear.\u201d\n\nA Senate aide said the committee doesn\u2019t have all of the paperwork in for Boggs and hasn\u2019t yet scheduled a confirmation hearing.\n\nBoggs, who received his law degree in 1990 from Mercer University\u2019s Walter F. George School of Law, has since 2012 served as a judge on the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nIn 2000, Boggs was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia State House, where he held office until 2004. From 2004 to 2012, he was a Superior Court Judge of the Waycross Judicial Circuit of the First Judicial Administrative District of Georgia of the Georgia Superior Court, where he established and presided over the court\u2019s felony drug court program.\n\nAlthough the Task Force has already called on Obama to recall the nomination, the presence of HRC on the letter is notable because the organization had previously said it was awaiting Boggs\u2019 hearing before making a judgment on the nominee.\n\nFred Sainz, vice president of communications for the Human Rights Campaign, said he had no comment Thursday on the White House\u2019s continued silence and deferred questions about HRC\u2019s change in position to the letter.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, Obama\u2019s choice of Boggs is part of a package deal struck between the president and Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson. Four of the six nominees are GOP picks, and just one is black, but the trade-off is that other Georgia nominees in the package will now move forward after years of going nowhere.\n\nObama faces requests to remove Boggs as he met with black civil rights leaders on Tuesday to discuss issues including criminal justice reform and income inequality.\n\nAsked whether Boggs came up during these discussions, Earnest referred to a White House blog posting on the event without mentioning in the controversial judicial nominee.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a blog post available at whitehouse.gov about the conversations that the president had with those leaders,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThey talked about the Affordable Care Act, and work in communicating to the American public, and particularly to individuals in the African-American community, the potential benefits that are available to them at healthcare.gov, and some of the protections that were put in place for consumers because of the Affordable Care Act. I know they had conversations about some of the ideas to criminal justice reform that the president and the attorney general both discussed. In terms of specifics, I can\u2019t go beyond that, in terms of whether or not a specific judicial nominee came up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest had no comment on Thursday regarding a controversial judicial nominee with an anti-gay record.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest had no comment on Thursday regarding a controversial judicial nominee with an anti-gay record.", "title": "White House silent on judicial nominee with anti-gay record", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 404, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2013/08/Josh_Earnest_thumb_7_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 404}, "updated_time": "2014-02-20T19:09:14-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/02/20/white-house-silent-judicial-nominee-anti-gay-record/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest had no comment on Thursday regarding a controversial judicial nominee with an anti-gay record.", "creator": "@chrisjohnson82", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2013/08/Josh_Earnest_thumb_7_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "White House silent on judicial nominee with anti-gay record", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "News", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-02-20T17:52:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-20T19:09:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gay news, Washington Blade, Josh Earnest, judicial nominee"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9929\"", "article_summary": "White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest had no comment on Thursday regarding a controversial judicial nominee with an anti-gay record \u2014 despite calls from progressive groups on President Obama to take back the selection.\nAsked whether Boggs came up during these discussions, Earnest referred to a White House blog posting on the event without mentioning in the controversial judicial nominee.\n\u201cWe believe that Boggs\u2019s record on reproductive rights, civil rights, and LGBT rights is especially troubling in a nominee to the federal bench,\u201d the letter states.\nIn terms of specifics, I can\u2019t go beyond that, in terms of whether or not a specific judicial nominee came up.\u201d\nIn 2000, Boggs was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia State House, where he held office until 2004."}
