Res. 25, a constitutional amendment that would prevent Congress from exempting themselves from the mandates they impose on their constituents.\n\nPaul\u2019s proposed amendment states: \"Congress shall make no law applicable to a citizen of the United States that is not equally applicable to Congress.\" Under applicable provisions of the measure, the executive and judicial branches of the federal government would likewise be subject to all laws passed by the legislature.\n\nRevelations of the subsidies granted to Congress under ObamaCare are the obvious impetus for Paul\u2019s proposal.\n\nAs has been widely reported, ObamaCare requires federal officials to enter the healthcare exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, but offsets the cost of these medical insurance plans by the continuing contribution of the federal government to the purchase of the policies.\n\nWhen laws do not apply to the lawmakers, we have entered an era of despotism. The choking grip of this type of tyranny is tightened when the people are forced to pay for the lawmakers\u2019 exemptions.\n\nThis is the situation facing citizens of the United States of America in the age of ObamaCare. Federal employees \u2014 be they congressmen or judges \u2014 are to be spared the economic ravages of the president\u2019s hallmark healthcare act. Each of these \u201cpublic servants\u201d will receive subsidies aimed at offsetting the cost of complying with the myriad mandates of ObamaCare.\n\nAfter these subsidies were made known, Senator David Vitter (R-La.) offered a bill that would have eliminated these exemptions. Vitter is pursuing several options to enact his effort to make congressmen live under the laws they pass.\n\n\u201cThis is really about fairness, making sure that Washington is forced to live under the same train wreck of Obamacare that is forced on the rest of America,\u201d Vitter said in a press release. \u201cIt will take the policy makers in Washington walking in the same shoes as the millions of Americans to actually make real policy changes, and clean up the train wreck.\u201d\n\nSenator Paul is carrying the cause into new territory by trying to alter the Constitution.\n\n\u201cMy amendment says basically that everybody including Justice Roberts \u2014 who seems to be such a fan of ObamaCare \u2014 gets it too,\u201d Paul told the online Daily Caller during a phone interview from Michigan, where, the article reports, he recently won a 2016 presidential straw poll.\n\n\u201cSee, right now, Justice Roberts is still continuing to have federal employee health insurance subsidized by the taxpayer,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd if he likes ObamaCare so much, I\u2019m going to give him an amendment that gives ObamaCare to Justice Roberts.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by the Daily Caller what he thought of Vitter\u2019s effort, Paul said, \u201cI support any effort to make all laws applicable to Congress that we pass.\u201d He supports the bill, but thinks his own effort is the stronger medicine the country needs to cure itself of at least one of the many ObamaCare diseases.\n\n\u201cI think mine is a little more inclusive,\u201d Paul explained. \u201cMine \u2014 compared to Vitter\u2019s \u2014 would include all federal employees, and save billions of dollars.... Why don\u2019t we do it for all federal employees? And mine would save quite a bit more money,\u201d Paul explained.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) sees nothing wrong with adding to the tax burdens of middle-class Americans so that federal employees can get cheap healthcare. \u201cThat\u2019s what the law says, and we\u2019ll be part of that,\u201d Reid declared, as quoted in the Daily Caller piece. \u201cWe\u2019ll be treated like the rest of the federal employees,\u201d Reid said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing unique that employers help pay for health care.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also nothing unique about the federal government behaving in every particular like an elected aristocracy, believing themselves entitled to bloating themselves on feasts funded by the American people. Then, when the table is set, they demand that we, the people, serve them and then feed ourselves on whatever scraps fall from the tables of the privileged.\n\nWhile Senator Paul is to be commended for his commitment to denying Washington the welfare they are so fond of, the use of a constitutional amendment to accomplish this worthwhile goal seems unnecessary for a few key reasons.\n\nFirst, although many enemies of the Constitution frame any debate on the constitutionality of an issue by arguing that the Constitution doesn\u2019t forbid this or that act, that approach is the reverse of that intended by our Founders.\n\nThe Constitution does not catalog restrictions on power. That is to say, the Constitution was not designed to be a list of all the things the federal government cannot do, rather, it was written to contain an exhaustive, all-inclusive list of the authority granted to the federal government by the states that created it.\n\nAs James Madison explained in Federalist, no. 45, \u201cThe powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\u201d\n\nSo, rather than argue about whether a power is or is not restricted by the Constitution, we should examine the document to discover if a particular power is granted therein. If the power isn\u2019t explicitly given to the federal government in the Constitution, then the debate stops there, without need to entertain legalistic arguments about the \u201cconstitutionality\u201d of the topic.\n\nNext, in a related vein, there is no need to add an amendment to the Constitution forbidding Congress from doing something that it isn\u2019t allowed to do in the first place.\n\nRegarding ObamaCare, the Constitution gives Congress neither the power to force Americans to purchase health insurance, nor to exempt itself from that mandate. Therefore, the Paul amendment is moot.\n\nImagine, furthermore, the never-ending list of amendments that would be necessary to attach to the Constitution were we to set about enumerating all the things Congress cannot do! Congress and the people would have time to do little else than to vote on these proposals.\n\nFinally, consider the following words of Alexander Hamilton from the Federalist Papers. In this essay, Hamilton was arguing against the inclusion of a bill of rights in the Constitution, but the principles he puts forth apply to the question of a constitutional amendment forbidding Congress from exempting itself from laws.\n\nFor why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in the national government. This may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.\n\nAlthough Senator Paul\u2019s sense of justice is correct and commendable, his choice of a constitutional amendment to accomplish that end is questionable and potentially very problematic.\n\nJoe A.
