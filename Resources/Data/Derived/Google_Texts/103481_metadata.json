Steve Beshear\u2019s proposals for mine safety by nearly $2.3 million a year \u2014 raising concerns among safety advocates that there might not be enough money to conduct required inspections.\n\nBeshear had proposed using $7.6 million of coal severance tax revenues in each of the next two years for the state program that inspects and licenses coal mines. But the budget bill passed by the House reduces that to $5.3 million per year.\n\nOverall, when including other state funding for the Office of Mine Safety and Licensing, the House cut represents a 15 percent reduction, compared to Beshear\u2019s proposal \u2014 from $14.7 million to $12.4 million in 2014-15 and from $14.9 million to $12.6 million in 2015-16.\n\nAnd Beshear\u2019s proposal already included a 5 percent cut to the 145-employee agency that inspects and licenses coal mines, trains and certifies all coal miners, performs mine rescue operations and investigates mining accidents.\n\nThe House cut was not mentioned during the budget committee meeting or floor session when the budget bill was passed. But it was noticed by Beshear\u2019s budget office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about the lack of sufficient funds to ensure safety for our miners, and we will work with the House and the Senate to make certain the budget will include enough money to cover the critical needs in this agency,\u201d Beshear said in a statement responding to a question about the cut.\n\nGovernor\u2019s Office spokeswoman Kerri Richardson, and Dick Brown, spokesman for the Energy and Environment Cabinet, declined to elaborate or say specifically how the cut might affect the safety program\u2019s ability to do its job.\n\nBut they emphasized that the budget bill will undergo changes as it proceeds through the Senate and a House-Senate conference committee.\n\nThe proposed cut has touched off a debate over whether the sharp drop in Kentucky coal miner employment in the past two years justifies a reversal of state actions taken to beef up mine safety since 15 miners died in Kentucky coal mines in 2006.\n\nRep. Rick Rand, a Bedford Democrat who chairs the House budget committee, said with employment down and coal severance revenues down overall, his committee decided that mine safety funds could be safely reduced. \u201cThere\u2019s not nearly so much mining going on now as there has been,\u201d Rand said. \u201cSo the need for those programs is probably not as great as it was \u2014 not that mine safety is not important. It\u2019s very important. But as the number of mines decrease, the number of jobs decrease, the need for those inspections probably decreases as well.\u201d\n\nRep. John Will Stacy, D-West Liberty, who chairs a budget subcommittee, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that mine safety needs\u201d the money that was cut. \u201cBut there\u2019s all kinds of needs for it. But the truth of the matter is that receipts are down ... so we\u2019re forced to tighten our belt.\u201d\n\nSome mine safety advocates say the House cut is cause for concern.\n\n\u201cIt sounds terribly bad if they\u2019ve cut that much from what was proposed by Beshear,\u201d said Stanley Sturgill, an activist for mine safety and retired miner from Lynch. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the governor didn\u2019t propose spending any more than he thought was necessary. ... It\u2019s supposed to be a tight budget.\u201d\n\nWes Addington, deputy director of the Appalachian Citizens Law Center, in Whitesburg, said, \u201cWe would be very concerned if it affects the ability of the office to do the six required inspections of mines each year.\u201d\n\nSteve Earle, an international vice president for the United Mine Workers whose district includes Western Kentucky, said, \u201cI don\u2019t like it. Yes employment is down, butit\u2019s not time to cut mine safety.\u201d\n\nThe budget bill is now in the hands of the Senate, where President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said he assumes the House\u2019s reason for the cut is the steep decline in mining employment in recent years. The Energy and Environment Cabinet\u2019s data shows coal employment in the last quarter of 2013 fell to 11,781, down from 18,096 in the final quarter of 2011.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the discussions we\u2019ll have in the next couple of days to see if, based on the amount of activity ... do they need to have the personnel there to do the inspections that will be required,\u201d Stivers said.\n\nIn each of the last two years there were two fatalities at Kentucky mines, according to the cabinet\u2019s website. But mine safety emerged as a priority for the General Assembly in 2006 when 15 Kentucky miners died in coal mines including five at a methane explosion at the Kentucky Darby mine in Harlan County.\n\nThose 2006 deaths prompted the General Assembly to strengthen safety laws, including increasing the number of required state inspections per year at mines from two to six.\n\nRep. Brent Yonts, D-Greenville, was sponsor of the those bills to strengthen mine safety. He said Friday he was unaware that the House version of the budget had cut mine safey funding. He said reduced mining activity and the fact that mines are also examined by federal inspectors may justify the cut.\n\n\u201cBut the question of mine safety is very critical ... .\u201d Yonts said. \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t result in a tragedy.\u201d\n\nMine safety is the largest of seven budget items that in recent years have been partly funded with coal severance tax receipts that were cut by the House. Others cut are programs that serve coal counties, including education and anti-drug programs.\n\nCombined, the House cut $5.4 million per year from these programs and moved that money to a program that distributes part of coal severance tax revenues back to coal producing counties in the form of projects and grants decided by legislators from those counties.\n\nThe House budget includes 425 different diverse projects costing about $18 million per year within 34 coal counties. These include water and sewer projects; grants to cities, counties, school districts, volunteer fire departments, local civic organizations, senior citizen centers, libraries and other projects.\n\nA few of the largest itemized projects are to pay debt service on county projects.\n\nAnd for Pike County, the House budget lists a single project: a $2.4 million per year pool of money to which government agencies in the county can apply for grants from the Department for Local Government which award the grants after consultation with \u201cthe Pike County legislative delegation.\u201d\n\nThe House did not cut two of Beshear\u2019s new proposed uses of coal severance tax funds. It retained the use of $2 million each year for a Regional Strategic Development Fund and $200,000 each year for administrative costs of the new SOAR (Shaping Our Appalachian Region) which is the initiative to revive the Eastern Kentucky economy announced late last year by Beshear and 5th District Congressman U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers.\n\nJason Bailey, director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said these projects in coal counties \u201ccan definitely have value and many of these projects are for basic infrastructure and services that these counties need.\u201d\n\nBut Bailey said, \u201cMine safety must be seen as an essential expense.\u201d He said lawmakers must carefully examine the needs of the safety agency amid declining coal employment before deciding whether it can endure a cut.\n\nReporter Tom Loftus can be reached at (502) 875-5136.

The final budget will be hammered out in a House-Senate conference committee in the session\u2019s final days.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1gfj9HD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Safety advocates fear there might not be enough money to conduct required inspections", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Safety advocates fear there might not be enough money to conduct required inspections", "title": "Mine safety quietly cut in House budget bill", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2014/03/23/mine-safety-quietly-cut-house-budget-bill/6791991/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Safety advocates fear there might not be enough money to conduct required inspections", "title": "Mine safety quietly cut in House budget bill", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/53e0225945b9b70bcccf36069105150876e6b40e/c=226-0-1133-907&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/03/23/notacourier-journ.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Kentucky", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Kentucky", "title": "Mine safety quietly cut in House budget bill", "author": "Tom Loftus", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/ky-legislature", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f4b8c6d69e09c205c6a34dd2c608e48c3d7fb82/c=340-0-1020-907/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/03/23/notacourier-journ.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34a462dba6989d7c91ba7e80b172d206f70cd7d6/c=226-0-1133-907/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/03/23/notacourier-journ.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a338d630b301477f53721e7bd2fafdb8d3a3c64/c=76-0-1285-907/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/03/23/notacourier-journ.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd922338491584cd42c3917cd24ca6a45944298b/c=0-71-1360-836&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/03/23/notacourier-journ.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-03-23T12:18:36-04:00", "shorthed": "Mine safety cut in House budget bill", "articleid": 6791991, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/10046517ffbe7100329fc4acec1c4a2a64793269/c=0-71-1360-836/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/03/23/notacourier-journ.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d8011c4292b1309e93032c3827b4dbc5d235e029/c=425-0-935-907/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/03/23/notacourier-journ.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "mine safety, Tom Loftus, mine inspections, House budget bill, Steve Beshear, Kentucky mines"}, "article_summary": "The House cut was not mentioned during the budget committee meeting or floor session when the budget bill was passed.\n(Photo: Copyright 2000 The Courier-Journ)With no explanation and little discussion, the House budget bill passed this month slashed Gov.\nHe said Friday he was unaware that the House version of the budget had cut mine safey funding.\nBut the truth of the matter is that receipts are down ... so we\u2019re forced to tighten our belt.\u201dSome mine safety advocates say the House cut is cause for concern.\nThe House budget includes 425 different diverse projects costing about $18 million per year within 34 coal counties."}
