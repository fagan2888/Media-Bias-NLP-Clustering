A 75-year old manufacturer based in Lisle, Ill., the company had sales of $3.6 billion in the 2013 fiscal-year ended in June.\n\nIts shares have been up just 7.3% this year, trailing the global rally, but Koch is paying $38.50 a share, a 31% premium to the common stock price and the highest it has traded since 2006. That still pales to the $60-plus the stock spiked to in 2000. It bottomed in 2009 just below $10.\n\nThe Koch brothers, well known for political positions, are looking to get into more deal-making after several years of largely making investments, Charles Koch, the chairman, told WSJ this year. Specifically they want to duplicate what Mr. Buffett has formed at Berkshire Hathaway: a buyer and long-time holder of large, steady companies.\n\nMr. Buffett has made no secret he\u2019s out on \u201csafari\u201d for big deals himself, though electronic components aren\u2019t typically in his wheelhouse. His biggest deal this year was a shared purchase of ketchup giant Heinz & Co. for $23 billion with private-equity firm 3G Capital.\n\nMonday\u2019s deal is not subject to financing, which shows off Koch\u2019s deep pockets. The sides are hoping to close by the end of the year, a fast maneuver for an M&A deal of that size. It will face a shareholder vote.\n\n\u201cAfter 75 years this was a difficult decision, but our board of directors and our family believe that this transaction,\u201d said Fred Krehbiel, co-chairman of the Molex board.\n\n\u2013Kevin Kingsbury contributed to this post.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Koch brothers have bagged their own version of an elephant.", "title": "Koch Industries Bags $7.2 Billion Molex in Hunt for Deals", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/09/koch-industries-bags-7-2-billion-molex-in-hunt-for-deals/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CE444A_KOCH_E_20130702174218.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Koch Industries Bags $7.2 Billion Molex in Hunt for Deals", "description": "The Koch brothers have bagged their own version of an elephant.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "David Benoit", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "The Koch brothers have bagged their own version of an elephant.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-09T12:59:02-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/09/koch-industries-bags-7-2-billion-molex-in-hunt-for-deals/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-7702", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Koch brothers have bagged their own version of an elephant.", "title": "Koch Industries Bags $7.2 Billion Molex in Hunt for Deals", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/09/koch-industries-bags-7-2-billion-molex-in-hunt-for-deals/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-7702", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-09T12:59:56-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cd6\"", "article_summary": "Charles Koch Zuma PressKoch Industries, the conglomerate of Charles and David Koch, will spend $7.2 billion to acquire Molex, a manufacturer of electrical and electronic components.\nIt would also give them their first big acquisition since Charles Koch told WSJ earlier this year the group is looking to buy more companies and compete with the famed elephant-hunter Warren Buffett.\nThe Koch brothers, well known for political positions, are looking to get into more deal-making after several years of largely making investments, Charles Koch, the chairman, told WSJ this year.\nHis biggest deal this year was a shared purchase of ketchup giant Heinz & Co. for $23 billion with private-equity firm 3G Capital.\nMolex makes the components that put together electronics and fiber-optic cables, such as switches, antennas and other parts."}
