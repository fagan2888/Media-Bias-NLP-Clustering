He was 91 years old.\n\nMr. Lee had been battling \u201csevere pneumonia,\u201d a condition the government disclosed in late February after he was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on Feb. 5. Mr. Lee had been in intensive care and was put on mechanical ventilation.\n\nLast week, the government, now led by Mr. Lee\u2019s son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said the elder Mr. Lee\u2019s condition had worsened due to an infection. On Sunday, the government said that his condition had weakened even further.\n\nMr. Lee\u2019s core principles \u2014 including a focus on clean and efficient government, business-friendly economic policies, and social order \u2014 helped attract massive investment and many of the world\u2019s biggest companies to Singapore after he became prime minister in 1959, catapulting living standards to First World status from Third World levels in hardly more than a generation.\n\nAlong the way Singapore, now one of the world\u2019s richest nations, drew criticism from rights groups that said it attained its developed-world living standards without adopting full Western-style democracy or some of the freedoms taken for granted in Western societies.\n\nMr. Lee argued that Western-style democracy just wasn\u2019t suitable for all nations, and that young countries needed stability and economic development before they could afford the luxuries of democracy and personal liberty in a Western mold.\n\nWriter T.J.S. George, in a biography of Mr. Lee, saw it another way: For Mr. Lee, he wrote, \u201cmeans never mattered so long as the ends he desired were reached. He ran Singapore like a tightly managed private corporation, paying what he considered good dividends to the shareholders.\u201d\n\nAn expanded version of this report appeared on WSJ.com.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Lee Kuan Yew, who dominated Singapore politics for more than half a century and transformed the former British outpost into a global trade and finance powerhouse, setting a template for emerging markets around the world, is dead at 91 years old.", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DI136_lee_kw_ZG_20150322172710.jpg", "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "P.R.
