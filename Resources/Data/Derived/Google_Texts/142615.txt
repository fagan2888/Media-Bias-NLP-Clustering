Oklahoma City police arrested a man after several children reported seeing him walking to his mailbox naked. Police said they also caught the man masturbating outside his house as a 14-year-old boy walked by.

According to police, about 2 p.m. on Wednesday, officers responded to several reports of a man walking to get his mail naked in the 8300 block of N.W. 112th Terrace. A woman told police that she and her three children, ages 12,10,6, saw the man naked in his front yard.

When officers arrived at the scene, they spoke with the suspect, 68-year-old Hillard Stallings, at his house. Stallings told officers that he was a registered sex offender, but he refused to give them his ID.

According to the report, officers then contacted the Sex Crimes Unit, and they stated that if Stallings came outside, the officers could arrest him. However, police said Stallings was very rude and did not want to talk to the officers.

Officers said they believed the inappropriate behaviors would continue. An officer remained on the scene. About five minutes after they spoke to Stallings, the officer said he saw a 14-year-old boy standing in front of Stallings' house, looking toward the front door.

When the officer got closer, he said he saw Stallings outside his house, "shaking his penis and thrusting his hips out" towards the boy , according to the report.

The officer then took Stallings into custody. He was taken to the Oklahoma County Jail on several charges, including three counts of indecent exposure, one count of failure to register as a sex offender, and one count of disorderly conduct by masturbating in public.
