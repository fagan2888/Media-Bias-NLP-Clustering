Since health care reform took effect, people with pre-existing conditions are finally getting life-saving treatments.\n\nThis week, Marcey DiCaro was able to have a 47.5-pound tumor removed from her stomach during surgery. You might have seen the rather graphic image floating around on the internet.\n\n\"If the tumor had been let go, it would have killed me,\" the Arizona resident said in a statement. \"I'm happy to be going on walks and getting back in the pool and getting out and enjoying life.\"\n\nShe found the tumor in 2012, which is also when she was lacking health insurance. When she got insurance and scheduled the surgery last year, she found out that the insurance company would only pay for a small portion of the costs. That surgery was later canceled.\n\nThat\u2019s where the ACA came in. Under it, DiCaro was able to obtain a policy that covered her pre-existing condition. In April, she underwent surgery to remove the tumor, which took 10 hours.\n\n\"Obamacare\" good for the heart?\n\nDiCaro isn\u2019t the only person out there that has an \"Obamacare saved me\" type of story. A month before DiCaro had her surgery, Dean Angstadt was able to obtain insurance in order to have a sorely needed heart valve-replacement surgery. Angstadt put off getting a policy under the ACA because he wasn\u2019t much of a supporter as it became law.\n\n\"For me, this isn't about politics,\" said Angstadt, from Pennsylvania. \"I'm trying to help other people who are like me, stubborn and bullheaded, who refused to even look. From my own experience, the ACA is everything it's supposed to be, and in fact, better than it's made out to be.\"\n\nMike O\u2019Dell, a man from Kansas, also needed life-saving surgery \u2014 for a new heart. He qualified for Kansas Medicaid, but he couldn\u2019t meet the spend-down requirements for continuous coverage. Through the ACA, he was able to get health insurance and be put on the transplant waiting list. Now the 40-something father of three has a new heart \u2014 not to mention a new lease on life.\n\nNote: These stories aren\u2019t meant to promote the ACA \u2014 But we do think they are heartwarming tales of how health care reform in general really can impact our lives.\n\nMore health news\n\nWoman living with terminal breast cancer fulfills lifelong dream\n\nOlympian Kerri Walsh Jennings has a sweet health secret\n\nHow to calm allergies with local honey", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.newsletter_sponsored": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,h_300,w_300/msi/p5xtz5bcv51qpofzg7wp", "sailthru.author_slug": "kristen-fischer", "description": "Since health care reform took effect, people with pre-existing conditions are finally getting life-saving treatments.", "og": {"site_name": "SheKnows", "description": "Since health care reform took effect, people with pre-existing conditions are finally getting life-saving treatments.", "title": "Is the Affordable Care Act saving lives?", "url": "http://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/1039871/womans-massive-tumor-removal-with-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,w_600/msi/p5xtz5bcv51qpofzg7wp", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,w_600/msi/p5xtz5bcv51qpofzg7wp", "description": "Since health care reform took effect, people with pre-existing conditions are finally getting life-saving treatments.", "site": "@sheknows", "card": "summary", "title": "Is the Affordable Care Act saving lives?"}, "sailthru.date": "Thu, 12 Jun 2014 15:12:00 -0700", "sailthru.image.newsletter_secondary": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,h_135,w_256/msi/p5xtz5bcv51qpofzg7wp", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "sailthru.title": "Woman's 47-pound tumor removal shows human side of health reform", "keywords": "ACA, obamacare, pre-existing condition, medical, health, health care, tumor, the affordable care act, marcy dicaro, tumor removal,", "fb": {"app_id": 105697356132938, "pages": 111589138109}, "sailthru.image.image": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,h_100,w_100/msi/p5xtz5bcv51qpofzg7wp", "sailthru.content_id": "sk-1039871", "sailthru.channel_name": "Health & Wellness", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-12T15:12:00-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-13T07:40:21-07:00", "author": "Kristen Fischer"}, "sailthru.channel": "health-and-wellness", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/c_fill,h_236,w_425/msi/p5xtz5bcv51qpofzg7wp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "sailthru.author_name": "Kristen Fischer"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc23\"", "article_summary": "Since health care reform took effect, people with pre-existing conditions are finally getting life-saving treatments.\nShe found the tumor in 2012, which is also when she was lacking health insurance.\nThrough the ACA, he was able to get health insurance and be put on the transplant waiting list.\nNote: These stories aren\u2019t meant to promote the ACA \u2014 But we do think they are heartwarming tales of how health care reform in general really can impact our lives.\nIn addition to writing for SheKnows, she has penned articles for Prevention, Health, Woman's Day, BELLA, and New Jersey Monthly."}
