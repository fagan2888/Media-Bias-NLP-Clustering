Street vendors sometimes spend a fortune or languish for years on waiting lists to acquire one of the permits that allow them to sell goods in tightly regulated locations.\n\nBut once a year, there\u2019s an exception, laid out in an artfully worded city ordinance: During the month of December, anyone may sell \u201cconiferous trees\u201d just about anywhere \u2014 no license required.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare tree-for-all. Peddlers flock in from across North America. Big trucks carrying huge loads of trees arrive in the dead of night. Stands selling coniferous trees (some people, but not the city, call them Christmas trees) sprout everywhere.\n\nThe annual tree ritual brings New Yorkers together on village-like corners abuzz with neighborly chatter amid twinkling lights.\n\n\u201cI like to walk through the smell,\u201d says Tim Albright, a customer taking a deep whiff of a cluster of trees this week.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s that other special green attraction: the smell of money that comes with the right to operate tree stands 24-7, free of charge, no license needed. That lures hardy entrepreneurs like Tom Gilmartin, a 62-year-old commercial fishing captain from Alaska.\n\nHe rolled into town with his wife and 12-year-old son in a pickup truck with a red-and-green camper perched on the back.\n\nThat\u2019s where they\u2019ll be sleeping for the next few weeks, parked next to the Manhattan stand they\u2019ve operated every season for two decades. A giant Santa Claus standing on the truck\u2019s roof helps lure customers. Gilmartin and his wife take turns doing 12-hour shifts and shower at a local hostel in return for a donated tree.\n\nThey sell up to 500 trees each season, averaging an income of about $14 per hour. Their prize sale so far has been a 17-foot, $700 Fraser.\n\nTheir son, Rory, earned $1,200 on a recent weekend delivering trees on a three-wheeled stroller. He gets $20 per delivery.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just sell trees,\u201d Tom Gilmartin said. \u201cYou have to make friends. That\u2019s what this business is all about.\u201d\n\nThey might not be in New York if it weren\u2019t for the unlicensed vending, which has an intriguing history.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Peddlers flock to New York City for \u2018coniferous tree\u2019 season", "title": "Peddlers flock to New York City for \u2018coniferous tree\u2019 season", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Peddlers flock to New York City for \u2018coniferous tree\u2019 season", "title": "Peddlers flock to New York City for \u2018coniferous tree\u2019 season", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/12/peddlers_flock_to_new_york_city_for_coniferous_tree_season/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/aptopix-nyc-christmas-tree-clause.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Peddlers flock to New York City for \u2018coniferous tree\u2019 season", "title": "Peddlers flock to New York City for \u2018coniferous tree\u2019 season", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/aptopix-nyc-christmas-tree-clause.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Verena Dobnik", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In New York City, even sidewalk space is coveted real estate.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just sell trees,\u201d Tom Gilmartin said.\nThat lures hardy entrepreneurs like Tom Gilmartin, a 62-year-old commercial fishing captain from Alaska.\nStands selling coniferous trees (some people, but not the city, call them Christmas trees) sprout everywhere.\nGilmartin and his wife take turns doing 12-hour shifts and shower at a local hostel in return for a donated tree."}
