Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, came as part of a larger, state-by-state list of statements and actions by Republicans on a range of issues that Democrats say \u201calienate large communities of Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter the state, no matter the demographic, no matter the region, the GOP rebrand has failed to make a substantive change that will make them any more successful at the ballot box than they were in 2012,\u201d said Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat.\n\nRepublican officials on the state and national levels brushed off the charges Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be interested what the DNC thinks about the fact that when you look at Arizona you don\u2019t hear a peep from Democrats about how they plan on making one of the few open races competitive,\u201d said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 report was timed to fall on the first anniversary of the Republican Party\u2019s Growth and Opportunity Project \u2013 often referred to as the party\u2019s \u201cautopsy report\u201d in the wake of its 2012 loss of the presidential election. Republicans said this week that they have made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d in the past year, citing tens of thousands of surveys, focus groups, listening sessions and other outreach to targeted groups.\n\nDemocrats disagreed.\n\n\u201cBasically we\u2019re doing an autopsy on their autopsy,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said as she unveiled the Democrat\u2019s report, \u201cSame Old Party,\u201d at the National Press Club.\n\nThe report highlighted what Democrats said was Republican \u201crhetoric and policy that divides us and is simply out of the mainstream,\u201d but that particularly affects several key voting groups: gays, women, blacks, Latinos, youth and the middle class.\n\nIn Arizona, the report pointed to SB 1062, the recently vetoed bill that would have let business owners cite their religious beliefs as a defense for refusing service to customers \u2013 including gays and lesbians. It also cited the recent comparison of government assistance to slavery by Republican congressional candidate Jim Brown and state Rep. Bob Thorpe\u2019s tweet suggesting U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is \u201csoft on crime\u201d because he is black.\n\nWasserman Schultz cited another bill introduced in the Arizona Legislature this year that would have made it a crime for immigrants who are here illegally to attend public school, drive on a public road or use any other public resource.\n\nWhile Republicans have made few gains, according to Wasserman Schultz, Democrats have been able to put down deeper grass roots and get a better handle on technology than the GOP. That puts the party in a good position for gains in this fall\u2019s elections, she said.\n\nArizona Republican Party spokesman Tim Sifert disagrees.\n\nSifert called Wasserman Schultz\u2019s report a \u201cshow she is putting on \u2026 to get people\u2019s minds off of Obamacare.\u201d He said Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, will play a larger role this fall than Democrats are willing to admit.\n\n\u201cRepublicans, Democrats and independents are all concerned about the effects of Obamacare,\u201d Sifert said.\n\nHe characterized the Democratic report as an act of desperation.\n\n\u201cArizona has some very competitive congressional races coming up,\u201d Sifert said. \u201cAnd any Arizona Democrat that supported Obamacare is worried.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A year after the Republican Party unveiled plans to attract women and minority voters, a national Democratic leader insisted the GOP is still \u201cout of touch,\u201d citing the party\u2019s actions in Arizona as examples.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Colton Gavin, Cronkite News Service", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "A year after the Republican Party unveiled plans to attract women and minority voters, a national Democratic leader insisted the GOP is still \u201cout of touch,\u201d citing the party\u2019s actions in Arizona a...", "title": "DNC chair: Arizona an emblem of GOP outreach problems", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2014/03/19/dnc-debbie-wasserman-schultz-az-shows-gop-outreach-problem/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2014/03/Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz-CNS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNC chair: Arizona an emblem of GOP outreach problemsArizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "arizona, democrats, republicans, voter outreach, debbie wasserman schultz, democratic national committee, washington dc, kirsten kukowski, republican national committee, growth and opportunity project, same old party, sb1062  ,debbie wasserman schultz,democratic national committee,democrats,growth and opportunity project,kirsten kukowski,republican national committee,republicans,same old party,sb1062,voter outreach,washington  dc", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Arizona Republican Party spokesman Tim Sifert disagrees.\nWhile Republicans have made few gains, according to Wasserman Schultz, Democrats have been able to put down deeper grass roots and get a better handle on technology than the GOP.\n\u201cBasically we\u2019re doing an autopsy on their autopsy,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said as she unveiled the Democrat\u2019s report, \u201cSame Old Party,\u201d at the National Press Club.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A year after the Republican Party unveiled plans to attract women and minority voters, a national Democratic leader insisted the GOP is still \u201cout of touch,\u201d citing the party\u2019s actions in Arizona as examples.\nRepublican officials on the state and national levels brushed off the charges Tuesday."}
