Officials also called on Congress to pass a bill protecting troops from for-profit colleges that prey on GI bill recipients.\n\nRelated: Cheating, Lying and Fraud\u2014Will Restructuring Save the Scandal-Plagued VA?\n\nSpeaking at Arlington National Cemetery on Wednesday, President Obama highlighted his administration\u2019s \u201chistoric investments\u201d in the VA, but noted the \u201cunacceptable problems\u201d the department has experienced -- namely the systemic fraud uncovered last year that showed agency officials at several medical facilities covered up patient wait times, which may have contributed to some deaths.\n\nThe controversy forced VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign and spurred Congress to pass a $16 billion overhaul of the second-largest federal agency.\n\n\u201cI am still not satisfied\u201d with the pace of VA reforms, Obama said, and pledged to keep investing in the department. Despite the president\u2019s high-minded rhetoric, the administration and Congress are still grappling with how to get the VA on a path to long-term success.\n\nRelated: Scandal-Plagued VA Has Most $200K Workers\n\nFor instance, it appears the department won\u2019t accomplish its self-imposed goals of ending veteran homelessness and erasing its disability claims backlog.\n\nWhile states like Connecticut and now Virginia claim they have found home for their homeless veterans, tens of thousands remain on the streets, according to the Associated Press. Staffers on the GOP-controlled House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee estimate the VA spending on homelessness has leapt from $376 million in 2009 to about $1.5 billion last year, prompting questions about the effectiveness of such efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of disability claims pending for more than 125 days stands at around 76,000. That figure is 88 percent below the more than 611,000 that existed in 2013, but means the backlog will exist into 2016.\n\nThe department is also by no means out of hot water with Congress. Republican lawmakers have criticized Shinseki\u2019s replacement, Robert McDonald, for not moving faster to dismiss officials connected to the healthcare scandal and for inflating the number of employees who have been disciplined under his tenure.\n\nRelated: Latest Outrage at the VA: Execs Profiting on Moving Expenses\n\nThe agency suffered another setback earlier this month when two senior officials invoked their Fifth Amendment rights at congressional hearing about allegations they gamed the department\u2019s hiring method for personal gain.\n\nTo add to the outrage, the VA gave executives and employees $142 million in performance bonuses for 2014\u2014despite the scandals and the fraud that so far only resulted in four people being fired and no indictments.\n\nThe VA\u2019s troubled reputation didn\u2019t stop the Senate on Tuesday from voting 93-0 to approve a fiscal 2016 spending bill for veterans\u2019 benefits and military construction. The measure, the first funding bill to be passed by Congress this year, gives $79.7 billion in discretionary funding for military construction and veterans programs, about $7.9 billion more than fiscal 2015 spending levels.\n\n\u201cThe veterans have $2 billion more than they would have had we followed the Republicans\u2019 lead, $2 billion more,\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said during a Capitol Hill press conference. \u201cSo we\u2019re satisfied this bill is a good bill, and it\u2019s a good bill because veterans are getting $2 billion more.\u201d\n\nRelated: POGO Blows the Lid Off Veterans Affairs Scandal\n\nThe money will go toward a variety of efforts, including hiring more medical staff and claims processors, but there\u2019s no indication that it will be enough to clean up the fall-out from last year\u2019s controversy.\n\nAbout a year ago, McDonald, the former head of Procter and Gamble, rolled out an agency wide initiative titled \u201cMyVa\u201d to streamline the organization, improve customer service and help veterans navigate the department\u2019s bureaucracy more easily.\n\nIn a speech last week at the National Press Club in Washington, McDonald said the department has integrated \u201cimproving customer service\u201d and other MyVA goals into employees\u2019 performance plans.\n\n\u201cSo, we have made progress. We have a lot more to do. There is lots of investigations currently underway. And as time goes on, you will see the results of these investigations,\u201d he said.\n\nMcDonald added he\u2019d suggested to congressional committee leaders, \u201cWe hold a hearing on the MyVA transformation rather than continue the barrage of hearings we\u2019ve had on things that occurred two years ago.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s been roughly 18 months since one of the worst scandals in the history of the Veterans Affairs Department was exposed, but Washington has yet to be able to deliver timely health care services to veterans.", "title": "Still Mired in Scandal, VA Awards $142 Million in Bonuses", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/Still-Mired-Scandal-VA-Awards-142-Million-Bonuses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Flag_of_the_United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs.svg_.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/11/Still-Mired-Scandal-VA-Awards-142-Million-Bonuses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Flag_of_the_United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs.svg_.png", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s been roughly 18 months since one of the worst scandals in the history of the Veterans Affairs Department was exposed, but Washington has yet to be able to deliver timely health care services to veterans.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The VA\u2019s troubled reputation didn\u2019t stop the Senate on Tuesday from voting 93-0 to approve a fiscal 2016 spending bill for veterans\u2019 benefits and military construction.\nOfficials also called on Congress to pass a bill protecting troops from for-profit colleges that prey on GI bill recipients.\n\u201cI am still not satisfied\u201d with the pace of VA reforms, Obama said, and pledged to keep investing in the department.\nThe controversy forced VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign and spurred Congress to pass a $16 billion overhaul of the second-largest federal agency.\nDespite the president\u2019s high-minded rhetoric, the administration and Congress are still grappling with how to get the VA on a path to long-term success."}
