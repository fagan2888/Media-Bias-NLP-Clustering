Sunday will be a windy day in the Denver metro area, with gusts up to 30 mph, but temperatures will remain well above freezing and by Thursday could hit 70 degrees.

Skies will be partly cloudy on Sunday with temperatures in the low to mid-50s, said Kyle Frieden, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Wind gusts could reach 30 mph.

In and along the foothills, wind gusts could reach 50 mph.

On Monday, the wind will continue to blow, with the strongest gusts in the western suburbs. Temperatures will approach 60 degrees in the metro area, Frieden said. “People might want to wear a jacket,” Frieden said.

Winds will die down by Tuesday, and the day is expected to be sunny, with a high temperature of 64 degrees.

By Thursday, the high could climb to 71 degrees.

The NWS has issued a winter weather advisory through Tuesday morning for much of the high country, with snow fall in some places of 2 to 4 inches through Sunday night.

Snow could continue on Monday, and Tuesday, adding another inch or so in some places.
