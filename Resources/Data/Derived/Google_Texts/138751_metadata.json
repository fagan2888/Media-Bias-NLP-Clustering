Unions want companies that employ their workers to be exempted from the new minimum wage, in a bid to increase unionization and union membership.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n@mattdpearce Because they\u2019re hypocrites? Unions also wanted exemption from Obamacare, after lobbying heavily to pass it. \u2014 Johnson Brian (@BikeSwimRun26) July 27, 2015\n\nHead of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, Rusty Hicks, told the Los Angeles Times in May that virtually \u201cevery [California] city that has passed a minimum wage include this kind of a provision.\u201d The Times reportedly found inconsistencies with this statement pointing out that \u201cSan Diego, the largest California city to raise its minimum wage in recent years before L.A., did not include such an exception.\u201d\n\nThe attempt has created divisions among union and labor leaders.\n\nDrastic increases in the minimum wage by the West Coast\u2019s liberal cities have forced many small businesses to close, including San Francisco\u2019s beloved Borderlands Books; many other small businesses are expected to follow. Some economists have warned that the minimum wage hike will also raise youth unemployment.\n\nThe higher wages have also forced many business establishments to reduce their workforces, and fast-food chains are increasingly replacing human beings with computers.\n\nMinimum Wage Hikes Result in McDonalds Closing Doors.
