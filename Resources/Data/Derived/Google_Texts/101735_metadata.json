The cost of archiving documents should be lower, because data can be housed on relatively small hard drives rather than in spacious warehouses. Likewise, the time expense of retrieving that data should be reduced, because it can be obtained through a few keystrokes rather than a tedious search of file cabinets.\n\nConsequently, open records requests should be far easier to fulfill, because electronic correspondence and memos are keyword searchable. Yet two New York politicos are showing that the era of Big Data does not necessarily mean the public gets a better view of its government.\n\nThe first is Hillary Clinton, the Empire State\u2019s former senator. According to reports this week in The New York Times and Associated Press, Clinton avoided using a government email address as U.S. secretary of state, instead conducting State Department business through a personal account on her own private server. The Times notes that \u201cthe practice protected a significant amount of her correspondence from the eyes of investigators and the public.\u201d\n\nAccording to one legal expert, Clinton\u2019s move may have run afoul of the spirit \u2014 if not the letter \u2014 of rules governing federal records.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to conceive of a scenario \u2014 short of nuclear winter \u2014 where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business,\u201d a former lawyer for the National Archives and Records Administration told the Times.\n\nAt least Clinton\u2019s emails may still exist somewhere, and could be made public if she and the State Department choose to release them. The same cannot necessarily be said for emails from the New York state government, thanks to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nLast week, his administration began mass deleting state government emails that are more than 90 days old. It is a data purging policy he first instituted in 2007 as state attorney general, making it harder for the public to know if his office investigated bank fraud in the lead up to the financial crisis of 2008.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of state insists she's willing to share her emails with the public.
