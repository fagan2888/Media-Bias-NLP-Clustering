His linemate, veteran winger Jarome Iginla, had three assists \u2014 with the first one giving him 1,220 career points and pulling him out of a tie with Jean Beliveau for 40th place on the NHL all-time list.\n\n\u201cI played no different than I have been,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cIt was one of those nights where things finally went in the net. Iggy and I haven\u2019t been on for many against, and I don\u2019t think we were on for a goal against on the (three-game Canada) road trip and we weren\u2019t tonight. We\u2019re getting tons of chances. It was real frustrating on the road trip not to be able to contribute, especially in those first two games where we could have been the difference. I know I took it real hard and I was disappointed, but hopefully it\u2019s not too late now.\u201d\n\nWorkhorse Semyon Varlamov was back in the Colorado net and wasn\u2019t particularly sharp as the Sabres showed some spunk in the third period, but he had 35 saves in claiming his 26th win of the season in front of a sellout crowd.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I liked the buzz in the building,\u201d said Colorado coach Patrick Roy. \u201cThe fans were there and they were behind us, and I thought that\u2019s what we needed. When you are playing your fourth game in six days, you need that energy and they gave us that energy that you need to play for the first 40 minutes.\n\n\u201cI thought we were solid for the first 40 and at the end we were a little tired. Obviously, it\u2019s not the kind of third period we like to see, but at the same time, you look at the schedule we\u2019ve been through. \u2026 I\u2019d have to say I\u2019m not surprised to see that happen.\u201d\n\nWith seven games left, the postseason remains a longshot for Colorado, but the win was the Avalanche\u2019s second in a row after the potentially demoralizing losses at Calgary and Edmonton.\n\nMarc-Andre Cliche and John Mitchell scored 32 seconds apart midway through the first to give the Avalanche a 2-0 lead. Cody McLeod\u2019s nifty backhanded pass from behind the net set up Cliche. Duchene made the play that led to the second goal, carrying the puck in and getting off the shot that Mitchell, in front, deflected past Buffalo goalie Anders Lidback, destined to be pulled after the first period.\n\nIn the second, Tyson Barrie\u2019s 12th goal of the season and Duchene\u2019s goal \u2014 from straight out off the rush \u2014 made it 4-0.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s Andre Meszaros scored twice in the third to ruin Varlamov\u2019s shutout, and the goals were sandwiched around a goal by Colorado defenseman Brad Stuart. Then Rasmus Ristolainen got the Sabres to within 5-3 at 8:43 of the third.\n\nAvalanche winger Dennis Everberg didn\u2019t play in the third period, but Roy declined to be specific about the injury, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll know more tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche handles Buffalo as Matt Duchene has goal and two assists", "title": "Avalanche handles Buffalo as Matt Duchene has goal and two assists", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/28/avalanche-handles-buffalo-as-matt-duchene-has-goal-and-two-assists/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__avs-duchenep1.jpg", "height": 476}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__avs-duchenep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T21:32:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T17:28:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd29f\"", "article_summary": "In the second, Tyson Barrie\u2019s 12th goal of the season and Duchene\u2019s goal \u2014 from straight out off the rush \u2014 made it 4-0.\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike ChambersMatt Duchene had his 19th goal of the season and two assists in perhaps his best game in a month.\nBuffalo\u2019s Andre Meszaros scored twice in the third to ruin Varlamov\u2019s shutout, and the goals were sandwiched around a goal by Colorado defenseman Brad Stuart.\nMarc-Andre Cliche and John Mitchell scored 32 seconds apart midway through the first to give the Avalanche a 2-0 lead.\nDuchene made the play that led to the second goal, carrying the puck in and getting off the shot that Mitchell, in front, deflected past Buffalo goalie Anders Lidback, destined to be pulled after the first period."}
