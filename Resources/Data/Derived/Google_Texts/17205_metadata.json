I was like, \u2018Sak passe?\u2019\u201d she remembers of that devastating night, five years ago this week.\n\nHer aunt replied, \u201cJezi ka passe.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s Creole for \u201cJesus is coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus is coming? What does that mean?\u201d Salomon recalled. \u201cShe said, \u201cIt means earthquake. There is an earthquake!\u201d\n\nSalomon had arrived in Haiti from Florida just two days earlier to see family. She was hoping to introduce her fianc\u00e9 to her grandmother. Instead, she was a witness to a devastating tragedy that toppled landmarks, killed tens of thousands of people, and displaced more than a million.\n\nShe thought, \u201cLord, why did I come to Haiti around this time? Why am I here? And I thought about it? And it was like why are you not?\u201d\n\nSalomon made her way to the U.S. Embassy to ask for help, but ended up translating and nursing the injured.\n\nAfter two weeks, the U.S. sent for its citizens and Salomon left, carrying her passport, a purse, and guilt.\n\n\u201cThe hardest thing was getting into the plane and coming back home. I had clean clothes to put on and I knew what I was going to eat the next day, and they had no hope,\u201d she admits.\n\nOver 1 million Haitians were living in tents in the weeks after the earthquake. That number today has dropped to 100,000.\n\nIn those first weeks after the earthquake, hundreds of injured Haitians were flown to Florida hospitals for treatment. And for months, nurses, doctors and others across the state worked in makeshift hospitals in Haiti, offering whatever medical care they could.\n\nThe need to help hasn't stopped. Medical and humanitarian efforts continue, including from those with personal connections to Haiti like Lorvena Salomon.\n\nThe 27-year-old is a now an MBA student at University of Central Florida. And she goes back twice a year to bring food and hygiene products.\n\nShe\u2019s also a member of the Greater Haitian American Chamber of Commerce and is starting a non-profit to fill existing gap in services in Haiti.\n\nLouise Comfort, director of the Center for Disaster Management at the University of Pittsburgh, blames that gap on a political vacuum where uncertainty reigned before and after the earthquake.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where the existing government in Haiti was very fragile. Resources came pouring in. It wasn\u2019t a question of money. It was really a question of how do we get the work done,\u201d Comfort said.\n\nShe is partnering with a Haitian state university to train students to use technology to assess building standards.\n\n\u201cInternational help can guide, can support, can suggest,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, the Haitians have to do it themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Haitian Consul General in Orlando, Laurent Prosper, agreed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I believe our diaspora is very important to us,\u201d he said. He has coordinated post-earthquake missions with doctors, nurses, and engineers in Central Florida\u2014many Haitian.\n\n\u201cWe are in a better situation than we were five years ago. We have a pretty strong educated diaspora, and we\u2019re hoping that with them, we can make Haiti get to the other level,\u201d he said.\n\nTourism in Haiti is up and new companies have emerged, but Prosper says education and job creation are key to rebuilding. More than 1 million children now attend school for free. Prosper wants to make sure they stay in Haiti.\n\n\u201cWe definitely have been exporting our academic resource. Haitians go to a lot of countries in Africa and Canada and the U.S. and not coming back,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that\u2019s not Loverne Salomon. Back in Orlando, she shares her earthquake survival story whenever she can.\n\nSalomon is preparing to get 501 c 3 status for her non-profit. She says if people like her don\u2019t go back and help, then Haiti will remain the way it is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the government that\u2019s going to change Haiti,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s people like us.\u201d\n\nRenata Sago is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
