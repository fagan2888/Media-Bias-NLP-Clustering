Infection Control Debate Rages\n\nHospital-acquired infections and the rise of drug-resistant organisms has put new focus on whether requiring doctors to go \u201cbare below the elbows\u201d (BBE) would help infection control. BBE means no long sleeves, no neckties, no wristwatches, no jewelry other than a wedding band, and generally that physicians will wear scrubs.The practice was adopted in the UK in 2008. But it appears to be a tough sell in the US. At a debate today at IDWeek 2015 in San Diego, two physicians squared off in a friendly\u2014and highly entertaining\u2014debate.Michael Edmond, MD, MPH, MP,of the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics said his hospital is going BBE January 1, 2016. He took the \u201cyes\u201d side of the debate. Neil Fishman, MD, of Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, PA, took the \u201cno\u201d side and closed his debate with a hip-hop style rap.Edmond began by citing studies that showed how dirty and microbe-contaminated lab coats could get. Though some surveys have shown patients prefer to see their doctors in coats and ties, \u201cPatients preferences vary\u201d and the survey techniques may bias the answers, he said.Edmond said he was convinced that BBE would help infection control since staph and other organisms persist on clothing, lasting over a month on white coats, particularly if they are polyester not cotton.One survey showed the iconic white coats are laundered infrequently, with about half the physicians in one survey saying they washed them once a month. \u201cQuite appallingly, 20% said they had never washed them,\u201d Edmond said.Though there have not yet been any random controlled studies showing that patients treated by physicians wearing white coats and ties had higher rates of preventable infections that those treated by BBE physicians the concept \u201chas biologic plausibility,\u201d Edmond said. Further, trying BBE has \u201cno risk, except to some people\u2019s egos\u201d and minimal cost.Nonsense said Fishman. \u201cThere is no evidence that BBE works,\u201d he said. With all the headaches and challenges physicians and hospital face \u201cYou want us to be fashion police too?\u201d Fishman presented a slide show that featured hairy forearms, tattooed forearms, and arms of men with plaque psoriasis, suggesting that baring forearms could be unprofessional and even hazardous.And what about the \u201ccommit to sit\u201d doctrine that encourages physicians to talk to patients at eye level, not tower above them. \u201cWill going bare below the knee be next?\u201d he asked. Edmond, showing photo of a filthy white coat he said belonged to a coworker, said it was simply common sense to think BBE would be safer and cleaner. \u201cYour mother would tell you that,\u201d Edmond said.Fishman responded with quotes from a UK physician who charged that the BBE practice of wearing scrubs had led to a \u201cless robust view of infection control\u201d in which physicians began to neglect hand-washing and acquired \u201ca slovenly personal appearance.\u201d Other complaints were that doctors never knew what time it was and had \"no place to put their stuff,\" he said.In a straw poll after the debate, the audience sided 58% to 42% with Fishman, who at one point showed a slide of himself in a white coat, his arm around the shoulders of a life-sized cutout of Pope Francis, a recent visitor to Philadelphia. The pontiff was wearing white vestments, Fishman pointed out.Ending the debate on a more serious note, Edmond challenged Fishman to compare his hospital\u2019s infection data with Edmond\u2019s after the Iowa hospital ho has started its BBE policy. He is confident there will be fewer hospital-aquired infections, he said.Editor's note: An earlier version of this story misstated Dr. Edmond's institutional affiliation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the UK's National Health Service, physicians are \"bare below the elbows\" meaning they wear scrubs and not white coats, dress shirts and ties.
