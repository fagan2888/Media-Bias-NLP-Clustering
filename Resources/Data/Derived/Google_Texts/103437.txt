Iowa’s insurance regulator has taken the federal government to court regarding the liquidation of insurance company CoOportunity Health.

Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart filed a suit Tuesday against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. At issue is whether a local order for CoOportunity's liquidation applies to the federal agencies.

Filed in U.S. District Court, the suit asks the court to declare that Iowa law is applied when determining the priority of claims from creditors. In the suit, Gerhart argues the federal government is claiming it has “super priority” over other claims and creditors tied to the case.

It also seeks to lift an “administrative hold” Gerhart says HHS has put on payments it is supposed to make to CoOportunity.

“The federal government has tried to jump to the head of the creditor line, but is not following Iowa or federal law in withholding over $20 million due to CoOportunity,” Gerhart said in a statement Tuesday.

A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in an email the agency had no comment.

CoOportunity Health was an Iowa-based health insurance company established under the Affordable Care Act. It had received about $146 million in federal money under the federal law, also known as Obamacare.

State regulators took over the company in December 2014 after it faced millions of dollars in losses.

The company had an operating loss of more than $163 million in 2014, according to the lawsuit. It had about 120,000 policyholders in Iowa and Nebraska before its collapse.

While it was one of 23 health insurance co-ops set up under the federal health care law, CoOportunity was the first to fail.
