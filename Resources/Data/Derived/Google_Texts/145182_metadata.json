Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), when the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted on his confirmation last month.\n\nThere is some question whether he will be confirmed by the full Senate.\n\nHe needs just 51 \u201cyes\u201d votes, and there are 55 Democratic senators. But Republicans hope to pressure Democrats facing tough reelection fights this year to oppose him.\n\nIf Kirk remains a backer, seven Democrats would have to vote \"no\" to doom the nomination.\n\nAfter the NRA circulated a letter opposing Murthy, several Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), argued the young doctor was picked for his political activity and lacks the experience to be the nation's leading health advocate.\n\n\"This nominee seems much more committed to politics than to patients,\" Barrasso, a former surgeon, said.\n\nMurthy founded Doctors for Obama, now Doctors for America, a group that has promoted Obamacare and gun control measures, including a proposed assault weapons ban.\n\nSome Republican senators also are irked at Murthy for ripping them on Twitter.\n\nAt a February committee hearing, Alexander read to Murthy a 2012 tweet in which the doctor said he was \"tired of politicians playing politics with guns, putting lives at-risk because they are scared of the NRA.\"\n\nMurthy told Alexander he does not plan \"to use the Surgeon General's Office as a bully pulpit for gun control.\"\n\nHe said he \"priority and focus is going to be on obesity prevention.\"\n\n\"My concerns with regards to issues like gun violence have to do with my experience as a physician,\" he said.\n\ndfriedman@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "DAN FRIEDMAN", "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Vivek Murthy is under fire from the group and some Senate Republicans for asserting that gun violence constitutes a health problem.", "title": "NRA shooting at Obama's surgeon general pick", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nra-shooting-obama-surgeon-general-pick-article-1.1720063", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1720062.1394689521!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-surgeon-general.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Dan Friedman", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "gun control", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-03-13T05:54:54", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nra-shooting-obama-surgeon-general-pick-article-1.1720063", "parsely-title": "NRA shooting at Obama's surgeon general pick", "sailthru.date": "2014-03-13T01:54:54-0400", "sailthru.title": "NRA shooting at Obama's surgeon general pick", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1720062.1394689521!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-surgeon-general.jpg", "description": "Dr. Vivek Murthy is under fire from the group and some Senate Republicans for asserting that gun violence constitutes a health problem.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Dr. Vivek Murthy is under fire from the group and some Senate Republicans for asserting that gun violence constitutes a health problem.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Dr. Vivek Murthy is under fire from the group and some Senate Republicans for asserting that gun violence constitutes a health problem.", "title": "NRA shooting at Obama's surgeon general pick", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nra-shooting-obama-surgeon-general-pick-article-1.1720063", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1720062.1394689521!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-surgeon-general.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "gun control", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "DAN FRIEDMAN", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1720062.1394689521!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-surgeon-general.jpg"}, "article_summary": "\"My concerns with regards to issues like gun violence have to do with my experience as a physician,\" he said.\nWASHINGTON - The National Rifle Association is working to shoot down President Obama's pick for surgeon general.\nAfter the NRA circulated a letter opposing Murthy, several Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.\nMurthy told Alexander he does not plan \"to use the Surgeon General's Office as a bully pulpit for gun control.\"\nSome Republican senators also are irked at Murthy for ripping them on Twitter."}
