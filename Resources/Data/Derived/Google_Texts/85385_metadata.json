Next year\u2019s political campaign is casting a long shadow, with new moves by potential Republican candidates and a public relations push by Columbus, Ohio, to land the Democratic convention. Plus, former Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia wastes no time in getting a new job.\n\nCongressional Republicans have had their issues with France as an ally, but there were nothing but expressions of solidarity and pledges of aid from Capitol Hill after Wednesday\u2019s attack in Paris.\n\n\u201cAmerica stands with France,\u201d said Representative Mac Thornberry, the Texas Republican who is the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nOn his Facebook page, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was even more emphatic. \u201cThis most recent attack,\u201d he said, \u201cis an attack on us all.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers said the murder of a dozen people at the office of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper, was a bitter reminder that terrorists can strike anywhere.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be cooperating, obviously, with the French in every way that we can to help them respond in a way that they think is appropriate,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.\n\nBut the attack also presented Republicans with a political dilemma. They are threatening to cut Department of Homeland Security financing over President Obama\u2018s executive action on immigration while at the same time warning of potential terrorist attacks.\n\nTop Republicans promised that the Homeland Security funds were not in danger.\n\n\u201cI believe that the president\u2019s executive actions with regard to immigration are outside of the Constitution and outside of his powers,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner said. \u201cAnd I believe that we can deal with that issue in the Department of Homeland Security bill without jeopardizing the security of our country.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nThe attack in Paris figures into a push in Washington to release more classified documents related to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nA bipartisan group of House members \u2014 in cooperation with former Senator Bob Graham of Florida \u2014 has joined the families of 9/11 victims in pressing the White House to release a 28-page classified section of the joint congressional report on the terrorists\u2019 strikes.\n\nThe 28 pages deal with the hijackers\u2019 financing and logistical support. Mr. Graham \u2014 a past chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 said the report, which he helped prepare and release in 2002, \u201cpoints a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThe section was classified by President George W. Bush, and the Obama administration has rebuffed calls to make it public.\n\nMr. Graham and other advocates of the classified information\u2019s release said the pages in question were essential to understanding what happened in 2001 and could deter attacks like the one in France by making it clear that the United States would expose any foreign support for terrorists.\n\nRepresentatives Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, and Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, have introduced a resolution calling on the White House to declassify the pages. Keeping them secret, the resolution says, \u201cprevents the people of the United States from having access to information about the involvement of certain foreign governments in the terrorist attacks of September 2001.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do,\u201d Mr. Jones said, \u201cis put pressure on the White House.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nPotential Republican presidential candidates are becoming less shy about their ultimate intentions.\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida announced a new political action committee this week, and, according to Politico, he is ready to release a decade\u2019s worth of tax returns.\n\nGov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is already jousting with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and, according to CNN, has a potential campaign manager lined up. In an interview this week with a conservative radio host, he also had well-practiced answers about his timeline for making a decision about running and whether his lack of a college degree would be a hindrance.\n\nAnd, as we warned you last month, the books are coming. On Wednesday, hardback editions from former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida landed on the desks of reporters across the country. The jackets show both would-be candidates against a backdrop of blue skies and scattered clouds.\n\nBut even in the earliest days of the 2016 campaign it is hard to avoid controversy.\n\nDr. Ben Carson, a conservative activist who is considered a long-shot presidential contender, is facing allegations that he plagiarized parts of his 2012 book, \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d A BuzzFeed investigation found that he lifted passages from the website SocialismSucks.net, among other sources.\n\nDr. Carson\u2019s agent said he did not intend to plagiarize.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nThe door had hardly closed on Saxby Chambliss\u2019s congressional career before the former Georgia senator had lined up a new job.\n\nMr. Chambliss, most recently the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, is joining the international law firm DLA Piper as a partner based in Atlanta and Washington. He will be advising clients on cybersecurity and similar topics while keeping a hand in the world of intelligence.\n\n\u201cI want to be engaged on the policy side of that,\u201d Mr. Chambliss said.\n\nAmong the former colleagues whom Mr. Chambliss will be joining at DLA Piper is Ray LaHood, a onetime House member from Illinois and a former secretary of transportation.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nSenate Republicans will take a step toward an anticipated showdown with President Obama on Thursday as they take action on a bill to force construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nThe Senate Energy Committee is expected to easily pass the bill under the leadership of its new Republican chairwoman, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. There will be at least one Democratic yes vote \u2013 from Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who is a co-sponsor.\n\nSenator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, will not try to amend the bill or block the its passage, her staff said last night. She and other Democrats are holding most of their fire for debate on the Senate floor, where they plan to introduce multiple amendments attacking the measure and undermining its Republican sponsors.\n\nThe fireworks on both sides will be all for show. Democrats can\u2019t get enough votes to pass their amendments or block the bill, and Republicans can\u2019t get the president\u2019s signature.\n\nBut Thursday\u2019s committee meeting will be an opportunity to check out a handful of Republican freshmen in action \u2013 Cory Gardner of Colorado, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Steve Daines of Montana and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.\n\nMr. Cassidy won his seat by defeating the committee\u2019s previous chairwoman, Mary L. Landrieu, in a runoff after she failed to move the pipeline bill forward.\n\n\u2014 Coral Davenport\n\nA day after the Paris attack, the Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a closed meeting at 9 a.m.\n\nThe House is expected to consider the Save American Workers Act of 2015, which would redefine the number of hours that people work each week before their employers fall under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe United States Agriculture Coalition for Cuba holds its first meeting since President Obama announced he would lift the Cuban embargo.\n\nColumbus, Ohio, wants to sweeten its chances at beating out Philadelphia and Brooklyn to secure the 2016 Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe incentive comes in the form of ice cream from homegrown Jeni\u2019s Splendid, with a special note from the founder, Jeni Britton Bauer. \u201cNew York and Philly are great, traditional options,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s had vanilla, strawberry or chocolate knows this.\u201d\n\nBut of Columbus, she wrote, \u201cWe\u2019re your salty caramel. Unexpected, revelatory, beloved.\u201d\n\nTrash talk is common in the convention-selection process, but until now, Columbus has been relatively quiet in pursuing its bid. That was until a brassy news release went out this week boasting of the city\u2019s 1.7 million-square-foot convention center and bragging that Columbus had the same flair as Jeni\u2019s Splendid, \u201cperhaps the nation\u2019s most famous ice cream maker.\u201d (Ben & Jerry could not be immediately reached for comment.)\n\nColumbus has been the underdog among the three finalists. But Philadelphia has run into problems securing donations for the convention, according to party officials, and there are security concerns about Brooklyn that have grown only worse since the recent confrontations between Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York Police Department.\n\nThe Republicans have already chosen Cleveland. The Democratic National Committee is expected to make its decision in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u2014 Amy Chozick\n\nThe latest coverage of the terrorist attack in France.\n\nDemocrats are already getting surly in the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nIn a Political Memo, Jonathan Martin looks at the generational challenges facing Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Jeb Bush of Florida, two former governors, should they run for president.\n\nPresident Obama is on a three-day tour serving up \u201cspoilers\u201d from the State of the Union address later this month.\n\nA federal appeals court hears arguments over the restrictive abortion laws in Texas.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner is under pressure to secure immediate policy victories over the White House, according to The New Yorker.\n\nPolitico details the problems that four potential Republican presidential candidates \u2014 Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin \u2014 are having at home that could interfere with their plans for 2016.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told a forum sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that both parties have supported policies that hurt the American middle class, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nEconomic growth this year will finally benefit ordinary American families, The Economist says.\n\nThe former House Speaker Newt Gingrich reminisces with The Weekly Standard about the \u201cRepublican Revolution\u201d of the 1990s and the modern history of American conservatism.", "article_metadata": {"adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2015/01/08", "PT": "Blogs", "BN": "first-draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "politics/firstdraft", "twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/01/08/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "sourceApp": "blogs", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-01082015.jsonp", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "SCG": "First Draft", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd028f\"", "article_summary": "But the attack also presented Republicans with a political dilemma.\nJeb Bush of Florida announced a new political action committee this week, and, according to Politico, he is ready to release a decade\u2019s worth of tax returns.\nNext year\u2019s political campaign is casting a long shadow, with new moves by potential Republican candidates and a public relations push by Columbus, Ohio, to land the Democratic convention.\n\u2014 Coral DavenportA day after the Paris attack, the Senate Intelligence Committee will hold a closed meeting at 9 a.m.\nDemocrats can\u2019t get enough votes to pass their amendments or block the bill, and Republicans can\u2019t get the president\u2019s signature."}
