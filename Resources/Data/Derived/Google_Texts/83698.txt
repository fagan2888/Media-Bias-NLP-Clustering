On Aug. 19, the Fond du Lac Reporter published an article about a billboard that appears along Interstate 41 in Oshkosh noting that the content of the sign is unusual for this stretch of highway. The billboard depicts Mount Rushmore, but not with images of our founding fathers. Instead, Mao Zedong, Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin are portrayed next to President Barack Obama. The tagline reads, “My real father’s dream. Search it” and invites passersby to visit the website InfoWars.com.

The General Council of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Agnes has discussed the message conveyed by the billboard and finds it highly offensive. The First Amendment protects citizens’ right to free speech, but this does not include the publication of untruths that harm a person or his/her reputation through ridicule, hatred, scorn or contempt. The sisters believe the billboard demeans the office of the presidency of the United States and the dignity of the president. In keeping with the U.S. Catholic Bishops’ call to Faithful Citizenship, CSA believes it is a civic duty to respect the offices and office holders of our government.

Acting on this belief and in consonance with the Congregation’s commitment to uphold human dignity of all people through ministries of education, healthcare and pastoral care, we invite others to oppose this type of advertisement. We invite you to speak with family and friends, write your legislators and use social media to support First Amendment rights without undermining the human dignity of those in public office.
