The conservative world is an endless shooting gallery of hypocrites, con men, narcissists, and walking examples of this or that species of cognitive malfunction. In fact, whacking the wingers is such a fun pastime that it is ballooning in popularity these days: The crazy right now furnishes reliable material for our generation\u2019s best comedians, and laughing at the benighted japes of the GOPers is, for many of us, the closest we come to real political involvement.\n\nToday let\u2019s try a little introspection instead. What does it mean when being \u201con the left\u201d is defined as being a fan of extremely partisan entertainment? What does it do to our larger political vision when we confine our political thinking to the crafting of hilarious put-downs of Tea Partiers and right-wing reality-doubters?\n\nThe answer is simple: We miss a substantial chunk of political reality ourselves.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by reminding you of one of the most disturbing news stories to come across the wires in the last month. In a much-reported study, the Russell Sage Foundation discovered that median household wealth in this country fell by 36 percent in the 10-year period ending last year. Wealth for people at the top, as other news stories remind us, has continued to soar. These things are a consequence of the Great Recession, of course, but they are also a reminder of the grand narrative of our time: The lot of average Americans constantly seems to be growing worse. The Great Depression of the 1930s was awful, but it set America on the path toward a period of shared prosperity. Our bout of hard times has had the opposite effect. It has accelerated the unraveling of the middle class itself.\n\nNow, you can blame the risible, Ayn Rand-reading Tea Party types for this if you like, and you can also blame the George W. Bush Administration. They both deserve it. But sooner or later you will also have to acknowledge that there are two parties in this country, not just one; that the Democrats held significant power during the period in question, including (for much of it) the presidency itself; and that even when they are not in the White House, these Democrats nevertheless retain the capacity to persuade and to organize. For a party of the left, dreadful news like this should be rocket fuel. For the Dems, however, it hasn\u2019t been. Why is that? Well, for one thing, because a good number of those Democrats have not really objected to the economic policies that have worked these awful changes over the years. They may believe in the theory of evolution\u2014hell, they may savor the same Jon Stewart jokes that you do \u2014but a lot of them also believe in the conventional economic wisdom of the day. They don\u2019t really care that union power has evaporated and that Wall Street got itself de-supervised and that oligopolies now dominate the economy. But they do care\u2014ever so much!\u2014about deficits and being fiscally responsible.\n\nBring up this obvious point, however, and you will quickly discover what a dose of chloroform the partisan style can be. There\u2019s a political war on, you will be told; one side is markedly better than the other; and no criticism of the leadership can be tolerated. Instead, let\u2019s get back to laughing along with our favorite politicized comedians, and to smacking that Rick Santorum punching bag.\n\nDo I exaggerate? Not really. I recently happened across a paper published by a prominent Democratic strategy outfit that announced there are no longer any important disagreements among Democrats, repeating a popular journalistic meme of the past few weeks. Virtually every Democrat is a populist now, from Elizabeth Warren to the former Clintonites, the paper argues, and so it\u2019s time for people on the left to halt their \u201cstruggle for the soul of the party.\u201d Specifically, they must stop accusing \u201cnon-progressive candidates\u201d of \u201cloyalties to groups like Wall Street.\u201d To continue an \u201cunabated struggle against all former adversaries,\u201d apparently meaning Clinton-era centrists, is \u201cquite literally to \u2018fight the last war.\u2019 \u201d Actually, it\u2019s worse than that: to criticize centrist Democrats who have something to do with Wall Street is to contradict categorically the come-together approach that is mandated by our present historical situation:", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's easy to take shots and laugh at the know-nothing right.
