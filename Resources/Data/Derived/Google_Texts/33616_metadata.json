Cory Booker of New Jersey, not Congressman Cory Gardner of Colorado who wants to unseat Sen. Mark Udall \u2014 implored Coloradans on Saturday to make the effort to ensure Udall wins his re-election bid.\n\nBooker described Gardner as a \u201cwingnut\u201d and said the reason the country is interested in Udall\u2019s race is because \u201cso goes Colorado in November, so goes America.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Sen. Udall is relentless,\u201d Booker said, but noted, \u201cThis election will not be determined on his work ethic. It will be determined on ours.\u201d\n\nGardner\u2019s campaign in response referred to Booker as an out-of-state bully.\n\nDemocrats are more likely to show up in presidential elections, but skip the others \u2014 something the left in Colorado wants to make sure doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nBooker and Colorado\u2019s other U.S. senator, Michael Bennet, helped Udall kick off the official opening of his campaign office in northeast Denver. The standing-room only crowd laughed and cheered at Booker\u2019s jokes \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve only been in the Senate 10 months; I still have that new senator smell\u201d \u2014 and jeered when he mentioned New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who has been making news in Colorado on several fronts, from pot to the governor\u2019s primary.\n\n\u201cThere is not a race in the country where there is a greater difference between the two people running for the U.S. Senate than right here in Colorado,\u201d Bennet said.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Booker.\n\n\u201cPlease understand that this is not a man who reflects Colorado,\u201d he said, of Gardner. \u201cHe represents the wingnuts. He is way out there.\u201d\n\nGardner\u2019s campaign spokesman Alex Siciliano fired back.\n\n\u201cWhile Sen. Udall continues to bring in a parade of out-of-state bullies to prop up his failing campaign,\u201d Siciliano said, \u201cCory spent the day in Pueblo meeting with Coloradans about how Obamacare is hurting their families, how Sen. Udall\u2019s energy tax would kill jobs and how Sen. Udall\u2019s record of rubber stamping President Obama\u2019s failed policies is damaging the future for Colorado families.\u201d\n\nBooker offered an example of what happens when Democrats don\u2019t vote in off-year elections. He told the crowd that when he voted for U.S. Sen. Barack Obama for president in 2008, the line of voters went around the block. But during New Jersey\u2019s election for governor a year later, the polling place was deserted. Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine lost to Christie, 44.9 percent to 49.5 percent.\n\nUdall talked about familiar themes \u2014 paying women the same as men for the doing the same job, making college more affordable \u2014 but in his final remarks the senator addressed the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., after police shot an unarmed black 18-year-old.\n\nNortheast Denver has the highest concentration of black voters in the city and a number of blacks \u2014 including a state lawmaker, two City Council members and a member of the Denver school board \u2014 were in the audience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic. It\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Udall said. \u201cUnarmed black men are not criminals. We need to do something. I don\u2019t have the answer but we can\u2019t let this fade away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cory Booker,Cory Gardner,Ferguson Missouri,Mark Udall,Michael Bennet", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Sen.
