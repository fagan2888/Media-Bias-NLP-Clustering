After Trump’s whirlwind series of meetings with Capitol Hill Republicans, Senate Democrats sought to portray the presumptive nominee and GOP legislators as sharing a set of identical and destructive policy stances.

Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Bob Casey told reporters that Senate Republicans are in step with Trump’s ideology on opposing immigration reform, in their approach to fighting ISIS, in seeking to repeal Obamacare, and in not putting forward economic policies that would help the middle class.

“You could almost say to that caucus, ‘You built that candidacy,’” said Casey, putting a twist on a phrase that Republicans used derisively against President Obama during the 2012 election.

Top Republican lawmakers had sought to portray a sense of unity after Wednesday's meetings. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has yet to endorse Trump, released a statement that he and Trump are "totally committed" to working together.

Asked about a poll of Pennsylvania voters this week showing Trump in a dead heat with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Casey said the state often has had close races for the presidency.

But Casey said he believes Democrats – and Clinton in particular – have an advantage this fall in the state on economic issues and foreign policy.

Casey's position alongside New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and others during the afternoon press conference may reflect the larger role that he'll play as his tenure in the Senate continues to grow, according to political analysts. He's also been outspoken in calling on his Republican colleagues to consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.

It's a leadership role Casey is likely to reprise throughout the year, including at this summer's Democratic National Convention, thanks to Casey's position not only as a prominent Democrat but as a Pennsylvanian.
