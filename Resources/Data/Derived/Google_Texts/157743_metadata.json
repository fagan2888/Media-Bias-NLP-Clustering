Boston blew out the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s twice this week that we\u2019ve handled it better, once we didn\u2019t,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cI just thought we played gutsy at the end.\u201d\n\nIn a handful of games earlier this season, the Celtics had squandered big leads and ended up losing.\n\nRajon Rondo had a triple-double with 13 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists for the Celtics, who won their third straight after a season-high five-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cWe got to do what we did to get the lead,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cI think we stopped running (when) they score every time down it\u2019s hard to run and were able to get stops and push the ball up, that\u2019s how we got the lead.\u201d\n\nRasual Butler scored 14 of his 22 points in the final quarter for the Wizards, who failed to match the franchise\u2019s best start since 1968-69.\n\nPierce, who played for the Celtics for 15 seasons and was a member of their 2008 championship team before being traded to Brooklyn prior to last season, scored 16 points. He signed with Washington as a free agent during the offseason.\n\n\u201cThis place will always have a place in my heart \u2014 always,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Wall had 17 points, 14 assists and eight rebounds for Washington, which had won its last four.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason, after winning four and row and playing the way we have, moving the ball and sharing the ball, we came out tonight as individuals,\u201d Wizards coach Randy Wittman said.\n\nThe Celtics had opened their 25-point lead midway into the third quarter before the Wizards made a furious fourth-quarter rally behind Butler.\n\nWashington, which struggled with its shooting, didn\u2019t get into an offensive rhythm until the beginning of the final quarter when Butler nailed three 3-pointers during a 14-3 spree that started the quarter.\n\nButler\u2019s final quarter \u2014 when he nailed four 3-pointers \u2014 helped the Wizards make it 94-93 with just over a minute to play.\n\nPierce front-rimmed a 3 before Avery Bradley nailed one from deep in the right corner for Boston with 37 seconds to play, and Green\u2019s breakaway layup sealed it.\n\nThe Celtics increased it to 63-38 in the third on Rondo\u2019s fastbreak layup and led 77-59 entering the final quarter.\n\n___\n\nTIP-INS\n\nWizards: They were coming off a season-high 119 points in a win over Denver on Friday, but missed 14 of their initial 18 shots and scored only 15 first-quarter points. \u2026 C/F Nene played his second straight after missing five with right plantar fasciitis.\n\nCeltics: Stevens likes the test his team will get facing the Wizards on consecutive days. \u201cI think they\u2019re a legitimate contender out of the East,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is great for us to have to have to play 96 minutes in a row against this team.\u201d \u2026 G Marcus Smart entered the game in the first quarter after being held out of Friday\u2019s game while he recovered from a sprained left ankle that sidelined him for 11 of 12.\n\nWELCOME BACK\n\nPierce got a nice hand during pregame introductions. The crowd near the Wizards bench chanted his name during the third quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s always probably going to be weird just coming up in this arena,\u201d he said before the game. \u201cEven just landing in the airport and driving through the city, taking a left instead of a right into the locker room. It\u2019s always going to be weird coming in here.\u201d\n\nHANDING IT OUT:\n\nWall had his fourth straight game with 12 or more assists.\n\nQUIET DOUBLE-DOUBLE\n\nBoston F Jared Sullinger had 10 points and 10 boards. He took only eight shots.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe teams play the second of the home-and-home Monday night in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rasual Butler scored 14 of his 22 points in the final quarter for the Wizards, who failed to match the franchise's best start since 1968-69.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Rasual Butler scored 14 of his 22 points in the final quarter for the Wizards, who failed to match the franchise\u2019s best start since 1968-69.", "title": "Wizards\u2019 rally falls short in loss to Celtics", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/wizards-rally-falls-short-loss-celtics/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/wizards-celtics-baske_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/wizards-celtics-baske_lanc.jpg", "description": "Rasual Butler scored 14 of his 22 points in the final quarter for the Wizards, who failed to match the franchise's best start since 1968-69.", "card": "summary", "title": "Wizards\u2019 rally falls short in loss to Celtics"}, "Author": "Ken Powtak", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington Wizards, Paul Pierce, Boston, Boston Celtics"}, "article_summary": "BOSTON \u2014 The Boston Celtics are learning the hard way.\nThe Celtics increased it to 63-38 in the third on Rondo\u2019s fastbreak layup and led 77-59 entering the final quarter.\nThe Celtics had opened their 25-point lead midway into the third quarter before the Wizards made a furious fourth-quarter rally behind Butler.\nButler\u2019s final quarter \u2014 when he nailed four 3-pointers \u2014 helped the Wizards make it 94-93 with just over a minute to play.\nJeff Green scored 25 points, reserve Marcus Thornton had 21 and the Celtics nearly blew a 25-point third-quarter lead before beating the Washington Wizards 101-93 Sunday in Paul Pierce\u2019s return."}
