Think about that for a moment, says Klein, at least under certain experimental conditions, our political identities now trump our racial identities.\n\nYou don\u2019t say? Really?\n\nMemo to dude who lives inside the DC bubble: You\u2019ve just found out what conservatives have argued for years. And in finding it out, you\u2019ve made the most compelling argument for smaller government?\n\nWhat law are you going to propose to stop discrimination on the basis of party affiliation?\n\nOh, that\u2019s right. There already is one.\n\nIt\u2019s in the constitution.\n\nIt\u2019s called free association, free speech, freedom OF religion.\n\nYou should look up the constitution. It\u2019s a document written by irrelevant white guys like you, only they were older and wiser.\n\nBut if that doesn\u2019t work there is also the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to look at. It was more popular with Republicans in both the House and the Senate than it was with Democrats.\n\nIn fact one Senator who opposed it on the Republican side at least did so for the RIGHT reasons:\n\n\u201cIf I were a Negro\u201d said Goldwater, who opposed federal intervention on matters of race, \u201cI don't think I would be very patient either.\"\n\nThe Democrats who opposed it did so because they were incorrigible old racists. Were it not for them, there would have been no reason for civil rights legislation.\n\nAt least Goldwater knew why he opposed civil rights legislation, dear Comrade Ezra, even if you forgot to notice.\n\nHe was afraid that the Civil Rights laws would be abused to fit into neat little political bludgeons; bludgeons used to beat a majorities\u2019 common sense. You know? Used to propose things like healthcare as a universal human right, where the government has the right to make you purchase insurance; or where men get to decide which restroom they use as a matter of civil rights. Yes, he thought that it would be silly to construct a body of legislation that would allow grown men to use the ladies\u2019 room as a matter of civil rights.\n\nOk, I made the last part up. Kind of.\n\nBecause clearly Goldwater or any of the other Senators who voted on that legislation would have reacted violently if I were to go back in time and ask them with the utmost seriousness whether the proposed legislation would be abused to cover such foolishness.\n\nBut since you can\u2019t even follow your own professional ethical standards, why would I expect you to follow a new law you profess to have discovered?\n\nIn coming full circle Klein seems determined to justify the old adage by Churchill: \u201cShow me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know exactly where Klein now fits on the continuum. He's still young, I guess.\n\nI just know that Ezra Klein is still an idiot.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Ezra Klein Reveals How He Became an Idiot - John Ransom - Personal Finance, Financial Advice, Money, Business News, Real Estate, Mortgages, Investments, Stocks, Ransom Notes Radio, John Ransom", "og": {"site_name": "finance.townhall.com", "description": "Memo to dude who lives inside the DC bubble: Youve just found out what conservatives have argued for years.
