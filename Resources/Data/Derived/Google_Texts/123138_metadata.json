That\u2019s what he does.\u201d\n\nThe candidates differed on a laundry list of issues.\n\nOn legalizing medical marijuana, Crist said he\u2019s for it. It would offer a preferable alternative for patients now being prescribed powerful pain medication.\n\n\u201cI think it would be much better and humane to have medical marijuana available to these people,\u201d Crist said.\n\nScott said he fears the medical marijuana measure, if approved by voters, could lead to pervasive pot use in the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched family members deal with drug abuse, and it\u2019s scares the daylights out of me,\u201d Scott said.\n\nOn gay marriage, Scott repeated his opposition to it and said the state will not retreat from fighting it in court.\n\nIt\u2019s going to go through the court system, the courts are eventually going to decide,\u201d Scott said, adding that his administration will abide with what the courts ultimately rule.\n\nCrist, who opposed same sex marriage when he ran for Governor in 2006, said he has \u201cgrown\u201d in his thinking on it, and now supports allowing gays to wed.\n\n\u201cWho are we to tell people who to love?\u201d Crist said.\n\nCrist also defended his defection from the Republican Party, saying it has fallen off a conservative cliff. In a familiar refrain, Crist said, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave the Republican Party, the Republican Party left me.\u201d\n\nCrist and Scott differed on the economic embargo against Cuba.\n\n\u201cI believe in the embargo. Here\u2019s why: The Castro brothers are terrorists,\u201d Scott said. Scott said Crist has only recently opposed the embargo because opinion polls show it has lost support, and that Crist is doing what the polls tell him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the embargo hasn\u2019t changed things,\u201d Crist countered. \u201cThe Castro brothers are still in place.\u201d He called the embargo a policy that has failed to work, despite being in place for half a century.\n\n\u201cThe definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting a different result,\u201d Crist said.\n\nCrist said he supports increasing the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cI will fight every way I possibly can to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Crist said.\n\nScott opposes raising the minimum wage, arguing it will force employers to lay off workers.\n\n\u201cIf we raise the minimum wage the way Charlie wants to do, it will cost 500,000 jobs,\u201d Scott asserted.\n\nCrist skewered Scott for rejecting billions of federal Medicaid dollars.\n\n\u201cA million of our fellow Floridians need health care and they would get health care if the governor would act to expand Medicaid,\u201d Crist said, glancing at Scott.\n\nScott says he has rejected the increased Medicaid funding, because it is part of a failed health care reform.\n\n\u201cWe got Obamacare. It\u2019s been a disaster for our state. Charlie says it\u2019s great,\u201d Scott said.\n\nCrist supports drivers licenses for so called Dreamers. Scott, however, vetoed licenses for the undocumented immigrants.\n\nOutside the television studio was the odd man out, third party candidate Adrian Wyllie who is suing to be in included in the debates and have his Libertarian platform heard: \u201cKeep government out of your wallet, out of your body, out of your bedroom and out of your business,\u201d Wyllie said.\n\nWyllie said there is no difference between Scott and Crist, that they are political business as usual. Debate organizers have said Wyllie can participate only if a legitimate poll gives him support among 15% of the voters. He has not reached that threshold.\n\nWyllie\u2019s suit names the Florida Press Association, Leadership Florida and Broward College where the October 15th debate will be held. CBS4 is hosting the event which will be televised across the state. If there is an issue you you like the candidates to address \u2018d like to submit a question for the candidates, go to CBSMiami\u2019s Facebook page and submit your question. CBS4 anchor Eliott Rodriguez may ask it during the debate.\n\nWhile Wylle\u2019s poll numbers have climbed, they fell just short of the threshold required by the debate organizers. A new poll shows him gaining, at 13%, just two spots shy of the 15% benchmark. His suit claims his equal protection rights have been violated by exclusion from the debate.\n\nWyllie says the organizers have changed their criteria in order to preserve the two party system.\n\nDean Ridings, President & CEO, Florida Press Association, released a statement which countered Wyllie\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cSince 2010, the partnership of Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association have conducted four statewide debates with a requirement that participating candidates have at least 15% polling support, including the benefit of the poll\u2019s margin of error. There are currently ten candidates who have qualified to run for governor. In a 60 minute debate, there is no feasible way for all ten to express their views, and most of the candidates have no reasonable chance of winning the election. Therefore, we had to have criteria that would include any candidate with a viable chance of winning. We believe our 15% threshold achieves that goal, and the people of Florida will have an opportunity to hear from the candidates who have a real chance of winning the election.\u201d\n\nSo how do the front running candidates feel about Wyllie\u2019s exclusion?\n\nRick Scott\u2019s spokesperson says it\u2019s up to the debate organizers who participate. The Crist campaign told us they don\u2019t have a position on the matter.\n\nWyllie says he hopes the judge will rule within the next few days.\n\nThe third and final debate between the two major candidates takes place October 21st in Jacksonville.\n\nIn the debate Friday, Crist promised to the be little guy\u2019s guy in Tallahassee.\n\n\u201cI look forward to being governor again, to fight for the middle class, to give them a fair shot,\u201d Crist said.\n\nScott pounded away with what has been his mantra in his bid for re-election. Job creation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already added 634,000 jobs,\u201d Scott said.\n\nThe blond-haired, blue-eyed governor delivered portions of his summation in Spanish.\n\n\u201cPeedo su voto,\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m asking for your vote \u2013 Scott said in one of several lines delivered in Spanish, perhaps for good reason: A highly regarded poll just out shows Crist leading Scott among Hispanic voters by a more than two to one margin. If those voters turn out, they could decide the election.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
