The grand opening comes almost two years to the day.\n\n\u201cOur Navajo kids need opportunities to do something constructive with their time. This new facility will give them the opportunity to play sports and have a safe and sanitary place to meet,\u201d President Shelly said.\n\nThe $6.6 million facility located in Shiprock, New Mexico, was funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Measuring 22,000 square feet, the center features rooms for art, games, learning, technology, media and the open ceiling gym.\n\nThe new facility is a welcome distraction for Navajo kids seeking recreational activities that don\u2019t involve drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nPresident Shelly said the war against drugs and alcohol on the Navajo Nation is a daily challenge.\n\n\u201cWe need to teach our children about the dangers of these addictive lifestyles,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new multipurpose building goes a long way toward addressing those dangers, in addition to replacing the dilapidated old facility, which is more than 50 years old.\n\nOur kids are the future leaders of tomorrow, the president said, adding that more youth centers like the one in Shiprock need to be constructed at chapters across the Navajo Nation.\n\n\u201cFirst Lady and I have dedicated our lives to protecting Navajo children,\u201d President Shelly said. \u201cIt started at our home with our kids and grandkids.\n\n\u201cOur homes are the first learning centers for our kids,\u201d he added.\n\nThanking the Navajo Nation Division of Community Development, Navajo Housing Authority, Division of Din\u00e9 Education and the Office of Dine Youth, President Shelly said it was a collaborative effort that made the project a reality.\n\nDesign and Engineering Services worked with Dyron Murphy for the architecture and design. Oakland-Arviso provided the construction.\n\nPresident Shelly said the 2014 presidential election taught the Navajo people the most important lesson of all\u2014the preservation of self-identity.\n\n\u201c(The election) taught us the importance of preserving our Navajo language and culture. I have great hope that this new facility will help us preserve those elements in our lives,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly attended the grand opening of the Shiprock Youth Center and snipped the ribbon to officially open the facility.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/01/shiprock-youth-center-opens-navajo-children-159845", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/president-shelly-shiprock-youth-center.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Shiprock Youth Center Opens for Navajo Children"}, "abstract": "Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly attended the grand opening of the Shiprock Youth Center and snipped the ribbon to officially open the facility.", "dc": {"title": "Shiprock Youth Center Opens for Navajo Children"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/01/shiprock-youth-center-opens-navajo-children-159845", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Navajo Nation, Native Youth, Substance Abuse, Department of Housing and Urban Development", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-01T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Shiprock Youth Center Opens for Navajo Children"}, "article_summary": "Recently Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly attended the grand opening of the Shiprock Youth Center and snipped the ribbon to officially open the spacious facility to the general public.\nOn March 6, 2013, President Shelly broke ground for the new youth center.\n\u201cOur Navajo kids need opportunities to do something constructive with their time.\n\u201cFirst Lady and I have dedicated our lives to protecting Navajo children,\u201d President Shelly said.\nPresident Shelly said the war against drugs and alcohol on the Navajo Nation is a daily challenge."}
