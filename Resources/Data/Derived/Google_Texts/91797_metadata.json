It\u2019s a lovely tradition, so long as you give the right answer.\n\n(Hint: Spouses and kids are generally safe picks. If you go with Obamacare or the right to bear arms, things could go from festive to testy in a hurry.)\n\nWhat if the political press \u2014 like, the whole thing embodied in a single, turkey-munching person \u2014 were a guest at your dinner table? What would the media say it is thankful for?\n\nHere\u2019s a guess at the top five:\n\n1. Donald Trump\n\nWas there any doubt about who or what would be in this spot?\n\nSome in the media love Trump. Some don\u2019t. But almost everyone likes covering the bombastic Republican presidential front-runner. He\u2019s a ratings machine \u2014 just ask him.\n\nTwenty-four million people tuned in to see him on a debate stage for the first time in September, five months before the first primary votes are cast. That\u2019s a huge number. It\u2019s more people than watched any game of the World Series this year, and it smashed the previous record for a cable audience.\n\nWhether voters love or loathe The Donald, they are extremely interested in what he has to say. And that means they will read, watch or listen to the media\u2019s many, many reports on his movements, even at this relatively early stage in the campaign.\n\n2. Bernie Sanders\n\nSanders has faded in national polls in recent weeks, but he has made the Democratic primary more compelling than expected. With Vice President Biden staying out of the race, the primary had the potential to become a dull march toward the inevitable coronation of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nInstead, the feisty, hand-flapping senator from Vermont has made Clinton work. He has drawn huge crowds to his rallies \u2014 more than 10,000 in some cases. At one point in September, Sanders held a sizable lead in New Hampshire. He still has an edge there and is within striking distance in Iowa, according to a recent CBS News/YouGov survey.\n\nNo one likes covering a one-horse race, and Sanders has provided enough competition to keep things interesting.\n\n3. Twitter\n\nIt\u2019s possible for members of the press to get in trouble in 140 characters or fewer (yes, fewer, not less). CNN reporter Elise Labbott stepped in it last week with her commentary on a House vote to beef up screening of Syrian refugees and was suspended.\n\nHouse passes bill that could limit Syrian refugees. Statue of Liberty bows head in anguish @CNNPolitics https://t.co/5RvZwVftgD \u2014 Elise Labott (@eliselabottcnn) November 19, 2015\n\nEveryone, It was wrong of me to editorialize. My tweet was inappropriate and disrespectful. I sincerely apologize. \u2014 Elise Labott (@eliselabottcnn) November 20, 2015\n\nBut think of all the great material Twitter delivers to the media. Trump\u2019s account, alone, is a gold mine that never runs out, but there\u2019s more. Twitter has also brought us such gems as \u2026\n\n\u2026 John McCain\u2019s discussion of tax policy with a \u201cJersey Shore\u201d star \u2026\n\n@Sn00ki u r right, I would never tax your tanning bed! Pres Obama's tax/spend policy is quite The Situation. but I do rec wearing sunscreen! \u2014 John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) June 9, 2010\n\n... Scott Brown\u2019s \u201cBqhatevwr\u201d \u2026\n\n\u2026 and Anthoney Weiner\u2019s you-know-what.\n\n4. Debates\n\nDebate day for a political reporter is like game day for a sports reporter. It\u2019s full of action, conflict, and there are usually winners and losers.\n\nThis year, the debates have been particularly intriguing. Well, mostly the third Republican one \u2014 the one run by CNBC in Boulder that prompted the GOP to suspend its partnership with NBC News on a future debate and had the candidates calling for handpicked conservative moderators, like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Mark Levin.\n\nThat one event supplied two weeks\u2019 worth of material for the press and might have yielded more, except that there was, you know, another debate to cover.\n\n5. Polls\n\nThere\u2019s sooo much you can do with a single poll and, even though surveys taken a year before the general election really don\u2019t mean much, they do tell us who\u2019s hot right now.\n\nKnowing who\u2019s hot right now is helpful for many reasons. It helps dictate who gets covered \u2014 and how much \u2014 and helps determine who gets to be on debate stages. But it also offers valuable insight into the mood of the electorate.\n\nMany journalists remain skeptical that Trump or fellow outsider Ben Carson will ultimately win the Republican nomination, for instance, but their consistent place atop the polls suggests that many conservative voters are fed up with the GOP\u2019s more conventional leading figures and want bolder leadership.\n\nKnowing the public\u2019s priorities helps journalists do their jobs better. And that\u2019s something to be thankful for.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Happy Thanksgiving.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/callum.borchers", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Happy Thanksgiving.", "title": "Donald Trump, and 4 other things the political media is thankful for this Thanksgiving", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/26/five-things-the-political-media-is-thankful-for-this-thanksgiving/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/27/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Obama_Thanksgiving_Turkey-0bcc7-1665.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@callumborchers"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/26/five-things-the-political-media-is-thankful-for-this-thanksgiving/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Thanksgiving, media, Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Twitter, debates, polls", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/callum.borchers"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Thanksgiving, media, Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Twitter, debates, polls"}, "article_summary": "What would the media say it is thankful for?\nWhat if the political press \u2014 like, the whole thing embodied in a single, turkey-munching person \u2014 were a guest at your dinner table?\nIf you go with Obamacare or the right to bear arms, things could go from festive to testy in a hurry.)\nIt helps dictate who gets covered \u2014 and how much \u2014 and helps determine who gets to be on debate stages.\n(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)If your family is like many others (or, at least, the ones on TV), you\u2019ll all go around the table on Thanksgiving and say what you\u2019re thankful for."}
