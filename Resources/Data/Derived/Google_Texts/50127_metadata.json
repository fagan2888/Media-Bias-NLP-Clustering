That\u2019s not just by luck.\u201d\n\nNot luck, because most of these files are for medical debt. The Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to more than 10 million Americans who were previously without health insurance and provided subsidies to millions more. But it hasn\u2019t changed much for those who have fallen behind in paying for healthcare.\n\nRoy spends a big chunk of his workday signing judgments against people who owe money to hospitals and medical providers. \u201cIt\u2019s like the tide coming in every week,\" he says.\n\nMedical debt affects one of every four Americans and accounts for more than half of all bankruptcies.\n\nAt age 60, Scott Cliett says he\u2019s in debt for the first time in his life. Chronic pancreatitis has forced him to stop working, and regularly sends him to the emergency room for a week at a time. He now has free health coverage through the Affordable Care Act, but he\u2019s still struggling to pay off old debt. Missing a single $25 installment landed Cliett in court.\n\n\u201cThe Judge did allow me to speak, but the fact that I admitted I do owe them money pretty much cut everything else off,\u201d Cliett says, reflecting on his day in court. \u201c\u2018You know, I\u2019m sympathetic to your plight, but I have to follow the letter of the law. You owe them money, so therefore I\u2019m granting the judgment.\u2019\u201d\n\nMost of Cliett\u2019s bills were forgiven through the hospital\u2019s charity care program. But he\u2019s barely made a dent in the remainder, like a $4,000 ambulance ride.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, $4,000 divided by twenty five dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cMy grandkids will probably still be working on it when I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nOverall, gaps in coverage like Cliett\u2019s are the exception to the rule. The vast majority of people with medical debt have insurance the whole time those costs are piling up. But the bills insurance doesn\u2019t cover can be devastating on their own.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, who teaches health policy at City University of New York, says health insurance is often a \"defective product.\"\n\n\u201cPeople buy it in good faith to try and get medical care and make sure their bills are paid, and then when they get an expensive or prolonged illness, the health insurance doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she says.\n\nWoolhandler says Obamacare has definitely helped. She says even with Obamacare, many policies still have high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nKaren Pollitz, who co-authored a recent study on medical debt for the Kaiser Family Foundation, says, \u201cWe see a lot of plans, still, that have 2, 3, 4, 5,000, $6,000 deductibles. That\u2019s still way more than most Americans have on hand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2015/05/13/health-care/despite-insurance-some-americans-still-struggle-medical-debt", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/medicalpiece.jpg?itok=hSQ_aAgV", "type": "article", "description": "More than 50 percent of all bankruptcies are linked to medical debt.", "title": "Despite insurance, some Americans still struggle with medical debt"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "U5lBSAQdZd28B4+zWfkdaQxXKJOWz20zfrhCWKXsK5tI3z+njhuxRMaDlxnTR/5xB6OsB11mxNcr3cnK9+yq8Q==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5bb\"", "article_summary": "Medical debt affects one of every four Americans and accounts for more than half of all bankruptcies.\nThe vast majority of people with medical debt have insurance the whole time those costs are piling up.\nThat\u2019s not just by luck.\u201dNot luck, because most of these files are for medical debt.\nDistrict Court Judge Kevin Roy says medical debt comprises well over half the court files awaiting his signature each week.\nThat\u2019s one reason Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, who teaches health policy at City University of New York, says health insurance is often a \"defective product.\""}
