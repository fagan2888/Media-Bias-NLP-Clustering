A lot of things have gone global, and it's unlikely to recede,\" Lagarde said.\n\nIn their first step, the five European nationals will launch a pilot initiative for automatic exchange of information on beneficial ownership and hope to broaden the scheme to include other nations.\n\nUrging a global exchange of beneficial ownership information in order to remove 'the veil of secrecy under which criminals operate', the ministers acknowledged cracks in the current framework and called on others to apply enhanced standards of transparency.\n\n(Additional reporting by Gernot Heller; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Europe's biggest nations launched a joint scheme on Thursday to", "title": "Top European powers join forces to clamp down on tax evasion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/14/Europes-biggest-nations-join-forces-end-tax-evasion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/panama-tax-iceland-protest_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/14/Europes-biggest-nations-join-forces-end-tax-evasion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/panama-tax-iceland-protest_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Europe's biggest nations launched a joint scheme on Thursday to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"In the future, nobody should be able to hide behind complex legal structures,\" German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said as he unveiled the initiative.\nIn their first step, the five European nationals will launch a pilot initiative for automatic exchange of information on beneficial ownership and hope to broaden the scheme to include other nations.\nFrench finance minister Michel Sapin said the joint effort should be followed by even tougher measures against countries that will not comply.\n\"Fighting tax evasion requires a global response.\"\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Europe's biggest nations launched a joint scheme on Thursday to clamp down on tax evasion and corruption, responding to revelations of the rich and powerful stashing money in far-away tax havens in the so-called Panama Papers."}
