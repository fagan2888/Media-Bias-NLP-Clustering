It amounts to just under 20% of the St. Louis-based company\u2019s income, and presumably that figure will be dropping once the company\u2019s headquarters is relocated to Germany.\n\nOK, the deal doesn\u2019t really count as a tax inversion since Merck /quotes/zigman/157099/delayed DE:MRK , a centuries-old pharmaceutical and chemical company that split from the more familiar Merck & Co. Inc. /quotes/zigman/574389/delayed /quotes/zigman/574389/lastsale MRK in the U.S. after World War I, is the one doing the acquiring. It\u2019s not as if Sigma-Aldrich is buying Merck to get a tax break overseas.\n\nFurther, the tax bill for Sigma-Aldrich actually will end up being higher than it is now, reports say. It\u2019s effective tax rate now is roughly 25% to 26% when money made on foreign sales is included. In Germany, that\u2019s expected to jump to just under 30%, reports said.\n\nBut the U.S. won\u2019t reap the rewards of roughly $130 million in taxes once the deal is complete. Merck said Monday it is paying $140 a share for Sigma-Aldrich, more than a third higher than the $102.37 closing price for Sigma-Aldrich on Friday.\n\nShares of Sigma-Aldrich jumped more than 33% to $136.40 on the deal, while Merck added more than 4% to 72.63 euros ($93.30). Merck\u2019s life-science operations gets a boost from the deal, as revenue from that part of the business is expected to double. Sigma-Aldrich\u2019s 2013 revenue was $2.7 billion.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nData suggest mid-single-digit price hikes for Obamacare in 2015\n\nLess than half of Obamacare income issues have been resolved\n\nMedicare pricier in unhealthy states, study says", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-09-22T17:45:32-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "The U.S. will miss out on $130 million in domestic taxes once Sigma-Aldrich Corp. is moved to Germany as part of an acquisition.", "title": "How U.S. loses money on Sigma-Aldrich deal with Germany\u2019s Merck", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/09/22/how-u-s-loses-money-on-sigma-aldrich-deal-with-germanys-merck/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT250_pills__MG_20140902105852.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "health,Merck KGaA,mergers,Sigma-Aldrich Corp.", "article.headline": "How U.S. loses money on Sigma-Aldrich deal with Germany\u2019s Merck", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "The U.S. will miss out on $130 million in domestic taxes once Sigma-Aldrich Corp. is moved to Germany as part of an acquisition.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "health,Merck KGaA,mergers,Sigma-Aldrich Corp.", "article.published": "2014-09-22T17:45:32-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/09/22/how-u-s-loses-money-on-sigma-aldrich-deal-with-germanys-merck/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "The U.S. will miss out on $130 million in domestic taxes once Sigma-Aldrich Corp. is moved to Germany as part of an acquisition.", "title": "How U.S. loses money on Sigma-Aldrich deal with Germany\u2019s Merck", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/09/22/how-u-s-loses-money-on-sigma-aldrich-deal-with-germanys-merck/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT250_pills__MG_20140902105852.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-3105", "article.updated": "2014-09-24T12:39:05-04:00"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s what Sigma-Aldrich /quotes/zigman/77951/delayed /quotes/zigman/77951/lastsale SIAL paid in domestic income taxes last year on the $657 million it reported in pretax income for 2013.\nShares of Sigma-Aldrich jumped more than 33% to $136.40 on the deal, while Merck added more than 4% to 72.63 euros ($93.30).\nMerck said Monday it is paying $140 a share for Sigma-Aldrich, more than a third higher than the $102.37 closing price for Sigma-Aldrich on Friday.\nIt\u2019s not as if Sigma-Aldrich is buying Merck to get a tax break overseas.\nMerck\u2019s life-science operations gets a boost from the deal, as revenue from that part of the business is expected to double."}
