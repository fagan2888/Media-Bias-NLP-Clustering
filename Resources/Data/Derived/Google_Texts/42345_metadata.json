But when Lindsey Vonn does it Sunday in Portillo, Chile, it figures to be a very special moment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI\u2019m super antsy. I\u2019ve had my boots laid out for a couple weeks already. Hopefully we will get some good weather and I will be training, but just to be out there skiing is going to be awesome.\u201d\n\nHer recovery from reconstructive knee surgery has gone exceptionally well and put her ahead of schedule. It\u2019s been six weeks since she even needed to ice her knee after a workout.\n\n\u201cMy knee doesn\u2019t get swollen anymore,\u201d said Vonn, the Olympic downhill champion and a four-time World Cup overall winner. \u201cNothing really bothers it. I can play tennis, I can do whatever I want. I can do plyos (jump drills) and agilities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not injured anymore.\u201d\n\nVonn said she is as strong as before, if not stronger. She is visibly leaner after tweaking her diet.\n\n\u201cI think my strength is awesome,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excess weight. I have the muscle mass I need, and the weight I need to be able to ski downhill fast, but there\u2019s no excess. That\u2019s going to be good for my knee.\u201d\n\nVonn said she expects to begin her season with World Cup races at Beaver Creek, Nov. 29-Dec. 1, on the new course built for women\u2019s races for the 2015 world championships. The U.S. Ski Team is thrilled Vonn is ahead of schedule in her comeback.\n\n\u201cIt all goes back to passion, to loving what she\u2019s doing,\u201d said chief executive Bill Marolt. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t take any shortcuts. She had a serious knee injury, and nobody really knew what the timeline was going to be. But because she\u2019s in such great shape, she was able to overcome this injury.\u201d\n\nShe worked hard and also accompanied Tiger Woods to \u201csix or seven\u201d golf tournaments, including the majors. She expects Woods to be at some of her races when his schedule allows. Woods had ACL surgery on his left knee in 2008.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s helped me stay patient through the recovery process,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt was different, coming from him, because he\u2019s been through it and he\u2019s an athlete. And giving me the confidence that it\u2019s going to be better than before.\n\n\u201cJust being able to talk to him about it, having him through the rehab process was really critical for me.\u201d\n\nVonn has 59 World Cup victories, second on the all-time women\u2019s list and only three behind Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria.\n\nShe\u2019s already nervous about those three races at Beaver Creek. She won a super-G in 2011, the only time the women have raced there, after a race intended for Val d\u2019Isere, France, could not be held for lack of snow. It was her first World Cup win in the United States.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be more intense than the Olympics,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be my first race back. Friends and family are going to be here, just like they were (in 2011). At least now, I\u2019ve won on home soil, so there\u2019s no pressure there, but it\u2019s going to be a big deal to come back from this injury and be skiing on the world championships hill.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s going to be awesome to be back. It\u2019s going to be fun to have my first race back at home.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn healed, thrilled to ski at training camp in Chile", "title": "Lindsey Vonn healed, thrilled to ski at training camp in Chile", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/08/31/lindsey-vonn-healed-thrilled-to-ski-at-training-camp-in-chile/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130828_112235_SkiingVonn082813-2.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130828_112235_SkiingVonn082813-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-08-31T18:17:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-30T04:32:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca02\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy knee doesn\u2019t get swollen anymore,\u201d said Vonn, the Olympic downhill champion and a four-time World Cup overall winner.\nIt was her first World Cup win in the United States.\nBut when Lindsey Vonn does it Sunday in Portillo, Chile, it figures to be a very special moment.\nSki Team is thrilled Vonn is ahead of schedule in her comeback.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited,\u201d Vonn said."}
