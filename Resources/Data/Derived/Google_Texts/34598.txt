No, Matt Drudge, Hillary Clinton has her hands on a patio chair for the People cover story. She is not using a walker.

I imagine that the same conservatives who can’t tell the difference between a market based health care system in the Affordable Care Act and “socialized medicine” also wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between a patio chair and a walker.

Beyond the fake controversy over Clinton’s health being raised by people such as Matt Drudge and Karl Rove, the article does not clarify whether she is running for president, but does reveal that she binged on the first season of House of Cards.

Clinton also stated that the problems she had after her concussion have all dissipated.
