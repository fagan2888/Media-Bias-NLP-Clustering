John McCain after he was quizzed by a well-known veteran and father of a slain prisoner of war.\n\nDuring a campaign event near Cincinnati Saturday, Keith Maupin, whose son was killed in Iraq after being taken prisoner, asked Trump to clarify comments he made in July about McCain, a former Vietnam War prisoner of war and the GOP\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee.\n\n\u201cYou made a comment to John McCain that you don\u2019t think that captured soldiers are heroes,\u201d Maupin, a Marine Corps veteran, told Trump during the event at a suburban Cincinnati convention center. Maupin\u2019s son Matt, a U.S. Army sergeant, went missing from his unit in Iraq in 2004. His remains were recovered in 2008. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like you to do is just clarify that, because I think it\u2019s important for all these people here, and for a lot of veterans in Ohio.\u201d\n\nThe question came as Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, vied with Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the GOP primary in Ohio, the most competitive of the winner-take-all-states in Tuesday\u2019s voting.\n\nTrump had said of McCain in July, while campaigning in Iowa, \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured.
