Thanks to a bill passed by the Alabama Legislature this year, Alabama\u2019s presidential primary date has been moved up to March 1, 2015, to coincide with the primaries of Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and possibly North Carolina. This \u201cSEC Primary\u201d means the most conservative area of the country will finally play a pivotal role in choosing the Republican nominee to take on Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nWe in Alabama know that our country is at a crossroads. America cannot afford four or eight more years of the liberal Obama-Clinton \u201ceconomic policies,\u201d foreign policy, or burdensome regulations that choke job growth.\n\nI believe that conservatives bear the responsibility for offering a new path. The leadership America needs will not come from a Democrat Party that has veered hard left. But make no mistake: conservatives will only win if we nominate a strong leader who will fight unapologetically for conservative principles and offer a positive vision of how to reform America, grow our economy, and make us safe again.\n\nI believe Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is the conservative leader our country needs at this crucial moment in history. He might not have the most interesting hair or the loudest rhetoric. He isn\u2019t flashy and doesn\u2019t change his message just to make the evening new.\n\nIn fact, Scott Walker is probably more like the average Alabamian than any other candidate in the race. He grew up as a preacher\u2019s kid in a small Wisconsin town of 8,000 people. He played sports, marched in the band, attended church every time the doors were open, and was even an Eagle Scout.\n\nScott Walker has served at every level of government from city council to governor. He cut taxes, reduced the size of government, and turned a massive deficit into a huge surplus. Sounds like what we need in Washington right now, right?\n\nUnder Walker\u2019s leadership, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate went from 8.1% to 4.6%, well below the national average. And one of the most important issues to me and my area of the state, he vows as president to roll back the EPA\u2019s burdensome regulations that are harming businesses across America. Every state has an environmental agency, and that\u2019s where he wants to put the regulatory authority instead. That would be a huge plus for Alabama!\n\nGovernor Walker is strongly opposed to Obamacare. But unlike most other Republican candidates, he has actually put forward a detailed health care plan to replace Obamacare on day one of his administration. The editors at the conservative National Review called Walker\u2019s health care plan the best-to-date from the Republican field.\n\nHe is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, and in his first year in office, he signed legislation permitting concealed carry in Wisconsin, along with repealing the 48-hour wait period. He defunded Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin years before those horrendous videos surfaced, and he signed legislation banning abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nOn foreign policy, Governor Walker will rebuild our military, stand beside our allies like Israel, and work with our Middle Eastern partners to defeat ISIS, not just run a few bombing missions per day.\n\nI personally believe faith in God is essential to strong leadership in the White House. Scott Walker is a devout Christian, the son of a Baptist pastor, and isn\u2019t afraid to stand for religious liberty and pro-life values when the elites in D.C. would rather people of faith stayed silent.\n\nBut not only is he a conservative fighter, Scott Walker can win. In Wisconsin, where President Obama beat Mitt Romney 53%-46%, Governor Walker has won three statewide elections over the past four years, including a bitterly contested recall election in which liberal interest groups spent tens of millions of dollars trying to unseat him.\n\nConservatives doesn\u2019t need a showman for our Republican nominee, and against Hillary Clinton conservatives can\u2019t settle for someone with no experience governing. After seven years of President Obama, our country also can\u2019t afford to elect another untested senator with no executive leadership experience.\n\nI believe Scott Walker is the proven leader we need in the White House. He has dealt with difficult circumstances, governed under tough times, and won every battle. Let\u2019s nominate a conservative leader who has proven he can fight and win \u2013 for Alabama and for America.\n\nJoin me in supporting Scott Walker for President!\n\nPrint\n\nSenate Majority Leader Greg Reed (R-Jasper) is chairman of Scott Walker\u2019s Alabama campaign efforts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alabama Senate Majority leader Greg Reed is chairman of Scott Walker's Alabama campaign efforts, and shares why he chose the Governor to support.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "Like you, I am excited about the prominent role Alabama now has in the 2016 presidential race.
