Despite being treated with chemotherapy and other remedies, doctors said he had only three months to live at most.\n\n\u201cThere was a point where I had to realize it was out of my hands. I was a totally broken man,\u201d Fazzina said.\n\nWhen the three-month scan came back in December, it showed no trace of cancer, making it the best Christmas present ever, according to Fazzina.\n\nDoctors weren\u2019t sure what to think. Some expressed happiness, some said miracles don\u2019t happen. But one doctor noted that not only did the tumor disappear, it didn\u2019t leave any scar tissue behind.\n\nFazzina recalled what he told God when he first received his diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Lord, if you want to heal me, I will do my best to continue to serve you and to share with the world your goodness, your grace, your love and your power.'\u201d\n\nReserve your copy of \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d now!\n\nEncouraged by friends and coworkers with whom he shared his and other peoples\u2019 stories of healing, Fazzina wrote \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d and started his radio show, which is syndicated nationally.\n\nSid Roth, host of \u201cIt\u2019s Supernatural,\u201d praises the book, writing, \u201cYour faith will be challenged and stimulated as you read these amazing true stories.\u201d\n\nFazzina understands that people are skeptical of claims of healing but encourages doubters to keep an open mind.\n\n\u201cThere might be more to this world, to this life, than what they perceive with their five senses.\u201d\n\nPerhaps with skeptics in mind, Fazzina\u2019s book, \u201cDivine Intervention,\u201d also includes medical documentation, X-rays, scans, doctors reports and contact information for the people in the book.\n\nFazzina believes that the connection to God that comes from prayer is powerful and that He is waiting to heal and comfort.\n\n\u201cSometimes we need to take a step of faith. If God puts someone near you who is sick or needs help, pray for them,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile seeing or witnessing a miracle can be exhilarating, Fazzina believes it is all for nothing if people don\u2019t then embrace the Healer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to encourage believers and challenge skeptics, and I really hope and pray that God will use this book to bless so many people and encourage them, and draw them into a relationship with his Son.\u201d\n\n\u201cDivine Intervention,\u201d is the culmination of Fazzina\u2019s encounters with people from all over the world who have shared miraculous stories that defy explanation.\n\nThe stories include:\n\nMedically documented divine healing\n\nDeliverance from alcoholism and addiction\n\nFreedom and salvation in Jesus Christ for a Muslim terrorist, and much more!\n\nPat Robertson, chairman of the board of Christian Broadcasting Network called it a \u201cfascinating, inspiring book that brings together modern-day miracle stories from all over the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI highly recommend \u2018Divine Intervention.'\u201d\n\nLauren Green, chief religion correspondent with the Fox News Channel, said: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious from Daniel Fazzina\u2019s \u2018Divine Intervention\u2019 accounts that God speaks every day to a modern world. We need only listen.\u201d\n\nTed Baehr, president of the Christian Film & Television Commission, writes: \u201cThis book will encourage you, inspire you, and set your heart on fire for Jesus Christ and His divine intervention. It is a joy to read. I highly recommend it.\u201d\n\nAn interview with Fazzina:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Daniel Fazzina\u2019s personal testimony is of miraculous healings, both from a painful chronic back condition in 2001 and from a massive cancerous tumor in 2002.
