Yankton, SD

A newlywed South Dakota couple who flew off to Rome for their honeymoon had their nuptials blessed by Pope Francis.



Kraig Kronaizl said it was a wonderful experience and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.



The Sioux Falls attorney married the former Morgan Peck on Aug. 7 at St. Joseph's Cathedral in Sioux Falls. The Kronaizls learned that the Pope generally holds a Wednesday audience when he is at the Vatican and that he blesses newlyweds at the conclusion of his sermon.



They joined a few dozen couples in line as Pope Francis moved from couple to couple to offer a personal blessing. The official Vatican photographer even snapped a picture of the meeting and gave a copy to the Kronaizls.
