Especially as insurers continue shifting more financial responsibility to consumers through high-deductible plans and other cost-sharing measures, Johnson thinks consumers will want even more \"information and transparency into cost and quality and be able to create their own value equations.\"\n\nExchanges, whether public or private, can be a good venue to offer the retail experience in the healthcare industry. \"From our vantage point, we really see exchanges as the latest evolution of healthcare consumerism and providing consumers with a somewhat familiar retail experience--although that still needs to be developed--and with more choice and transparency so they can make more informed decisions,\" Johnson added.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Employee Benefits News article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nBrokers see increased shift of employees to private exchanges\n\nReport: Exchanges will transform the health insurance business\n\nGood news for payers in a consumer-focused industry\n\n4 retail strategies for payer success in the consumer-driven marketplace", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's been a lot of talk since the Affordable Care Act was passed that the health insurance industry must focus on and engage more with its consumers the way other industries do, particularly in retail and travel.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "There's been a lot of talk since the Affordable Care Act was passed that the health insurance industry must focus on and engage more with its consumers the way other industries do, particularly in retail and travel.", "title": "Other industries influence what consumers want from healthcare", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/other-industries-influence-what-consumers-want-healthcare/2014-12-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Consumer-centric,health insurance exchange,Health Insurance Exchanges,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,Private Exchange,Retail Industry", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance Exchanges,Marketing & Consumer Engagement"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcbc\"", "article_summary": "She adds that private health insurance exchanges are in a good position to drive the industry's transition to being more consumer-centric.\nExchanges, whether public or private, can be a good venue to offer the retail experience in the healthcare industry.\n\"They're not going to check their consumer hat when they walk into the health experience.\"\nThere's been a lot of talk since the Affordable Care Act was passed that the health insurance industry must focus on and engage more with its consumers the way other industries do, particularly in retail and travel.\nThat translates to consumers who want more information about what they're actually paying for in their health plans."}
