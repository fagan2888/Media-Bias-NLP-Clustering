It is finally cookie season, and the Girl Scouts learned Saturday some good techniques to sell these delicious treats.

This year's special event is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Samoa cookie. The Girl Scouts learned different selling strategies, how to decorate their booths, and played games like cookie twister. The girls are ready to get out and start selling cookies.

"Just have fun. It doesn't matter what you do as long as you have fun and sell as many cookies as you can. I have a goal to sell about 300 boxes," explains Abby, a local Girl Scout.

Most of the money the Girl Scouts sell go right back to the community.

You can expect to see the Girl Scout's booths open for business next month.
