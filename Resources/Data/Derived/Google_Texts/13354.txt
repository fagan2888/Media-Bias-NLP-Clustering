ESPN has suspended Keith Olbermann for the rest of the week after he went on a Twitter rant against Penn State students.

On Monday, a Penn State alum tweeted to Mr. Olbermann the phrase “We Are!” and a link to an article about students raising more than $13 million to fight pediatric cancer.

The TV host replied “…Pitiful,” which received 35 retweets.

He then went on a long rant against his Twitter critics, calling Penn State students “morons,” “goobers” and saying their degrees are worthless.

“No, Son,” Mr. Olbermann said to one critic. “I said PSU students were pitiful. Had nothing to do with fundraising #AlsoPSUReadingComprehensionAppearsToBeWeak.”

“At this rate your diploma won’t be recognized, Moron,” he said in a tweet to @dave_seidel.

“Don’t make [expletive] up, Sonny. You’ll wind up running Penn State,” he said in a tweet to @EricOwensFS.

“I’d like to thank the students and alums of Penn State for proving my point about the mediocrity of their education and ethics,” Mr. Olbermann said in a general tweet to his 537,000 followers.

On Tuesday, ESPN said in a statement that “it was completely inappropriate and does not reflect the views of ESPN. We have discussed it with Keith, who recognizes he was wrong. ESPN and Keith have agreed that he will not host his show for the remainder of this week and will return on Monday. The annual tradition of THON and the efforts of the students of Penn State to fight pediatric cancer should be applauded.”

Mr. Olbermann also apologized on Twitter, saying, “I was stupid and childish and way less mature than the students there who did such a great fundraising job.”

All of Mr. Olbermann’s insulting tweets remained on his page as of Tuesday afternoon.
