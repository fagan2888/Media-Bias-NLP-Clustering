For its analysis, it examined plans available in the most populous cities in 45 states, coming to conclusions that starkly contrast Avalere's. Gold plan rates, it said, could rise 16 percent, followed by silver plans at 14 percent, bronze plans at 9 percent. Platinum plan rates are expected to drop 8 percent.\n\nDespite the high projected increases, \"premium rates for 2016 Obamacare plans may change between now and November due to the rate review process and increased competition from other insurers,\" the report cautions. This has been the case in past years, but 2016 also is unique because insurers now have data from the previous year to back up their rate proposals to state insurance regulators, FireceHealthPayer has reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the Avalere analysis\n\n- here's the HealthPocket report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhy 2016 is the year for steep premium increases\n\n3 reasons insurers will likely request higher rates in 2016\n\nRisk pool, drug prices to shape insurers' 2016 rates\n\nHow King v.
