Moviegoers in Connecticut who want to watch "The Interview" have a choice of two theaters screening the film at the center of an international storm involving Hollywood, Washington, D.C., and North Korea.

The film's Facebook page and the websites of Hartford's Spotlight Theatres and Apple Cinemas in Waterbury announce the showing of the film Thursday.

"Happy to share that 'The Interview' opens," the Waterbury theater said on its website. Nearly 300 theaters nationwide are listed for Christmas Day showings.

The movie satirizing the isolated communist-run nation prompted a cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. North Korea's Internet was shut down in an apparent attack Monday.

Sony canceled the Christmas Day release, but reversed course. Seth Rogen and James Franco, the film's co-stars, hailed Sony's decision to show the film, calling it a victory for freedom.
