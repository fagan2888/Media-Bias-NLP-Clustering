Dick Durbin, D-Ill, Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Rand Paul, R-Ky., and John McCain, R-Ariz., are all schedule to make appearances\n\nThe Senate has taken center stage in the shutdown and debt ceiling fights since negotiations stalled between House Republicans and the White House this weekend.\n\nThough there\u2019s still no sign of an imminent deal, both parties are still talking \u2013 progress considering the stalemate that held well into ten days of a government shutdown.\n\nThe fight that began over Obamacare has now turned to spending, with Republicans in the Senate pushing to maintain levels enacted last year in across the board cuts, known as sequester.\n\nBut Senate Democrats rejected a proposal from Maine Republican Susan Collins Saturday afternoon that they said kept spending levels far too low. Collins\u2019 proposal would have raised the debt ceiling until January 2014 and would have funded the government at sequester levels for six months.\n\nSenate Democrats such as Dick Durbin, who is scheduled to appear on Meet the Press, also argued that a longer debt ceiling extension is needed to avoid hurting the economy as Americans enter into the holiday shopping season.\n\nDemocrats then met with President Obama at the White House to discuss next steps. Before heading to that meeting, Schumer made it clear that after more than two weeks of disorder in the House, it\u2019s time for someone else to step in.\n\n\u201cMy view is that it will be the senate that will have to come to an agreement here,\u201d Schumer said, \u201cbecause the house republicans seem so divided and in such disarray, they don\u2019t have a plan.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Saturday afternoon, the senators struck very different tones. While McConnell described talks between himself, Reid, Lamar Alexander and Chuck Schumer as \u201ca good meeting,\u201d Reid was more pessimistic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing my best, I\u2019m not confident in anything the way Republicans have acted,\u201d Reid said.\n\nAt a conference meeting early Saturday morning, Speaker of the House John Boehner pushed responsibility for reaching some sort of compromise to the Senate and told his fellow representatives to stay united while talks continue.\n\nAfter a contentious meeting at the White House Friday night, Ted Cruz was absent from discussions today, but Sen. Lindsey Graham subbed for Cruz as the GOP\u2019s angry firebrand. Graham called Obama \u201ca pathetic leader\u201d because of his refusal to acquiesce to Republican demands over the both the continuing budget resolution and the debt ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s dysfunction at every level,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "With only four days to avoid a U.S. default, Senate leaders must make another round of arguments to the American public.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/standoff-shifts-the-senate", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "With only four days to avoid a U.S. default, Senate leaders must make another round of arguments to the American public.", "title": "Standoff shifts to the Senate", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/standoff-shifts-the-senate", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/h_51039097.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/standoff-shifts-the-senate", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/h_51039097.jpg?itok=8iPmaV_o", "title": "Standoff shifts to the Senate", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "With only four days to avoid a U.S. default, Senate leaders must make another round of arguments to the American public."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-13T09:16:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "meredith-clark", "tags": "debt-ceiling,democrats,government-shutdowns,republicans,melissa-harris-perry", "contentId": "http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/10/13/standoff-shifts-to-the-senate/", "title": "Standoff shifts to the Senate", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/standoff-shifts-the-senate", "date": "10/13/2013 09:16:00 EDT", "published": 1}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "With only four days to avoid a U.S. default, Senate leaders must make another round of arguments to the American public.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Republicans, Debt Ceiling, Government Shutdowns"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca387\"", "article_summary": "With only four days left to raise the debt ceiling, key Senate negotiators are taking to the Sunday morning talk shows to make their pitch for what a deal should look like.\nWhile McConnell described talks between himself, Reid, Lamar Alexander and Chuck Schumer as \u201ca good meeting,\u201d Reid was more pessimistic.\nGraham called Obama \u201ca pathetic leader\u201d because of his refusal to acquiesce to Republican demands over the both the continuing budget resolution and the debt ceiling.\nDemocrats then met with President Obama at the White House to discuss next steps.\nBut Senate Democrats rejected a proposal from Maine Republican Susan Collins Saturday afternoon that they said kept spending levels far too low."}
