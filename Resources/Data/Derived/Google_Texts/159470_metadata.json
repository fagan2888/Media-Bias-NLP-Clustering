And I\u2019m going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: climate change,\u201d he says in the video below.\n\n\u201cYou see, climate change once seemed like a problem for future generations,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut for most Americans, it\u2019s already a reality: deeper droughts, longer wildfire seasons; some of our cities even flood at high tide.\u201d\n\nIn Alaska the effects are quite graphic.\n\n\u201cGlaciers are melting. The hunting and fishing upon which generations have depended for their way of life and for their jobs are being threatened. Storm surges once held at bay now endanger entire villages,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Obama administration has been working to draw awareness to climate change via several initiatives, ranging from the National Climate Assessment issued in 2014, to a series of executive orders mandating measures to combat its effects.\n\nRELATED: Obama Taps Tribes to Assist in Adapting to Climate Change\n\nObama\u2019s Climate Change Report Lays Out Dire Scenario, Highlights Effects on Natives\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Alaska isn\u2019t just a preview of what will happen to the rest of us if we don\u2019t take action,\u201d Obama says in the video, inviting the nation to sign up to receive dispatches from his trip. \u201cIt\u2019s our wakeup call.
