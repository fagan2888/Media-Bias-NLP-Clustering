Punter Drew Meyer completed a pass for a first down, and third-string quarterback Bart Houston unleashed a rugby-style kick that covered 52 yards.\n\nAnd that's exactly how special teams coordinator Jeff Genyk drew it up.\n\nFacing Maryland's William Likely, who is averaging a conference-leading 17.9 yards per return, the punt game was a big emphasis during Wisconsin's bye week. The answer was keeping him off-balance and adding a couple tricks.\n\n\"We focused heavy on special teams,\" coach Gary Andersen said. \"The kids executed, worked hard in practice at it, the coaches coached it hard, and we wanted to make sure that we felt like, again, we were edgy in the special teams area.\"\n\nMeyer's pass came on a fourth and 9 from the Maryland 36-yard line in the first quarter with the Badgers leading, 7-0. Maryland, looking for a possible fake, lined up in its punt safe formation, which UW saw on film and thought it could exploit.\n\nKnowing how the Terrapins would line up, the call for the fake was on. Meyer took the snap and immediately ran forward, drawing Maryland's linebackers in to try to stop him. The Badgers' punter then jumped and popped a pass to tight end Troy Fumagalli for a 17-yard gain and a first down.\n\n\"We were just trying to be aggressive, and it worked out great,\" Meyer said. \"The guys did a great job. I think even a couple of them started yelling that we might be kicking it to get those guys (linebackers) to come up. Troy did good shedding the block and got open.\"\n\nThe completion extended the Badgers' drive and led to a 36-yard field goal from Rafael Gaglianone. Meyer said the play was added during the bye week and practiced every day. He also got some extra reps on it with Fumagalli and long snapper James McGuire after practices.\n\n\"We were really wanting to be a little more aggressive as a unit and really start winning games with the punt game and with special teams,\" Meyer said.\n\nThe fake wasn't the only thing Meyer worked on over the bye week. He has had more success with his Aussie-style punting this season and the game plan was for him to use it exclusively Saturday.\n\nUsing the Aussie-style kick allows Meyer to get more air under the ball and have better control of where it lands, but it limits the distance that it travels. Sacrificing distance might not sound ideal, but good hang time and better control meant that the coverage team could get to the returner quicker.\n\nThe result was two fair catches, one touchback and a return of zero yards. Meyer's punts averaged only 33 yards, but all of them pinned Maryland inside their 20.\n\nWisconsin's longest punt of the day came from Houston, who lined up deep in Badgers territory late in the second quarter. Houston, who says he punted about 13 times his senior year in high school, let out a low, rugby-style kick that went about 28 yards in the air, then skittered 24 more yards.\n\nNot bad for a guy who says he learned what a rugby punt was the Thursday before the bye.\n\n\"The distance was good, I just have to get it higher,\" Houston said. \"One of these days if I do that again, it could hit Sam Arneson in the back. That's not good. That'd be going backwards from what I want. But I found the seam, and man, that sucker rolled.\"\n\nLike the fake punt, the idea for Houston's punting debut came during the bye week. It was a surprise to Houston, but he took it in stride and started messing around with rugby punts after practice.\n\n\"I'm with the offense, I'm signaling plays, learning the offensive scheme, and then Coach Genyk just goes, 'OK, these are the plays you need to know. Know 'em,'\" Houston said.\n\nThe biggest threat with Houston lined up in punt formation obviously is that he might throw. Will we see that? Houston says it's not his decision, but he's ready.\n\n\"Everybody's been saying I've got the strongest arm on the team and all that,\" he said. \"That's been said now for years. I'll throw it out there (in punt formation). I'm accurate.\"\n\nMaybe Meyer can give him some tips on executing the fake punt pass to perfection.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Successful Badgers punt game includes role reversal", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/badgers/successful-badgers-punt-game-includes-role-reversal-b99377255z1-280433822.html", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99377255z.1_20141025211329_000_gpb8dvss.1-1.jpg", "height": 869}, "type": "article", "description": "A punter threw a pass right on the money and a quarterback punted during Wisconsin\u2019s 52-7 win over Maryland on Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium.
