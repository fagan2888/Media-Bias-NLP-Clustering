Barbara McGuire, D-Kearny, doesn\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t wear seat belts.\n\n\u201cWe have them buckle up in our cars. It doesn\u2019t make sense not to have them buckle up elsewhere,\u201d she said.\n\nSo when a 2009 bill to require seat belts on school buses met opposition from Republican leaders and foundered, she decided to drive a school bus for the Ray Unified School District.\n\n\u201cIn order to defuse their objection, I wanted to learn it from the ground up so that I would have firsthand knowledge,\u201d she said.\n\nThat experience informed SB 1115, McGuire\u2019s bill to require lap belts on all new school buses. Buses currently in school districts\u2019 fleets wouldn\u2019t be affected.\n\n\u201cWe demand safety in all other aspects of our life \u2013 safety in working conditions, safety on our roads, with our own vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we demand the same safety when it comes to the well-being of our children.\u201d\n\nOut of office in 2011, McGuire got her commercial driver\u2019s license and drove a route through rural communities like Mammoth, sometimes covering 100 miles round trip.\n\nStudents of all ages rode her bus, from kindergartners to high school seniors. She said it became clear that lap belts would prevent them from slamming into the frame of the seat in front of them during a sudden stop.\n\n\u201cIf they catch the frame, they\u2019re going to break a shoulder bone, a collarbone, they\u2019re going to knock teeth out, and they end up getting injured,\u201d McGuire said.\n\nSeats in school buses are padded and close together, a safety technique called compartmentalization that, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, provides a safe enough environment on the bus without seat belts.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that seat belts play an important role in keeping occupants safe in these vehicles, however school buses are different by design and use a different kind of safety restraint system that works extremely well,\u201d a NHTSA report reads.\n\nSeat belts aren\u2019t required for buses heavier than 10,000 pounds, leaving school districts to decide whether they should be installed.\n\nThe Phoenix Union High School District has had lap belts in its buses for more than a decade, said Bryan Henderson, the district\u2019s transportation manager.\n\n\u201cThere is no drawback to wearing a seat belt. Whereas, there may be a drawback to not wearing a seat belt,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Ron Latko, transportation director for Mesa Public Schools, said it would cost too much to install what he calls unnecessary seat belts on school buses.\n\n\u201cThere are millions and millions of miles traveled every day with students in school buses,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s far safer than transporting them in your own personal car, seat belts or no seat belts.\u201d\n\nBob Riley, executive director of the National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation Systems, said lap-shoulder seat belts can add an extra element of safety during rollover accidents or side-on collisions, he said.\n\n\u201cKids don\u2019t always sit with their hands on their laps facing forward completely in the seat,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThey hang out of the seat, they stand up, they kneel, they do all kinds of things while they\u2019re riding along and then if there\u2019s an accident they get none of the protection from the compartmentalization.\u201d\n\nMcGuire said that while she never had any major discipline issues with the students on her bus seat belts would encourage proper passenger behavior.\n\n\u201cIt allows the driver to stay more focused on the road and the task at hand, which also contributes to the safety of the students on the bus,\u201d she said.\n\nHer bill was assigned to the Senate Education Committee but has yet to be scheduled for a hearing. A similar bill she introduced last year wasn\u2019t heard in committee.\n\nMcGuire said might return to driving the bus when her service in the Legislature ends.\n\n\u201cIt renewed my faith in young people today and their respect and their determination to become good adults,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When children ride school buses, Sen.
