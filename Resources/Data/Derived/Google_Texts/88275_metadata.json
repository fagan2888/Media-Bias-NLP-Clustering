(AP) \u2014 A California woman died after a car driven by her mother ran over her while they were fighting, police said Saturday.\n\nKimberly Wilson, 55, and her daughter, 34-year-old Brandy Wilson, were in a Jeep Cherokee in a Santa Maria parking lot Friday when they got into a fight that turned physical, said Sgt. Mark Streker, a police traffic supervisor.\n\nBrandy Wilson began assaulting her mother before Kimberly Wilson rapidly backed up the Jeep, which threw her daughter from the passenger's seat, police said.\n\nThe car then ran over Brandy Wilson, who was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nInvestigators believe Kimberly Wilson, who is homeless and lived in the car, did not intentionally run over her daughter. She was extremely distraught at the scene, Streker said.\n\nThere was evidence of drug use and results of drug and alcohol tests of the mother and daughter were pending, Streker said.\n\nWilson was released after being interviewed and the investigation is ongoing. Prosecutors will decide whether Wilson should face any charges.\n\nStreker said the mother and daughter have a history of getting into physical fights with each other.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California woman dies after being run over by her mom's car - AP News: SANTA MARIA, Calif.
