Reuters\n\nA team of transplant specialists at University Hospitals Leuven in Belgium recently performed a world\u2019s first: in executing a double transplant for a patient\u2019s new liver and lungs, the team was required to preserve the donor lungs outside the patient\u2019s body for a full 11 hours. The feat\u2019s timeline sailed past the standard shelf life of a donor lung, which is normally suggested not to remain outside the body for more than 10 hours.\n\nThe patient suffered from chronic lung failure, and was due to receive an ordinary lung transplant when suddenly the patient developed acute liver problems and fell into a coma. This made the standard procedure far more complex. Now doctors had to remove the faulty liver and replace it with a new one. In the meantime, however, the lungs had to be removed because a liver transplant requires a working set of lungs.\n\nAs the procedure normally takes between six and 12 hours, doctors had to use a bit of ingenuity to ensure the donor lungs remained healthy.\n\n\u201cTo keep the donor lungs in good shape long enough after removal from the donor and prior to transplantation,\" Dr. Dirk Van Raemdonck, who helped perform the surgery, told KU Leuven, \u201cour medical team used a new preservation technique.\u201d\n\nNormally, organs that are waiting in the wings get put on ice. Lungs typically last six hours with that treatment, according to the University of Michigan Transplant Center.\n\nThe new technique enlisted the help of OCS LUNG, a perfusion-based machine that supplies the quarantined lungs with a continual, refreshing supply of oxygen. Perfusion refers to the process of blood replenishing a capillary. It\u2019s what an EMT looks for when she checks a person\u2019s vital signs by pinching his or her skin and seeing how long it takes to go from white to pink.\n\n\"The machine enabled us to keep the lungs outside the body for more than eleven hours with no negative effects,\u201d said Van Raemdonck. The incubation constituted \u201cthe longest period ever reported \u2014 a world first.\"\n\nIn addition to preserving the organ, the machine can produce an analysis of lung quality and work overtime in preparation for an impending transplant. It has the capacity to keep the lung (and heart, if the surgery calls for it) at a near physiologic state \u2014 meaning it functions as if it had already been successfully transplanted.\n\nWhile the machine is now commercially available in Europe and Australia, clinical trials in the U.S. are expected to start soon. According to KU Leuven, the technique isn\u2019t being reimbursed by insurance providers and is only being used in special cases. Funding for OCS LUNG was provided entirely by University Hospitals Leuven and the machine\u2019s manufacturers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lung preserved outside body, world first, medical history, double transplant, lung transplant, liver transplant", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A first in medical history, Belgian doctors keep a pair of donor lungs preserved for 11 hours outside the patient's body.", "title": "A World First: Doctors Preserve Lung Outside Body For 11 Hours During Double Transplant", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lung-preserved-outside-body-11-hours-double-transplant-liver-first-medical-history-259927", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/http-content.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A first in medical history, Belgian doctors keep a pair of donor lungs preserved for 11 hours outside the patient's body.", "title": "A World First: Doctors Preserve Lung Outside Body For 11 Hours During Double Transplant", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lung-preserved-outside-body-11-hours-double-transplant-liver-first-medical-history-259927", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/http-content.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/15/http-content.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-10-15T13:15:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-15T13:15:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A first in medical history, Belgian doctors keep a pair of donor lungs preserved for 11 hours outside the patient's body."}, "article_summary": "A first in medical history, Belgian doctors keep a pair of donor lungs preserved for 11 hours outside the patient's body.\nIn the meantime, however, the lungs had to be removed because a liver transplant requires a working set of lungs.\nThe patient suffered from chronic lung failure, and was due to receive an ordinary lung transplant when suddenly the patient developed acute liver problems and fell into a coma.\nThe feat\u2019s timeline sailed past the standard shelf life of a donor lung, which is normally suggested not to remain outside the body for more than 10 hours.\n\"The machine enabled us to keep the lungs outside the body for more than eleven hours with no negative effects,\u201d said Van Raemdonck."}
