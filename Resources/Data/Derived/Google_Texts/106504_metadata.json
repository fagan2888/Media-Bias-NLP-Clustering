Kennedy urged a new generation of young people to \u201cask not\u201d what their country could do for them but what they could do for their country.\n\nBetween 1961 and 2015, nearly 220,000 Americans answered the call by joining the Peace Corps and serving in 140 countries. And despite a mixed record of successes and controversies over the decades, the Peace Corps remains a highly regarded international program. Last week, Congress approved a new $410 million operating budget for the Peace Corps as part of the $1.1 trillion fiscal 2016 omnibus spending bill \u2013 the largest in the program\u2019s 54-year history.\n\nRelated: Federal Watchdogs Bite Back at Agencies That Ignore Them\n\nBut as The Washington Post reported last week, many Peace Corps veterans are greatly disillusioned by what they view as the extraordinary indifference of officials to serious medical problems and injuries they sustained while overseas \u2013 in some cases decades ago. And now they are asking what their country can do for them.\n\nAn estimated 10 percent to 30 percent of Peace Corps volunteers develop health problems \u2013 both physical and mental \u2013 during and after their service in foreign countries, according to some Peace Corps watchdog and advocacy groups. When they return home after their service, volunteers are required to file a worker\u2019s compensation claim with the Labor Department, but often they encounter cumbersome red tape and struggle to provide proof of their disabilities.\n\nWilliam Harless, who served in a remote area of Thailand in 2009, told The Post that he contracted a food-borne infection that caused nerve damage to his hip and left leg and digestive system, yet received inadequate medical attention in Thailand and after he returned to the U.S. He said his workers compensation claim for medical care was approved by the Peace Corps, but it didn\u2019t cover the specialists he needed to see.\n\nRelated: Everybody Wins Something in the $1.1 Trillion Omnibus Spending Bill\n\n\u201cWe thought we were doing a good thing for our country when the Peace Corps recruited us,\u201d said Harless, who now resides in San Francisco. \u201cOur country keeps sending 7,000 volunteers abroad annually with full awareness that the protection for their health care is inadequate or non-existent.\u201d\n\nBut the message apparently is finally getting through to the Peace Corps brass.\n\nA recent report by a task force of top officials established in March to investigate the complaints acknowledges the agency\u2019s gross failures in providing quality health care services to thousands of returning volunteers, and vowed to make improvements. The report, posted on the Peace Corps\u2019 website, said that a wide variety of veteran volunteers \u201cshared their experiences not only about the health issues that impact the quality of their lives but the feeling of abandonment after giving months and years of service to their country.\u201d\n\nThe task force found an extraordinarily high level of frustration and anger, noting that many have \u201ctried to get their health service issues resolved for decades and believe there is a lack of understanding from the Peace Corps and the Peace Corps Community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When he created the Peace Corps in 1961 to provide technical assistance to other count", "title": "The War Against the Peace Corps Could Finally Be Over", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/27/Growing-War-Against-Peace-Corps-Could-Finally-Be-Over", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR1LWSZ.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/27/Growing-War-Against-Peace-Corps-Could-Finally-Be-Over", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTR1LWSZ.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When he created the Peace Corps in 1961 to provide technical assistance to other count", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6b0\"", "article_summary": "Between 1961 and 2015, nearly 220,000 Americans answered the call by joining the Peace Corps and serving in 140 countries.\nAnd despite a mixed record of successes and controversies over the decades, the Peace Corps remains a highly regarded international program.\nAn estimated 10 percent to 30 percent of Peace Corps volunteers develop health problems \u2013 both physical and mental \u2013 during and after their service in foreign countries, according to some Peace Corps watchdog and advocacy groups.\nHe said his workers compensation claim for medical care was approved by the Peace Corps, but it didn\u2019t cover the specialists he needed to see.\nLast week, Congress approved a new $410 million operating budget for the Peace Corps as part of the $1.1 trillion fiscal 2016 omnibus spending bill \u2013 the largest in the program\u2019s 54-year history."}
