Blow (column, June 1), urging that high-profile cases be used \u201ceducationally to better protect other children\u201d:\n\nPrevention of child sexual abuse should be a major public health initiative. If it were a higher priority, identifying children at risk could be done in pediatrician\u2019s offices and emergency rooms. Risk factors include neglect and psychological mistreatment.\n\nMandatory reporting of child abuse is a legal obligation by health care professionals; other forms of violence that include children should be illegal but are not. Domestic violence, witnessed by children, is a common antecedent to other forms of abuse. However, it frequently goes unreported because the abused person (most often a woman) does not report the abuse. Another implication for child sexual abuse is sex trafficking. The average age of induction into sex trafficking in the United States is 13. Most commonly, the victims have a history of childhood sexual abuse.\n\nIt\u2019s time for compulsory parenting education at every birth and for increased training of health care professionals for identification and monitoring of those at risk \u2014 time, in other words, to begin protecting our children.\n\nVIVIAN B. PENDER\n\nNew York\n\nThe writer, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, was the course director of the webinar \u201cHuman Trafficking: Training Healthcare for Policy and Prevention\u201d at Weill Cornell Medical College.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI applaud Charles M. Blow for using two high-profile cases to highlight the alarming prevalence and circumstances surrounding childhood sexual abuse.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI also agree with him that it should not be \u201ca political issue.\u201d Sadly, however, it is: A majority of our states have been unable or unwilling to reform their statutes of limitation to provide most child sex abuse victims meaningful access to justice in the courts of law.\n\nReformation efforts in dozens of states have been repeatedly blocked by legislators influenced by predominantly religious special interest groups (Catholic and Latter-day Saints bishops and Jewish rabbis, among them) and occasionally secular groups (for example, some state American Civil Liberties Union affiliates have opposed reform for the criminal statutes of limitation). The four states most stuck in the political quagmire that disables victims\u2019 access to justice are Alabama, Michigan, Mississippi and New York. This is political pandering, plain and simple.\n\nWe need to stop playing politics with child sex abuse victims and eliminate the impediments to prosecution and civil lawsuits for this horrific crime.\n\nMARCI HAMILTON\n\nWashington\u2019s Crossing, Pa.\n\nThe writer is a professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150604032001, "twitter": {"description": "A psychiatrist and a law professor offer suggestions for tackling \u201cthis horrific crime.\u201d", "title": "Protecting Children From Sex Abuse", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/protecting-children-from-sex-abuse.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003717049"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/protecting-children-from-sex-abuse.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003717049", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/protecting-children-from-sex-abuse.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Protecting Children From Sex Abuse", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 4, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Sex Crimes,Child Abuse and Neglect,Domestic Violence", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A psychiatrist and a law professor offer suggestions for tackling \u201cthis horrific crime.\u201d", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A psychiatrist and a law professor offer suggestions for tackling \u201cthis horrific crime.\u201d", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 4, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-06-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Domestic Violence", "published": "2015-06-04", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "04Labuse", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150604032001, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/protecting-children-from-sex-abuse.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A psychiatrist and a law professor offer suggestions for tackling \u201cthis horrific crime.\u201d", "title": "Protecting Children From Sex Abuse"}, "pdate": 20150604, "des": "Domestic Violence", "articleid": 100000003717049, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Protecting Children From Sex Abuse", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "We need to stop playing politics with child sex abuse victims and eliminate the impediments to prosecution and civil lawsuits for this horrific crime.\nTo the Editor:Re \u201cSurviving Child Sexual Abuse,\u201d by Charles M.
