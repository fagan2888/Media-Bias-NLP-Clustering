Considered to be the World\u2019s Best Ski Hotel (WorldSkiAwards.com 2013), The Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch is the ideal locale for the discerning ski enthusiast looking for unparalleled access to skiing, combined with the amenities of a five-star hotel. Already in 2015, 18 close-out sales were achieved.\n\n\u201cThe rate at which the Ritz-Carlton Bachelor Gulch Residential Suites are selling is remarkable,\u201d said LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty broker, Kevin Kenney. \u201cI anticipate the final five remaining residences to be sold by the end of the first quarter- especially considering the snow-year we\u2019ve been having.\u201d\n\nLocated on Colorado\u2019s Beaver Creek mountain, The Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch 5-star ski resort touts that \u2018every day is a perfect day at the Ritz\u2019. Living up to that reputation, there are only a handful of turn-key residences available to make extending your stay indefinitely possible at what is considered the \u2018World\u2019s Best Ski Hotel\u2019.\n\nThe Residential Suites are being sold as full-ownership residences, enhanced by the legendary service and amenities that only The Ritz-Carlton can offer. One-and two-bedroom suites feature spectacular vistas of the surrounding mountains and come complete with custom interiors, designer fabrics and carpets, and hardwood flooring.\n\nKitchens feature granite countertops, custom designed cabinetry, and premium high end appliances. Perhaps one of the biggest benefits to ownership is the amenities offered to residents.\n\nWhen owners are in residence, all hotel amenities of a 5-star hotel are available to them, including complementary valet service. There are no limits on the number of days an owner can use their home, and residence owners may introduce their residence back into a rental program for added value for years to come.\n\nThe five remaining residences range from a studio / 1 bath at 883 sq. ft. for $699,900 (707), and four additional 2 bed / 2 bath residences (613, 728,704, 713), ranging from 1,318 square feet to 1,392 sq. ft., priced between $1,199,900 to $1,299,900.\n\nLocated only 2 hours from Denver and twenty minutes from Vail, Beaver Creek Resort is truly a skier\u2019s paradise, offering more than 1,800 acres of beginner, intermediate and advanced terrain.\n\nMcCoy Park Nordic Center offers more than 32 kilometers of Cross Country Skiing and Snowshoe adventures and additional winter adventure activities including dog sledding, snowmobiling, ice-skating, ice-fishing, sleigh rides, snow cat tours and horseback riding.\n\n\u201cProspective buyers are noticing that the window of opportunity is closing for them to be able to purchase new product in Bachelor Gulch at incredible value,\u201d said LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty managing broker, Dan Fitchett Jr. \u201cExcellent construction quality combined with the renowned service of The Ritz-Carlton truly make this a rare opportunity to own at the World\u2019s Best Ski Hotel.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit www.worldsbestskihotel.com, or contact LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty brokers, Kraig Forbes, at 970-845-0400 or Kevin Kenney, at 970-331-6037.
