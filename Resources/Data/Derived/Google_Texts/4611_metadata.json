[T]here can be no assurance that the ongoing discussions to resolve these matters will be successful,\u201d the company stated in the filing, adding, \"The terms of a final resolution may require us to pay significant fines and penalties and give rise to other costs or adverse consequences that materially exceed the reserve we have established.\u201d\n\nTenet\u2019s loss came despite stronger-than-expected revenues of $5.03 billion, up from $4.47 billion in the same period a year ago. The Dallas-based firm had projected revenues of $4.74 billion to $4.94 billion for the final quarter, according to the The Wall Street Journal.\n\nContributing to the loss was a rise in uninsured patients and unresolved debt at its hospitals, though hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act saw a drop in uninsured admissions.\n\nOverall, uncompensated care rose 10% to $1.42 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, compared with $1.27 billion a year ago.\n\nHowever, in the six Medicaid expansion states where Tenet operates \u2014 Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania, \u201csame-hospital uninsured plus charity admissions\u201d dropped by 187 admissions, or 11.1%, in the fourth quarter, the firm said. Meanwhile, the period saw a 1% rise in Medicaid admission, up by 287.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nModern Healthcare: Tenet offers $238 million to settle Georgia Kickback allegations\n\nThe Wall Street Journal: Tenet Swings to Loss Amid Charges\n\nBecker's Hospital Review: Tenet posts $140M net loss in 2015: 6 things to know\n\nForbes: Tenet Hospitals See Uninsured Fall in States That Expanded Medicaid", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "medium": "news", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-hospital-admin", "description": "Healthcare", "category": "News Post", "title": "Tenet near settlement on Georgia kickback charges, posts 2015 Q4 loss", "pub_date": "feb 24, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-24T22:42:37", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, February 24, 2016, 10:42 PM", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/e7/95/e795b5268389d7e23a21bc05670de4a7.jpg", "news_keywords": "Payer,Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-02-11T22:42:37", "teaser": "<p>While uncompensated care grew overall, Tenet&rsquo;s six Medicaid expansion states saw a drop in uninsured admissions.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-02-24", "sailthru.description": "While uncompensated care grew overall, Tenet\u2019s six Medicaid expansion states saw a drop in uninsured admissions.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "While uncompensated care grew overall, Tenet\u2019s six Medicaid expansion states saw a drop in uninsured admissions.", "title": "Tenet near settlement on Georgia kickback charges, posts 2015 Q4 loss", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/tenet-near-settlement-on-georgia-kickback-charges-posts-2015-q4-loss/414403/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/dollar_sign_silver.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/75/90/7590517ab67cd2efa6baaa66fc47955e.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingModern Healthcare: Tenet offers $238 million to settle Georgia Kickback allegationsThe Wall Street Journal: Tenet Swings to Loss Amid ChargesBecker's Hospital Review: Tenet posts $140M net loss in 2015: 6 things to knowForbes: Tenet Hospitals See Uninsured Fall in States That Expanded Medicaid\nThe news came as the for-profit hospital operator posted a $140 million net loss for the 2015 fourth quarter.\nDive Brief:Tenet Healthcare has offered to pay the government $238 million to settle kickback allegations involving four of its Georgia hospitals.\nOverall, uncompensated care rose 10% to $1.42 billion in the 2015 fourth quarter, compared with $1.27 billion a year ago.\nThe Dallas-based firm had projected revenues of $4.74 billion to $4.94 billion for the final quarter, according to the The Wall Street Journal."}
