Bush as in over his head. Mr. Bush faced intense criticism over the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and the Great Recession, and of course, he had long been attacked as not smart enough for America\u2019s top job.\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign to succeed Mr. Bush, the Democratic nominee, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, played on his own reputation as an intellectual to persuade Americans that he would restore competence to the Oval Office.\n\nHowever, confidence in President Obama\u2019s ability to do the job has steadily eroded since he was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009.\n\nHis reputation has been tarnished by problems with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya; the continuing economic struggles; and the fact that more was added to the national debt during Mr. Obama\u2019s first three years than during Mr. Bush\u2019s full eight, among other things.\n\nConsequently, the president has consistently received low approval ratings since his 2012 re-election. In fact, his second-term numbers have been eerily similar to the ones Mr. Bush had during Round 2.\n\nIt looks like things just got worse for Mr. Obama.\n\nRespondents to a June 1-3 Fox News poll \u2013 which actually was conducted by one Republican polling firm and a Democratic one \u2013 were asked whether Mr. Obama is more or less competent than several previous presidents. Interestingly, 48 said he is less competent than Mr. Bush. Forty-two percent said Mr. Obama is more competent, and 7 percent judged the two presidents\u2019 competence equally.\n\nConsidering the big fuss candidate Obama made about Mr. Bush\u2019s supposed incompetence, this must be the ultimate indignity for President Obama.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8df\"", "article_summary": "Considering the big fuss candidate Obama made about Mr. Bush\u2019s supposed incompetence, this must be the ultimate indignity for President Obama.\nHowever, confidence in President Obama\u2019s ability to do the job has steadily eroded since he was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2009.\nIt looks like things just got worse for Mr. Obama.\nIn fact, his second-term numbers have been eerily similar to the ones Mr. Bush had during Round 2.\nMr. Bush faced intense criticism over the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and the Great Recession, and of course, he had long been attacked as not smart enough for America\u2019s top job."}
