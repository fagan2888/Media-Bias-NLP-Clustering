He is director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have healthier babies born closer to term and fewer health complications related to prematurity\u2014like lung disease, heart disease, and infections,\u201d said Singer, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.\n\nFor the report, Joyce Martin of the NCHS and colleagues examined birth statistics in 46 states and Washington, D.C., from 1998 to 2014.\n\nThe researchers found the rate of births of triplets, quadruplets or more babies fell 41 percent\u2014from 7,625 in 1998, when such births peaked, to 4,526 in 2014, reaching a rate of one in every 880 births.\n\nIn seven states\u2014Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Rhode Island\u2014the rate of these births fell by at least half, the study findings showed.\n\nOne doctor welcomed the new numbers.\n\n\u201cHopefully, this trend will continue,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Kawwass, an assistant professor with the Emory Reproductive Center in Atlanta.\n\nKawwass said advances in in vitro fertilization (IVF) have helped stem multiple births.\n\n\u201cThe trend toward reducing the number of embryos transferred and transferring a single embryo when possible during IVF cycles is moving in the right direction,\u201d she said. \u201cReproductive endocrinologists are making a conscious effort to continue improving.\u201d\n\nSinger said most twins do fine, but higher-number multiples face unique medical challenges. When a woman has three or more embryos, some often don\u2019t survive pregnancy, he explained. They die because of abnormalities or because they are aborted for medical or financial reasons, he said.\n\nThose who survive pregnancy are more likely to be premature, suffer from a variety of illnesses or die in their first year, Singer added.\n\nAccording to the new report, 7 percent of triplets, quadruplets and higher multiple-births born in 2013 didn\u2019t live past one year, compared to one in 200 singletons (less than 1 percent).\n\nSinger explained that as treatment moved from artificial insemination \u2014 in which sperm is injected into a womb \u2014 to IVF in a lab, doctors gained more control over the number of eggs fertilized.\n\nAlso, he agreed that IVF physicians now transfer fewer embryos into the womb, lowering the risk of multiple births. Given the widespread use of IVF, this make a difference, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have more than 200,000 women going through [IVF] on an annual basis in the U.S. alone,\u201d Singer said.\n\nThe declines in births of three or more babies at once were highest among white women. Rates were lower for Hispanics and unchanged for blacks, the report found.\n\nDr. Evan Myers, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University Medical Center, said this may reflect lower numbers of black women undergoing costly infertility treatments. Blacks were less likely than whites to have health insurance, at least before the Affordable Care Act, and tend to have lower incomes, he said. That\u2019s an important consideration for those whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover infertility treatment, Myers added.\n\nThe report is published in the April issue of the NCHS Data Brief.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about assisted reproductive technology.", "article_metadata": {"Content-Source": "healthcom", "description": "Since 1998, births of three or more babies at once have fallen by more than 40 percent in the United States, new government statistics reveal.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Health News / Tips & Trends / Celebrity Health", "description": "Since 1998, births of three or more babies at once have fallen by more than 40 percent in the United States, new government statistics reveal.", "title": "Why Fewer Triplets and Quadruplets Are Being Born in the U.S.", "url": "http://news.health.com/2016/04/28/births-of-triplets-quadruplets-on-decline-in-u-s-report/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/baby-quadruplets1.jpg", "height": 340}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/baby-quadruplets1.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@goodhealth", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "search_title": "Why Fewer Triplets and Quadruplets Are Being Born in the U.S.", "msapplication-tooltip": "Health's blog features breaking news, celebrity tips, exercise videos, and more!
