The radical Shiite Islamists who seized power in 1979 also seized the US embassy in Tehran and kept dozens of diplomatic personnel as hostages for 444 long days.\n\nThe chant became a regular feature of the nightly news, as the intense media coverage often included footage of the constant protests of the \u201cstudents\u201d while a feckless administration could do nothing to end the humiliation.\n\nRelated: Rubio Suggests Obama Is Letting Iran Dictate US War Policy\n\nUnfortunately, subsequent administrations didn\u2019t learn much from the folly of engagement with the radical mullahs that run Iran with an iron fist. Ronald Reagan tried to swap arms with Iran to end a string of kidnappings of Americans by Hezbollah, Tehran\u2019s terrorist proxies that eventually took control of Lebanon and became Bashar al-Assad\u2019s enforcers in Syria.\n\nEvery administration since has attempted to get the Iranians to end their support for terror, and the last two have tried to get Tehran to end its nuclear-weapons program since the discovery of their clandestine effort more than a decade ago. Despite the concessions made repeatedly to woo the mullahs into more responsible behavior, the response has always been a thinly veiled version of \u201cDeath to America.\u201d\n\nThis week, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader didn\u2019t even bother with the veil. A crowd attending a speech by Ali Khamenei in Tehran began the \u201cDeath to America\u201d chant as the ruling mullah assented. \u201cOf course yes, death to America,\u201d Khamenei replied, \u201cbecause America is the original source of this pressure\u201d to end Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nThis is, of course, the head of state in the high-stakes negotiations that President Obama has tried so hard to keep going. Furthermore, in the Iranian theocracy, it\u2019s the ayatollah serving as Supreme Leader who counts for everything in a political sense. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have hitched the security of the US and the very existence of our allies in the Middle East \u2013 especially Israel \u2013 on the basis that we can trust Iran to stick to a deal and not produce nuclear weapons, even though it would give them a significant advantage in the region. And the only man whose opinions count publicly cheers, \u201cDeath to America.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Iran Is Taking Over the Middle East\n\nThe response to Khamenei\u2019s statement by the White House may have been even more unnerving. According to CNN and National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar, the Obama administration didn\u2019t take it seriously. They said it was \u201cintended for a domestic political audience.\u201d The administration dismissed the idea that was significant in terms of the deal Obama and Kerry have pursued, and for which the US and its allies have spent months negotiating. It\u2019s just the Ayatollah being the Ayatollah, in other words.\n\nFunny, but the White House took a distinctly less charitable approach to the ally that opposed Iran the previous week. Benjamin Netanyahu, in fighting for re-election in Israel, told voters there that he could no longer support a two-state solution under the current conditions of Palestinian leadership. He also warned Israelis that outside activists had attempted to boost voting of Israeli Arabs in an attempt to defeat Likud, and urged Israel\u2019s Jews to turn out more heavily for him. In the final days of the election, Netanyahu won handily.\n\nDid the Obama administration shrug Netanyahu\u2019s words off as \u201cintended for a domestic political audience?\u201d\n\nOf course not.\n\nEver since, the White House has been in high dudgeon, slamming Netanyahu\u2019s campaign for both the comments about Arab turnout and the futility of negotiating with a Hamas-partnered Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu has tried making amends for both statements, but as late as Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Marie Harf sniffed that the US didn\u2019t find Netanyahu credible any longer. \u201cGiven his statements prior to the election, it\u2019s going to be hard to find a path where people seriously believe, when it comes to negotiations, that those are possible.\u201d\n\nRelated: Netanyahu Shows Obama\u2019s Deal with Iran Is Lose-Lose\n\nLet\u2019s get this straight. Benjamin Netanyahu, the elected head of government of a US ally, defies Obama on a policy that impacts Israel\u2019s security, then apologizes for it, and yet is considered someone who lacks credibility. However, when the head of state of a nation that has sponsored terrorism for decades openly says, \u201cDeath to America,\u201d the Obama administration shrugs off the statement as mere domestic politics and considers him a credible partner for peace.\n\nWe are truly through the looking glass with this President.\n\nIt has become abundantly clear that Obama wants a deal for the sake of claiming a foreign policy achievement, no matter what the cost, and no matter what it does to our allies, especially Israel. The situation is reminiscent of another confrontation between Western powers and an extremist dictatorship that professed its own destiny to rule the world, and where the dictator even wrote out his plans for world domination and practically begged everyone to read them.\n\nIn both cases, Western leaders told themselves that the extremist rhetoric was only intended for domestic consumption. Also in both cases, they treated with contempt their allies whose very existence was threatened by the new hegemon, who kept breaking international agreements and stalling negotiations until the West appeased them by betraying those same allies -- even locking their democratic allies out of the negotiations.\n\nAt least Neville Chamberlain learned his lesson after Munich, albeit far too late for the Czechoslovakians, Eastern Europe, and millions of Jews. Obama and Kerry seem determined to repeat those same mistakes. That can be described many ways, but smart power isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When the chant \u201cDeath to America\u201d goes out in Tehran, it should remind us of the natur", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Obama Panders to Iran, Throws Israel Under the Bus", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/03/26/Here-s-Why-Obama-Panders-Iran-Throws-Israel-Under-Bus", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/03/26/Here-s-Why-Obama-Panders-Iran-Throws-Israel-Under-Bus", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran_2.jpg", "creator": "@EdMorrissey", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When the chant \u201cDeath to America\u201d goes out in Tehran, it should remind us of the natur", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb9ad\"", "article_summary": "Did the Obama administration shrug Netanyahu\u2019s words off as \u201cintended for a domestic political audience?\u201dOf course not.\nAccording to CNN and National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar, the Obama administration didn\u2019t take it seriously.\nThis is, of course, the head of state in the high-stakes negotiations that President Obama has tried so hard to keep going.\nRelated: Rubio Suggests Obama Is Letting Iran Dictate US War PolicyUnfortunately, subsequent administrations didn\u2019t learn much from the folly of engagement with the radical mullahs that run Iran with an iron fist.\nWhen the chant \u201cDeath to America\u201d goes out in Tehran, it should remind us of the nature of Barack Obama\u2019s diplomatic partners in Iran."}
