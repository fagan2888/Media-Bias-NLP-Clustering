A Lynn Haven family is settling into their new home thanks to Habitat for Humanity.

Christmas has come early for single mom Wanda Williams and her four children.

"I'm so excited. Its been a long time coming, but its really exciting to be getting a house right before Christmas," Williams said.

Sunday afternoon the Bay County Habitat for Humanity dedicated the Williams home in Lynn Haven.

Wanda couldn't be more excited to move into her new four bed, two bath house on Iowa Avenue.

She had to log hundreds of hours of volunteer work with other Habitat for Humanity projects.

"It takes a while to put in 600 hours of sweat equity. They also learn the skills they will need to maintain their home, whenever they take it over," said Herman Daniels, Bay Co. Habitat for Humanity.

Williams said, "It actually shows my kids how hard I've worked to get something for them. It shows them in order to get something you have to earn it."

The dedication comes after more than a thousand hours of construction.

"This is the perfect time of year to do this," Daniels said. "We are here a couple of weeks before Christmas and this family is going to get quite a Christmas present."

As a single mother, Williams was never able to give her children their own, separate bedrooms.

Now only her daughters have to share.

"My boys have never had their own rooms, so they are excited to finally have their own rooms," she said.

The Habitat for Humanities builds simple, affordable homes for people across America.

They are given to families at a reduced mortgage.

The Bay County chapter has built 65 homes for families since 1992.
