He then issued a subpoena to Todd-Malmlov, who is apparently no longer a resident of Minnesota but resides somewhere in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area, where she is employed as a senior vice president at Avalere, a health care consulting firm.\n\nThe key findings of the OLA report blasted the launch of MNsure, which took place during Todd-Malmlov\u2019s tenure:\n\n(1) MNsure implemented its enrollment website in 2013 with serious technical problems.\n\n(2) Federal law imposed an ambitious timeline on states developing exchanges. This challenge washeightened by late federal rules, delays in passing state legislation,and problems with vendor selectionand performance.\n\n(3) MNsure staff withheld information from the MNsure Board and other key officials before the enrollment website was launched.\n\n(4) The initial enrollment process was often lengthy, and technical problems frustrated consumers,insurers, and counties.\n\nAs part of its investigation, the OLA \u201csolicited input through interviews and written information requests from MNsure staff and board members; staff from the Office of MN.IT Services (which provides information technology services to state agencies) and the Minnesota departments of Human Services, Health, and Management and Budget; representatives of key MNsure stakeholders, such as counties and health plans; and federal human services officials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe requested to interview the person who served as director of Minnesota\u2019s exchange from 2011 until her resignation in December 2013 [April Todd-Malmlov]; she did not respond directly to our requests,\u201d the OLA report added.\n\nIn a footnote to the report, the OLA explained further:\n\nWe invited the former MNsure executive director to speak with us, and a second time we sent her a subpoena, but she did not respond either time. Her attorney contacted us on several occasions, but his conditions for an interview with the former director were not acceptable. Primarily, her attorney said the former director would only cooperate if the Office of the Legislative Auditor paid all expenses she incurred by cooperating, including her attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nUnder Minnesota Statute 2007, 3.978, subdivision 2, current employees of the state of Minnesota are required to comply with requests for examinations by the legislative auditor:\n\nAll public officials and their deputies and employees\u2026 shall at all times afford reasonable facilities for examinations by the legislative auditor\u2026\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if the requirement of this law applies to former employees.\n\nSince the OLA subpoena of Todd-Malmlov was likely issued in Minnestoa but delivered to Todd-Malmlov outside the state of Minnesota, compliance with it could only be enforced through the cooperation of the attorney general in the state or district in which she currently resides, most likely Maryland, Virginia, or the District of Columbia.\n\nBreitbart News asked Todd-Malmlov\u2019s attorney, Marshall Tanick, to provide the legal basis on which his client refused to testify before the OLA unless the condition that all her expenses related to that testimony, including his own legal fees, were accepted by the OLA prior to her testimony.\n\nBreitbart News also asked Tanick to offer a comment on his client\u2019s behalf concerning claims she failed to provide adequate contract oversight when she approved $329,000 of invoices submitted by Jonathan Gruber for his enrollment projections, all of which failed to provide the level of billing detail called for in his contract.\n\nTanick did not respond to any of our inquiries.\n\n\u201cMs. Todd-Malmlov continually indicated a willingness to meet with the Legislative Auditor, as long as her rights were honored,\u201d Tanick said in a statement released earlier.\n\nBreitbart News contacted Legislative Auditor Nobles to inquire if he also attempted to interview Jonathan Gruber, but received no response. In addition, Nobles offered no explanation to Breitbart News or any other media outlet for his decision not to compel Todd-Malmlov to comply with the subpoena.\n\nMinnesota is not the only state or federal entity with unresolved questions about Jonathan Gruber\u2019s billing practices and the methodology he used in developing his Obamacare related economic projections.\n\nTodd-Malmlov\u2019s stonewalling of the OLA investigation into the launch of MNsure, and Jonathan Gruber\u2019s role in that launch, is consistent with Gruber\u2019s own pattern of stonewalling questions posed by other state and federal authorities.\n\nIn Vermont, for instance, Gruber has yet to respond to inquiries posed in December by State Auditor Doug Hoffman, who wants details about $80,000 of invoices submitted by Gruber and paid to him by the state of Vermont for work purportedly undertaken by unnamed research assistants.\n\nIn January, Hoffman described Gruber\u2019s response to his requests for information as \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d That characterization may soon change, however.\n\n\u201cI plan to release a memo next Monday,\u201d Hoffman told Breitbart News when asked for an update on the status of his inquiries into Jonathan Gruber\u2019s billing practices.\n\nAt the federal level, House Oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has indicated that he may call Gruber back to testify before the committee, as the documents he provided in response to an earlier subpoena may not be sufficient.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to address it. We can\u2019t just let \u2018er go,\u201d Chaffetz said in January.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ex-Bureaucrat Who Hired Jonathan Gruber Stonewalls Minnesota Investigation of His Work", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ex-Bureaucrat Who Hired Jonathan Gruber Stonewalls Minnesota Investigation of His Work", "title": "Ex-Bureaucrat Who Hired Jonathan Gruber Stonewalls Minnesota Investigation of His Work - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/19/ex-bureaucrat-who-hired-jonathan-gruber-stonewalls-minnesota-investigation-of-his-work/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ex-Bureaucrat Who Hired Jonathan Gruber Stonewalls Minnesota Investigation of His Work", "title": "Ex-Bureaucrat Who Hired Jonathan Gruber Stonewalls Minnesota Investigation of His Work - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/jonathan-gruber-testimony-afp.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "April Todd-Malmlov, Jason Chaffetz, Jonathan Gruber, Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor, Minnesota State Representative Greg Davids, MNsure, Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffman,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Vermont State Auditor Doug Hoffman", "published_time": "2015-02-19T08:23:43-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd151d\"", "article_summary": "Breitbart News contacted Legislative Auditor Nobles to inquire if he also attempted to interview Jonathan Gruber, but received no response.\n\u201cI plan to release a memo next Monday,\u201d Hoffman told Breitbart News when asked for an update on the status of his inquiries into Jonathan Gruber\u2019s billing practices.\nIn the OLA report, Legislative Auditor Jim Nobles noted that he first attempted to interview Todd-Malmlov on a voluntary basis but received no response.\nMinnesota is not the only state or federal entity with unresolved questions about Jonathan Gruber\u2019s billing practices and the methodology he used in developing his Obamacare related economic projections.\nThe key findings of the OLA report blasted the launch of MNsure, which took place during Todd-Malmlov\u2019s tenure:(1) MNsure implemented its enrollment website in 2013 with serious technical problems."}
