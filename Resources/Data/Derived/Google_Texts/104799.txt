A small town Butler County post office has been temporarily closed for safety concerns during the busiest shipping season of the year.

A sign on the front door of the Benton Post Office says in part "Due to safety issues within the building ... we are temporarily moving our operation to the Andover Post Office."

Benton residents say a majority of the town picks up their mail at the downtown post office, but for the past week they've had to make a 15 minute drive to Andover to get their mail.

"Well we've been coming every other day, we've been coming to town and come get our mail it's like, OK we're not going to make a special trip but we'll get it done," says Benton resident Dick Weston.

KAKE News reached out to the Benton and Andover post offices to find out what the safety concerns are, but their spokesperson hasn't responded.

However, Benton residents say they're not too concerned. Some have heard it was not a threat or suspicious package, but likely a mold problem.

Dick Weston says although this turned out to be bad timing considering all of the holiday shipping, it's not too big of an inconvenience.

"It's true, but a lot of it's catalogs and things that just as soon not have in your box anyway so I mean it's not like it's a crisis," says Weston.

The post office operations manager says they have contacted the landlord about the repairs needed before businesses continues. Weston thinks it could be a while.

"It's just one of those things that we have to deal with and when they get it fixed up and safety is no longer an issue why they tell us we'll get our mail again at the post office box in Benton that we had in the post office," says Weston.
