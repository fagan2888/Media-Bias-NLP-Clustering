She had not been feeling well but her demanding schedule as the traveling point person to Democratic National Committee Chair and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz didn\u2019t leave her much time to worry about her health. The then-27-year-old didn\u2019t even have a regular doctor.\n\nWith two days off, she caught a plane home from Cleveland to Washington, D.C., and went to a walk-in clinic. She figured she had the flu. They sent her to the Emergency Room because her red blood cell count was so low.\n\nMore tests followed. Two weeks later Houghton sat across from a hematologist who began speaking about \u201cimmature white blood cells.\u201d\n\nHoughton knew what that meant: cancer.\n\nHer boss is a breast cancer survivor and Houghton had been fundraising for cancer research and care for years. She\u2019d volunteered for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. She and Wasserman Schultz created the Congressional Women\u2019s Softball Game in 2009 to benefit the Young Survival Coalition, a nonprofit that helps young women under 40 with breast cancer. The event has raised more than $500,000 to date.\n\nNow, a doctor was struggling to tell Houghton that she had a rare form of leukemia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be so hard to tell a 27-year-old she has cancer,\u201d Houghton said. \u201cI thought he was going to cry.\u201d\n\n* * * * *\n\nCommunity service was part of Houghton\u2019s upbringing. Raised in a Miami Catholic family, she has a grandfather, Robert Yglesias, who serves as a deacon at St. Louis Catholic Church. Her grandmother, Barbara Yglesias, imbued her with the idea of \u201csocial justice.\u201d Together they volunteered in the women\u2019s maximum-security section of the Krome Detention Center teaching remedial English and math.\n\nEarly on, Houghton knew she wanted to make a career of community service. At FIU, she studied political science and began to see the connection between social justice and public policy.\n\n\u201cI realized I could go into nonprofit work, but in the course of learning about government and how many people you impact I saw that there was a way of doing what I wanted on a much larger scale,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can help people. My eyes opened to a different world.\u201d\n\nShe went on to earn a graduate degree in public policy at George Mason University and completed a congressional internship with Wasserman Schultz in 2007. Eventually, the Congresswoman asked her to join the team. Houghton\u2019s responsibilities grew when Wasserman Schultz became chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n\n* * * * *\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia comes with a life expectancy of three to six weeks. When she was diagnosed in 2012, Houghton was in the midst of planning the annual softball game she founded. It pits the female Washington press corps against bipartisan women members of Congress for seven innings of fun and friendship, all to help women with cancer. Houghton was too sick to make it that year.\n\n\u201cMy husband went in my place and wore a shirt that said \u2018Mr. Kate,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nHoughton more than beat the odds on leukemia. Four months after her diagnosis, she went back to work. The next year, she was back in the game. She poured her energy into the softball game and helped raise a record $166,000 to help young women with cancer.\n\n\u201cThat was me sticking it to cancer,\u201d she said.\n\nToday, Houghton is in remission and serves as the director of the Democratic Women\u2019s Alliance at the DNC. Day-to-day her role is to give Democratic women leaders the tools they need to effectively communicate the party\u2019s platform and messages. She quickly analyzes and responds to issues in a fast-paced, high-stakes political arena.\n\nThe issues have always been personal for her. None more so than the Affordable Care Act. As a cancer survivor, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a security in knowing I\u2019ll never be denied coverage because of this massive pre-existing condition I have.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s had $450,000 of medical treatment to beat cancer. \u201cIt gave me a real perspective on what medical bankruptcy could mean,\u201d she said. \u201cI could lose my home for something I didn\u2019t do to myself.\u201d\n\nAs the oldest child of a working mother, Houghton is also passionate about establishing pay equity for women. \u201cWomen earn 78 cents for every dollar men make,\u201d Houghton says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand that. I\u2019ve been inspired by so many strong women.\u201d\n\nAccepting leadership of the DNC Democratic Women\u2019s Alliance, she said, was scary. But cancer never was.\n\n\u201cWhat is the alternative? I could live or die. Dying was not an option,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going to live. In some ways it\u2019s the most sure thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nBeing a cancer survivor, she said, has fueled her commitment to making change through public policy.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s living conditions can be improved by the service providers, by the government,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how policy impacts a person in a personal way.\u201d \u2666", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kate Yglesias Houghton \u201906 advocates for social justice on behalf of women in her leadership role at the Democratic National Committee\r\nPolitical staffer", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.3.9", "og": {"url": "https://news.fiu.edu/2014/12/the-politics-are-personal-for-kate-yglesias-houghton-06/83231", "site_name": "FIU News", "image": "https://news.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/kate-houghton-700x450-400x257.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "The politics are personal for Kate Yglesias Houghton \u201906"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": "floridainternational"}, "keywords": "Alumni,College of Arts Sciences & Education,FIU Magazine,Politics and International Relations,Steven J.
