Alvarez says his interim duties begin Monday.\n\nThis announcement comes about two-and-a-half months after O\u2019Connor was back to work following an internal investigation based on allegations from the firefighters\u2019 union on behalf of the paid volunteer firefighters.\n\nO\u2019Connor was placed on administrative leave at the end of October.\n\nIn December, city manager Bill Avera announced three of five allegations brought against him were unfounded. Those claims said O\u2019Connor violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Affordable Care Act. The city said those policies don\u2019t apply to paid volunteer firefighters.\n\nThe third claim stated allegations of a conflict of interest because O\u2019Connor\u2019s son is also a firefighter for the department.\n\nAvera said the two final claims were related to staffing issues, which the city asked O\u2019Connor to better clarify for his department.\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s career spans more than a decade and he served as the city\u2019s fire chief for about a year.\n\nOn Monday, Avera met with a search firm tasked with filling O'Connor's role and the roles of the others who left under a voluntary separation incentive program the city offered toward the end of last year. At least ten others left, including a city clerk. As part of the program, O'Connor stands to get $78,000 in wages and incentives. Whoever takes over the fire department has a large responsibility, overseeing Hollister, San Juan Bautista and part of San Benito county.\n\n\"They (the search firm) recently conducted a search for the city of Marina,\" Avera said. \"We hope to pull from some of those candidates.\"\n\nAlvarez hasn't yet decided whether to pursue the role permanently. City leaders expect the hiring process to take several months, shorter if someone local is hired.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "Hollister Interim Fire Chief Leo Alvarez confirms he is stepping in after former Fire Chief Mike O\u2019Connor takes retirement.
