But that\u2019s what happened when baby Xavier Powell was born using the world\u2019s oldest human sperm.\n\nBaby Xavier\u2019s story starts when his dad, Australian Alex Powell, was 15 years old. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system in which cells grow abnormally and hinder a person\u2019s ability to fight off infections, The Inquisitr reported. Though it\u2019s not entirely clear what causes the disease, chemotherapy, radiation, or stem cell treatment have been found to put it into remission. So when doctors told Powell he\u2019d be undergoing chemotherapy to fight the disease, his mother, who\u2019d had a conversation with a stranger about storing sperm that same day, suggested he do the same.\n\nOne of the side effects of chemotherapy is infertility. While not every man who undergoes chemotherapy will be made infertile, it can affect how much sperm a man produces and the sperm\u2019s ability to fertilize an egg. Though he may not have known it at the time, his frozen sperm would eventually become very useful.\n\nThat\u2019s because in 2013, when Powell and his wife Vi decided to have a baby, they found that, although the Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma was gone, Powell was indeed infertile. The couple decided to try in-vitro fertilization (IVF), \u201ca complex series of procedures used to treat fertility or genetic problems and assist with the conception of a child,\u201d according to the Mayo Clinic. Therefore, the only viable route they had to conceiving a biological baby was to use Powell\u2019s 23-year-old sperm.\n\nThis 23-year gap is what set the world record \u2014 Powell\u2019s sperm is the oldest human sperm in the world. And despite skepticism, a year after they started IVF, they were successful. Xavier was born on June 17, 2015. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s that sort of feeling in life you want to relive every moment if you can,\u201d Alex told Australian news service 9News, when asked about the birth of his healthy son.\n\nNormally, sperm can be stored frozen for up to 10 years. However, for people who are fertile, there\u2019s a chance it can be stored for a maximum of 55 years. For people who no longer need the sperm, it\u2019s typically donated or used in research. After experiencing the hardships of using two-decades-old sperm, the Powells are ready for another child \u2014 so they will use IVF again.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, the previous record holder for baby born from the world\u2019s oldest sperm was surpassed by Xavier by only a year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "guinness world record, sperm, ivf, healthy baby boy, alex powell, hodgkin's lymphoma", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Australian woman and her husband, who beat Hodgkin's lymphoma as a teen, used IVF and the man's 23-year-old sperm to conceive a child, setting a Guinness World Record.", "title": "Baby Born Using 23-Year-Old Sperm And IVF, Sets World Record", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hodgkins-lymphoma-survivor-and-wife-conceive-child-using-ivf-and-worlds-oldest-human-364986", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/11/baby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Australian woman and her husband, who beat Hodgkin's lymphoma as a teen, used IVF and the man's 23-year-old sperm to conceive a child, setting a Guinness World Record.", "title": "Baby Born Using 23-Year-Old Sperm And IVF, Sets World Record", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hodgkins-lymphoma-survivor-and-wife-conceive-child-using-ivf-and-worlds-oldest-human-364986", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/11/baby.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/11/baby.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-12-11T17:34:58-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-11T17:34:58-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Australian woman and her husband, who beat Hodgkin's lymphoma as a teen, used IVF and the man's 23-year-old sperm to conceive a child, setting a Guinness World Record."}, "article_summary": "This 23-year gap is what set the world record \u2014 Powell\u2019s sperm is the oldest human sperm in the world.\nBut that\u2019s what happened when baby Xavier Powell was born using the world\u2019s oldest human sperm.\nIt\u2019s not every day that someone sets a Guinness World Record, especially when they\u2019re only 6 months old.\nIf you\u2019re wondering, the previous record holder for baby born from the world\u2019s oldest sperm was surpassed by Xavier by only a year.\nAfter experiencing the hardships of using two-decades-old sperm, the Powells are ready for another child \u2014 so they will use IVF again."}
