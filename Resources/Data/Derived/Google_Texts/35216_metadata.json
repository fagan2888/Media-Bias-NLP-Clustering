Certified volunteers provide help nationwide through the AARP Foundation Tax-Aide Program. A group of volunteers is doing that at the Marquette Senior Center.\n\n\u201cWe also do a couple of days in Negaunee and a couple of days in the Gwinn area,\u201d Tax\u2013Aide local coordinator Richard Brich said. \u201cWith that, we would love to be able to establish some more sites.\u201d\n\nThe program works with seniors and low-to-moderate income residents. The start of Obamacare is affecting the returns of some of the people that have come in for help.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is, if they don\u2019t have health care coverage and they don\u2019t meet certain exemptions, they\u2019re going to be hit with a penalty,\u201d Brich said. \u201cI\u2019ve already had three people since (February) 3rd that have been hit with penalties.\u201d\n\nVolunteers will be at the center every Tuesday and Friday through April 7th. The free assistance is also confidential.\n\nIf you want more information about the program, including eligibility information, you can find it at aarp.org/taxaide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many of us who haven't already filed income tax returns for the previous year are starting to prepare them right now.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Upper Peninsula ABC 10", "description": "Many of us who haven't already filed income tax returns for the previous year are starting to prepare them right now.", "title": "AARP program provides free income tax help - Upper Peninsula ABC 10", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "http://abc10up.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/senior-tax-help.jpg", "height": 432}, "url": "http://abc10up.com/aarp-program-provides-free-income-tax-help/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many of us who haven't already filed income tax returns for the previous year are starting to prepare them right now.", "creator": "@upabc10", "image": "http://abc10up.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/senior-tax-help.jpg", "title": "AARP program provides free income tax help - Upper Peninsula ABC 10", "site": "@upabc10", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 324979658237, "app_id": 313490130554}, "article": {"section": "Community", "tag": "volunteer", "published_time": "2015-02-18T23:19:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-18T23:19:36+00:00", "author": "http://abc10up.com/author/staff/"}, "google-site-verification": "xFsC80eHHA1OiPH_a5eV1KmMGe6qDPO83BB6PoNGeao", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda87f\"", "article_summary": "Certified volunteers provide help nationwide through the AARP Foundation Tax-Aide Program.\nMARQUETTE \u2014 Many of us who haven\u2019t already filed income tax returns for the previous year are starting to prepare them right now.\nIf you want more information about the program, including eligibility information, you can find it at aarp.org/taxaide.\n\u201cWith that, we would love to be able to establish some more sites.\u201dThe program works with seniors and low-to-moderate income residents.\nThe start of Obamacare is affecting the returns of some of the people that have come in for help."}
