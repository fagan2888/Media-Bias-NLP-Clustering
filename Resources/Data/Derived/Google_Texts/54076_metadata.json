In order to take advantage of mobile searches, restaurant operators should invest in optimizing their websites for smartphones, says Riehle.\n\nNo. 3: Take advantage of social.\n\nRiehle says social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter can help maintain relationships with existing customers and attract new ones. \u201cThey allow operators to nudge consumers to patronize,\u201d he says. The National Restaurant Association\u2019s research finds that over a third of diners ages 18-34 view restaurants\u2019 social media pages, making these sites especially important for attracting a younger clientele.\n\nNo. 4: Think local.\n\n\u201cLocal sourcing is equated with freshness,\u201d says Riehle, and locally sourced meat, seafood and produce top the list of table-service menu trends for 2014. Playing up local menu items or partnerships with neighborhood farms can help attract foodies this year, with 64% of adults more likely to visit restaurants that offer locally made items.\n\nNo. 5: Become health-conscious.\n\nHealthful kids\u2019 meals and gluten-free options are also among the top five trends for 2014, and over 80% of all restaurant operators say their customers are paying more attention to nutritional content than they were just two years ago. Given that nearly three-quarters of diners are more likely to visit a restaurant that offers healthy options, adding some new, good-for-you dishes may be a smart move for restaurant owners.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-09 10:29:54 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The National Restaurant Association predicts the restaurant industry will see another year of record sales in 2014, and expert Hudson Riehle shares some tips for restaurant owners who want to grow their piece of the pie.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/01/21/tech-at-table-what-restaurants-are-cooking-up-for-2014.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/01/21/tech-at-table-what-restaurants-are-cooking-up-for-2014/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452353397215.jpg?ve=1", "description": "The National Restaurant Association predicts the restaurant industry will see another year of record sales in 2014, and expert Hudson Riehle shares some tips for restaurant owners who want to grow their piece of the pie.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tech at the Table?
