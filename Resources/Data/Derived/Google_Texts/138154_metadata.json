To attest to this fact, they can select \u201cInformed of Tax Penalty Risk\u201d when filling out a special-enrollment application through a certified insurance agent or enrollment counselor.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, health care and taxes now are linked arm in arm,\u201d Covered California Executive Director Peter V. Lee said. \u201cThe law requires most people to be insured, and if you\u2019re not, you may face a significant financial penalty when you file your taxes this year.\u201d\n\nConsumers who didn\u2019t have insurance in 2014 but were eligible to enroll, risked a penalty of $95 per adult per household ($47.50 per child under 18) or 1 percent of their household income, whichever is greater.\n\nIn 2015 the penalty is much larger. Those who don\u2019t buy health insurance in 2015 could be penalized $325 per adult in a household ($162.50 per child under 18) or 2 percent of their income, whichever is greater.\n\nThe new tax penalty for being uninsured \u2014 known as the \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d \u2014 motivated many consumers to purchase insurance during the latest open-enrollment period. Covered California acknowledges that many people who are supposed to purchase insurance may be surprised when they file their taxes and learn they must pay a penalty for not having health coverage, Lee said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to feel blindsided by the shared responsibility payment,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we established this limited-time special enrollment that builds on the broader availability of coverage for Californians who have a change of circumstance making them eligible outside of open enrollment. If you didn\u2019t realize the tax consequences of not having insurance, you can enroll in a Covered California plan up until April 30.\u201d\n\nEnrolling in coverage for 2015 will not reduce the penalty for not being insured during 2014. However, enrolling now could help minimize the penalty for being uninsured for 2015.\n\nAs the penalty increases, it makes more and more sense for people who have been waiting on the sidelines to get in and get covered, Lee said. In some cases, he argued, it actually costs less to buy insurance than to pay the penalty.\n\nFor example, a 30-year-old person in Los Angeles making $18,000 a year would pay $252 over the course of 2015 to be covered under the least expensive Bronze insurance plan. Or they could go without insurance for the entire year and pay a $325 penalty when they file their taxes next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA couple, both 30 years old and living in Los Angeles, earning $28,000 dollars a year combined, would pay $468 over the course of 2015 to be covered under the least expensive Bronze plan. Or they could go without insurance for the entire year and owe $650 when they file their taxes next year.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), California had 16.9 million individual tax filers in 2012. Potentially, some 338,000 to 676,000 California taxpayers could face a penalty.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearing the finish line on the second year of this historic initiative, and we don\u2019t want to leave anyone behind,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMillions of people have gotten covered, which in turn has provided them with the medical care they deserve at the time they need it.\u201d\n\nLee said uninsured residents can still get covered by going to www.CoveredCA.com, where consumers can find the nearest Certified Enrollment Counselor or Certified Insurance Agent to help them enroll. Consumers can also call the Covered California Service Center \u2014 at (800) 300-1506 \u2014 where a representative will help them.\n\nIn addition to Covered California\u2019s special-enrollment opportunities, consumers may also be able to qualify for Medi-Cal, which has year-round enrollment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never smart to avoid having health insurance,\u201d said Lee. \u201cOne accident can lead to an emergency room visit and tens of thousands of dollars in bills \u2014 or learning you have cancer when it\u2019s too late to treat it. Now there\u2019s another reason to get insured: taxes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The clock is ticking on tax filers who are facing a penalty for not having health insurance.Covered California, the agency that administers so-called \u201cObamacare\u201d in California, is offering consumers who were unaware of the tax pen", "title": "Covered California: Be aware of tax consequences", "og": {"url": "http://www.willitsnews.com/article/NR/20150415/NEWS/150419961", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.willitsnews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NR/20150415/NEWS/150419961/AR/0/AR-150419961.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1001px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Covered California: Be aware of tax consequences"}, "twitter": {"domain": "willitsnews.com", "description": "The clock is ticking on tax filers who are facing a penalty for not having health insurance.Covered California, the agency that administers so-called \u201cObamacare\u201d in California, is offering consumers who were unaware of the tax pen", "title": "Covered California: Be aware of tax consequences", "url": "http://www.willitsnews.com/article/NR/20150415/NEWS/150419961", "image": {"src": "http://www.willitsnews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NR/20150415/NEWS/150419961/AR/0/AR-150419961.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@thewillitsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "features, Business", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "features, Business"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0f2\"", "article_summary": "30, 2015, consumers are eligible to apply for health coverage during special enrollment by stating that they did not realize there was a tax penalty.\nThe clock is ticking on tax filers who are facing a penalty for not having health insurance.\nTo attest to this fact, they can select \u201cInformed of Tax Penalty Risk\u201d when filling out a special-enrollment application through a certified insurance agent or enrollment counselor.\nThe new tax penalty for being uninsured \u2014 known as the \u201cshared responsibility payment\u201d \u2014 motivated many consumers to purchase insurance during the latest open-enrollment period.\n\u201cFor the first time, health care and taxes now are linked arm in arm,\u201d Covered California Executive Director Peter V.
