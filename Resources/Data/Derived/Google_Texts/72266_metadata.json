While the members are concentrated in the South, West or Midwest, they also come from states as varied as Arizona and New Jersey. Some are young, like Representatives Justin Amash of Michigan, 35, and Ron DeSantis of Florida, 37; others are older, like Representative Steve Pearce of New Mexico, 68.\n\nSome are in their first term in Congress; some are well into their second decade. They are mostly white men.\n\nIn keeping with its anti-establishment bent, the Freedom Caucus usually meets in the basement of a local pub rather than at the Capitol, and its founders have cultivated an aura of subterfuge, in part by never releasing an official membership list.\n\nSeveral members said the group serves as a forum for vigorous policy discussions that they feel are lacking on the House floor.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the desire for good government, for the process to work in the House, the desire for amendments to be offered, just for regular order,\u201d Mr. Stutzman said in an interview, standing by the elevators outside the House chamber. \u201cI really think that\u2019s what brings us together.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet Mr. Stutzman and the others have made an impact, often in a highly destructive fashion. They forced the shutdown of the government in 2013, hoping to undo the Affordable Care Act. Many seemed ready to shutter the government again this year in a fight over funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nMore mainstream Republicans have accused the hard-liners of pursuing a strategy of trying to \u201cburn the House down,\u201d as Representative Bill Flores of Texas put it. Others have said that Mr. Boehner\u2019s real mistake was kowtowing to the newly elected conservatives and allowing them too much rope \u2014 to the Republican Party\u2019s detriment.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a confrontation on Fox News on Sunday, Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, accused Mr. Mulvaney and his conservative allies of castigating Republican leaders while achieving nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done that\u2019s accomplished anything?\u201d Mr. Cole asked Mr. Mulvaney. \u201cThe last time we followed these kind of tactics on the government shutdown October of 2013, we lost. We didn\u2019t win. We certainly didn\u2019t repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAnd last month, Representative Tom McClintock of California quit the Freedom Caucus and denounced its tactics in a resignation letter, saying the group had effectively become an ally of Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, by helping to block Republican initiatives.\n\nThe bottom line, however, is that the hard-liners still have their jobs and that Mr. Boehner is on his way out.\n\nTheir demands for a different way of doing things in the House are likely to get a lot of attention this week, given that their numbers are large enough to prevent any candidate from securing the 218 votes needed to be elected speaker.\n\nThat means no Republican is going to be elected without at least making some commitments toward ending business as usual.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Mulvaney complained that legislation was more likely to be written by staff members working for the leadership than by lawmakers, who are called upon only at the end, to vote as demanded by the leadership.\n\n\u201cIf you say yes, you are a good team player; if you say no, you are a pariah,\u201d he said. \u201cThat cannot be the way the Republican Party should function.\u201d\n\nBut even if they get some of what they want, such as a greater ability to offer amendments on the House floor, it is unclear that they will gain anything beyond paralyzing the House with endless debate. Mr. Obama still has veto power, and Senate Democrats can still use a filibuster.\n\nIf nothing else, Freedom Caucus members say they have succeeded in sending a message to their constituents that they are willing to fight harder \u2014 against Mr. Obama, Planned Parenthood and other perceived opponents. Some are also building their careers. Mr. Stutzman, for instance, is running for Senate, where Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has often waged a lonely battle for goals similar to those of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nMr. Mulvaney, who has a degree in international economics from Georgetown and a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said: \u201cIt\u2019s what I thought being in Congress was going to be like: smart people with real-world experience getting together and trying to hash through issues. That does not happen in the Republican conference.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the Freedom Caucus is Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a former college wrestling coach who holds a law degree and a master\u2019s degree in education.\n\nMr. Jordan, 51, who is now in his fifth term, represents a central Ohio district that is adjacent to Mr. Boehner\u2019s district north of Cincinnati. He has repeatedly said that he has no personal animus toward Mr. Boehner, even as he has rallied House conservatives to pressure the House leadership on almost every major issue.\n\nAfter Mr. Boehner said he would resign, Mr. Jordan issued a statement on behalf of the Freedom Caucus saying that the group did not have a preferred candidate for speaker, and calling for a \u201ccareful and deliberative\u201d search that would \u201censure that we follow regular order in the House and give a voice to the countless Americans who still feel that Washington does not represent them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps fittingly, on Wednesday the Freedom Caucus decided on its choice for speaker: Representative Daniel Webster of Florida, the longest shot in a three-person race.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work just to change the leaders,\u201d said Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, 46, a farmer and former state legislator with a doctorate in political science. \u201cYou have got to actually talk about changing policy, you have got to talk about principles, instead of planning on losing every time.\u201d\n\nMr. Huelskamp is the leader of the House Tea Party Caucus as well as a member of the Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cWhen two-thirds of the Republican Party, 60 percent, whatever it is, says they have had enough of the establishment in Washington, you can\u2019t just move people up the ladder,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have got to be talking about other changes as well. Here\u2019s a chance to restore trust in the Republican Party.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151007114138, "twitter": {"description": "Lawmakers who pressed for the resignation of Speaker John A.
