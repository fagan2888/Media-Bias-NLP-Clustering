× Jimmy Fallon, Billy Joel Create Doo-Wop Group

Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon once again showed the range of his talent and entertaining abilities when he put guest Billy Joel up to a bit of a musical challenge.

Using an app called Looper, he and the Piano Man formed an impromptu doo-wop group and sang “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” by The Tokens.

With two microphones and an iPad, they created something special.

Billy Joel heads to Cleveland for a performance at Quicken Loans Arena on April 1.
