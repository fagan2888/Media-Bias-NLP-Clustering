While most women undergo the pains of plastic surgery in order to be more beautiful, a new study claims that going under the knife actually makes women more likeable, as well as younger looking, to other people.

The study, the first of its kind was carried out by Professor Michael Reilly of Georgetown University School of Medicine. It found that women who have plastic surgery are perceived by others to have better social skills and are even more trustworthy.

The research compared people’s perceptions of women who had face lifts, upper and lower eye lifts, brow lifts, neck lifts, and chin implants.

For Professor Reilly, the results are more than a little bit interesting.

“Our animal instinct tells us to avoid those who are ill-willed and we know from previous research that personality traits are drawn from an individual’s neutral expressions.”

Another study, which was not related to plastic surgery, found that people look at the eyes when judging attractiveness and trustworthiness, which could be why these procedures yielded the most positive results.

Reilly added, ‘This may explain why the patients who had a lower eyelift were found to be significantly more attractive and feminine, and experienced improved trustworthiness scores.”

While there were no clear statistics to lead to a conclusion about the way people perceive faces, pre- and post-surgery, Reilly noted, “Some might say that is negative, but others may want that look. The comprehensive evaluation and treatment of the facial rejuvenation patient requires an understanding of the changes in a person’s perceived aura that are likely to occur with surgery beyond just the traditional measures of age and attractiveness.”

On top of that, Reilly suggested that plastic surgery patients should be made aware that going under the knife is about more than just aesthetics and beauty.
