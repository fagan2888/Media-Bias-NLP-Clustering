In 2014, the Pew Research Center found 90 percent of Americans own a cell phone; 58 percent own a smartphone; 32 percent own an e-reader; and 42 percent own a tablet computer \u2014 all perhaps without knowing the toll it takes on human biology.\n\nRichard Stevens, an epidemiologist working out of the University of Connecticut Health Center, has been studying the effects of mobile technology\u2019s blue light for three decades. While he, too, has found the blue light that emitted from these devices inhibits sleep and work performance, he recently found there may be a chance to correct the situation. That is to say the typical lighting that\u2019s affecting human biology can be improved.\n\n\u201cWe're learning that better lighting can reduce these physiological effects,\u201d Stevens said in a press release. \u201cBy that, we mean dimmer and longer wavelengths in the evening, and avoiding the bright blue of e-readers, tablets, and smart phones.\"\n\nIt may not seem like it, but when using mobile technology into the night, enough blue light is emitted to suppress the sleep hormone melatonin. In turn, this throws off the body\u2019s circadian rhythm, which is the biological mechanism responsible for restful sleep. Separate research has shown the circadian rhythm can set the pace for a healthy heart and weight, plus a healthy liver. So it might be better to reach for, say, a paper book over an e-reader when trying to fall asleep.\n\n\u201cThe physiological effects of light at night and sleep disruption have been \u2018proven\u2019 in the sense that there is general acceptance in the scientific community of its truth. \u2026 What has not been \u2018proven\u2019 is that electric light-at-night causally increases risk of cancer, obesity, diabetes, and/or depression,\u201d Stevens and his co-author wrote in their recent paper.\n\nBlue light, however, isn\u2019t solely to blame for messing with the body\u2019s internal clock. The authors added there\u2019s also \u201cinadequate light during the day inside buildings for a robust resetting of the human endogenous circadian rhythmicity.\u201d Over the past 50 years, use of electric light for work and domestic life has significantly grown, lessening the amount of time people spend in natural, vitamin D-rich sunlight.\n\nOne small study done in 2013 took eight people with varied chronotypes \u2014 think of morning birds and night owls \u2014 and sent them camping in Colorado (where they lived). Despite participants' initial range of bedtimes, researchers found there was far less variability among them toward the end of the study.\n\nIt\u2019s the fact we\u2019re less exposed to natural light during the day and overexposed to blue light at night that\u2019s impacting our biology. Researchers find balancing this out \u201cmay help to reduce the physiological, cognitive, and health consequences of circadian disruption.\u201d Again, this might mean a paper book instead of an e-reader at night and incandescent bulbs during the day. These bulbs, Stevens said, are dimmer and more circadian friendly.\n\nSource: Stevens R.G. and Zhu Y. Electric light, particularly at night, disrupts human circadian rhythmicity: is that a problem?
