The matter centered around Steyn\u2019s column of last Friday called \u201cThe Age of Intolerance.\u201d Citing the experience of Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson, who came under attack from gay rights activists for expressing his view of homosexuality, Steyn argued that the forces of \u201ctolerance\u201d are so intolerant that they threaten to make ours a decidedly illiberal society.\n\nSteyn led off his column with two old jokes about gays. The first, from Bob Hope, was, as Steyn said, \u201coddly profound\u201d because it somehow foresaw the intolerance that Steyn attacks.\n\nThe second joke, from Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, was stupid and unfunny. Steyn, though, wasn\u2019t holding it out as an example of clever humor, but rather as an example of something one can no longer say on television. And, as usual, Steyn put the gag to clever use in his piece.\n\nSteorts found Steyn\u2019s piece \u201cless than illuminating\u201d and characterized it as \u201c200 percent felt and half thought.\u201d Steyn fired off a pointed response to which Steorts replied.\n\nSteorts made two points in his criticism of Steyn\u2019s piece. Presumably referring to the attack by gay activists on the Duck Dynasty guy, Steorts \u201cargued that in principle the people have every right to make pariahs of whom they will, and to slug it out among themselves, so to speak, when they disagree.\u201d He also complained that \u201cthe derogatory language in [Steyn\u2019s] column, and especially the slur in [the Rat Pack] joke, [is] both puerile in its own right and disappointing coming from a writer of such talent.\u201d\n\nSteorts\u2019 first point, asserting the right to make pariahs of those one disagrees with, is beside the point. Gay activists may have the right to try to make a pariah out of the Duck Dynasty guy, but their efforts to do so are nauseating nonetheless. They should be deplored in the strongest terms, as Steorts seemed ultimately to agree.\n\nAs to the terms Steyn used, I understand Steorts\u2019 point. I too would have liked the column better without the unfunny Rat Pack joke. And I agree with Steorts that courteous disagreement, devoid of insults, is usually preferable to lack of courtesy, even when one is disagreeing with the dangerous and the uncivil.\n\nBut Steyn doesn\u2019t do \u201ccourteous\u201d disagreement; he does wickedly funny, edgy disagreement to the enjoyment of a great many, including me. The column that offended Steorts was entirely in line with Steyn\u2019s idiom. If we like Steyn\u2019s work, we should not want him to pull his punches simply because this time his wrath is directed at gay activists.\n\nIndeed, I would go one step further. Gay activists, once perhaps sympathetic civil rights advocates, are now a nasty, destructive force that aggressively threatens freedom of speech and religion. Accordingly, they are among the last groups we should want Steyn to treat more gently than is his custom.\n\nSteyn is therefore correct to say that Steorts \u201cdoes not grasp the stakes\u201d in the Duck Dynasty dispute. The stakes consist of preserving a liberal society, in the classical sense. For, as Steyn grasps, \u201ca society where lives are ruined over an aside because some identity-group don decides it must be so is ugly and profoundly illiberal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "John has mentioned the controversy between Mark Steyn and his National Review editor, Jason Lee Steorts.
