Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and former Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) jointly introduced legislation that would provide $1 trillion of infrastructure spending over the next five years.\n\nSanders did not specify sources of funding for his proposal on Tuesday, but said he hoped to prompt discussion on it. \u201cHe did say some modest changes in the tax code for corporations and upper income earners could be an easy place to start,\u201d said Vincent Morris, a spokesperson.\n\n\n\nRelated: Biz Group Makes Congress an Infrastructure Offer They Can\u2019t Refuse\n\nSanders is a self-described Democratic socialist who is exploring a challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. He said the fastest way to help Americans left behind by the economic recovery is to rebuild infrastructure.\n\nThe Sanders-Mikulski proposal is one of the most ambitious ideas floated on Capitol Hill to address a shortfall in the federal Highway Trust Fund that threatens to delay or shelve state construction projects. The measure would inject an additional $75 billion a year into the Highway Trust Fund, create a national infrastructure bank, and expand financing and grant programs, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). It would also fund freight and passenger rail improvements, airports, water projects, ports and inland waterways and national parks, along with broadband and electric networks.\n\nLeaders of transportation and public works committees have been struggling to find ways to keep federal highway and infrastructure spending at roughly $50 billion a year \u2013 and the Sanders-Mikulski proposal would raise that by an additional $148 billion a year. Congress approved a stopgap $10.8 billion measure last year to keep the trust fund solvent through May.\n\nRelated: Obama Says China\u2019s Infrastructure Puts the U.S. to Shame\n\n\u201cBy taking steps to invest in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, the U.S. can protect $3.1 trillion in GDP, $1.1 trillion in U.S. trade value and 3.5 million jobs and a little over $3,000 a year per family,\u201d Casey Dinges, ASCE\u2019s senior managing director, said in a statement. \u201cWithout these investments, infrastructure \u2026 will continue to decline and Americans will pay the price.\u201d\n\nSanders said his proposal would put millions of people to work repairing the backlog of infrastructure projects and have a ripple effect on the economy, creating demands for new equipment, supplies and services.\n\nFew would argue the need to bolster infrastructure. The ASCE has calculated that an additional $1.6 trillion should be spent on infrastructure by 2020, and President Obama has repeatedly bemoaned how the U.S. trails China and other global competitors in investment.\n\nRelated: Gas Tax Hike May Be First Victim of Boehner Revolt\n\nYet there\u2019s tremendous disagreement on how to proceed, though Obama, Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) generally believe something needs to be done this year. The White House and congressional leaders have floated proposals for generating new revenues for infrastructure as part of an overhaul of the corporate tax code. And some prominent Senate Republicans, including John Thune (SD) and Bob Corker (TN), have said that with gas prices below $2.50 per gallon, Americans could afford to pay a slightly higher gasoline tax to help fix highways and bridges.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and McConnell (R-KY), though, are wary of anything resembling new taxes \u2013 and would oppose an increase in the 18.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax. Even debt-financed infrastructure projects would practically pay for themselves these days, with long-term interest rates so low.\n\n\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Two high-powered senators have upped the ante in the drive to boost spending for highw", "title": "$1 Trillion for Infrastructure: Where\u2019s the Money?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/1-Trillion-Infrastructure-Where-s-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-05-24T205606Z_1_CBRE94N1M5L00_RTROPTP_2_USA-BRIDGE-COLLAPSE.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/1-Trillion-Infrastructure-Where-s-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-05-24T205606Z_1_CBRE94N1M5L00_RTROPTP_2_USA-BRIDGE-COLLAPSE.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Two high-powered senators have upped the ante in the drive to boost spending for highw", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc78a\"", "article_summary": "Even debt-financed infrastructure projects would practically pay for themselves these days, with long-term interest rates so low.\nSen.
