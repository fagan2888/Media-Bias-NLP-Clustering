It asks for reimbursement from insurance companies to help pay for the Fire Department to delivery emergency medical services.\n\nTaking into account medical insurance and the Affordable Healthcare Act, the Salinas Fire Department did a study on what it costs to respond and care for someone on a medical call, said Salinas Fire Chief Ed Rodriguez.\n\nThe cost of having a fire captain, engineer and firefighter/paramedic, as well as costs of apparatus, infection control, emergency medical services oversight, dispatch fees, administrative rates and billing fees were all factored into the total cost of response at $341.74.\n\nAn increase in dispatch costs further bumped up the cost to a $350 flat fee that is now charged for the call, regardless of whether paramedics help treat a broken arm or cardiac arrest.\n\nAfter a medical call, the biller, Wittman Enterprises LLC, sends the insurance company the bill directly, but people may receive a bill from the Salinas Fire Department if, for one reason or another, it wasn\u2019t able to collect the person\u2019s insurance information at the time of the service provided.\n\nIf that occurs, the Fire Department asks you to forward the bill to your insurance company or contact Wittman Enterprises at 1-800-906-6552.\n\nWhile taxes do pay for the Fire Department to respond, the monies that the Fire Department is asking for have been set aside by most insurance companies to help pay for these services, according to Salinas Fire.\n\nThe Fire Department sees this as a way of supplementing taxpayer dollars with money that\u2019s been set aside for the service anyway and to ensure that critical EMS services are always available.\n\nBased on the number of paramedic calls in 2013, officials estimate the first year will net nearly $750,000, and that money will go toward funding the Fire Department, including staffing, training and more.\n\nRodriguez notes that paramedic care is often more cost-effective than care received in a hospital.\n\nThe average ambulance ride is about $4,000, he explained, and the immediate care that paramedics provide can be critical and less costly than hospital care.\n\nThe fee program has always been available, and about 18 different agencies statewide use a similar fee program, including San Francisco and San Mateo, Rodriguez said. Changes with the Affordable Care Act were part of the prompt to make the change.\n\nHowever, it appears that there have been a handful of communication glitches as the program has been implemented.\n\nDespite past outreach to media and residents, some residents have sent inquiries or stopped by the Fire Department to question why they received a bill.\n\n\u201cThe first year is always the most difficult with these programs, and we are committed to working together with all stakeholders, ensuring a fair and compassionate cost recovery program,\u201d said Salinas Fire EMS Officer Scott Houchin.\n\nAn elderly woman living in Salinas, who said she\u2019d rather not be publicly identified, said she called 911 because she felt lightheaded and received a bill for $350. She said she called the number for billing inquiries but didn\u2019t get much response, and the experience has made her hesitant to call again.\n\nResidents who use LifeLine! services are being advised that while they may receive an invoice for services, they are encouraged to contact Wittman Enterprises for special assistance provided for Lifeline clients to get the fee waived. Lifeline is a program run in conjunction with Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital that offers elderly or disabled residents a button to wear as a necklace or bracelet that they can push in the case of an emergency to get help dispatched.\n\nThe city of Salinas has been given a list of Salinas Lifeline! clients as a way to possibly prevent the clients from being billed, according to a letter sent to clients by SVMH.\n\nWhile most commercial health insurance and almost all car insurance policies have coverage for this, Medicare and MediCal don\u2019t cover first responder fees at this time.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has changed the reimbursement process for medical billing, and there\u2019s discussion in the state Legislature to possibly allow the first responder fee to become reimbursable in the future, said Houchin.\n\nIn the meantime, all Medicare and MediCal patients are offered a reduction of the first responder fee or they can have the fee waved when they meet financial hardship criteria, he further explained.\n\n\u201cWe understand that many of the MediCal and Medicare patients meet the financial hardship criteria. They should never be afraid to call 911 in the event of an emergency for fear of receiving a first responder bill,\u201d Houchin wrote in an email. \u201cBy contacting the billing company and completing the required paperwork, there will be a reduction or a forgiveness of fees in every situation for Medicare and MediCal.\u201d\n\nSince most of the fire department\u2019s calls are from Medicare and MediCal clients, the Salinas Fire Department plans to propose to council a way to substantially reduce the fees by half or more for those clients, Houchins said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re listening to all the feedback we\u2019re getting from the community and putting it into perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nNo one is ever asked for information up front, and the biller has a lot of latitude to work with people, Rodriguez said.\n\n\u201cThe goal here is not to ever put someone in the poorhouse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never to move someone into incredible hardship but for us to recoup costs and defray costs of calls that the Fire Department may respond to.\u201d\n\nContact Public Safety Reporter Chelcey Adami at 831-754-4261 or cadami@thecalifornian.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://bit.ly/1RZT67F", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A fee forgiveness program is available for people such as the elderly or poor.", "og": {"site_name": "The Salinas Californian", "description": "A fee forgiveness program is available for people such as the elderly or poor.", "title": "Salinas paramedic billing easing into first year", "url": "http://www.thecalifornian.com/story/news/my-safety/2015/10/22/salinas-paramedic-billing-easing-first-year/74426684/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thecalifornian.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A fee forgiveness program is available for people such as the elderly or poor.", "title": "Salinas paramedic billing easing into first year", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Salinas/B9319391021Z.1_20151022194517_000_GI8CB0D4I.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@salnews", "site": "@salnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=871223774", "fb": {"app_id": 149812628403064}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "salinas fire, salinas, cost recovery program, paramedics"}, "article_summary": "The fee program has always been available, and about 18 different agencies statewide use a similar fee program, including San Francisco and San Mateo, Rodriguez said.\n(Photo: The Salinas Californian)Buy PhotoAs the Salinas Fire Department eases into enforcement of an ordinance approved to to recoup paramedic care costs, officials are reminding the public there are options for anyone who receives a bill for services.\nTaking into account medical insurance and the Affordable Healthcare Act, the Salinas Fire Department did a study on what it costs to respond and care for someone on a medical call, said Salinas Fire Chief Ed Rodriguez.\nThe city of Salinas has been given a list of Salinas Lifeline!\nBuy Photo Salinas Fire paramedics respond to a medical emergency in this 2011 file photo."}
