The investor and television personality added that he\u2019s taking a \u201csizable loss\u201d in the deal that was brokered during Crumbs\u2019 bankruptcy case last year but didn\u2019t name a purchase price.\n\nMr. Lemonis said he made the decision to sell after realizing that he had underestimated his opportunities to grow the business as a minority owner of the company.\n\n\u201cWhen I got into the deal, I was looking to grow the business. I\u2019m in business to be able to affect change,\u201d Mr. Lemonis said Tuesday. \u201cI have a lot of respect for the Fischers, but I miscalculated my ability as a minority stakeholder to affect change.\u201d\n\nFischer Enterprises confirmed the transaction to Bankruptcy Beat and said the operations of the company won\u2019t be affected.\n\nAlthough the deal does means that Mr. Lemonis won\u2019t have any involvement in the company going forward, he is retaining the rights to the Crumbs name for cookies, ice cream and candy products.\n\nHe plans to sell these products at grocery stores mainly through companies he already owns, including Mr. Green Tea and Sweet Pete\u2019s Candy, two brands that Mr. Lemonis featured on his television show CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Profit.\u201d\n\nCrumbs Bake Shop, facing a default on its debt, last summer shut the doors on its 49 stores overnight, laid off nearly 450 employees and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. In the days that followed, Mr. Lemonis announced his interest in the company.\n\nHe teamed up with Fischer Enterprises. Together, they submitted a $6.5 million no-cash, debt forgiveness bid to take ownership of the company. The new owners also agreed to pump $600,000 into the business to cover two months of rent. The bankruptcy court approved the offer last August, which ultimately allowed Crumbs to reopen 24 locations in the Northeast, Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\n-Sara Randazzo contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stephanie Gleason at stephanie.gleason@wsj.com.
