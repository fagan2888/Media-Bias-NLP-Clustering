Law enforcement officials in southern Colorado are searching for people involved in two separate fatal one-vehicle accidents over the weekend in which drivers fled the scene, leaving a deceased passenger.

Alcohol is considered a factor in both crashes.

The first accident occurred early Friday morning in Pueblo when a Cadillac slammed into a power pole at an intersection around 2:30 a.m., according to Sgt. Howard Jackson of the Pueblo Police Department.

Bernadette Trujillo of Pueblo, a 16-year-old who was riding in the car, was found at the scene and pronounced dead, according to Jackson.

“Witnesses reported hearing screams after the crash and reported seeing two males and a female running from the scene,” Jackson said.

Speed and alcohol are believed to be factors in the accident, and police are continuing to search for those involved, said Jackson.

A Facebook page titled ” Never Be Forgotten Bernadette Trujillo” was created Saturday night.

An investigation into the accident is ongoing.

The second crash happened late Saturday in Huerfano County where the Colorado State Patrol says a person crashed a pickup truck into a tree, killing their female passenger before fleeing.

The truck, a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado, was traveling east on Colorado 12 near Cuchara when it left the roadway and collided with a tree before rolling onto its hood, the patrol said in a news release.

Ambre Cassio, 25, of Pueblo, was killed in the one-vehicle crash, the release said. Cassio was not wearing a seat belt.

The State Patrol says the vehicle’s driver is currently unknown, but they have identified Tyler Spinuzzi, 25, of Pueblo, as a person of interest in the investigation of the crash.

“At this time, alcohol use is being suspected as a contributing factor to the crash,” the release said.
