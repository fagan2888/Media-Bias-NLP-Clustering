She also takes a few prescription medications and occasionally sees a psychiatrist and a nutritionist. She can\u2019t get insurance through her partner, because her partner\u2019s employer doesn\u2019t offer benefits to same-sex couples.\n\nAnd, Boudreaux has been skipping mammograms and other check-ups for a few years. \u201cIt\u2019s worrisome,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like gambling. Gambling with my health, and it is very frustrating.\u201d\n\nBoudreaux was hoping to find a better deal on healthcare.gov. Boudreaux has logged on, looked at the plans, and so far, remains largely unimpressed.\n\nShe likes the monthly premiums that she sees but balks at the annual deductibles.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say if I paid the $178 a month, my deductible would be $5,000,\u201d she says. \u201cI would have to pay up to $5,000 before I received any kind of payment from my insurance company.\u201d\n\nAs a comparison, the average deductible for single coverage in employer sponsored insurance is about $1,135, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\nBoudreaux could get a lower deductible if she paid a higher premium, but about $200 a month is all she feels she can afford. She doesn\u2019t qualify for subsidies to help pay for a policy, either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t smoke, I\u2019m relatively healthy, so I was pretty insulted when I saw this [price],\u201d she says. \u201cI was extremely angry actually. I felt hoodwinked by the insurance companies: \u2018Oh here\u2019s this wonderful insurance plan but by the way you need to come up with $6,000 out-of-pocket first before we pay for anything.'\u201d\n\nThat reaction is typical, says Caroline Pearson, an analyst and expert on the new health insurance marketplaces for the consulting firm Avalere Health.\n\n\u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t ever going to get out of that deductible,\u201d says Pearson. \u201cOnly if you have a catastrophic health event or you\u2019re really chronically ill will you ever hit your out-of-pocket cap. People are left, I think, feeling like \u2018I spent a lot of money this year on premium and I didn\u2019t get any meaningful coverage from my insurance.'\u201d\n\nBut Pearson says people forget two things if they just focus on the high deductible. One is that the new plans must offer some free preventive services, like mammograms and yearly physicals. The other is that having a plan protects you from medical bankruptcy if you get in an accident or face something like a cancer diagnosis.\n\nThat\u2019s because Affordable Care Act requires that health plans have a yearly limit on out-of-pocket expenses. If something did happen to Boudreaux, she wouldn\u2019t pay more than $6,350 in the year.\n\nNot As Generous As Workplace Coverage\n\nNevertheless, Pearson points out that the plans sold on the exchange are not as generous as employer-sponsored insurance. The plans have a range of deductibles, depending on which level \u2014 bronze, silver, gold or platinum \u2013 the consumer picks.\n\n\u201cWe think most people are going to be enrolled either in silver or bronze plans, which will cover 60 to 70 percent of a person\u2019s health care costs, and a typical employer plan covers 80,\u201d Peason says. \u201cSo when the law was passed, by definition we knew these plans would be less generous than employer coverage. And that has definitely played out.\u201d\n\nBoudreaux has been managing her health needs without insurance for several years. For her depression, her doctor prescribes her double doses of her psychiatric medicines, which she then cuts in half, and because the meds are generic they only cost her about $40 per year.\n\nBut Boudreaux has considered the possibility that something catastrophic can happen.\n\n\u201cThat is a huge fear. What if \u2026\u201d she says.\n\nIf nothing unexpected happens, she thinks she\u2019d pay less just continuing to go along on her own. And she could put the $200 that would go to the monthly premium into a savings account.\n\nIn any case, Boudreaux doesn\u2019t feel any urgency to sign up right away. She\u2019s been uninsured for a few years, so what\u2019s a month or two more?\n\nWith the holidays coming up, this is one difficult and confusing decision she\u2019d rather just avoid for now.\n\n\u201cWhoa, shut the computer. Find something else to do. There\u2019s something much better I could be doing with my time than trying to figure out this rigmarole of insurance policies and deductibles and what\u2019s covered and what\u2019s preventative and what\u2019s included and blah blah blah,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not very well explained.\u201d\n\nIf Boudreaux does not enroll in a plan by the end of March, her tax penalty would probably be a few hundred dollars \u2013 for the first year. The penalty starts out at $95 or 1 percent of income in 2014 and rises in later years.\n\nThis story is part of a collaboration that includes KUHF, NPR and Kaiser Health News.
