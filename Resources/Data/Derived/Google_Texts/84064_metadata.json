Along with Abedini, Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmat and Nosratollah Khosrawi Roudsari, jailed in Iran on various charges, were also released.\n\nJason Rezian was a correspondent with The Washington Post. He was detained for 18 months.\n\nThe 7 Iranians freed by the US have been named as Nader Modanlou, Bahram Mechanic, Khosrow Afqahi, Arash Ghahreman, Touraj Faridi, Nima Golestaneh and Ali Sabounchi. They were imprisoned due to sanction violations.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry speaking in Vienna, Austria said, \u201cI\u2019m very happy to say that as we speak, we have received confirmation that five Americans who had been unjustly detained in Iran have been released from custody. And they should be on their way home to their families before long \u2013 shortly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President will have more to say about their release later. But I can tell you one thing: While the two tracks of negotiations were not directly related \u2013 and they were not \u2013 there is no question that the pace and the progress of the humanitarian talks accelerated in light of the relationships forged and the diplomatic channels unlocked over the course of the nuclear talks. And certainly in the time since we reached an agreement last July, there was a significant pickup in that dialogue,\u201d Kerry added.\n\nThis announcement was made in conjunction with the implementation of the nuclear agreement made by the Obama administration and the Iranian government.\n\nThe White House has yet to release a formal statement from President Obama, but several Republican presidential candidates weighed in.\n\n\u201cOur prayers have been answered today, as Pastor Abedini will return home to his wife and children in America. Pastor Abedini is an incredibly brave man for risking his life for his Christian beliefs and I am pleased that our government did not sit idly by while an American citizen was persecuted abroad due to religious intolerance,\u201d U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) said in a released statement. \u201cThe United States stands as a beacon of freedom and hope for those across the globe, and as such, we must continue to fight for the safe return of those wrongfully imprisoned abroad based on their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nIn November 2013, Paul was an original co-sponsor of a Senate resolution calling for the government of Iran to immediately release Pastor Abedini. Following the resolution\u2019s passage, Paul issued a letter to President Hassan Rouhani of Iran urging the release of Pastor Abedini. Sen. Paul helped bring attention to this matter and was a fierce advocate for his release.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee in a released statement said, \u201cPraise God that Christian pastor Saeed Abedini has been freed from his eight-year prison sentence for serving the Lord, spreading the Gospel and planting house churches across Iran! I join millions of Americans and his overjoyed wife Naghmeh in saying, \u2018Well done Saeed! You are a faithful servant! And welcome home!\u201d\n\nHuckabee also leveled criticism at the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cBut why did it take the Obama Administration so long to secure his release? He never should have been jailed and it\u2019s embarrassing that John Kerry and Obama negotiate with Iran as innocent Americans remained locked-up in prison. President Obama is a complete fool for trusting a country that\u2019s been lying, cheating, murdering and sponsoring terrorism around the globe for 37 years. Empowering Iran with sanctions relief is like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to Adolf Hitler before WWII hoping he\u2019ll behave. This Iran deal is an insane disaster and this White House has lost its mind,\u201d Huckabee added.\n\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) tweeted:\n\nThankful that prayers have been answered and Pastor Saeed, Amir Hekmati, Jason Rezaian and another American will finally come home. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) January 16, 2016\n\nRubio pointed out more needs to be done.\n\nIran needs to also help locate Floridian Robert Levinson. This hostage-taking must stop. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) January 16, 2016\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie during a town hall meeting in Ames, IA said:\n\nFirst I think, we\u2019re all grateful, at least the reports that we hear this morning, that the Iranians have released our Americans and we have to thank god for that and pray for their safe return and pray for the strength of their families who have put up with them being separated from our country and from their families for a long time. The concern I have, and we don\u2019t know yet, is that the president made a trade. Now, when this president makes trades this is a big problem. This is not a guy I would let negotiate buying a car for me let alone anything else. I mean he makes bad deals and he seems to become an expert at making bad deal with the Iranians. The fact is that we shouldn\u2019t have to trade anything to get our citizens back home. They were taken illegally by a rogue regime of Mullahs over in Iran and this is the problem with this president, he gets no respect around the world. No respect. If we had a president who was respected around the world, we wouldn\u2019t have these folks taken in the first place. Remember the last time we had Iranian hostages again a president that the world did not respect in Jimmy Carter and as soon as Ronald Reagan took the oath of office those Iranians returned our citizens immediately because they knew if they didn\u2019t they would have to face the strength of character and the wrath of Ronald Reagan. We need a president like that in the White House again, who people say understands what the problems are in this country and will fight hard for our citizens. So we have to be grateful that those folks are being sent home but we also have to scrutinize what this president gave away in the process. He\u2019s been trading terrorists from Guantanamo Bay back into the terrorism business. This is an awful thing and this president doesn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased that five American citizens, who were illegally imprisoned by Iran in flagrant violation of longstanding international human rights norms, have finally been released. I am overjoyed for the families and friends of Jason Rezaian, Amir Hekmat, Saeed Abedni and two additional, unidentified Americans,\u201d Dr. Ben Carson said in a released statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, the fact remains that President Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people, our ally Israel and other peaceful nations in the Middle East and around the world. Furthermore, the disastrous agreement will release more than $100 billion to Iran and allow it to continue exporting terrorism around the world and threaten the United States and its allies. If I am elected President, I will withdraw from this dangerous agreement on Day One,\u201d Carson added.\n\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) tweeted:\n\nPraise God! Surely bad parts of Obama's latest deal, but prayers of thanksgiving that Pastor Saeed is coming home. https://t.co/rad1VcWUml \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 16, 2016\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush tweeted:\n\nPrayers answered as American hostages coming home.
