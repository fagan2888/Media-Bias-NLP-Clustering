Steve Beshear (D) is unconcerned about the double-digit rate in his administration\u2019s signature policy.\n\n\u201cSystem-wide averages don\u2019t give a good picture of what an individual\u2019s out-of-pocket costs may be,\u201d Beshear said.\n\nBeshear bypassed the legislature and created Kynect, the nation\u2019s first state-run health-insurance exchange, through an executive order.\n\n\u201cThe rates for private health plans on Kynect have been filed but have not yet been approved or certified, so we don\u2019t yet know what the final numbers will be,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cChanges still may occur, and rates should be finalized sometime in mid-July, but we do expect that some plan rates will go down, some will go up, and some will stay close to the same as last year.\u201d\n\nFinancial Problems Loom\n\nIn May, Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P\u2019s) reported Kynect is in serious financial trouble, especially because no federal bailout money will be provided after 2016, when Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program ends.\n\nS&P\u2019s report indicates the Kentucky Health Cooperative booked an amount of risk corridor receivables, which is money from a risk pool paid out in varying degrees to insurers who collected significantly less in premiums than the cost of providing benefits, equal to 117 percent of its capital. Kentucky had the second highest number of risk corridor receivables in the nation in 2014.\n\nRate Hikes Will Vary\n\nBeshear says rate changes will impact enrollees differently depending on their region, age, household income, and smoking status, and he argues the average numbers don\u2019t specify how much those rate fluctuations may affect individual policyholders.\n\nDespite Beshear\u2019s assurances, all enrollees will pay significantly higher premiums in 2016.\n\nBlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee\u2019s 36.3 percent average premium rate increase will result in increased premiums ranging from 19.5 percent to 59.5 percent. The top end of premium increases in New Mexico, where exchange market leader Health Care Service Corp. is asking for an average hike of 51.6 percent, would be even steeper.\n\nThe current 25 percent increase sought by the Kentucky Health Cooperative would mean the cooperative will have increased rates by 45 percent in Kynect\u2019s first two years of existence.\n\nUnintended Consequences Cited\n\nThe announcement of proposed premium increases arrived at the same time as a recently released report from Families USA, which found one in four people with health insurance plans purchased on government-operated exchanges skip doctor\u2019s visits and important medical tests because of high deductibles. The number is closer to one in three among poorer enrollees, the report says.\n\nJohn Garen, an economist at the University of Kentucky, says the massive regulatory agenda of Obamacare is doing great damage to the health insurance and health care markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating, because it\u2019s like sticking your thumb in a leak\u2014you stick it in and five more leaks pop up,\u201d Garen said.\n\n\u201cIf you want to help people who are poor and sick, ruining the market, as the Affordable Care Act threatens to do, isn\u2019t the way to do it,\u201d Garen said.\n\nGaren says targeted policies are needed, such as funding for high-risk pools or vouchers that serve as private insurance for those in need of a safety net without ensnaring the whole population.\n\n\u201cSuch an approach puts individuals back in charge of their own health care and reduces costs, which is one of the most important steps we can take to get back on the tracks toward a viable and affordable health-care policy,\u201d Garen said.\n\nPolitical Battle over Kynect\n\nKynect\u2019s viability has been a hot topic during Kentucky\u2019s 2015 gubernatorial campaign, which will replace Beshear, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term.\n\nJack Conway, the Democratic nominee, is backed by Beshear and supports Kynect. In contrast, Republican nominee Matt Bevin proposes eliminating Kynect and moving its enrollees to the federal exchange. State Senator Jimmy Higdon (R-Lebanon), who serves on the state Senate\u2019s Health and Welfare Committee, also supports ending Kynect.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need it, and we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Higdon said. \u201cI think that it could be handled through the federal government. The state would save around $30 million a year by not having to operate its own exchange, and it\u2019s not an overwhelming number of people we\u2019re talking about\u2014about 100,000. The federal government, in taking them on, would barely notice, but it would greatly help our state budget.\u201d\n\nHigdon says he supports plans to hold hearings by the state Senate\u2019s Health and Budget Committees in the fall before the legislature begins working on its biennial budget in January.\n\n\u201cGetting information on Kynect from this administration is like pulling teeth,\u201d Higdon said. \u201cI think we would be surprised at what we find this administration has really spent on marketing, advertising, and operating this plan.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Health Care News.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Kentucky Health Cooperative, the largest insurer on Kynect, Kentucky\u2019s Obamacare health insurance exchange, proposed a 25.1 percent health insurance premium rate increase for 2016.\nJohn Garen, an economist at the University of Kentucky, says the massive regulatory agenda of Obamacare is doing great damage to the health insurance and health care markets.\nThe current 25 percent increase sought by the Kentucky Health Cooperative would mean the cooperative will have increased rates by 45 percent in Kynect\u2019s first two years of existence.\n\u201cI think we would be surprised at what we find this administration has really spent on marketing, advertising, and operating this plan.\u201dThis article originally appeared in Health Care News.\nThe top end of premium increases in New Mexico, where exchange market leader Health Care Service Corp. is asking for an average hike of 51.6 percent, would be even steeper."}
