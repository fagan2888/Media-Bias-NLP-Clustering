I feel sorry for the Republican presidential candidates — and I use the term, "presidential," loosely. Once Republicans bought into the tactic of openly disrespecting President Barack Obama from Day One, they set themselves on a course of descent into vulgarity, showing disdain and open hostility to not just the president of the United States, but to their own party members ("GOP candidates in high-stakes chess match in South Carolina," Feb. 17).

They are not fit to govern, and they haven't. The fractures and tears in their so-called Republicanism only serve to further highlight their extreme bigotry, as well as their disregard for the Constitution regardless how much they say they love it.

Now they want to dictate that President Obama's term is already up with no regard to the presidential duties and responsibilities outlined in the document they profess to love so much — the Constitution. Some of these characters act as if they don't know the law and have never had a close encounter with the truth. Maybe they just need some medication!

Thank God for Obamacare. Hopefully, they can take their medical coverage with them when they're voted out of office.
