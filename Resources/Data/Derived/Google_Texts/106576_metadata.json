A number of FedSmith readers have commented that the existing system of requiring a couple to purchase a health benefits plan at the same rate as an entire family is not reasonable. Presumably, these comments are assuming that a \u201cself plus one\u201d option under the FEHB would be less expensive that buying a family plan.\n\nThe process of creating and implementing this self-plus-one option is moving forward. It may not arrive as quickly as many would like but, beginning in 2016, this new enrollment option for the FEHB is scheduled to be in effect.\n\nOPM has issued a Benefits Administration Letter dated March 24, 2014 (displayed below) entitled \u201cSelf Plus One Enrollment.\u201d The purpose of the letter is to announce \u201cthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will be implementing a new enrollment type, Self Plus One, under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. This letter also outlines agency responsibilities for the implementation of the Self Plus One enrollment type.\u201d\n\nThe Self Plus One enrollment type for the FEHB will cover the federal employee or retired federal employee and one eligible family member.\n\nThis means that the annual Open Season for enrolling in the FEHB program or changing plans that starts on November 9, 2015 will include the Self Plus One enrollment type in the available enrollment choices.\n\nOPM also noted that \u201cThe FEHB carriers are taking action to have Self Plus One implemented by September 1, 2015.\u201d\n\nFEHB Self Plus One Enrollment\n\n\u00a9 2016 FedSmith Inc.
