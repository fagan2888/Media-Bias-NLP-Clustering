Regulators want wellness programs to encourage healthy behavior, not push away sick people or high-risk groups.

As one Obama administration agency made headlines Thursday by blessing wellness incentives, other regulators were quietly telling employers and insurers to restrain themselves.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said employers can offer wellness incentives with a value equal to 30 percent of the health benefits package. Earlier, the EEOC had gone to court to object to what many benefits industry players viewed as ordinary, plain vanilla wellness programs.
