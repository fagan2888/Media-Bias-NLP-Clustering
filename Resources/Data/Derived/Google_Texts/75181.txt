Colorado State running back Dee Hart, who ran for 139 yards and two touchdowns in his first game for the Rams Friday night, Monday was named Mountain West Conference offensive player of the week and senior kicker Jared Roberts was named special teams player of the week.

Hart’s 139 rushing yards equaled the top mark for a CSU running back in his first game. Ron Harris ran for 139 on Sept. 14, 1974 at New Mexico.

“I think he’ll be the first to tell you, our team players of the week were the offensive line,” said CSU coach Jim McElwain. “He was the recipient of some great work up front. As you guys know, we lost some really good running backs from a year ago (Kapri Bibbs and Donnell Alexander) and I thought both Dee and Treyous (Jarrells) stepped up and played how we expected them to play. That’s a great honor and believe me, I’m happy as heck for Dee and really that offensive line.”

McElwain helped recruit Hart to Alabama when he was the Crimson Tide’s offensive coordinator before becoming the Rams’coach for the 2012 season. He said he was told many of the Alabama players and coaches watched the CU-CSU game Friday night, the night before Alabama’s win over West Virginia, and he had heard from some of them congratulating him and Hart.

“It’s one thing about the University of Alabama that really kind of makes it a special place,” McElwain said. “Once you’re one of them, you’re one of them forever. . . Dee did a lot of good things for them when he was there, on special teams, and they’ll be the first ones to tell you. They’re really proud of him. They all watched the game because that was their Friday night in the hotel.”

Roberts made all four of his extra points Friday night and made a 52-yard field goal late in the Rams’ 31-17 win over Colorado. He now has been the Mountain West’s special teams player four times in his three seasons with the Rams.
