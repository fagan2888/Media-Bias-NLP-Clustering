The program\u2019s chief executive got forced into resigning, and the legislature wants answers on how taxpayer funds got used to deliver such a broken system. Yesterday, the Star Tribune\u2019s Jeffrey Meitrodt offered an expos\u00e9 of just how much of a surprise the debacle was to MNSure officials, which was, er, not a surprise at all:\n\nThe warning was one of many to surface in a hurried rollout that led to frequent website crashes and ongoing errors that have angered thousands of would-be enrollees, a Star Tribune examination of internal project reports, external audits and hundreds of state government e-mails show. Managers and auditors said for months that the project was falling woefully behind and that critical system tests came too late or had to be curtailed. Among the Star Tribune\u2019s findings: \u2022 Auditors revealed dozens of major problems that were not fixed before the website was launched, state records show, contradicting public statements from MNsure officials that such issues were being handled promptly. Last July, for instance, auditors noted the MNsure website wouldn\u2019t work with some Internet browsers, an issue that lingered through December. \u2022 MNsure didn\u2019t have plans to address website failures, forcing officials to scramble when the system broke down, state records and e-mails show. \u2022 MNsure board members said they were not told about critical audit findings, and were unaware of meetings during which staff members discussed postponing the launch. \u2022 Minnesota officials, who said the federal government\u2019s Oct. 1 deadline to launch the website was \u201cinflexible,\u201d did not know that online enrollment could be postponed without penalty, an option federal officials disclosed in response to Star Tribune inquiries.\n\nThe latter came as a surprise to everyone, including Meitrodt, who describes the reaction in the video on the Strib\u2019s story. No one apparently bothered to ask when Minnesota was required to have its web portal up and running; everyone just assumed the deadline was October 1. That may be true in other states, too, such as Oregon and Hawaii, both of whose web portals did\u2019t work at all by October 1, and Oregon\u2019s still doesn\u2019t work. The federal regulations required states to guarantee that consumers could buy insurance offered on the exchanges, but the transactions themselves could still have been on paper.\n\nThat would have saved Minnesota a lot of headaches, as the website\u2019s failures began to mount. At the very least, one would expect the Dayton administration\u2019s team to have researched the actual regulations for which they were complying before determining deadlines. \u201cI should have asked,\u201d one board member told Meitrodt when the reporter informed him of the situation. Isn\u2019t that what Minnesotans paid him to do in the first place?\n\nApril Todd-Malmlov got forced out of her position at MNSure late last fall after the failure of the system, and this report gives at least one indication why:\n\nFor months last year, Todd-Malmlov had reassured the governor and MNsure board members that no serious obstacles would impede the launch. Dayton said her blunt alarm about the problems plaguing the site \u201ccame as a shock\u201d during the Sept. 19 meeting at his residence. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a Plan B,\u201d Dayton recalled during a recent interview, adding that he \u201cstrongly urged them to fix the problems.\u201d Dayton said he was reassured in the days that followed that MNsure\u2019s website would be \u201cgood enough to go,\u201d but he left the final call to Todd-Malmlov, a health care policy specialist who served as MNsure\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe red flags started popping up long before this, though \u2014 in fact, thirteen months before the rollout. In September 2012, the project leaders knew that the \u201cschedule status had turned to red\u201d because of delivery issues on website components. My May 2013, an outside audit found MNSure meeting standards on one task \u2026 out of 135. By August, the same auditor warned that the system was so far behind schedule that major parts of it would not have time for testing by the October 1 rollout.\n\nSo what did Todd-Malmlov do? Apparently, she never told the board about these audits \u2026 and then took a vacation to the Caribbean in late November while MNSure melted down. Most of the board members contacted by Meitrodt only found out about the outside audits in January, long after Todd-Malmlov got the boot. She maintains that it never occurred to her that the board should have seen the audit results.\n\nThat brings us back to the Dayton administration, which found out 1n September about the impending disaster about to unfold in two weeks. Even though they pronounce themselves as shocked now, what action did they take with Todd-Malmlov when they discovered the problems and the deception? That would be nothing. Todd-Malmlov was Dayton\u2019s responsibility, but Dayton did nothing except leave the project in her hands even though she had just blindsided and \u201cshocked\u201d them with her eleventh-hour report on the system\u2019s upcoming failure. It took four more months after that for the board to find out that the auditors had warned her all along of the failures, thanks to the failure of the Dayton administration to take responsibility in the crisis.\n\nThat\u2019s the takeaway from the Strib\u2019s in-depth report, for which they had to force the Dayton administration to release its documentation. Dayton needs to answer for this debacle.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The surprise was it wasn\u2019t a surprise.", "title": "MNSure debacle: Months of warning about disastrous rollout", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/07/mnsure-debacle-months-of-warning-about-disastrous-rollout/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-07T12:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-07T11:49:53+00:00"}, "keywords": "Mark Dayton, MNSure, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Last July, for instance, auditors noted the MNsure website wouldn\u2019t work with some Internet browsers, an issue that lingered through December.\n\u2022 MNsure board members said they were not told about critical audit findings, and were unaware of meetings during which staff members discussed postponing the launch.\nThe red flags started popping up long before this, though \u2014 in fact, thirteen months before the rollout.\n\u2022 MNsure didn\u2019t have plans to address website failures, forcing officials to scramble when the system broke down, state records and e-mails show.\nManagers and auditors said for months that the project was falling woefully behind and that critical system tests came too late or had to be curtailed."}
