Some are high-quality but seem more apt for box-set gifting on Father\u2019s Day than for actual viewing (\u201cBand of Brothers,\u201d \u201cJohn Adams\u201d). Some are perfectly fine for a tune-in but seem airily inconsequential, a would-be movie script that didn\u2019t clear the bar for studio funding but, with a star on board, could definitely garner an Emmy (\u201cPhil Spector,\u201d \u201cGame Change,\u201d \u201cMrs. Harris\u201d). And then some \u2014 a select few \u2014 take advantage of the intimacy and solitary nature of television viewing in a way that movies, by their nature, cannot.\n\n\u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d airing this Sunday on HBO, is one of those. It\u2019s probably an amateurishly made movie in parts, but that\u2019s beside the point, because it\u2019s great television, and the best movie HBO has broadcast since the similarly sentimental \u201cMildred Pierce.\u201d For something this watchable and moving, one\u2019s willing to forgive a lot.\n\nThe film is an adaptation of Larry Kramer\u2019s play, which was written in the early 1980s and depicts Kramer\u2019s, and others\u2019, own work in the early fight against AIDS, back when the disease was known only as a mysterious gay cancer and when the president, a cosmopolitan Californian with gay friends, refused to speak its name aloud. That the play, and its adaptation, both feature lengthy and sometimes didactic politically minded monologues about gay rights is kind of revelatory. The movie follows one Ned Weeks (played, quite well, by Mark Ruffalo), a fellow we first see declining to doff his shirt at a pre-AIDS Fire Island beach party. Weeks is uncomfortable with other men but very comfortable with the notion of himself \u2014 politically, at least \u2014 as gay, and quickly becomes involved in a fight that hadn\u2019t previously existed at all.\n\nThat Fire Island beach party, which starts the film, presents, at once, the best and worst of \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d directed at great personal expense by Ryan Murphy after years during which Barbra Streisand, who held the film rights, reportedly refused to move forward. Murphy knows from TV: He has an Emmy for directing \u201cGlee,\u201d and his \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d keeps on collecting acolytes. The anarchic, childlike spirit of early \u201cGlee\u201d infuses the opening scene in \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d in which seemingly throwaway details, tossed off in vamping conversation between Weeks and friends played by Jonathan Groff and Taylor Kitsch, actually convey a great deal. And the luridness of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d rears its head as Groff\u2019s character, amid the idyll, begins to cough, and then collapses; later, Ruffalo\u2019s character happens upon a m\u00e9nage in the Fire Island woods that looks like some twisted vision of Eden.\n\nIt\u2019s through these two sets of skills \u2014 \u201cGlee\u2019s\u201d knack for portraying communities coming together, and the \u201cAHS\u201d eye for the horrific \u2014 that Murphy makes a credible movie. When he indulges too far, it\u2019s in overselling the terror of his story. To a generation that didn\u2019t live through the AIDS crisis and to a generation that did, the telltale lesions are upsetting for entirely different reasons. They say enough \u2014 and two scenes, one in a hospital and another on a subway car, in which the camera careens around and the colors go super-saturated, do far too much to hammer us with the horror of AIDS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Glee\" creator has made something great, even despite his directorial excesses", "title": "Ryan Murphy grows up with the stunning, heartbreaking \u201cNormal Heart\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Glee\" creator has made something great, even despite his directorial excesses", "title": "Ryan Murphy grows up with the stunning, heartbreaking \u201cNormal Heart\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/ryan_murphy_grows_up_with_the_stunning_heartbreaking_normal_heart/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/normal_heart2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Glee\" creator has made something great, even despite his directorial excesses", "title": "Ryan Murphy grows up with the stunning, heartbreaking \u201cNormal Heart\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/normal_heart2.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Julia Roberts, mark ruffalo, matt bomer, Ryan Murphy, The Normal Heart", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, Julia Roberts, mark ruffalo, matt bomer, Ryan Murphy, The Normal Heart, Entertainment NewsThere\u2019s perhaps no genre quite as mixed as the HBO movie.\n\u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d airing this Sunday on HBO, is one of those.\nMurphy knows from TV: He has an Emmy for directing \u201cGlee,\u201d and his \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d keeps on collecting acolytes.\nSome are high-quality but seem more apt for box-set gifting on Father\u2019s Day than for actual viewing (\u201cBand of Brothers,\u201d \u201cJohn Adams\u201d).\nThat Fire Island beach party, which starts the film, presents, at once, the best and worst of \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d directed at great personal expense by Ryan Murphy after years during which Barbra Streisand, who held the film rights, reportedly refused to move forward."}
