Not everybody on that team was a Christian. Not everybody believed what I did. Not everybody had the same views. To equate this to gay marriage to me, is really silly.\"\n\nDungy reiterated from his original statement he wouldn't have a problem coaching Sam, although he doesn't intend to \"back down from\" his Christian belief system.\n\n\"I know people will try to make this about my Christian faith. That's not something I'm going to back down from,\" Dungy said. \"But when you go into coaching, you have the responsibility to deliver a good football team to your owner. I've said this many times \u2014 I wouldn't have a problem coaching him. I wouldn't have a problem with him being on the team.\"\n\nIn fact, Dungy oddly referred to cutting someone who is more talented based on their anti-Christian beliefs as ... \"a sin.\"\n\n\"They can read in whatever they want but I think you make decisions as a football coach to bring the best team to your owner and your fans,\" Dungy said. \"As a Christian I think that's my responsibility and if I did anything less that would be wrong and that would be a sin. To keep someone who was a Christian who wasn't as good or help the team as much \u2026 that would be wrong and I've never done that.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tony Dungy appeared on the 'Dan Patrick Show' Wednesday and said gay marriage and football 'have nothing to do with each other.'", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "description": "Tony Dungy appeared on the 'Dan Patrick Show' Wednesday and said gay marriage and football 'have nothing to do with each other.'", "title": "Tony Dungy: Gay marriage, football 'have nothing to do with each other'", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24634267/tony-dungy-gay-marriage-football-have-nothing-to-do-with-each-other", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/cbss/ui5/cbssportsv2_200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tony Dungy appeared on the 'Dan Patrick Show' Wednesday and said gay marriage and football 'have nothing to do with each other.'", "title": "Tony Dungy: Gay marriage, football 'have nothing to do with each other'", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24634267/tony-dungy-gay-marriage-football-have-nothing-to-do-with-each-other", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/cbss/ui5/cbssportsv2_200x200.png", "creator": "@EyeOnNFL", "site": "@cbssports", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297742330311988, "pages": 25902406772}, "vr": {"content_id": 24634267, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "sports news scores information, NFL football MLB baseball NBA basketball live scores news standings teams players, NCAA college basketball football scores news polls rankings, fantasy football news player rankings advice, fantasy baseball basketball news, CBS fantasy sports, golf tennis soccer autos auto racing tour de france, summer winter Olympics, CBSSports.com Sports Line, CBS SportsLine.com", "googlebot": "NOODP"}, "article_summary": "\"Well, gay marriage and who should be on a football team have nothing to do with each other,\" Dungy said.\nTo equate this to gay marriage to me, is really silly.\"\n\"But when you go into coaching, you have the responsibility to deliver a good football team to your owner.\nWednesday he did some more talking, appearing on the Dan Patrick Show to discuss what happened with the original interview and the ensuing fracas and made the point that his beliefs about gay marriage and his beliefs about constructing a football team aren't related.\nDungy reiterated from his original statement he wouldn't have a problem coaching Sam, although he doesn't intend to \"back down from\" his Christian belief system."}
