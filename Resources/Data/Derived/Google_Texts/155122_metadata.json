Give me three very good reasons why you would like to go to Italy.\n\nNow, do the same thing for Portugal.\n\nFind the question difficult to answer? If so, you obviously have not seen Dr. Bob and Nell Seegers lately, because, after their recent trip to Portugal, these experienced travelers have nothing but wonderful things to say about this little country, located on the Iberian Peninsula of Europe.\n\nWhen Bob and Nell first came into my office at Monroe Travel Service and a conversation about river cruising in Europe for an anniversary trip was begun, I seriously doubt if a boat trip on the Duoro River in Portugal was ever on their radar. Yet, after carefully researching the brochures on the different cruise destinations and studying the boats plying the many rivers of Europe, their keen interest in wine and exploring a new country won out. I reserved a nice balcony cabin on Amawaterway's little AmaVida.\n\n\"We had so many nice surprises on this journey,\" admitted Dr. Seegers. \"but Lisbon was really not one of them. I have been to other European cities we liked better, but, amidst all that Old World charm, you sense a definite vibrancy. I was surprised how well educated and sophisticated the general populace was. Why even their taxi drivers spoke pretty good English.\"\n\n\"Unlike in Greece, you could see how, as a nation, Portugal was coming back,\" interjected Nell, \"and it seemed young, hip and fun. In some ways, Lisbon reminded us of San Francisco with all the hills, except it is definitely much older and certainly not as expensive. One of the highlights of our three night pre-cruise stay in Lisbon was a day trip to Sintra. Located about 20 miles from Lisbon, Sintra reflects Portugal's glory days with its extravagant castles, palaces, gardens and homes.\"\n\n\"Lisbon is known for its cafe culture, and Nell and I certainly appreciated that,\" smiled Bob, \"but you can easily get fished out \u2014 especially on cod. I think we had it in any and every way you can get it, which is quite interesting because cod fishing ended centuries ago. All that salted dried cod is now imported from Norway.\"\n\n\"From Lisbon, we traveled to the country's second largest city of Porto, a UNESCO World Heritage site famous for its exporting, where we boarded the AmaVida. I instantly liked the sleek clean lines of the boat,\" said Nell. \"and, because there were only 88 guests, everything seemed to run smoothly \u2014 no hassles, no waiting in line for anything, and the service was excellent. The small, intimate setting also allowed us to make friends easily with people from all over the world.\"\n\n\"From visiting with veteran river cruisers on the AmaVida, we soon learned what a great decision we had made for our anniversary trip. First of all, this river is relatively untouched by the tourist crowds, and everyone commented on how gorgeous the Douro River is. People actually swim in it! Also, because there is no industry along the banks, the views alternate from dramatic granite cliffs, to lush pine forests, to steep terraced vineyards. Unlike other European rivers, the Douro is not set up for nighttime navigation, so the boat travels during the day. This is particularly nice for anyone who loves time on the water.\"\n\nIt is ironic, but, in the world of travel, this area of Portugal is promoted as one of the world's 'up and coming' wine destinations when, actually, the Douro Valley is the oldest demarcated wine region in the world. It is even older than the Bordeaux of France. The Portuguese have been making Port and table wines here for over 500 years!\n\nYet, it was not until the country joined the Common Market or European Union in the 1980's that the production of wine was finally permitted at the individual vineyards instead of the still popular and enormous Port lodges in Vila Nova da Gaia, a delightful little place across the river from Porto. This is where the Seegers enjoyed many of the world's finest Port.\n\nWith the on-site production of wines, a thriving and very unique wine tourism industry was born, and our local couple soon found these wineries or quintas to be one of their favorite aspects of their trip. \"The Douro Valley is definitely not like a visit to Napa or Sonoma where the wineries are well-suited to drop-in visitors, complete with nice elaborate visitor centers and professional guides.\"\n\n\"At the quintas in Portugal, you will probably be meeting with the winemaker himself or his family. In short, it feels like you are visiting a winery, not a tourist attraction. Everything is very laid back but still professional. There is no doubt we will one day return to the Quinta de Pacheca, a charming wine house outside Lamego, which we discovered on our cruise.\"\n\nWe would also spend a few days at the amazing Yeatman Hotel in Porto again, rent a car, and, then, go exploring the wineries in depth with the Quinta de Pacheca as our base,\" confided Mrs. Seegers as she handed me a brochure on this quinta they had fallen in love with \u2014 just in case I had future travelers who might be interested in this wine region.\n\n\"So just what made this Douro River cruise so enchanting?\" I asked.\n\n\"We really liked the relaxing peaceful experience of the river cruise. It was interesting. The food and regional wines served with our meals were always excellent. The cruise director was excellent and kept everything organized. Although we were surprised to realize we sometimes had to travel a distance by bus for shore excursions (the trip to Salamanca, for example, was nearly two hours each way), our guides were always entertaining and the scenery was fascinating.\n\nThe variety in sightseeing choices offered by Amawaterways was impressive. Possibly, our only regret was one day we had to choose either a tour to the Mateus Palace and Gardens, said to be the most beautiful in Portugal, a cork manufacturing plant or a picnic/wine tasting on the grounds of a quinta. Of course, we chose the wine tasting,\"smiled Seegers, \"so we will just have to see the gardens on our next trip to Portugal.\"\n\nJust as a quick review. Old world charm, lots of history, good food, fine wines, interesting sightseeing, and a nice relaxing cruise on a beautiful river, which just happens to be ground zero for Port wine, are all excellent reasons to visit Portugal. As these old established vines are starting to give birth to new and different products \u2014 namely, fine, rich, unfortified wines \u2014 both red and white, the Douro Valley has become the new \"in\" spot for wine connoisseurs.\n\nGet ahead of the crowd. Give me a call and go learn more about the wine renaissance taking place in Portugal.\n\nWho knows? Like the Seegers, you, too, may agree Portugal should be known for much more than its mighty fine Port!\n\nDianne Newcomer is a travel agent at Monroe Travel Service, located at 1908 Glenmar Street, Monroe.
