Vern Buchanan (R., Fla.).\n\nBuchanan, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, participated in a meeting with Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is the son of the newly crowned King Salman, to discuss regional issues and Iranian aggression.\n\nWhen asked by Buchanan and other lawmakers present at the sit-down about the current talks with Iran\u2014which have now passed their March 31 deadline\u2014Salman called the tentative agreement disastrous for the region.\n\nSalman \u201csaid Iran can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d according to a readout provided by Buchanan following the hour-long meeting in Riyadh. \u201cHe questioned why we would be negotiating with the Iranians when they are responsible for growing tension in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nOne foreign policy analyst with extensive contacts in the Middle East told the Free Beacon that regional players are dismayed by the concessions that Washington is willing to make to Iran.\n\n\u201cParties in the region are aghast. It literally seems like there\u2019s nothing the Iranians could do that would convince the Americans Tehran is too hostile and untrustworthy to deal with,\u201d said the source.\n\nSaudi Arabia has criticized the Obama administration\u2019s dealings with Iran, vowing in recent days to pursue its own nuclear weapons program as an avenue to counter the Islamic Republic\u2019s growing influence in the region.\n\nSalman spoke in harsh terms when asked by Buchanan to explain his position on the negotiations.\n\n\u201cI asked the Prince what he thought about the discussions between the U.S. and Iran, and he responded that he doesn\u2019t think the United States is taking the threat posed by Iran seriously,\u201d according to Buchanan. \u201cHe said the Saudis would also like more military assistance from the U.S. to combat Iran\u2019s growing influence in the region.\u201d\n\nSalman and his government are also concerned about ties between Iran and Russia. The two countries recently secured an arms pact that will provide Tehran with advanced weaponry as well as light water nuclear reactors.\n\nAs the talks between Western powers and Iran stretch past a self-imposed deadline with what the parties and sources consider insufficient progress, traditional U.S. allies such as the Saudis, Israel, and France are becoming increasingly exasperated with the Obama administration\u2019s rush to procure an agreement they consider dangerous.\n\nFrance\u2019s expression of reservations about the administration\u2019s stance and concessions prompted diplomatic retaliation from the White House.\n\nConcerns also are mounting on Capitol Hill, where Republicans and a growing number of Democrats are worried that the United States is handing Iran the ability to produce a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cAccepting any agreement that leaves the door open to Iran\u2019s continued pursuit of a nuclear weapon should be a non-starter,\u201d Buchanan said when asked to elaborate on his view of the ongoing talks. \u201cNo deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. should stand strong against any regime that calls for death to America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to let the world know that America is serious about protecting its interests and its allies.\u201d\n\nSources close to leading lawmakers say that they have been shut out of the talks by the Obama administration, which is pushing to tie Congress\u2019 hands.\n\nOne senior congressional aide familiar with Republican thinking on the negotiations recently told the Free Beacon that lawmakers are displeased by what is taking place in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, people here are wondering what the f\u2014k is going on,\u201d said the senior staffer, who would only speak on background. \u201cWhy, after a year of negotiations, are major, consequential issues like whether Iran can keep its stockpile of highly enriched uranium being debated just before the clock strikes midnight?\u201d\n\nDemocrats are also beginning to have reservations about the deal, according to the source.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians seem to be successfully capitalizing on the fact that the administration is in dire desperation mode to get a deal,\u201d the source said. \u201cEven the president\u2019s most loyal Democrats in Congress are finding it near-impossible to defend what appears to be a worse deal than anyone ever imagined.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Concerns mounting on Capitol Hill", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "LAUSANNE, Switzerland\u2014Saudi Arabia\u2019s newly installed defense minister told members of Congress on a recent trip to the oil-rich nation that \u201cIran can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d according to a readout of", "title": "Saudi Defense Minister to Congress: \u2018Iran Can\u2019t Be Trusted\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/saudi-defense-minister-to-congress-iran-cant-be-trusted/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mohammed-bin-Salman-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LAUSANNE, Switzerland\u2014Saudi Arabia\u2019s newly installed defense minister told members of Congress o", "title": "Saudi Defense Minister to Congress: \u2018Iran Can\u2019t Be Trusted\u2019", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mohammed-bin-Salman-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@Kredo0", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @Kredo0LAUSANNE, Switzerland\u2014Saudi Arabia\u2019s newly installed defense minister told members of Congress on a recent trip to the oil-rich nation that \u201cIran can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d according to a readout of the meeting provided by Rep.
