We are able to do things that other people can and can\u2019t do \u2013 just like anybody from around the world,\u201d Burke said in a statement to The National Down Syndrome Society. \u201cNo matter who we are or where we live, give us a chance to do something with our lives so we can look forward to the future.\u201d\n\nThe National Down Syndrome Society estimates that approximately 400,000 Americans have Down Syndrome.\n\nSarah Torre, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Signal that each year, \u201cthousands of parents face the unexpected news that their unborn child could suffer from a serious disability.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegrettably, many children diagnosed with Down Syndrome in particular are more often aborted than carried to term. Some studies suggest unborn children given a Down Syndrome diagnosis are aborted at rates of 61 to even 93 percent,\u201d Torre said.\n\nTorre said that despite challenges, people who live with Down Syndrome can live full and happy lives.\n\n\u201cOften, parents are given a long list of the things their unborn child might not be able to do or the physical and health setbacks they may suffer. Too few hear the stories of hope and joy that come from children who were given the chance to live a flourishing and happy life \u2013 despite physical challenges. Recognizing the worth, dignity, and potential of every human being by upholding the most fundamental human right to life is a founding principle of the United States. We should not exclude the youngest and most vulnerable children from that right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "You might see lots of colorful socks this weekend, wherever you are.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "You might see lots of colorful socks this weekend, wherever you are.", "title": "World Down Syndrome Day Observed with Kindness, \u2018Lots of Socks\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/downsyndromeday.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-20T17:21:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1FNATpk"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "You might see lots of colorful socks this weekend, wherever you are.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/downsyndromeday.jpg"}, "title": "World Down Syndrome Day Observed with Kindness, \u2018Lots of Socks\u2019", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-03-21T03:01:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T17:21:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "World Down Syndrome Day, WDSD, WDSD15, Down syndrome, random acts of kindness, lots of socks"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaaae\"", "article_summary": "In the United States, World Down Syndrome Day will be honored with a \u201cRandom Acts of Kindness\u201d campaign.\n\u201cIt is important to celebrate World Down Syndrome Day on March 21 because there should be a day to celebrate the needs of people with Down Syndrome.\npic.twitter.com/fWVdCV5GNo \u2014 Song Woww (@songwahly) March 12, 2015In honor of World Down Syndrome Day, in a series called \u201cMy Opportunities, My Choices,\u201d Down Syndrome International interviewed individuals with Down Syndrome in 39 countries.\nAccording to Down Syndrome International, World Down Syndrome Day, to be held worldwide Saturday, March 21, is an occasion to \u201cparticipate in activities and events to raise public awareness and create a single global voice for advocating for the rights, inclusion and wellbeing of people with Down Syndrome.\u201dThe date for World Down Syndrome Day, the \u201c21st day of the 3rd month,\u201d was \u201cselected to signify the uniqueness of the triplication (trisomy) of the 21st chromosome which causes Down Syndrome.\u201dSeveral countries began observing World Down Syndrome Day in 2006.\nThis year\u2019s World Down Syndrome Day will be honored through its \u201cLots of Socks\u201d campaign, an initiative encouraging participants to wear brightly colored and unique socks as a conversation piece, allowing the wearer to raise awareness about Down Syndrome."}
