Right now, substitute shortages leave an average of 30 classes a day unfilled, prompting teachers to forgo planning time and other responsibilities to step in.\n\nIn addition, elementary music, art and physical education teachers are sometimes asked to fill in, as are instructors who work in small groups, which hurts students, according to Anne Sullivan, the district's chief of human resources.\n\n\"It affects teaching and learning,\" she said.\n\nAbout 190 of Des Moines' 2,800 classroom teachers are absent on any given day. Substitutes are found most of the time.\n\nBut Andrew Rasmussen, president of the Des Moines Education Association, said the switch could decrease the number of licensed substitutes who have completed a teacher preparation program, which also is required of full-time teachers, and instead increase the number of substitutes with less training. The union does not represent substitutes.\n\n\"We have, as a union, always been against outsourcing the work of public employees to private corporations,\" Rasmussen said.\n\nIn addition, he questioned a move that he believes means less district control on hiring and training decisions.\n\nThe proposal goes before the Des Moines school board at its Tuesday meeting. It was initially placed on the consent agenda, which is typical for management functions, but was pulled to another section to allow more discussion.\n\n\"This could be a viable option, and a viable solution,\" school board chairwoman Cindy Elsbernd said, explaining that companies that work with the district must follow its policies and procedures. \"These are still going to be professional people.\"\n\nIf approved, the plan would start in the fall and cost $854,000 a year.\n\nOutsourcing substitutes\n\nDes Moines competes with suburban districts for substitutes, and Sullivan believes that Kelly Educational Staffing, which district leaders are recommending, would increase Des Moines' competitiveness.\n\n\"I was really impressed by their professionalism and the benefits they offer to subs,\" she said, citing paid orientations, options for health and retirement benefits, as well as bonus and substitute recognition programs.\n\nKelly Educational Staffing is a specialty service of publicly traded Kelly Services. It has contracted with school districts in states such as Texas and Missouri, among others. A company spokesperson could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon.\n\nAccording to the company's website, districts typically contract with them after having difficulty hiring enough substitutes.\n\nOthers make the switch because of the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, the site says. The health care law requires that employees who work 30 hours a week or 130 hours a month have access to employer-sponsored health care benefits. Some substitutes meet that threshold.\n\nBut parents such as Thatcher Williams, president of the parent-teacher organization at Phillips Elementary School, question whether companies concerned about being \"in the black\" would make the same decisions as the district when it comes to hiring substitutes.\n\n\"We all know that one person who we were shocked when they continued to get jobs in a temp agency, because of their lack of effort,\" he said.\n\nStandards unchanged\n\nSullivan said standards for substitutes would remain the same if the contract is approved. Under Iowa law, the district is required to hire substitutes who are licensed and have completed a teacher preparation program, or who have earned an authorization, which allows individuals who have completed a bachelor's degree and a substitute course to be hired.\n\nBackground checks would also continue, as would current pay: licensed substitutes earn $130 a day and teacher associates $79, she said.\n\nOutsourcing substitutes appears to be a solution that was prompted by discussions during union contract negotiations this winter. Union leaders asked for additional pay when teachers are asked to take on additional classes because a substitute cannot be found.\n\nIn addition, Sullivan said there have been more complaints by teachers and principals about the sub shortage.\n\n\"I think they're trying to find a solution,\" said Samy El-Baroudi, a teacher at East High School and the union's treasurer. \"I just don't think it's the right solution.\"\n\nSubstitute license and authorization\n\nSubstitute license: Holders have completed a teacher preparation program and have, or are eligible, for an Iowa teaching license. They may hold long-term subbing positions up to 90 days.\n\nHolders have completed a teacher preparation program and have, or are eligible, for an Iowa teaching license.
