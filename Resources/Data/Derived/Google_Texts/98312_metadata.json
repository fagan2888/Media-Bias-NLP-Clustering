A grand jury in San Francisco on Thursday indicted FedEx Corp. and its subsidiaries with conspiracies to traffic in controled substances and misbranded prescriptions, along with the distribution of these substances and prescriptions originating from illegal Internet pharmacies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, as early as 2004 officials from the DEA, FDA, and members of Congress told FedEx that illegal Internet pharmacies had been selling products through FedEx\u2019s distribution channel. The problem is, FedEx didn\u2019t stop. The company put a safeguard in place \u2014 its Online Pharmacy Credit Policy \u2014 requiring pharmacy background checks. But this measure was loosely enforced. To this day, 97 percent of Internet-run pharmacies are considered \u201crogue\u201d sites, selling fake and dangerous drug products to consumers.\n\n\u201cThe advent of Internet pharmacies allowed the cheap and easy distribution of massive amounts of illegal prescription drugs to every corner of the United States,\u201d U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag said in a press release, \u201cwhile allowing perpetrators to conceal their identities through the anonymity the Internet provides.\u201d\n\nFedEx wouldn\u2019t be held liable for its corporate pill-pushing if it hadn\u2019t known what was hidden in its trucks. But according to the indictment, the company understood its agreement with two illegal pharmacies, the Chhabra-Smoley Organization, from 2000 through 2008, and Superior Drugs, from 2002 through 2010. The indictment alleges FedEx would knowingly delivered prescriptions for these companies, even after they were closed down by state and federal law enforcement agencies \u201cand that their owners, operators, pharmacists, and doctors were indicted, arrested, and convicted of illegally distributing drugs,\u201d explains the U.S. Department of Justice brief.\n\nIn states like Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia, FedEx couriers complained of people storming their trucks for deliveries. They were made to drop off packages in schools and parking lots, instead of home addresses. In response, the company began requiring customers who bought from problematic shippers to pick up their packages at store locations.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical drug abuse is a serious problem affecting millions of consumers in the United States,\u201d said DEA Special Agent in Charge Jay Fitzpatrick. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) agrees. Ease of entry mixed with quick turnaround allows pharmaceutical companies to distribute counterfeit medicine to unwitting consumers. A recent NABP review found 88 percent of rogue sites sell prescription medications without needing a valid prescription. And 60 percent used only a questionnaire for \u201cproof\u201d of diagnosis.\n\nConsumers can protect themselves. The simplest way is to avoid online prescription orders. If you can help it, keep purchases confined to local pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices. If the Internet offers great advantages, stay alert for foreign or suspicious labeling and off-brand product names. Forty-nine percent of the rogue sites in the NABP review sold drugs that weren\u2019t approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Another clue is legitimacy: 62 percent of sites didn\u2019t have a physical address listed.\n\nAt the same time, Internet pharmacies should be able to enjoy consumer trust, DEA\u2019s Fitzpatrick said, but that trust also requires corporate integrity. \u201cWhile DEA is committed to ensuring patients receive legitimate prescriptions,\u201d he said, \u201ctoday\u2019s action should send a strong message that corporations that participate in illegal activity risk investigation and prosecution.\u201d\n\nFedEx\u2019s indictment only signifies that crimes may have been committed. The U.S. judicial system still has to maintain its assumption of innocence. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of five years of probation, and a fine of between $1 and 2.5 million, or twice the gross gain derived from the offense. In this case, that total is at least $820 million.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fedex, indicted, distribution, prescription, drugs, case, highlights, how, internet, sales, can", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "As much as 97 percent of pharmaceutical websites in a recent review sold medicine that carried no formal approval whatsoever.", "title": "FedEx's Illegal Drug Conspiracy Reveals Holes In Internet Safety", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fedex-indicted-distribution-prescription-drugs-case-highlights-how-internet-sales-can-go-wrong", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/18/fedex.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As much as 97 percent of pharmaceutical websites in a recent review sold medicine that carried no formal approval whatsoever.", "title": "FedEx's Illegal Drug Conspiracy Reveals Holes In Internet Safety", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fedex-indicted-distribution-prescription-drugs-case-highlights-how-internet-sales-can-go-wrong", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/18/fedex.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/18/fedex.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-07-18T10:29:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-18T10:29:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "As much as 97 percent of pharmaceutical websites in a recent review sold medicine that carried no formal approval whatsoever."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9d1\"", "article_summary": "At the same time, Internet pharmacies should be able to enjoy consumer trust, DEA\u2019s Fitzpatrick said, but that trust also requires corporate integrity.\nAccording to the indictment, as early as 2004 officials from the DEA, FDA, and members of Congress told FedEx that illegal Internet pharmacies had been selling products through FedEx\u2019s distribution channel.\nA recent NABP review found 88 percent of rogue sites sell prescription medications without needing a valid prescription.\nA grand jury in San Francisco on Thursday indicted FedEx Corp. and its subsidiaries with conspiracies to traffic in controled substances and misbranded prescriptions, along with the distribution of these substances and prescriptions originating from illegal Internet pharmacies.\nBut according to the indictment, the company understood its agreement with two illegal pharmacies, the Chhabra-Smoley Organization, from 2000 through 2008, and Superior Drugs, from 2002 through 2010."}
