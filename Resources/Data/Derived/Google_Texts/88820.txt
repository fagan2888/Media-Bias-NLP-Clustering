The head of the Massachusetts Health Connector — who oversaw both the colossal failure of the state’s Obamacare web site last year and the rebuilding of this year’s portal — will resign later this month, the Patrick Administration announced today.

Executive Director Jean Yang plans to step down Jan. 16, one day after the Health Connector Board’s next meeting.
