R. Martin admits the next book in his \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series won't be out before the next season of HBO's \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nEthan Weston\n\nThe hype never really dies when it comes to George R. R. Martin's fantasy series, \"A Song of Ice and Fire.\"\n\nBut the author did deal a massive blow to that hype Saturday when he announced \"The Winds of Winter\" \u2014 the sixth book in the series \u2014 would not be released before the new season of HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" series. (Video via HBO)\n\nWriting on his blog, Martin announced he had an update on the book but told fans \"you won't like it.\"\n\nThe book isn't done, and he says it isn't likely to be done anytime soon, saying, \"I am months away still ... and that's if the writing goes well. ... I tried, I promise you. I failed.\"\n\nFor the first five seasons of \"Game of Thrones\" book readers have had advanced knowledge of what's in store for the cast of characters. But with this announcement that all changes. (Video via HBO)\n\nAnd Martin says he never anticipated this, \"Look, I never thought the series could possibly catch up with the books, but it has.\"\n\nWhat is certain is that Bran Stark's words at the end of the first trailer for season six seem oddly prescient now. Book readers and show watchers alike really have no idea what's going to happen.
