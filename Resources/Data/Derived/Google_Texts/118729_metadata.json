The Affordable Care Act has limited mechanisms to reign in these costs, but, really, we, the providers of health care products and services, must lead on this issue. We must innovate new, creative, and effective ways to eliminate excessive and unnecessary financial burdens.\n\nWhen it comes to cutting costs, we at AMT/Gordian, consider ourselves trailblazers. Since our inception, we\u2019ve focused on eliminating one major financial drain. Which one? Federal Income Tax. How did we cut it? We never paid any. Is that even legal? Shhhhh, don\u2019t speak.\n\nAmerica\u2019s corporate tax rate is 35%! If something regularly consumed 35% of your budget, wouldn\u2019t you do everything you possibly could to eliminate it? Especially if all it took was some paperwork and a complete lack of ethics? Of course you would. And of course we did, because that\u2019s the AMT/Gordian/New-Name-TBD way.\n\nLet me tell you our story:\n\nAmerican Medical Technologies (\u201cAMT\u201d) was founded in 1994 by Gerald Del Signore. From 1994 until 2007, not only did we not pay any federal income tax, we didn\u2019t even file a single income tax return. This wasn\u2019t because we had no money \u2013 we were pulling in $35 million per year \u2013 but because, as they might say, you can\u2019t spell \u201cmaking millions by evading taxes\u201d without \u201cevading taxes.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, his highness Mr. Del Signore sold AMT in a sham transaction to Gordian, which was wholly owned by him, his wife, and his kid. There\u2019s nothing more American than a family business, right?\n\nOf course, we kept using the AMT name, logo, staff, and resources\u2026 but we changed our corporate name, so it\u2019s cool. Every great innovator changes names when the heat is on: Arthur Anderson consulting became \u201cAccenture\u201d around the time of Enron, Philip Morris is now \u201cAltria,\u201d and even Darth Vader goes by \u201cAnakin Skywalker.\u201d\n\nAll through this whole journey, we continued to evade taxes. (Sure, the IRS is trying to recoup $17 million in back taxes and liabilities, but, pfft, like they have the resources to do it? Ha).\n\nFrom our very unbiased and not-at-all-perverse perspective, those 17 million dollars are actually \u201chealth care cost savings.\u201d You\u2019re welcome, America.\n\nAnd consider this: By not even filing taxes for 13 years, we also saved hours of labor costs for the cash-strapped IRS. So it\u2019s a win-win-win all around.\n\nFurthermore, had we actually paid our taxes, losing all that money would have made us sick to our stomachs. Which, of course, would have required medical attention. Which would have raised health care costs. Which would have caused us to earn more money, and pay more taxes, and feel worse, and get more medical attention, etc. ad infinitum. So, if we had done what was legal and ethical and right, it would have started a vicious cycle that would have destroyed the America we love and so faithfully exploit.\n\nHere at AMT/Gordian/Whatever-Shell-Corporate-Name-Is-Next, we\u2019ve always operated under one core philosophy: \u201cWhat\u2019s good for our company \u2013 and its sole owner and his family\u2013 is good for America. Probably.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d you might ask, \u201cbut what about the lost tax revenue?\u201d We believe being broke will motivate Americans to work harder, and manual labor is exercise, and exercise improves health so\u2026 Boom! More health care savings right there. We at AMT/Gordian/All-Hail-Satan never stop giving. I mean, we never stop taking. Whatever, giving, taking, who can tell the difference?\n\nBottom line: Our bold and ridiculous tax evasion has been good, patriotic public policy because it sort of, kind of cuts health care costs. I\u2019m sharing our strategy with you because if there are enough dishonest, disreputable, and shameful cheaters, they won\u2019t be able to catch us all.\n\nYours in disrepute,\n\nJeff Kreisler\n\nChief Satirist\n\nNot-AMT/Not-Gordian", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2128\"", "article_summary": "From 1994 until 2007, not only did we not pay any federal income tax, we didn\u2019t even file a single income tax return.\nBottom line: Our bold and ridiculous tax evasion has been good, patriotic public policy because it sort of, kind of cuts health care costs.\nSkyrocketing health care costs are a major public policy issue.\nFederal Income Tax.\nWhich would have raised health care costs."}
