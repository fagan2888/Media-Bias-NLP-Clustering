During their morning commute, passengers let out collective oohs and aahs, then went almost silent as the train flew past the Las Vegas Convention Center\u2019s Silver Lot. There, colorful cranes in red and white, black and school bus yellow are stretched as high as their reach will allow, and oversized booths designed to hold the largest construction machinery have invaded the space.\n\nThrough Saturday, ConExpo-Con/Agg occupies 2.5 million square feet, or every available inch of the Las Vegas Convention Center. The show, produced by the Association of Equipment Manufacturing, expects about 125,000 attendees who will create an estimated nongaming economic impact of $157.3 million to the city, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.\n\nCompared with the show three years ago, registration already is tracking ahead for the 2014 show. About 2,500 companies are exhibiting at ConExpo-Con/Agg, which comes to Las Vegas every three years. The show is collocated with the 2014 IFPE expo for fluid power, motion control and power transmission.\n\n\u201cBoth shows are the largest they have ever been,\u201d said Megan Tanel, vice president of exhibitions for the Association of Equipment Manufacturing.\n\nThe convention\u2019s so big this year that registration has been housed at the LVH. And, on Tuesday morning, the hotel\u2019s convention area was bombarded by thousands of people who either didn\u2019t preregister or didn\u2019t receive their badges in the mail. Once inside the LVH pavilions, the throngs extended into the casino from deep inside the property\u2019s convention center.\n\nNew to the show this year is the Platinum parking lot area that\u2019s housing 387,000 square feet of equipment. At Caterpillar\u2019s outdoor park in the Gold Lot, faux grass, black park benches, flowers, curbing and stone planters work together to make the area look like a permanent construction park where giant Caterpillar machines go to rest after a hard day\u2019s work.\n\nToo bad it will all be taken down starting Saturday.\n\nUntil then, the area is home to a number of machines, one of them the brand- new, 38,450-pound 586C site prep tractor with 350 horsepower. This shiny new toy features a bright orange front end and black tires that are about 5 feet high, or eye level for some of us. Side steps needed to enter the cab almost reach to chest level.\n\nNearby, JLG Industries\u2019 orange and cream-yellow lifts, including compact crawlers and boom lifts, were being displayed. Just beyond, JCB was making a big splash with its booth that included an area devoted to its dancing diggers, equipment choreographed to perform to a group of violinists. Outside the performance area, the brand\u2019s bright-yellow and black machines were positioned on soft black turf, while a wooden walkway provided a runway for potential customers to easily access the business center.\n\n\u201cA lot of our customers come to the show, and a lot of big construction equipment customers use this as a buying opportunity because they can compare like units from different brands,\u201d said Bob Cannady, general manager of Flaska JCB, a dealer for the Phoenix-based brand. \u201cIt\u2019s a selling show. It\u2019s a very good show to be at to meet new customers as well.\u201d\n\nThus far, Cannady said the show is very well-attended from what he\u2019s heard. Globally, JCB has the No. 1 selling backhoe, which it invented. In the United States, John Deere and Caterpillar hold the market share.\n\n\u201c(JCB is) a local player really trying to crack into the U.S. market,\u201d Cannady said.\n\nElsewhere, Fassi was exhibiting its line of cranes, while Allu was showing its new DL series screening buckets for compact machines. Gunnebo Johnson, a Swedish company, was celebrating its 250th birthday. Gunnebo is a manufacturer of grade 80 and 100 alloy chains and fittings, crane blocks and wire rope shivs. The company\u2019s showing a new system on its crane blocks called Flexiweight that changes the weight carried from a few thousand pounds to upward of 20,000 pounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important because a lot of the cranes have longer boom lengths now and so we\u2019re able to match the needs of the block with the boom length,\u201d said Joe Bridgeman, vice president of sales and marketing for the USA. \u201cWe can also cut down the number of truckloads to the job site. We know weight is money.\u201d\n\nBridgeman said he\u2019s excited for the show\u2019s business possibilities.\n\n\u201cFolks are excited to be here compared to three years ago. They\u2019re in a much more optimistic mood,\u201d he said.\n\nConExpo-Con/Agg 2014 runs through Saturday and is open to industry only.\n\nContact reporter Laura Carroll at lcarroll@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4588.
