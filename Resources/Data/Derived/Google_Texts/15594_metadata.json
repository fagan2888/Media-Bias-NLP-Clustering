David Byrne has been friends with Worrell for a long time \u2014 the two collaborated on the Talking Heads\u2019 Stop Making Sense as well as some of Byrne\u2019s personal projects \u2014 and he was one of a group of musicians to perform at a benefit show at New York City\u2019s Webster Hall last night. Organized and led by Nona Hendryx, the Black Rock Coalition, and Sweet Relief, the fundraiser also featured appearances by Bootsy Collins, George Clinton, Living Colour, Jonathan Demme, Meryl Streep, Rick Springfield, Maceo Parker, Steve Scales, Bill Laswell, Mudbone, Fred Schneider, Bernard Fowler, Leo Nocentelli, Ronny Drayton, Melvin Gibbs, Jerry Harrison, Screaming Headless Torsos, The Woo Warriors, Sarah Dash, Nelson George, Marc Ribler, Paul Shaffer, and Black Rock Coalition Orchestra.\n\nIn addition, Byrne remixed \u201cHow Does The Brain Wave?,\u201d a song he co-wrote with Worrell, and shared Jamie Liddell\u2019s remix of the song as well. Physical editions of both remixes are being auctioned off and you can digitally download the tracks now. All of the proceeds will go toward Worrell\u2019s Sweet Relief fund. Byrne said the following via his website:\n\nIn a better world, we shouldn\u2019t feel the need to do this. Obamacare is a step, but the U.S. health system needs fixing bigtime. Relative to all the industrialized countries of the world, the U.S. remains the only country without universal coverage AND it\u2019s the most expensive. Ernest Adams writes on Quora about his experience in UK: \u201cHaving lived under both systems I cannot find the words to express the relief at knowing that I will get care no matter how sick I get, no matter how much it costs, and no matter whether I\u2019m rich or poor.\u201d If the U.S. had Canada\u2019s healthcare system, 5,400 fewer babies would die in infancy, and we\u2019d save about $1.3 trillion dollars in healthcare spending. (But, in Canada there longer wait times for ER, etc.) But, here we are.\n\nCheck out photos and videos from last night\u2019s benefit show below.\n\nThe amazing Meryl Streep at tonight's Bernie Worrell Benefit.
