It is the first time a government panel has endorsed such a drug. The move surprised many experts, because the Food and Drug Administration has twice rejected the drug due to lackluster effectiveness and worrisome side effects.\n\nThe FDA will make a formal decision later this summer. But many analysts say the panel\u2019s backing could clear the way for the first drug approved to treat a female sexual disorder. Drugmakers have been trying to cultivate that market since the blockbuster launch of Viagra for men in the late 1990s. Ahead of this week\u2019s meeting, women\u2019s groups and other advocates lobbied for the pill\u2019s approval, saying women\u2019s sexual problems have been overlooked for too long by the federal government.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the pill flibanserin from Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which some have dubbed \u201cFemale Viagra.\u201d\n\nHow does the drug work?\n\nFlibanserin acts on brain chemicals associated with mood and appetite, similar to antidepressant drugs. In fact, it was originally studied as a treatment for severe depression before being repurposed into a libido drug. It\u2019s not entirely clear why flibanserin increases sexual desire but researchers point to its ability to increase dopamine \u2014 a brain chemical associated with appetite \u2014 while lowering serotonin \u2014 another chemical linked with feelings of satiation.\n\nWho would take this drug?\n\nSprout wants to market the drug to premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, described as a lack of sexual appetite that causes emotional distress.\n\nSurveys estimate that between 5.5 million to 8.6 million U.S. women have the condition, or roughly 8 to 14 percent of women ages 20 to 49. Because so many other factors affect sexual appetite there are a number of alternate causes doctors must rule out before diagnosing the condition, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and mood issues caused by other medications like sleeping aids and painkillers.\n\nThe diagnosis is not universally accepted and many psychologists argue that low sex drive should not be considered a medical condition.\n\nIs the drug effective?\n\nExperts usually describe flibanserin\u2019s effect as \u201cmodest.\u201d In company studies, women taking flibanserin reported a slight increase in sexually satisfying events each month. Their answers to separate questionnaires indicated they experienced a slight increase in desire and a slight decrease in stress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Q&A: Female sex pill makes comeback with positive panel vote", "title": "Q&A: Female sex pill makes comeback with positive panel vote", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Q&A: Female sex pill makes comeback with positive panel vote", "title": "Q&A: Female sex pill makes comeback with positive panel vote", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/06/qa_female_sex_pill_makes_comeback_with_positive_panel_vote/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/female-sex-pill-fda.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Q&A: Female sex pill makes comeback with positive panel vote", "title": "Q&A: Female sex pill makes comeback with positive panel vote", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/female-sex-pill-fda.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Perrone", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Their answers to separate questionnaires indicated they experienced a slight increase in desire and a slight decrease in stress.\nAhead of this week\u2019s meeting, women\u2019s groups and other advocates lobbied for the pill\u2019s approval, saying women\u2019s sexual problems have been overlooked for too long by the federal government.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsWomen suffering from low libido got some hope this week when a panel of health experts said the government should approve an experimental pill intended to boost sexual desire.\nExperts usually describe flibanserin\u2019s effect as \u201cmodest.\u201d In company studies, women taking flibanserin reported a slight increase in sexually satisfying events each month.\nSprout wants to market the drug to premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, described as a lack of sexual appetite that causes emotional distress."}
