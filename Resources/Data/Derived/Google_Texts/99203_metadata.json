Here are some thing to do in Denver when you're president. (Tom LeGro and Natalie Jennings/The Washington Post)\n\nEducation, health care, loans and wages were all on the menu for President Obama Tuesday night. Arriving in Denver to kick off his three-day \u201cthe bear is loose\u201d tour, Obama dined with five ordinary Americans who wrote to him about their everyday concerns. The dinner was carefully orchestrated, an attempt to show the president as a leader in touch with his country. The only misstep came from a man wearing a horse mask and someone who offered him a \"hit.\"\n\nThe entourage arrived at the Wazee Supper Club, which TripAdvisor gives a four star rating, just before 7 p.m. The table was set up for pizzas and the letter writers were sinking beers while waiting for their illustrious guest. Although the White House said Tuesday the president would be dining with \u2018Alex,\u2019 some more folks were rounded up, all of whom were eager to eat pizza and chat with Obama.\n\nThe mystery Alex turned out to be Alex Dooley, a graduate of the University of Arkansas who works at a furniture upholstery store in Denver. She wrote to the president earlier this year, thanking him for calling on businesses in his State of the Union address to increase the minimum wage, which resulted in a voluntary rise from her boss -- even though Alex didn't watch the speech herself.\n\nAlex Dooley, a worker at a furniture upholstery store in Denver who says she received a raise after President Obama's State of the Union address encouraging an increase in minimum wage, introduced the president before his speech on the economy on Wednesday.

Cooper has federal loans and occasional financial assistance from her parents, yet still struggles to make ends meet.\n\nEntrepreneurs Carolyn Reed and David Johnson also joined, thanking Obama for the opportunity to expand their chain of sandwich shops through an Small Business Administration loan. The pair now owns six branches of Silver Mine Subs in Denver. Reed also thanked the president in for the Affordable Care Act \u2013 both Reed and Johnson are enrolled in the Colorado state exchange.\n\nFinally, teacher Leslie Gresham rounded off the party. A mother of two who has been in education for 26 years, Gresham wrote to the president to stress the importance of early childhood education. Gresham, who has been awarded early childhood educator of the year, explained to the president the difference she has seen in children who'd enjoyed early exposure to education.\n\nSadly, the press pool was kicked out of the restaurant after five minutes, so most of what the group discussed remains a mystery. \"I'm so glad you're here,\" Obama said when he arrived at the restaurant. For a group of Denver residents who simply wrote letters to the White House, they probably were too.\n\nSpeaking in Denver\u2019s Cheesman Park this morning, the president said he receives 40,000 pieces of correspondence everyday \u2013 ten of which he usually reads. Referring to his pizza dinner last night and emails and letters he receives, Obama said \u201cthey reminded me why I ran for office and what I\u2019m supposed to be doing every single day...every day I receive these thousands of acts of hopes from you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arriving in Denver to kick off his three-day \u201cthe bear is loose\u201d tour, Obama dined with five ordinary Americans.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Arriving in Denver to kick off his three-day \u201cthe bear is loose\u201d tour, Obama dined with five ordinary Americans.", "title": "Dinner in Denver, pizza with the president", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/07/09/dinner-in-denver-pizza-with-the-president/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-07-09/Getty/TS-Hkg10038481.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SebastianEPayne"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/07/09/dinner-in-denver-pizza-with-the-president/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama denver, obama alex, obama dinner, obama pizza dinner", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama denver, obama alex, obama dinner, obama pizza dinner"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd159c\"", "article_summary": "President Obama visited Denver on the first leg of a three-day trip to tout economic gains, fundraise and meet with ordinary citizens.\n(Tom LeGro and Natalie Jennings/The Washington Post)Education, health care, loans and wages were all on the menu for President Obama Tuesday night.\nHere are some thing to do in Denver when you're president.\nThe dinner was carefully orchestrated, an attempt to show the president as a leader in touch with his country.\nA mother of two who has been in education for 26 years, Gresham wrote to the president to stress the importance of early childhood education."}
