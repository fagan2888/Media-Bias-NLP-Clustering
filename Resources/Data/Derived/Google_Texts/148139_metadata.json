These hearings follow the rapid rise in managed care merger announcements and the ongoing consolidation of hospitals and physician practices. Three additional fall hearings will focus on insurer, hospital and physician practice mergers. The Senate Antitrust Subcommittee will hold a hearing next week on health plan mergers. The House hearing was essentially a platform for hospital and physician groups to oppose insurer mergers and criticize one another, as each constituency circled the wagons to protect their own interests.\n\nInsurance merger opponents testified that mergers would eliminate two of the five largest national insurance companies and threaten to reduce competition by creating narrower provider networks and inhibiting new entrants. The subcommittee Chairman questioned whether Medicare reimbursement rates have driven hospitals to buy physician practices, which has led to reduced competition and higher costs for the same services in a hospital setting rather than in a doctor\u2019s office. The American Medical Association (AMA) wants physicians to have the ability to remain independent if they choose and called for clear antitrust rules so physicians can avoid \u2018financial integration\u2019 with hospitals. The AMA also asked to rescind the ban on physician-owned hospitals to enable more hospital competition. The AMA said that disparate payment systems make it difficult for independent physicians to compete with hospitals which are in a better position to negotiate with insurance companies and can obtain supplies and services at lower costs. Hospitals say competition is robust, that hospital costs are legitimately higher and that insurers are pressuring their reimbursement rates.\n\nFinally, the insurance lobby, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), said insurance mergers can have pro-competitive effects and should be looked at on a case-by-case basis. AHIP said consolidation could facilitate new and better products and services while enabling operating cost efficiencies that reduce premiums. AHIP said the industry will offer more high-value products, bundled payments (reimbursements on an episode-of-care basis rather than traditional \u2018fee for service\u2019), and accountable care models tailored to meet the needs of patients. Naturally, AHIP blamed of rising prices on providers and hospital mergers.\n\nOur view is that all three groups make valid arguments. Healthcare service consolidation \u2013 among hospitals, physician practices, insurers, as well as branded and generic biopharmaceutical manufacturers, drug distributors, and device makers \u2013 is a result of inevitable competitive forces and the incentives of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Patients, in fact, stand to benefit both clinically and financially from the market and regulatory forces at work leading to a continuum of care that requires providers\u2019 and payers\u2019 clinical and financial integration. What is needed now are reasonable antitrust reviews driven by an understanding of clinical integration, and clear financial incentives and payments based on efficiency and quality. In fact, managed care mergers may offer the best hope of curtailing the drug makers\u2019 and hospitals\u2019 pricing power, particularly as managed care medical cost margins are largely regulated. Recently, the head of California\u2019s public health insurance exchange, the largest state exchange under ACA, stated that insurance industry consolidation \u201ccould lower prices for consumers by offsetting the bargaining power of healthcare providers.\u201d\n\nWe believe that antitrust regulators will examine all sides of the pending insurance mergers. This means hearing from state insurance commissioners and CMS, the federal agency that runs Medicare, especially in connection with the Medicare Advantage managed care program through which more than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries get their health coverage. While managed care investing is never for the faint of heart (especially now under the merger reviews), uncertain outcomes can lead to risks well worth taking. Managed care offers largely domestic revenue exposure, strong cash generation, reasonable debt levels and investment income offsets to interest rate increases, as well as no exposure to China\u2019s economic slowdown or critical Supreme Court decisions.
