The Chicago Crime Commission planned to formally restore the title to Guzman this week.\n\nSeveral U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices have indicted Guzman on federal trafficking charges, including in Chicago, where more than a dozen Guzman lieutenants have been successfully prosecuted and imprisoned. The U.S. had said after Guzman\u2019s 2014 capture that it would file an extradition request, though it\u2019s unclear if that already happened.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dismay in US over Guzman\u2019s escape from Mexican prison", "title": "Dismay in US over Guzman\u2019s escape from Mexican prison", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Dismay in US over Guzman\u2019s escape from Mexican prison", "title": "Dismay in US over Guzman\u2019s escape from Mexican prison", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/dismay_in_us_over_guzmans_escape_from_mexican_prison/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/mexico-drug-lords-glance.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dismay in US over Guzman\u2019s escape from Mexican prison", "title": "Dismay in US over Guzman\u2019s escape from Mexican prison", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/mexico-drug-lords-glance.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Tarm", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. had said after Guzman\u2019s 2014 capture that it would file an extradition request, though it\u2019s unclear if that already happened.\n\u201cIt is a shock that the most dangerous cartel leader in the world has escaped,\u201d Peter Bensinger said Sunday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Mexican prisons are not equipped to hold Guzman,\u201d said John Pastuovic.\n\u201cHe ought to have been housed in an American prison.\u201dThe Chicago Crime Commission, an influential crime-fighting group, said the prison break meant Guzman will regain his title as Public Enemy No.\nThe Chicago Crime Commission planned to formally restore the title to Guzman this week."}
