Raw oysters.\n\nMarler says he has seen more foodborne illnesses linked to shellfish in the past five years than in the two preceding decades. The culprit: warming waters. As globally waters heat up, it produces microbial growth, which ends up in the raw oysters consumers are slurping down.\n\n2. Precut or prewashed fruits and veggies.\n\nMarler says he avoids these \u201clike the plague.\u201d Convenience may be nice, but, as more people handling and processing the food means more chances for contamination, it isn\u2019t worth the risk.\n\n3. Raw sprouts.\n\nSprout outbreaks are surprisingly common, with more than 30 bacterial outbreaks (primarily salmonella and E. coli) in the past two decades.\n\n\u201cThere have been too many outbreaks to not pay attention to the risk of sprout contamination,\u201d Marler says. \u201cThose are products that I just don\u2019t eat at all.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 15 Worst Supermarkets In America\n\n4. Rare meat.\n\nSorry, chefs: Marler isn\u2019t going to order his steaks any rarer than medium-well. According to the expert, meat needs to be cooked to 160 degrees throughout to kill bacteria that could cause E. coli or salmonella.\n\n5. Uncooked eggs.\n\nFor anyone who remembers the salmonella epidemic of the 1980s and early '90s, this is a no-brainer. According to Marler, the chance of getting food poisoning from raw eggs is much lower today than it was 20 years ago \u2014 but he still isn\u2019t taking any chances.\n\n6. Unpasteurized milk and juices.\n\nA growing movement is encouraging people to drink \u201craw\u201d milk and juices, arguing that pasteurization depletes nutritional value. Marler says pasteurization is not dangerous \u2014 but raw beverages can be, as skipping the safety step means an increased risk of contamination by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no benefit big enough to take away the risk of drinking products that can be made safe by pasteurization,\u201d he says.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Business Insider.
