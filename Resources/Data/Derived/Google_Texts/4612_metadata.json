The nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer said he hasn\u2019t looked at the analysis in \u201csome time\u201d and thus was unsure of where along the constitutional spectrum the order is permitted.\n\nThe surprising admission came after Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) grilled Holder for several minutes on the constitutional limits of executive orders and the executive branch during a Senate hearing on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I have not seen \u2014 I don\u2019t remember looking at or having seen the analysis in some time, so I\u2019m not sure where along the spectrum that would come,\u201d Holder replied after Lee pressed him about the employer mandate delay.\n\nLee came prepared, prefacing his question with an explanation of the standard legal test for executive orders. The test, first discussed by Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, argues the president\u2019s authority to issue executive orders is strongest when he \u201cdoes so with the backing of Congress (category one), more dubious when he issues an order pertaining to a topic on which Congress has not passed a law (category two), and weakest when the executive order is \u201cincompatible with a congressional command\u201d (category three), to use Lee\u2019s paraphrase,\u201d the Washington Examiner reports.\n\nAfter Holder\u2019s \u201cnot sure\u201d answer regarding the employer mandate, Lee asked about the president\u2019s constitutional authority to unilaterally raise the minimum wage for federal contractors.\n\n\u201cAgain, without having delved into this without any great degree\u2014\u201c Holder began.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re the attorney general, I\u2019m sure he consulted you,\u201d Lee interrupted.\n\nHolder admitted there have been consultations with the Justice Department. He said the minimum wage executive order would probably fall under category one and relates to the president\u2019s ability to regulate things that involve the executive branch.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a constitutional basis for it, and given what the president\u2019s responsibility is in running the executive branch, I think that there is an inherent power there for him to act in the way that he has,\u201d Holder said.\n\nLee then asked Holder about the president\u2019s decision to unilaterally delay Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate a second time \u2014 and he got the same answer.\n\nWatch the tense exchange below:\n\nAfter Lee was done questioning Holder, he proceeded to lecture the attorney general on the importance of ensuring no one person in government is allowed to accumulate too much power.\n\n\u201cThis is very, very important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be very helpful for you to release legal analysis produced by the office of legal counsel or whoever is advising the president on these issues. It\u2019s imperative within our constitutional system that we not allow too much authority to be accumulated in one person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we have a Constitution, is to protect us against the excessive accumulation of power.\u201d\n\nIn response, Holder argued that Obama would never abuse his executive authority and act outside of the Constitution. He also claimed that President Obama has utilized executive orders less than his predecessors.\n\n\u201cGeneral Holder, I respectfully, but forcefully, disagree\u2026\u201d \u2013 Sen. Mike Lee Share:\n\n\u201cGeneral Holder, I respectfully, but forcefully, disagree with the assertion \u2014 if this is what you\u2019re saying \u2014 that because the number of executive orders issued by this president might be comparable to the number of executive orders issue by previous presidents, that that means he hasn\u2019t made more use of it than other presidents have.\u201d\n\nLee said looking at the \u201cnature\u201d of Obama\u2019s use of executive orders, it is clear the president has \u201cusurped an extraordinary amount of authority within the executive branch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not precedented,\u201d he concluded. \u201cAnd I point to the unilateral delay, lawless delay in my opinion, of the employer mandate as an example of this. At a minimum, I think he owes us an explanation of what his legal analysis was.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 44, "twitter": {"description": "Attorney General Eric Holder was unable to explain to Congress why President Barack Obama was within his constitutional limits when he issued an executive order to delay Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate.
