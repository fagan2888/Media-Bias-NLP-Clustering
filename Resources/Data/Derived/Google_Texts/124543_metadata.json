Scapegoats like almonds, alfalfa and meat. Really. What Big Labor did to the Motor City the environmental extremists are doing to California, threatening to create a new Dust Bowl with their misguided water policies.\n\nEven now, environmentalists don\u2019t want solutions. California\u2019s 840-mile Pacific coastline offers prospects of mass desalination, which is used successfully in many parts of the globe. But the radical left abhors that idea. Just as they\u2019ve blocked use of abundant fresh water supplies, they also keep filing lawsuits to block a $1 billion desalination plant scheduled to be completed this autumn near San Diego.\n\nWhat irony! Natural drought helped build the Golden State. Now man-made drought threatens to tear it down.\n\nThe Golden State\u2019s historic growth to today\u2019s 39 million in population is sometimes credited to the Gold Rush of 1849. But the largest single migration was in the 1930s, when over 3 million people evacuated states like Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas and part of Texas to escape the Dust Bowl. The largest group headed west to California.\n\nWhat one Dust Bowl gave, a new Dust Bowl may take away.\n\nWater is essential to any society, so users compete for it with money, votes and power, subjecting it to massive government regulation.\n\nDespite the state\u2019s current major drought, California does not lack water. However, that water is not usually in the places where people want to use it. Government has rerouted massive amounts of water while declaring other sources \u201coff-limits.\u201d Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s approach is deceptive when it claims to mandate a 25 percent reduction in using water. It is not riddled with loopholes. The Democratic governor\u2019s order is only the latest confusion brought on by a maelstrom of government controls. Every look into that whirlpool makes you dizzy.\n\nHalf the water for Los Angeles comes by aqueduct from the Owens Valley over 200 miles away, a diversion that began in 1913. The current statewide drought is nothing compared to how dry the Owens Valley has been for over a century because LA takes its water. How LA acquired these water rights was fictionalized \u2014 somewhat \u2014 in the 1974 movie \u201cChinatown.\u201d Since then, parched and angry farmers have used both the courts and dynamite trying to get back some of their valley\u2019s water.\n\nBefore getting the Owens Valley water, Los Angeles had 300,000 people and no movie industry. With that water, LA\u2019s metro area has grown to over 13 million people \u2014 including Hollywood, Disneyland and, of course, those beaches.\n\nToday\u2019s competition for water is not merely between different areas and different uses. It\u2019s also a fight of man versus beast \u2014 if the delta smelt can be called a beast.\n\nThis is perhaps America\u2019s strangest fish story because it involves not catching a big one but allegedly saving a small one. Protecting the habitat of the 2- to 3-inch fish has been a major reason for blocking badly needed reservoirs and irrigation systems. There are reports that 4.5 million acre-feet of fresh water are blocked each year to protect the delta smelt (with a lesser amount to protect salmon). Some groups calculate that the majority of California\u2019s fresh water is placed off-limits by environmental policies.\n\nWith artificial scarcity comes real infighting over the available water. Many complain that California\u2019s agriculture consumes too much, and they are angry that Governor Brown\u2019s \u201c25 percent cut\u201d exempts agriculture \u2014 the single largest user of water, claiming, by one estimate, 80 percent of the state\u2019s water resources compared to 14 percent by residential users and just 6 percent by commercial customers. Just by themselves, California\u2019s almonds suck up 10 percent of the state\u2019s water.\n\nActivists are prompting news accounts to describe how much water is consumed by each crop. The Los Angeles Times printed a guide to determine the \u201cwater footprint\u201d of different meals, telling Angelenos how to save water by changing their eating habits. Going vegan is celebrated. As one journalist wrote, \u201cSo what are some thirsty foods? Beef, pork, lamb, chickpeas, lentils, peas, goat, mangoes and asparagus. Less thirsty crops? Cabbage, strawberries, onions, lettuce, carrots, eggplant, grapefruit and tomatoes.\u201d\n\nInfighting is breaking out between rival crop growers. Growing a pound of almonds requires about 600 gallons of water, so some label them \u201cthe devil\u2019s nut.\u201d Thus, every pound of almonds exported from California (about two-thirds of the crop) is like sending another 600 gallons of water out of the state. A Gizmodo writer provided a punchline, \u201cLess almonds=more water.\u201d\n\nBut cut off the water from almond growers and California\u2019s economy loses $11 billion in annual sales.\n\nThere is another agricultural villain: alfalfa. Not the kid from \u201cThe Little Rascals\u201d but the crop, which is mostly exported to China to feed that country\u2019s dairy cattle. According to some sources, growing alfalfa consumers a fifth of California\u2019s water.\n\nDon\u2019t expect any solutions soon for the Golden State\u2019s Golden Mess. The tiny delta smelt has big friends. Washington bureaucrats have the ability to reroute massive amounts of federally controlled water. But when Congress proposed to make that happen, President Obama threatened to veto the bill.\n\nIs there a solution? Yes, several \u2014 but they are consistently blocked. The best thing to come out the whole incident is that California is teaching a lesson to the rest of the nation. We need to listen, and to learn.\n\n\u2022 Former Congressman Ernest Istook is president of Americans for Less Regulation.
