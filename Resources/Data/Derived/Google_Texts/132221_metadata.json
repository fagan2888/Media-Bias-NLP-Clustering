Proponents of redefining marriage are confident they\u2019ll win in June. If so, that will be a decisive -- and divisive -- juncture for organized religion in America and frame competing religious liberty claims the media will be covering in coming years.\n\nA previous Religion Guy Memo advised journalists to examine the \u201cfriend of the court\u201d briefs in these historic cases. The religious arguments for traditional marriage are familiar, perhaps especially for GetReligion readers. But now that all the briefs are filed, newswriters should consider the somewhat less publicized religious argument on the opposite side.\n\nThe key brief comes from the Episcopal Church\u2019s bishops in these four states (.pdf here) with the president of the Episcopal House of Deputies, the United Church of Christ, the Unitarian Universalist Association, Judaism\u2019s three non-Orthodox branches, a dozen pro-gay caucuses and 1,900 individuals.\n\nThough there\u2019s strong religious support for marriage traditionalism, these gay-marriage proponents insist they\u2019re also part of the religious \u201cmainstream,\u201d noting that the United Church and Unitarians stem directly from New England\u2019s Puritans and Pilgrims. The Episcopalians likewise have colonial roots. The brief also cites recent ideological support from the large Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Presbyterian Church (USA), though they didn\u2019t join the brief.\n\nAmericans have increasingly positive feelings toward gays, and the brief cites data on this from the Public Religion Research Institute. Not mentioned is that the institute\u2019s most recent survey (2013) also showed impressive percentages saying same-sex marriage goes against their religious beliefs: white \u201cevangelical\u201d Protestants 78 percent, black Protestants 61 percent, all Catholics 53 percent, all Americans 51 percent and white \u201cmainline\u201d Protestants 45 percent -- with only 26 percent of non-religious citizens.\n\nThese liberals argue that \u201cfundamental principles of both equal protection and religious freedom\u201d require nationwide legalization of gay marriages. The brief says if liberals win, the Supreme Court won\u2019t \u201c \u2019take sides\u2019 with one religious view against another\u201d because all faiths \u201cremain free to define religious marriage however they wish\u201d and to avoid same-sex weddings.\n\nMainly for that reason the brief discounts traditionalists\u2019 \u201camorphous concerns about \u2018religious liberty\u2019.\u201d Otherwise, it says courts will apply already existing public accommodation and employment laws when religious organizations or individuals \u201coperate in commercial or governmental spheres.\u201d\n\nFor instance, the group notes, the New Mexico Supreme Court decided Elane Photography had no right to refuse coverage of a gay wedding on religious grounds, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review this. (Importantly, the handful of such conservative merchants don\u2019t discriminate against gay customers except with weddings.)\n\nAssuming a liberal win, for journalists this is the most important future aspect of what the Supreme Court says. The Seventh-day Adventist Church takes no side on gay marriage as such but sees \u201cwide-ranging implications for religious liberty\u201d and asks the justices to make \u201caccommodations for sincere religious objections.\u201d\n\nA brief from First Amendment scholars Thomas Berg and Douglas Laycock advocates the right to gay marriage but asserts in fairness the Supreme Court must also protect the rights of conscientious objectors. Despite recent news about those wedding merchants they focus on matters like counseling services, housing at religious schools, religious employment, provision of spousal benefits, adoption placement, religious camps, day care, professional licensing, school accreditation, government contracting, access to public facilities and -- eventually \u2013 threats against tax exemption.\n\nThe brief from the U.S. Catholic bishops predicts that if the Supreme Court rewrites the law of marriage, this will \u201ccreate church-state conflict for generations to come.\u201d\n\nFor religion reporters, it\u2019s cram time on First Amendment law, especially the Bob Jones University precedent on tax exemption. That's the domino that insiders are watching, with the state deciding, again, when religious doctrines are acceptable and when they are not -- the ultimate church-state collision, with state-approved doctrines forming a new American creed.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "On April 28, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear those same-sex marriage cases \r\nfrom Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee.
