PITTSBURGH — Justin Morneau is taking a big step toward a possible return to the majors.

The Rockies’ first baseman, who’s missed most of the season because of a neck injury and concussion symptoms, is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment with the Double-A New Britain Rock Cats Friday night. He is expected to play in three games for the Rock Cats.

Morneau, 34, suffered whiplash and a concussion after diving for a ball May 13 in Anaheim against the Angels. He also missed significant time in 2010 and 2011 with concussions.

Two weeks ago, Morneau took batting practice on the field for the first time since his injury.

“It’s nice to see the ball travel and be out with the boys,” Morneau said. “It feels like another step in the process.”

Morneau said that his goal was to return to the Rockies this season.

“I’m going through a regular routine this homestand. I’ll see how it feels, then we’ll see (what’s next),” he said. “I wouldn’t be out here if I didn’t think (I could return). That’s the point.”

The Rockies have Morneau signed through this season, with a $9 million mutual option next season.

Morneau won his first career batting title last season, leading the National League with a .319 batting average in his first year with the Rockies.

Morneau played for the Rock Cats for parts of three seasons and helped the Rock Cats to the Eastern League Co-Championship in 2001. In 2002, he batted .298 with 31 doubles, 16 home runs and 80 RBIs at New Britain and was selected to play in the Major League Future’s Game at Miller Park in Milwaukee. He began the 2003 season with the Rock Cats before eventually reaching the Major League’s that same season.
