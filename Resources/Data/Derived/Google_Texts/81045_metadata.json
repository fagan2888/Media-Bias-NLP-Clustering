Office of the Supreme Leader/AP\n\nAs the United States mobilizes an international coalition to take on the Islamic State group, Iran has publicly said it will not work with a Western-organized effort. But the Shiite-majority state, which borders Iraqi territory where the terrorist group has spread, will still play a role in opposing the violent extremist Sunni organization.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry did not want Iran to participate in an international conference on fighting the Islamic State that was held in Paris on Monday, but he did not rule out further discussions with Tehran.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not coordinating with Iran, but as I said, we\u2019re open to have a conversation at some point in time if there\u2019s a way to find something constructive,\u201d Kerry told reporters in Paris. \u201cI\u2019m never going to shut a door to something that could solve a problem if there\u2019s a way to do it.\u201d\n\nTalks regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program will resume this fall, and Kerry said that conversations about the current terrorist threat in the Middle East have previously happened on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations. Some conversations are expected when world leaders gather at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said in an interview with Iranian state television that the U.S. ambassador to Iraq requested cooperation from the Iranians in fighting the Islamic State group, but that Khamenei refused.\n\n\u201cWe will not cooperate with the Americans in this regard since they have a corrupt intention and stained hands,\u201d Khamenei said. \"The Americans should know that if they do this, the same problems that were created on their way in the past ten years in Iraq will be created for them again.\u201d\n\nJacob Stokes, the Bacevich Fellow with the Center for New American Security, says that even if the two countries are not prone to working together, the reality of the situation suggests they cannot completely ignore one another.\n\n\u201cPart of this is the public face that Iran\u2019s supreme leader needs to have as a part of his domestic politics but then there\u2019s the sort of reality on the ground,\u201d he says. \u201cThere's going to need to continue to be not even cooperation or even coordination but sort of moving in the same direction against the same enemy.\u201d\n\nTony Cordesman, the Burke Chair in strategy with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that Iranian volunteers are already on the ground in Syria, but actual clashes with the Islamic State have been limited to small affiliate groups.\n\n\u201cThe problem is always volunteers are never really volunteers,\u201d Codesman says. \u201cBut they\u2019re not units. They are people going in to support Syrian forces and fighting with the Hezbollah.\u201d\n\nCordesman says this is similar to the plan the U.S. proposes to deal with the Islamic State in Iraq. \u201cIn some ways that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen with the U.S., we won\u2019t send ground combat units in but we\u2019ll send special forces and advisors and we\u2019ll send in other elements,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a way they can\u2019t be said to be purely advisory. When you\u2019re in a combat environment you can try to be as advisory as you want but if anything goes wrong, you\u2019re in combat.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Shiite Iranian government supports the regime of Syrian Presdient Bashar al Assad, who is also Shia. The Islamic State, a Sunni group, poses a threat to Iranian interests in both Syria and Iraq, which also has a Shiite majority. The sectarian policies of former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki marginalized the Sunni minority and played a role in the formation of the Islamic State.\n\nNow, says Cordesman, it\u2019s in Iran\u2019s interest to support a more national Iraqi government where all groups are represented, rather than one that drives Sunnis to extremism. He says the Iranians have traditionally had a role in Iraq's internal negotiations to form governments, but their involvement hasn't extended to sending formalized combat units there.\n\nBecause of the close role Tehran has played with the Iraqi government, which also works closely with the United States, Cordesman says Iraq can act as a sort of intermediary between the two. \u201cYou don\u2019t have two people acting as military advisors to the same government without it providing some feedback and discussion and warnings,\u201d he says.\n\nIn Syria too, says Stokes, Iran has an interest in stopping extremist Sunnis.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Syria", "title": "Iran Won't Work With the West, But Still Must Fight Islamic State", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Tehran won't work with a Western-coalition against the terrorist group, but can't afford to do nothing.", "title": "Iran Takes a Different Path to Fight the Islamic State", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/16/iran-wont-work-with-the-west-but-still-must-fight-islamic-state", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/6c/69/ca07d9274e239c91e112ea6c1310/140916-ayatollah-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Iran Won't Work With the West, But Still Must Fight Islamic State", "description": "Tehran won't work with a Western-coalition against the terrorist group, but can't afford to do nothing.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Teresa Welsh,Iran,Pulse,picks,Islamic State,Iraq,Syria", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Tehran won't work with a Western-coalition against the terrorist group, but can't afford to do nothing."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd6b\"", "article_summary": "Office of the Supreme Leader/APAs the United States mobilizes an international coalition to take on the Islamic State group, Iran has publicly said it will not work with a Western-organized effort.\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei says he refuted the U.S. ambassador to Iraq's calls for cooperation in combating the Islamic State group.\nSecretary of State John Kerry did not want Iran to participate in an international conference on fighting the Islamic State that was held in Paris on Monday, but he did not rule out further discussions with Tehran.\nThe Islamic State, a Sunni group, poses a threat to Iranian interests in both Syria and Iraq, which also has a Shiite majority.\nThe sectarian policies of former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki marginalized the Sunni minority and played a role in the formation of the Islamic State."}
