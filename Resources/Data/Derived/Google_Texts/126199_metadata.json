We all know each other races, and how we train, so there's nothing really competitive up to now.\"\n\nThe first meet in which the Buffs competed with most of their elite runners, CU held the top seven spots on the men's side and five of the top six on the women's side. Following Murphy directly was Morgan Pearson, Connor Winter and Zach Perrin \u2014 all within 27 seconds.\n\nJunior Erin Clark beat her time of last year, finishing first in 20:13, and the Buffaloes tried to push their pack time in an attempt to get the racing juices flowing.\n\nNo one wearing colors other than gold could keep up.\n\n\"Definitely excited. It's been awhile since the end of track season, and a long time since cross country so it was fun to test out all the training we've been doing and see where everyone's fitness is,\" said Clark, who led the entire way. \"I think it went well. I watched everyone come in and was excited to see Maddie (Alm) and Dani (Jones) just behind me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertainly, there is growing interest in how well the women's team is shaping up. They came into Saturday's race second in both the regional and national polls behind New Mexico, and by cooking the home course they definitely appear ready to take that next step. Alm finished in 20:54, Jones in 21:16.\n\n\"Those are big shoes to fill being ranked No. 2, but I think it's exciting that people are seeing that we have a strong team here,\" Clark said. \"We're just going to keep training as we are, doing the right things and hopefully the results will come.\"\n\nColorado's Erin Clark (369) leads a pack of runners on Sunday at the Rocky Mountain Shootout. (Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)\n\nThe Buffaloes might catch a better glimpse of where they are at in two weeks, when they travel to Louisville for the NCAA Pre-Nationals. So far, however, there has been nothing but encouraging signs for head coach Mark Wetmore.\n\n\"I saw two good teams, two teams that may be a little better than I expected,\" Wetmore said, adding times were surprisingly comparable to last year despite different racing conditions. \"The women ran a little better (than last year).\n\n\"There's a little more talent (on the women's side), another year of experience and a good, solid summer and some synergy. They're all making each other better, so you put all those things together and it makes a big step forward.\"\n\nWetmore said Ryan Forsyth's seventh place finish impressed him, as did the unattached runs of true freshmen John Dressel and Joe Klecker \u2014 enough to question the benefits of redshirting them.\n\nThe men won the race for the 25th straight time, while the women logged their 17th straight Shootout victory.\n\nAdam Dunivan: dunivana@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/AdamDunivan24\n\nRocky Mountain Shootout\n\nAt Buffalo Ranch CU South Campus\n\nMen\n\nDivision I team scores \u2014 Colorado 15, Air Force 50, Northern Colorado 85.\n\nDivision II/Other team scores \u2014 Colorado Mesa 33, Western State 40, Gillette (Wyo.) 68, Colorado School of Mines 87, Central Wyoming College 145.\n\nTop 10 individuals \u2014 1.
