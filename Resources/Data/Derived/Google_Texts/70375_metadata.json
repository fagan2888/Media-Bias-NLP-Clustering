That\u2019s more than twice the $4.2 billion wagered on the Super Bowl.\n\nThe average American completes nearly two brackets and bets an average of $29 on each one. But it\u2019s largely an exercise in futility: The odds of picking a perfect NCAA bracket are less than one in 9.2 quintillion, according to DePaul University mathematics professor Jeff Bergen.\n\nRelated: The 16 Highest-Paid Coaches in College Basketball\n\nThe American Gaming Association predicts that Americans will complete more than 70 million brackets in 2016.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of non-gambling money involved in the tournament as well. The cheapest price for a ticket to a March Madness game is at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena during the round of 32, when the average ticket cost is $112. During the Final Four games at NRG Stadium in Houston, prices spike to an average of $1,052, according to TiqIQ.\n\nFinal Four host Houston will see an economic impact of $300 million, according to a WalletHub report, with the average visitor spending $2,100 while there. The advertising rights for the tournament are worth $1.1 billion.\n\nNearly 40 percent of office workers say they are distracted at work by major sporting events, according to a Robert Half survey. The staffing firm attributed that distraction to the ability of today\u2019s workers to stream games at any time. Companies are projected to lose nearly $2 billion in worker productivity during the tournament.\n\nIf you do manage to win some money in a March Madness betting pool, keep in mind that the winnings are taxable. See IRS publication 525 for all the painful details.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Americans will bet more than $9.2 billion on March Madness office pools this year, up", "title": "Here\u2019s How Much Americans Are Betting on March Madness Basketball", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/17/Here-s-How-Much-Americans-Are-Betting-March-Madness-Basketball", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/March_Madness_Basketball03192014_02.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/17/Here-s-How-Much-Americans-Are-Betting-March-Madness-Basketball", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/March_Madness_Basketball03192014_02.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Americans will bet more than $9.2 billion on March Madness office pools this year, up", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Americans will bet more than $9.2 billion on March Madness office pools this year, up from $9 billion last year.\nIf you do manage to win some money in a March Madness betting pool, keep in mind that the winnings are taxable.\nThe cheapest price for a ticket to a March Madness game is at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena during the round of 32, when the average ticket cost is $112.\nNearly 40 percent of office workers say they are distracted at work by major sporting events, according to a Robert Half survey.\nThe average American completes nearly two brackets and bets an average of $29 on each one."}
