Other executives \u2013 especially the chief clinical officer, chief medical officer and CFO \u2013 are providing this support as well, and not surprisingly the CPHO role works closely with these leaders,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cUnder a population health model, there\u2019s also a need for greater outreach and collaboration with payers, community organizations, and advocacy groups, and the population health executive can spearhead these important partnerships,\u201d he added.\n\nNo one-size-fits-all approach\n\nWhile certain aspects of a CPHO candidate may be the same across healthcare systems, there is a lot of room for variability on who makes an ideal CPHO \u2013 potential candidates could have payer or large physician group backgrounds, for instance.\n\nOr, in the case of Marion A. McGowan, executive vice president and CPHO at Lancaster General Health in Pennsylvania, nursing. She moved from a clinical background to clinical leadership to an executive role. Prior to being appointed CPHO she was COO with Lancaster General.\n\nMcGowan, who has been in the CPHO position for a little more than 18 months and is the first person to fill the role at Lancaster General, says that even though a common standard for the role has not yet developed, there are important areas of experience or expertise that every CPHO should have:\n\nThe individual should be a visionary and understand healthcare reform, integration strategy and value-based care.\n\nThe individual should have a keen sense of how to manage complex systems, payer strategies and change leadership.\n\n\u201cThis position is usually asked to take the lead in helping to design the population health strategy for the organization, and then taking the ball and implementing it,\u201d said King. \u201cA key aspect of implementation is getting buy-in from the organization and constituents (payers, community groups, etc.), creating a \u2018followership,\u2019 and so the CPHO has to be an influencer and champion of change.\u201d\n\nThe leadership qualities needed for the role of CPHO make these executives strong candidates to eventually assume health system CEO positions, added King. \u201cThey will be working on the cutting edge of health reform, care model redesign, and building strong relationships with many influential people, and accumulating high-level strategic and operational experience. If she or he is an MD, that would make that person all the more attractive as CEO.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/and-coming-executive-role-chief-population-health-officer", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Jim_King_72_dpi.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "With population health management becoming a central focus for more healthcare providers, a growing number are considering adding a chief population health officer to the executive ranks.", "title": "An up-and-coming executive role: chief population health officer"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Jim_King_72_dpi.jpg"}, "title": "An up-and-coming executive role: chief population health officer", "description": "With population health management becoming a central focus for more healthcare providers, a growing number are considering adding a chief population health officer to the executive ranks.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "With population health management becoming a central focus for more healthcare providers, a growing number are considering adding a chief population health officer to the executive ranks.&#13; As noted in a recent help wanted ad for the role, CPHOs report to the chief executive officer, are responsible for overall strategic direction and coordination of population health and care management and must have leadership and team-building skills.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd93c\"", "article_summary": "With population health management becoming a central focus for more healthcare providers, a growing number are considering adding a chief population health officer to the executive ranks.\n\u201cUnder a population health model, there\u2019s also a need for greater outreach and collaboration with payers, community organizations, and advocacy groups, and the population health executive can spearhead these important partnerships,\u201d he added.\nOther executives \u2013 especially the chief clinical officer, chief medical officer and CFO \u2013 are providing this support as well, and not surprisingly the CPHO role works closely with these leaders,\u201d King said.\nA role whose time has comeThe chief population health officer will become and remain one of the healthcare industry\u2019s fastest growing C-suite positions for some time to come, said Jim King, senior partner and chief quality officer at executive search firm Witt/Kieffer.\nAs noted in a recent help wanted ad for the role, CPHOs report to the chief executive officer, are responsible for overall strategic direction and coordination of population health and care management and must have leadership and team-building skills."}
