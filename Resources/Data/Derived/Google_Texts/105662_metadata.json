Its aim is to convert and control people with its assumed biblically revealed one true savior of the world. The tip of its evangelizing iceberg is seen in the folly of Hobby Lobby.\n\nFollowing its recent Supreme Court victory\u2013 that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement to provide contraceptive coverage for women employees violated its religious freedom\u2013 a New York Times story on Hobby Lobby\u2019s \u201cnew project\u201d contains more of its mission to gain power over people\u2013 which motivates much of Christianity. The evangelical family-owned craft store chain has purchased a huge, eight-story building in Washington, near the National Mall, to house a Bible museum. Why? Steve Green, Hobby Lobby president is quoted as having \u201creferred to the Bible as \u2018a reliable historical document,\u2019\u201d and intends to \u201c\u2019reintroduce this book to this nation.\u2019\u201d (\u201cFamily Behind Hobby Lobby Has New Project: Bible Museum,\u201d By Alan Rappeport, July 17, 2014)\n\nWhy does The Bible need to be reintroduced to America? Steve Green answers: \u201cThis nation is in danger because of its ignorance of what God has taught.\u201d The danger? \u201cThere are lessons from the past that we can learn from, the dangers of ignorance of this book. We need to know it,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know it, our future is going to be very scary.\u201d (Ibid)\n\nSteve Green is correct. But not in the way he thinks. Dangerous indeed is \u201cignorance of this book.\u201d The danger is failing to see how people with power use \u201cthis book\u201d to justify imposing their beliefs on others, dehumanizing and robbing them of their rights, oppressing and killing them and stealing their resources and land. It is about power\u2013 ordained and licensed by \u201cwhat God has taught\u201d in The Bible.\n\nThe imperialism underneath Christianity\u2019s evangelizing iceberg surfaced right after The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby\u2019s biblically-based, \u201cbe ye fruitful and multiply,\u201d anti-contraceptive desire to control women\u2019s bodies. Fourteen Christian leaders immediately sent a letter to The White House, requesting that their institutions be exempt, on religious freedom grounds, from a forthcoming presidential ruling that would prohibit groups, receiving federal funds, from discriminating against LGBT persons in hiring. To these and many other Bible-believing Christian leaders, religious freedom means the \u201cfreedom\u201d not to hire a gay, lesbian or transgender person and, when it is known, the right to fire a same-sex marriage partner\u2014because homosexuality is \u201can abomination,\u201d which is \u201cwhat God has taught\u201d in The Bible. Conventional Christian leaders want LGBTQ persons to stay in the closet, i.e., remain invisible, i.e., to not even exist.\n\nWhat would happen if such Christians had the power to impose all of their biblical beliefs on society? If various Christian denominations could do that? If other religions could subject everyone to their will? If white persons were in complete control? ? If \u201cpioneers\u201d and \u201csettlers\u201d\u2013 and \u201ccapitalists\u201d\u2013 could have their way with others?\n\nThe literal belief in \u201cthis book\u201d provides the license to dominate \u2014 given by an infallible god who favors his own. It is just a matter of obtaining the legal\u2014and military\u2014power to carry out \u201cwhat God has taught\u201d his chosen people. Beware of this \u201cGod.\u201d If he thinks like a man, and talks like a man, and acts like a culturally-conditioned man, then, he is a man\u2014dressed in \u201cspirituality.\u201d\n\nThere certainly \u201care lessons from the past that we can learn,\u201d especially \u201cthe dangers of ignorance of this book. . . . If we don\u2019t know it,\u201d as Steve Green said, \u201cour future is going to be very scary\u201d\u2014and like our past and present\u2013 very scarred.\n\nNative Americans can tell us \u201clessons\u201d from the past\u201d about the imperialistic \u201cdangers\u201d contained in \u201cthis book.\u201d America\u2019s \u201cFounding Fathers\u201d were guided by what \u201cGod has taught\u201d in The Bible. Jesus reportedly told his followers, \u201cYou are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. . . . Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.\u201d (Matthew 5: 14-16) Believing in a godly \u201cmanifest destiny, the \u201cFounding Fathers\u201d and their descendants expanded westward to the Pacific Ocean, using their divine \u201clight\u201d to justify turning the indigenous occupants of the land into terrorist \u201csavages\u201d and casting them into outer darkness.\n\nTo this day, U.S. presidents take pride in equating America with that biblical \u201ccity built on a hill.\u201d From \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d to \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d\u2014with \u201clessons\u201d now for the whole world of \u201cwhat God has taught.\u201d\n\nBlack persons can testify to the \u201clessons\u201d regarding \u201cthe dangers of ignorance of this book.\u201d Like, \u201cSlaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as you obey Christ; not only while being watched, and in order to please them, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.\u201d (Ephesians 6: 5, 6) Like loving your \u201cmaster\u201d with all your heart and soul and mind and strength. \u201cWhat God has taught\u201d in \u201cthis book\u201d was used by our white forefathers to justify enslaving millions of black persons.\n\nOur country was not founded on Biblical beliefs, but on the bones of native Americans and the backs of black persons. And many black descendants still live in the shadows of America\u2019s white-controlled hierarchy of political, economic, legal and religious power. With one latest victim repeatedly saying, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d before apparently dying from a policeman\u2019s chokehold. He gave voice to the smothering effect of life at the bottom of America\u2019s white-controlled hierarchy.\n\nWomen can share \u201clessons\u201d about patriarchy to which \u201cthis book\u201d has subjected them. Such as the New Testament writings of Paul the Apostle, who taught, \u201cWomen should be silent in the churches.\u201d (I Corinthians 14: 34-36), and also \u201csubject . . . in everything to your husbands . . . just as the church is subject to Christ.\u201d (Ephesians 5: 22-24).\n\nPerhaps Paul was influenced by the fact that Jesus\u2019 twelve disciples were all men. Or, that Adam and Eve were real people. With Eve tempting Adam to eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Violating the commandment of a jealous god, who feared they would become wise like him. A god so offended by their disobedience that he condemned human nature as sinful thereafter, with the punishment of all women being that their husbands \u201cshall rule over\u201d them. (Genesis 3) Thanks to Paul, whether it is contraception or confirmation as a clergy person, or other male-dominated right or opportunity, \u201cwhat God has taught\u201d is that women take a back seat to men. From Eve\u2019s time on, a primary challenge of women involves cutting the um-biblical-cord of patriarchy.\n\nJewish people know the \u201cdangers of ignorance of what God has taught.\u201d \u201cThis book\u201d blames \u201cthe chief priest and the elders\u201d for the crucifixion of Jesus. According to Matthew\u2019s Gospel, Pilate, the all powerful Roman governor, found no evil in Jesus, but supposedly gave in to the Jewish leaders\u2019 repeated cries, \u201cLet him be crucified!\u201d With that, Pilate washed his hands of the matter, saying, \u201cI am innocent of this man\u2019s blood.\u201d Then, supposedly, the Jewish \u201cpeople as a whole answered, \u2018His blood be on us and on our children.\u2019\u201d (27: 15-23) Like a self-imposed death sentence for the ages. It should be obvious that these self-incriminating words were written much later, by a Christian seeking favor and power under Rome\u2019s rule and justifying the ongoing persecution of Jews. From Jesus\u2019 crucifixion on, these assumed New Testament words of Jewish guilt have given license to Christians to commit terrible crimes against Jewish people.\n\nObtaining power has a way of leading people to forget their own history of oppression\u2014or of using it to justify oppressing another group. Today, Jewish people are doing to the Palestinian people what was done to them. They have robbed Palestinians of their land to create the state of Israel, and continue to grab land in the West Bank with their illegal settlements. They have turned the Gaza Strip into the world\u2019s largest, brutalizing, \u201copen-air prison,\u201d squeezing the life out of 1.8 million Palestinians with a blockade that controls everyone\u2019s movement and their access to water, electricity, fuel, medical supplies and care, and communications. And when Gaza\u2019s democratically-elected government, Hamas fights back against such warring aggression with limited rockets and tunnels, Israel\u2019s overwhelming land, sea and air power counters with the indiscriminate, lopsided slaughter of men, women and children in their homes, schools, mosques, hospitals, UN shelters and other places to which they have fled.\n\nIsrael\u2019s current massacre of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip is called \u201cOperation Protective Edge.\u201d Its public relations campaign to cover up this present war crime included dropping flyers that warned Gaza\u2019s Palestinians of the impending ground invasion\u2019s barrage of bombings and shelling, and telling them to flee. But the blockaded Palestinians had no place to run or hide.\n\nThe tried and true rationalization for \u201cOperation Protective Edge,\u201d repeated by our own president, is that \u201cIsrael has a right to defend itself.\u201d Here is the blurring of cause and effect\u2014reinforced by America\u2019s mainstream media, which portrays the conflict as Hamas firing rockets and Israel retaliating to defend itself. Never mind the context. The other day, former Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniya gave expression to the Palestinian people\u2019s reality and current struggle: \u201cWe\u2019ll never go back to the slow death.\u201d (\u201cIsrael Is Facing Difficult Choice in Gaza Conflict, By Jodi Rudoren, The New York Times, July 21, 2014)\n\nWhere does Israel get the authority to deny Palestinians their rights? From \u201cwhat God has taught.\u201d\u2013 backed, of course, by the U.S. government. The Bible teaches that the Jews are \u201cGod\u2019s\u201d chosen people, that he delivered them from bondage in Egypt, and led them to a promised land \u201cflowing with milk and honey.\u201d There happened to be people on the land: \u201cCanaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites.\u201d (Exodus 3: 7, 8) They did not matter. The Bible tells us that \u201cthe Lord God\u201d commanded the Israelites with, \u201cI will hand over to you the inhabitants of the land, and you shall drive them out before you. . . . You must utterly destroy them.\u201d Genocide, justified by, \u201cThe Lord God has chosen you out of all the people on earth to be his people, his treasured possession.\u201d (Exodus 23: 31; Deuteronomy 7: 1-6)\n\nIt is not as if Jews lived on the land since the beginning of time. Their entitlement to the land came from \u201cwhat God has taught\u201d\u2014at the expense of the Canaanites and others. Liberation theologian, author and Biblical scholar Fr. Michael Prior, C.M., Ph.D., now deceased, provided a humanizing teaching of his own here, in saying, \u201cIt is high time that biblical scholars, church people, and Western intellectuals read the biblical narratives of the promised land \u2018with the eyes of the Canaanites.\u201d (\u201cConfronting the Bible\u2019s Ethnic Cleansing in Palestine,\u201d in Burning Issues: Understanding and Misunderstanding The Middle East: A 40-Year Chronicle, published by Americans for Middle East Understanding, 2007)\n\n\u201cWhat God has taught\u201d led regular-Bible-reading president, George W. Bush to launch a falsely-based pre-emptive war of choice against Iraq. Prayerfully, he started a \u201cglobal war on terrorism,\u201d repeatedly saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them.\u201d (\u201cHow a War Became a Crusade, By Jack Lears, The New York Times, March 11, 2003) Bush followed \u201c:Providence\u2019s leading, saying, \u201cI believe everybody in the Middle East desires to live in freedom,\u201d that \u201cmothers and fathers want to raise their children in a free and peaceful world,\u201d and \u201cI believe all these things, because freedom is not America\u2019s gift to the world, freedom is almighty God\u2019s gift to each man and woman in this world.\u201d (\u201cGeorge W. Bush on Faith,\u201d beliefnet.com)\n\n\u201cWhat God has taught\u201d former President Bush led America to commit horrible war crimes against the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. Rather than \u201cmothers and fathers . . . rais[ing] their children in a free and peaceful world,\u201d their lives and lands are being torn apart. Tragically, the war crimes committed by a Bible-reading Bush was supported by a majority of white evangelical Christians, a number if whose leaders saw the war against Iraq as an opportunity to convert Muslims to Christianity\u2014in keeping with an assumed resurrected Jesus commanding his followers: \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore to \u201cgo therefore and make disciples of all nations.\u201d (Matthew 28: 16-20) Other Christian groups initially protested America\u2019s bi-partisan government\u2019s war crime against Iraq, but the protest of some was measured, and in time the voices of many faded away.\n\nCertain \u201crevelations\u201d of \u201cwhat God has taught\u201d violate the humanness everyone shares. The story of a lesbian police chief in Latta, South Carolina provides a helpful lesson here. Mayor Earl Bullard fired Police Chief Crystal Moore when he found out that she was a lesbian and had a partner. The Mayor is quoted: \u201cI\u2019d much rather have somebody who drank and drank too much taking care of my child than I had somebody whose lifestyle is questionable around children, because that ain\u2019t the damn way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d (\u201cS. C. town rallies for gay police chief after firing,\u201d By Jeffrey Collins, Associated Press, The Boston Globe, July 14, 2014)\n\nResidents came to the aid of Police Chief Moore, who had 20-years of experience in law enforcement. People recalled Moore\u2019s \u201ccivic spirit\u201d as a high school student, who served as a police dispatcher and helped to clear debris when Hurricane Hugo struck. And who, as a police chief, checked to make sure many residents were safe during a crippling ice storm. (Ibid)\n\nTown resident Dottie Waters is quoted as putting Police Chief Crystal Moore\u2019s identity in human perspective: \u201cThat\u2019s Crystal. All she does is help people. I don\u2019t get why he fired her. . . . She was the same great Crystal yesterday as she is today, and she\u2019ll be the same person tomorrow.\u201d The Town Council stripped the mayor of some of his power, and rehired Moore. And when she \u201creturned to work June 30, people honked their car horns and gave her a thumbs up as she drove around in her police SUV.\u201d (Ibid)\n\nThe challenge is to experience the individuality and worth of all other human beings, and, when necessary, use our power to join in protecting or restoring their inherent right to life. It is about reading The Bible \u201cwith the eyes of the Canaanites.\u201d And The Bible itself provides inspiration for such universal humanness. Like the exhortation in Leviticus 19: 33, 34: \u201cThe stranger who resides with you shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as yourself for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.\u201d The words also of the prophet Micah: \u201cHe has told you, O Mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.\u201d (6: 8) And the teachings of Jesus: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.\u201c (Matthew 5: 9) And the great commandment: \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (Mark 12: 31)\u2013 with no proselytizing strings attached. It is about listening to \u201cwhat God has said\u201d with the discernment of the universally revered Golden Rule: \u201cIn everything do to others as you would have them do to you; for this is the law and the prophets.
