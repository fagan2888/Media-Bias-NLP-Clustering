One church in Quitman honored local kids with a unique banquet tonight.

The anointed word church held a children's awards banquet in the city's multi-purpose building. Two months ago, the church came up with the idea to recognize all children in the area. Anointed word's pastor says she believes we shouldn't just focus on grades.

"I feel in my spirit that every child is a leader. There are some kids that make a's and b's in school, but it's not only those children that will go on and be successful in life," Pastor Rosie Bumpers says.

Bumpers hopes to talk to the Quitman school district's superintendent to grow the banquet, and make this an annual event.
