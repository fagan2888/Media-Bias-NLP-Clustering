Beneficiaries may have fewer options and higher out-of-pocket costs. Stephen Hemsley, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, says that the company will have to trim benefits. \"Medicare Advantage has a couple of difficult years ahead,\" he says. (UnitedHealthcare offers AARP-branded Medicare Advantage policies.)\n\n\"This is no free lunch,\" Gruber says. But he and other supporters of the ACA say the changes are essential to help ensure that the program is around for future generations.\n\nMy doctor got a letter saying the insurance company is dropping her from its Medicare Advantage plan because of the health care law. Why?\n\nThe Medicare Advantage plans are run as businesses, and because the government seeks to reduce the rate of growth of reimbursements to those plans, companies are making decisions to offset those cuts.

More than 7.1 million older and disabled people in the doughnut hole have saved $8.3 billion between 2010 and October 2013.\n\n\n\nNext page: Will patient care suffer as a result of ACA payment cuts to hospitals? \u00bb\n\n", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:AARP Bulletin Today", "Division1": "Division:AARP Bulletin Today", "page_title": "Is Your Medicare Safe?", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-04-02T14:19:22.412-04:00", "keywords": "obamacare, medicare, aca, affordable care act, medicare advantage, health care law, medicare benefits, health law, medicare spending", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Marsha Mercer", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_bulletin_today", "type": "info", "description": "The health law protects Medicare benefits, but it reduces future Medicare spending.
