The current caused sparks, and Short grabbed a fire extinguisher.\n\nFlesher says Short was vaulting over the hitch between the tractor and grain cart when he was thrown backward. Short collapsed against the frame of the grain cart. One of the other men helping with the harvest found a plastic shovel and was able to move Short away from the electric current.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A central Kansas man has suffered severe electrical shocks while helping to harvest a soybean field.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Man-shocked-in-farm-accident-280434432.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/tractor+fire+saline+county.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A central Kansas man has suffered severe electrical shocks while helping to harvest a soybean field.", "title": "UPDATE: Man suffers electric shock in farm accident"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A central Kansas man has suffered severe electrical shocks while helping to harvest a soybean field.", "title": "UPDATE: Man suffers electric shock in farm accident", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Man-shocked-in-farm-accident-280434432.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/tractor+fire+saline+county.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "UPDATE: Man suffers electric shock in farm accident", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Man suffers electric shock"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8bd\"", "article_summary": "Credit: KSALA central Kansas man has suffered severe electrical shocks while helping to harvest a soybean field.\nThe Salina Journal reports that 24-year-old Zachary Short was flown to a Wichita hospital Saturday with critical injuries.\nFlesher says Short was vaulting over the hitch between the tractor and grain cart when he was thrown backward.\nOne of the other men helping with the harvest found a plastic shovel and was able to move Short away from the electric current.\nShort collapsed against the frame of the grain cart."}
