It motivates hospitals to continually improve care for patients. It drives medical innovation, which has produced lifesaving technological advances. It also pushes health care providers to find operational efficiencies that improve care and lower costs. Hospitals welcome competition when all market competitors play by the same rules.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem overlooked by those seeking hospital deregulation through the repeal of Virginia\u2019s Certificate of Public Need law. Eliminating COPN would not be a health care panacea. It wouldn\u2019t lead to new hospitals with new beds enabling patients to shop for less expensive care.\n\nWhat it would produce instead is a situation where niche health care businesses swoop into communities and cherry pick profitable services to offer. Experience tells us those companies would not offer many of the services communities need, because not all are profitable.\n\nNewcomers would gain an unfair advantage by offering only select services that benefit their bottom line, while hospitals continue to provide necessary community services regardless of profitability or patients\u2019 ability to pay.\n\nThat\u2019s because hospitals serve the public good with a focus on community health. Hospitals deliver specialty services ranging from emergency treatment, cardiac care and obstetrics to psychiatric and radiology. Some of those services generate income. Others do not.\n\nHospitals provide indigent care because it\u2019s the right thing to do and aligns with community hospitals\u2019 mission of serving those in need. What goes unsaid by many advocates for COPN repeal is they have little interest in a health care approach not exclusively driven by financial considerations.\n\n***\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a Virginia without COPN. The number of ambulatory surgery centers likely would increase because they receive favorable insurance reimbursements for services, and that business model is known for aggressive patient targeting. However, that expansion would come at the expense of hospitals that have devotedly served their communities for decades.\n\nIt also would come at the expense of patients who would find themselves with fewer options for certain acute care services because community hospitals would no longer be able to afford them. Why? Because community hospitals would face the financial crunch of being left to provide many unprofitable services, often to indigent patients, while enduring lost revenue from profitable services horned in on by ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). In other words, the community hospital would continue to bear community care responsibility while being financially harmed by COPN repeal.\n\nIn addition to a potential loss of health care services in less profitable but vital sectors such as psychiatric care or obstetrics, quality of care could suffer. We have seen that in Pennsylvania, where state health analysts observed a serious decline in general acute care hospitals in the 10 years (1996-2005) after the Keystone State ended its COPN law. Parallel to that was a dramatic increase in ASCs.\n\nA separate report from a Pennsylvania legislative panel found that cardiac catheterization programs with open heart surgery, which started after Pennsylvania\u2019s COPN ended, failed to meet industry-standard minimum proficiency volumes. That study also found higher mortality rates at such facilities. Those findings illustrate the utility of having appropriate regulatory oversight to protect patient well-being.\n\n***\n\nWithout COPN in Virginia, hospital leaders would face unwelcome choices. Each would provoke economic hardship in the communities they serve, negatively impacting patient outcomes and community health.\n\nOne potential response would be the elimination of services like mental health care, pediatrics, obstetrics and post-hospital skilled nursing care.\n\nNext might be layoffs. All job losses are devastating for workers, their families and the community. Hospital layoffs would hurt more because hospitals are among Virginia\u2019s largest employers. That is particularly true in rural Virginia counties; health care among the top employers in 82 percent of those locales.\n\nThough regrettable, such ledger-conscious moves would be inevitable in a regulatory environment where already financially stressed hospitals find themselves cornered by COPN repeal. Hospitals already face challenges from federal and state policy decisions that have introduced more volatility into an industry coping with much change.\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service in recent years has given nonprofit hospitals a negative financial outlook. Their for-profit counterparts have fared a bit better. Virginia hospitals fall into both categories. And while our operating models differ, one commonality among all hospitals is the federal legal requirement to treat people in our emergency rooms regardless of their ability to pay. Hospitals are obligated to give away their services in those instances. We\u2019re not complaining about that. It is, quite simply, the humane thing to do.\n\nThat commitment makes hospitals unique among other commercial enterprises, which routinely charge customers for service. The duty to treat people in need is part of our mission to care for our communities. We take it seriously.\n\nHowever, it comes with considerable cost. In 2013, Virginia hospitals provided more than $1.5 billion in uncompensated care, a figure reflecting growing Medicaid and Medicare shortfalls, and charity care. More financial hits to hospitals are coming as the Affordable Care Act calls for reductions in certain Medicare and Medicaid payments under a new care model that envisions greater Medicaid participation.\n\nYet another potential victim could be financial support for graduate medical education at our Virginia teaching hospitals, which produce the future health care professionals who will provide care to us all.\n\n***\n\nVirginia health systems are boxed in because cuts are coming and, so far, state policymakers have been unable to find compromise on a plan to assist uninsured Virginians. Hospitals face real, and increasingly critical, financial challenges from cuts and growing demand for charity care.\n\nIn 2013, about one-third of Virginia\u2019s hospitals had negative operating margins. That problem afflicts providers across Virginia but is most acute in rural communities \u2014 where 20 of the 37 rural hospitals operated at a financial loss. It is reasonable to expect those conditions would further deteriorate if COPN were repealed without offsetting policy actions to stabilize Virginia hospitals\u2019 competitive footing.\n\nHospitals are open to regulatory reform. We previously supported deregulation legislation in Virginia when the General Assembly approved a COPN wind-down law that has yet to be implemented. We remain open to thoughtful approaches to industry deregulation.\n\nIt is imprudent, however, to call for health care regulatory reform in a vacuum, without addressing the realities of health care economics. That would devastate the commonwealth\u2019s economy, its communities and its health-care network.\n\nThe majority of states still have COPN laws, an indication that many state policymakers continue to see their benefits. Virginia hospitals are flexible on that subject and other matters of health care policy. We stand ready to work with any state or federal official committed to finding workable solutions to hospitals\u2019 challenges so we can continue to deliver top-notch health care to our fellow Virginians for years to come.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Richmond Times-Dispatch", "description": "Competition is a good thing.
