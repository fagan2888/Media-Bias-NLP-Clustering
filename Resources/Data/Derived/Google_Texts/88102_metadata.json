He shot, but the ball hit a Costa Rican defender on the goal line, ricocheted from the crossbar and bounced out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre,\u201d Van Persie said. \u201cWe had too many chances. You have to stay strong and focused in such circumstances. We had to work hard to win this game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Van Persie\u2019s misses nearly cost Dutch at World Cup", "author": "Dusan Stojanovic", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Van Persie\u2019s misses nearly cost Dutch at World Cup", "title": "Van Persie\u2019s misses nearly cost Dutch at World Cup", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/van_persies_misses_nearly_cost_dutch_at_world_cup/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/brazil-soccer-wcup-netherlands-costa-rica.jpeg16-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Van Persie\u2019s misses nearly cost Dutch at World Cup", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/brazil-soccer-wcup-netherlands-costa-rica.jpeg16-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Van Persie\u2019s misses nearly cost Dutch at World Cup", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Van Persie\u2019s misses nearly cost Dutch at World Cup", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe57a8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThose misses could have been very costly,\u201d Van Persie said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre,\u201d Van Persie said.\nThe ball was crossed from the left, two Dutch players failed to get to it, and it fell to Van Persie close to the back post.\nVan Persie missed two chances from close range in stoppage time in a 0-0 draw before the Dutch prevailed 4-3 in penalty shootout to set up a World Cup semifinal match against Argentina.\nHe shot, but the ball hit a Costa Rican defender on the goal line, ricocheted from the crossbar and bounced out."}
