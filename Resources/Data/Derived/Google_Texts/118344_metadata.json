However, it was popularly known as a place for Satan worship, rituals, and dances. There were also Satanic drawings at the entrance.\u201d\n\nHuman rights and humanist circles in Egypt have criticized the atheist cafe raid. Ali Atef, lawyer for the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, told Cairo Post that it was illegal to have the cafe closed on grounds of its customers\u2019 alleged atheism, adding that the only way it could have been illegal in Egypt is if the cafe began discriminating against people belonging to other religions.\n\n\u201cIf the caf\u00e9 were legal and has its papers in order, then the police storming for the caf\u00e9 then would be the wrong or criminal action, as no one has the right to arrest someone for his thoughts. And to be fair and honest, usually these incidents happen for arresting atheists, and later they explain that the caf\u00e9 papers were illegal, which is usually wrong.\u201d\n\nMiddle East Eye reported that at least one person, the cafe owner, has been arrested during the raid.\n\nAtheism is currently not listed as a crime in Egypt. However, blaspheming or defaming any of the Abrahamic religions can result to six months to five years imprisonment and a fine of LE 500 to 1000, or 88 to 140 U.S. dollars.\n\nUnofficial polls claim that there are at least three million atheists out of 84 million people living in Egypt. Western media outlets, including the BBC, have put the numbers in question, noting that because of the current socio-religious struggles in Middle East, establishing statistics for the actual number of atheists in the country would be unreliable at best.\n\nIt has not been confirmed if the atheist cafe will be back in business.\n\n[Image from C.
