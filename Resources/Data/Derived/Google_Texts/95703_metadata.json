These were the eye-popping images and media events that signaled change in 2015: change in the ways we watch TV, in who was represented on TV, and significant events of the year covered by the media.\n\nAn infusion of diversity yielded an entertainment culture more reflective of the people watching, not least \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d Viola Davis gave a memorable acceptance speech after becoming the first African-American to win an Emmy for best actress in a drama for \u201cHTGAWM.\u201d Quoting Harriet Tubman, Davis thanked the network execs, the producers, writers and actors who have \u201credefined what it means to be beautiful, to be sexy, to be a leading woman, to be black.\u201d\n\nIn his Emmy acceptance speech for his role in \u201cTransparent,\u201d Jeffrey Tambor thanked the transgender community.\n\nJon Stewart signed off of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d after 16 years of speaking truth and silliness to power. His departure was a blow to liberals who felt it as a personal loss. His final show cemented his status as most valuable irreverent political player with the parting advice: \u201cIf you smell something, say something.\u201d\n\nImages from the April death of Freddie Gray while in the custody of Baltimore police and the Charleston church shooting in June were painful to watch. Yet it was the stark Walter Scott video that seemed most shocking, most prominent on every news channel: On April 4, a white South Carolina police officer gunned down an unarmed black man, firing eight times as Scott ran away. Graphic video was recorded by a bystander and replayed until it almost felt like a scene from a drama. The sight of an actual homicide, dissected frame by frame by analysts and ingrained in memory by viewers, was sickening.\n\nCivil unrest, affirming \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d caused the media to confront the usual dilemma as 24-hour cable news practically salivated at the potential for rioting: cameras and lights draw crowds and influence behavior, but coverage is important and necessary.\n\nInternationally, November\u2019s Paris attacks drew round-the-clock coverage plus introspection about the meaning of terrorism, security, refugees and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nThe Bruce Jenner sit-down with Diane Sawyer and subsequent bow of Caitlyn Jenner (complete with reality show) was an amazing combination of educational and titillating television. The ABC special was confusing: beyond the clarification of terms amid expert commentary, the celebrity angle complicated everything. Thankfully, there was more to it than the Kardashian connection. This was a landmark television moment.\n\nBill Cosby\u2019s reputation finally imploded. The moral authority the star exerted as the fictional Cliff Huxtable ended as his real-life persona came into focus: 35 women told their stories of being raped by Cosby in a New York magazine article in July. Saturation coverage ensued with multiple women taking to CNN to accuse Cosby.\n\nNBC\u2019s curious crisis management style was in evidence. The network let Brian Williams move to sister network MSNBC as a way to rehabilitate the admitted fabricator, suspended in February. The result: he\u2019s still smooth and likable on camera, but it may always feel like a corporate manipulation. (Lester Holt is doing just fine in the ratings since taking over \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d in June.) Donald Trump\u2019s hate speech resulted in his firing by NBC only after the network first issued a polite, distancing statement. It\u2019s not about ethics for NBC; it\u2019s about focus groups and PR.\n\nFox\u2019s \u201cEmpire\u201d maintained a stunning ratings climb, the clever \u201cMad Men\u201d finale (\u201cIt\u2019s the real thing!\u201d) closed out an uneven but notable AMC drama in May. NBC\u2019s pleasing \u201cThe Wiz Live!\u201d redeemed the network after lesser live TV attempts \u201cPeter Pan\u201d and \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d\n\nA year of proliferating podcasts, in the wake of the phenom that was \u201cSerial,\u201d brought digital talk shows on a wide range of topics. Consider \u201cFresh Air,\u201d \u201cThis American Life,\u201d \u201cMen in Blazers,\u201d \u201cFreakonomics,\u201d \u201cWTF with Marc Maron\u201d and more (see this list of 30: http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/the-30-best-podcasts-right-now).\n\nThe real loser of the GOP debate from the University of Colorado in October was CNBC. CNBC\u2019s John Harwood, Becky Quick, and Carl Quintanilla lost control from the start. Too long, too sloppy, too many candidates engaging in crosstalk.\n\nPolitics found a home in late-night TV. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d Kate McKinnon continued a fun run as Hillary Clinton. \u201cSNL\u201d reprised Tina Fey as Sarah Palin along with Amy Poehler as Hillary 2008. Donald Trump\u2019s appearance on the show was protested by Hispanics. Darrell Hammond returned to the show with his Trump impersonation. In the real world, the nearly 11-hour marathon Benghazi hearings in October were surprisingly riveting. The analysts\u2019 takeaway: \u201cMarathon Benghazi hearing leaves Hillary Clinton largely unscathed.\u201d\n\nMay\u2019s David Letterman sendoff after 33 years between NBC and CBS was a teary, significant endpoint for a man who changed the tone of TV comedy. Stephen Colbert\u2019s takeover of the CBS \u201cLate Show\u201d in September generated more heat before he debuted than since. It\u2019s been a smooth, if not ratings-rich transition.\n\nThe rise of streaming services continued to delight cord-cutters. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Crackle, Yahoo \u2026 there\u2019s no sense comparing them, because each offers different content. A lot of it. We hit \u201cpeak TV\u201d at 409 scripted series.\n\nTo cap the year, Steve Harvey mistakenly crowned the wrong Miss Universe contestant on live TV. The crown was removed from Miss Colombia and placed atop the actual winner, Miss Philippines. Harvey apologized on the air and, afterward, on Twitter, misspelling both Colombia and Philippines. The tweet has since been deleted.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or @ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Memorable TV media events of 2015: Anchors away, comedians, too", "title": "Memorable TV media events of 2015: Anchors away, comedians, too", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/memorable-tv-media-events-of-2015-anchors-away-comedians-too/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__20151225_C12_AE27TVMOMENTSp3.jpg", "height": 470}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151224__20151225_C12_AE27TVMOMENTSp3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T02:10:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:49:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "To cap the year, Steve Harvey mistakenly crowned the wrong Miss Universe contestant on live TV.\nDonald Trump\u2019s hate speech resulted in his firing by NBC only after the network first issued a polite, distancing statement.\nGraphic video was recorded by a bystander and replayed until it almost felt like a scene from a drama.\nThe sight of an actual homicide, dissected frame by frame by analysts and ingrained in memory by viewers, was sickening.\nInternationally, November\u2019s Paris attacks drew round-the-clock coverage plus introspection about the meaning of terrorism, security, refugees and anti-immigrant rhetoric."}
