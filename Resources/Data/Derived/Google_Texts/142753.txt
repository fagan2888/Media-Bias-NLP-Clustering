PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — Rhode Island residents looking to enroll or re-enroll in HealthSource RI will need to do so by December 23 to be covered for January 1.

Karen Biastre of Middletown was outraged when she went to re-enroll at HealthSource RI and astonished to see how much higher rates would be in 2015 for the same plan. Her complaints were echoed by many others who assumed what they were paying last year for health insurance would stay the same in 2015.

“I started questioning information I knew about the Affordable Care Act,” Biastre said. “We were promised that affordable healthcare would be provided to us at no cost above 8% of what your income is.”

Biastre questioned HealthSource RI about the change and was told the government bases a family’s income off of what they can afford for eight people, though she only has a family of three.

Consumer Reporter Susan Hogan brought Biastre’s concerns to Christine Ferguson, the Director of HealthSource RI.

“We have talked with congressional delegation, I’ve been to D.C. and talked to administration and congress about the fact that this is a problem,” Ferguson said.

Ferguson encourages customers to look at the plan comparisons and not just at the deductibles, but at the maximum out of pocket expenses.

Open enrollment ends on February 15, 2015. Customers can renew their coverage online at www.healthsourceri.com, over the phone at 1-855-840-4774, or in person by appointment or walk-in.
