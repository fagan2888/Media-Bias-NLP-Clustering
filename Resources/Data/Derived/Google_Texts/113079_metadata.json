(Photo: GEORGE WALKER IV/FILE )\n\nAttorney Rick Dumas said today that he won\u2019t campaign for a Davidson County General Sessions Court judgeship, though his name will appear on the August ballot as the Republican nominee.\n\nDumas, who was unopposed in last week\u2019s GOP primary, said he\u2019ll support Judge Rachel Bell, the Democratic nominee after winning her party\u2019s contested primary by a 13,000-vote margin.\n\n\u201cAfter much hard thought and deliberation and discussions with Ashley, I have decided not to run for General Sessions judge,\u201d Dumas wrote on Facebook. \u201cThere are a number of reasons, but primarily, the main reason is, is that my heart simply isn't in it. I think to make this happen, you have to be fully committed and you have to desire it greatly, and I just don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful to everyone who has encouraged me and the offers of help I have been given. Thank you so much. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think I can remove my name from the ballot, so my name will still be on it in August, but I would urge you to vote for my friend Rachel Bell. I look forward to working with her over the next 8 years.\u201d\n\nDumas confirmed his plans in a text message.\n\nReach Michael Cass at 615-259-8838 and on Twitter @tnmetro.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1n8FuqS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Attorney Rick Dumas said his \u2018heart simply isn\u2019t in it.\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Attorney Rick Dumas said his \u2018heart simply isn\u2019t in it.\u2019", "title": "Nashville GOP judge candidate drops out, supports Dem", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2014/05/17/nashville-gop-judge-candidate-drops-supports-dem/9228623/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Attorney Rick Dumas said his \u2018heart simply isn\u2019t in it.\u2019", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f07a2fd7d8aa1c76d23ddefb01b54bf9a37a0bf3/c=460-0-2908-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/17/nasbrd03-08-2012tennessean1b00220120307imgrachelbell002.jpg31sk.jpg", "title": "Nashville GOP judge candidate drops out, supports Dem", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/86a214346695e9a9e9381bf47b2b703346c635ab/c=766-0-2602-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/17/nasbrd03-08-2012tennessean1b00220120307imgrachelbell002.jpg31sk.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e873d092e7b6f3db2435692479499791771ff15b/c=460-0-2908-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/17/nasbrd03-08-2012tennessean1b00220120307imgrachelbell002.jpg31sk.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c863eaf2e84ae3d3b272b9e79f2b92470473fb0f/c=52-0-3316-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/17/nasbrd03-08-2012tennessean1b00220120307imgrachelbell002.jpg31sk.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12f1fc65c20c950b461f8bac8779c7dbc4d77670/c=0-277-3368-2171&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/17/nasbrd03-08-2012tennessean1b00220120307imgrachelbell002.jpg31sk.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-05-17T17:51:21-05:00", "shorthed": "Nashville judge candidate drops out", "articleid": 9228623, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9d1c93c1fcb396ff3b8d40a00404254cc8b0fee4/c=0-277-3368-2171/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/17/nasbrd03-08-2012tennessean1b00220120307imgrachelbell002.jpg31sk.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3038f0b9ba55db9727150ae6c5199bd7b5a7e0b/c=996-0-2373-2448/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/05/17/nasbrd03-08-2012tennessean1b00220120307imgrachelbell002.jpg31sk.jpg"}, "author": "Michael Cass", "title": "Nashville GOP judge candidate drops out, supports Dem", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0253\"", "article_summary": "General Sessions Judge Rachel Bell is now unopposed in the general election.\n\u201cAfter much hard thought and deliberation and discussions with Ashley, I have decided not to run for General Sessions judge,\u201d Dumas wrote on Facebook.\nDumas, who was unopposed in last week\u2019s GOP primary, said he\u2019ll support Judge Rachel Bell, the Democratic nominee after winning her party\u2019s contested primary by a 13,000-vote margin.\n\u201cThere are a number of reasons, but primarily, the main reason is, is that my heart simply isn't in it.\n(Photo: GEORGE WALKER IV/FILE )Attorney Rick Dumas said today that he won\u2019t campaign for a Davidson County General Sessions Court judgeship, though his name will appear on the August ballot as the Republican nominee."}
