In order to accept that money from the Department of Education, colleges and universities must receive a stamp of approval from independent, federally recognized accreditors.\n\nYet while financial aid for students and universities is in demand more than ever \u2013 with student debt totaling more than $1.2 trillion and counting \u2013 the federal government isn\u2019t doing enough to oversee which schools qualify to receive that money.\n\nRelated: How a College Education Can Close the Income Gap\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of a new report from the Government Accountability Office, which flags the Dept. of Education for not properly evaluating the independent accreditors responsible for deciding whether schools should receive accreditation or not.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nStudents as well as taxpayers are putting hundreds of billions of dollars toward federal student aid each year. Last year, federal student aid totaled $136 billion.\n\nRight now, these accreditors are more likely to penalize or reward schools based on their financial health, rather than how well their students are performing or how valuable their degrees are when they enter the job market, according to the GAO.\n\n\u201cOn average, accreditors were no more likely to issue terminations or probations to schools with weaker student outcomes compared to schools with stronger student outcomes,\u201d the auditors said.\n\nThe report suggested that accreditors very rarely yank accreditations from schools. For example, from October 2009 through March 2014, just 66 schools, or less than 1 percent of all schools, lost their accreditations. The majority of those were for-profit schools with financial issues.\n\nRelated: School Budgets: The Worst Education Money Can Buy\n\nThis is a problem: The GAO noted that students take on loans to attend accredited schools that in some cases \u201cdo not provide a quality education.\u201d\n\nThe auditors say the Dept. of Education should ramp up oversight of the accreditors, as well as find \u201cbetter ways to assess whether creditor standards effectively address academic quality.\u201d They suggest the agency use data to evaluate accreditors\u2019 decisions with student outcomes.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The federal government doles out roughly $100 billion in student aid each year in the", "title": "College Accreditors Care About Money, Not Students", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/23/Colleges-Are-Accredited-Regardless-Academic-Quality", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/08232011_college_construction_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/23/Colleges-Are-Accredited-Regardless-Academic-Quality", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/08232011_college_construction_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The federal government doles out roughly $100 billion in student aid each year in the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "WHY THIS MATTERSStudents as well as taxpayers are putting hundreds of billions of dollars toward federal student aid each year.\nLast year, federal student aid totaled $136 billion.\nThe federal government doles out roughly $100 billion in student aid each year in the form of Pell grants and subsidized student loans.\nIn order to accept that money from the Department of Education, colleges and universities must receive a stamp of approval from independent, federally recognized accreditors.\nof Education for not properly evaluating the independent accreditors responsible for deciding whether schools should receive accreditation or not."}
