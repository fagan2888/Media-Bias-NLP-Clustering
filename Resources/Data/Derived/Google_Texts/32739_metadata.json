With millions of seniors covered under Medicare, a comprehensive look into what options are available can save literally billions of dollars for enrollees.\n\nOverview Of Medicare Components\n\nMedicare Part A\u2014covers many costs for hospital stays; has no monthly premium; covers short-term nursing home, some home care and some hospice costs.\n\nOption of Part B\u2014has a monthly premium; covers 80 percent outpatient costs.\n\nOption of Medigap/Medicare Supplemental Policies\u2014offered by private carriers; in place to cover costs Part A and B do not cover.\n\nMedicare C (Medicare Advantage plans)\u2014offered by private insurance plans; are managed networked plans (like HMO, PPO); some have drug/vision/dental coverage; low or no monthly premiums; require enrollment in Part A & B\u2014no Medigap option.\n\nOption of Medicare Part D\u2014helps cover prescription drug costs; offered by private insurers; does not ensure 100 percent cost coverage, though.\n\nWhat Does Open Enrollment Involve?\n\nDuring the period between October 15 and December 7, current Medicare plan holders can opt to adjust their Medicare plans. Such potential moves include changing from traditional Medicare (Parts A and B) up to Medicare Advantage (Medicare C) plans--opening more benefits through private health plans; changing Medicare Advantage plans for those already at that tier of coverage; changing Part D prescription plan carriers.\n\nOverview Of 2015 Medicare Changes\n\n\u201cThe big picture? There will be fewer plans, higher premiums and more deductibles,\u201d Diane C. Lade from the Sun Sentinel says.\n\nMost changes occurring are seen for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. There is a reported decrease in Medicare Advantage plans available, \u201cThere will be 1,945 plans in 2015, compared with 2,014 plans in the last enrollment period,\u201d MarketWatch says.\n\nPart D changes are more complex, with plans disappearing, inconsistent deductible changes, inconsistent copays and premium changes.\n\nPlan Changes--Among top Part D plans to disappear are AARP MedicareRx Enhanced, SilverScript Basic and Aetna/CVS.\n\nPremium Changes--\u201cNearly 10 million people now enrolled in six of the 10 largest Part D drug plans face premium increases ranging from 11 to 52 percent if they don\u2019t switch to a different plan. Three other large plans, with nearly 3.5 million members, will drop their premiums by 13 to 31 percent\u201d says AARP.\n\nDeductible Increase--Drug deductibles will increase in 2015 AARP reports, \u201cThe maximum Part D annual drug deductible rises by $10, to $320, in 2014. More plans will charge a deductible (from $1 to $320) and fewer will wave the deductible.\u201d There is an expected rise of 4 percent\u2014while that does not sound huge, that is the expected average. Kaiser Family Foundation notes that number \u201cmasks a significant amount of variation across plans\u2026enrollees in six of the 10 most popular [stand-alone plans] will experience double-digit premium increases if they stay in the same plans in 2015, while enrollees in three of the 10 most popular [stand-alone plans] will see double-digit premium decreases\u201d\n\nDoughnut Hole Disappearing--Part D doughnut hole is disappearing, AARP states. \u201cIn 2015, you get more discounts in the drug coverage gap.\u201d They continue, \u201cMedicare officials say that shrinking the gap, a result of the 2010 Affordable Care Act has already saved 8.3 million enrollees more than $12 billion.\u201d\n\nCopay Changes--\u201cCopays differ enormously among Part D plans, even for the same drug\u2014and can vary by more than $100 for a month\u2019s supply, according to an AARP Bulletin analysis. For example, among 31 plans in California, the insulin drug Lantus SoloSTAR will cost between $24 and $170 for a 30-day supply in 2015\u2014with 14 plans charging under $45 a month and eight plans charging over $80,\u201d AARP reports.\n\nOne thing will give temporary reprieve, though, for Medicare enrollees: Medicare Part B premium (covering doctor visits, outpatient services) will not change for 2015.\n\nWhat Considerations Need To Be Made During Open Enrollment?\n\nAccording to Tricia Neuman, director of the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Program on Medicare, the problem many seniors face is that they do not fully consider the changes that are implemented each year, which inevitably can affect their financial situation.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that people tend to pick a plan and stick with it,\u201d Neuman says. \u201cNow is the time for them to take stock of what providers are covered by their plan and make a decision if they want to stay.\u201d\n\nQuinlan Care LLC (a Medicare, health and life insurance brokerage) owner Robert Quinlan said that there are particular questions each enrollee needs to ask:\n\nAre your doctors and hospitals still accepting patients under the original Medicare Parts A and B? If you are in a Medicare Advantage plan, similar question: are your doc\u2019s and hospitals still in the carrier\u2019s network of providers? With Medicare Plan D coverage, are your medications still covered by your current plan? Do you have to upgrade your current Part D plan to cover new medications?\n\nIn other words, enrollees must compare out-of-pocket costs and coverage between current plans and other available plans, looking beyond premiums and copays.\n\nWhile just asking these questions may still elicit confusion, medicare.gov has established a \u201cplan finder\u201d that can help immensely. For example, when considering Plan D options, simply inputting a zip code can provide specific results; the more information provided (Medicare ID number, names of prescription drugs), the more accurate the plan finder results will be.\n\nThis article was a collaboration between Joe Young and Benzinga personal finance writer Rebecca Sheppard.\n\nPlus:\n\nCreating Curb Appeal When The Weather Turns Crummy\n\nBe R.E.A.D.Y. - How To Draft Financial Plans\n\nThe Dark Side Of A Generation's Frugality", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "nasdaq news, market headlines, market news, stock market headlines, stock market news", "og": {"url": "http://www.nasdaq.com/article/medicare-changes-for-2015-cm413312", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "site_name": "NASDAQ.com", "title": "Medicare Changes For 2015"}, "Robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "nasdaq news, market headlines, market news, stock market headlines, stock market news", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-12T10:43:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Open Enrollment for Medicare is underway, having begun October 15 and set to end December 7.In case the 152 page Medicare.gov 2015 Medicare handbook."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20dd\"", "article_summary": "Part D changes are more complex, with plans disappearing, inconsistent deductible changes, inconsistent copays and premium changes.\nDuring the period between October 15 and December 7, current Medicare plan holders can opt to adjust their Medicare plans.\nIn case the 152 page Medicare.gov 2015 Medicare handbook is daunting, a more condensed overview of the changes may be beneficial.\nSuch potential moves include changing from traditional Medicare (Parts A and B) up to Medicare Advantage (Medicare C) plans--opening more benefits through private health plans; changing Medicare Advantage plans for those already at that tier of coverage; changing Part D prescription plan carriers.\nOne thing will give temporary reprieve, though, for Medicare enrollees: Medicare Part B premium (covering doctor visits, outpatient services) will not change for 2015."}
