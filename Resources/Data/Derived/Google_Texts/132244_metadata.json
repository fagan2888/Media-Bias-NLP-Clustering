(NYSE: AME) is set to buy Watermill Group portfolio company Global Tubes, a manufacturer of precision metal tubing, for $200 million. (See our video with Watermill Group's John Carr below.)\n\nThe Berwyn, Pennsylvania-based buyer, which was an especially active acquirer in 2014, is known for making electronic instruments and devices. The purchase of Global Tubes expands Ametek's high-precision metal tubing manufacturing capabilities.\n\nGlobal Tubes will be folded into Ametek's electromechanical group, a supplier of specialty metals and thermal management systems. The company was formed in 2012 after Watermill purchased, and later merged, two different businesses: Devon, U.K.-based Fine Tubes Ltd. and Collegeville, Pennsylvania-based Superior Tube Company Inc.\n\nThe Lexington, Massachusetts-based firm also streamlined Global Tubes' operations, increased production capacity and upgraded equipment. Ametek had contacted Watermill before an auction even began, according to managing director Steve Karol.\n\n\"It was a direct negotiation with no intermediary,\" he adds. Law firm Goodwin Procter LLP provided legal counsel with a team led by partner James Lee.\n\nThe sale was announced on the heels of Watermill's acquisition of Mountain Molding, which was valued at around $10 million. The Longmont, Colorado-based company will be added to portfolio company Tenere Inc., a provider of metal and plastic components.\n\n\"Tenere has been doing extremely well since we bought it,\" Karol says. \"It's in a pretty good cash position and was able to do the deal out of pocket.\" Tenere is currently looking at two other M&A opportunities, he adds.\n\nFor more on the manufacturing sector, see Manufacturing Deals Reassemble 5 Significant Sectors.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/manufacturing/ametek-acquires-watermill-backed-global-tubes-256196-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/fine-tubes.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Ametek Acquires Watermill-backed <br>Global Tubes"}}, "article_summary": "Global Tubes will be folded into Ametek's electromechanical group, a supplier of specialty metals and thermal management systems.\nThe purchase of Global Tubes expands Ametek's high-precision metal tubing manufacturing capabilities.\nThe Lexington, Massachusetts-based firm also streamlined Global Tubes' operations, increased production capacity and upgraded equipment.\nThe Longmont, Colorado-based company will be added to portfolio company Tenere Inc., a provider of metal and plastic components.\nAmetek Acquires Watermill-backedGlobal TubesThe deal was announced on the heels of Watermill's bolt-on acquisition of Mountain Molding for portfolio company TenereAmetek Inc.
