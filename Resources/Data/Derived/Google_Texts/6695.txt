I believe in Alaska! This is truly the land of opportunity, and serving in public office is a way to give back to the State I have lived in since birth. I want to help shape the state for future generations, and Alaskans of all ages. Ensuring we have world class educational opportunities, a healthy vibrant economy and a place that people want to live and raise a family, and retire in is paramount. There is no challenge to great that we cannot overcome if we all work together.
