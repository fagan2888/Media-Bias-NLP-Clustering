In May, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus called for the integration of more women into the Navy, and in a speech at Annapolis, Maryland, vowed to open more service options for females, the Daily Caller reported. He also said then body-fat limits for sailors would be increased in order to accommodate more females.

Come January, men in the age ranges of 22 to 29 will be allowed to carry up to 23 percent body fat, an increase of 1 percent from those in the 18-to-21-year-old age grouping, the Daily Caller reported. Meanwhile, those males between the ages of 30 to 39 will be allowed body-fat ratings of 24 percent, and those over the age of 40, up to 26 percent body fat.

For women, the body-fat percentages for those aged 18 to 21 is 33 percent; the standard will hike to 34 percent for women aged 22 to 29. And for those between 30 and 39, it will rise to 35 percent. Women over the age of 40, meanwhile, can carry up to 36 percent body fat, the Daily Caller reported.

Navy officials say they’re trying to move away from “one size fits all” standards.

“We like to speak of a culture of fitness, but we really haven’t implemented a culture of fitness across the Navy,” Vice Adm. Bill Moran, chief of naval personnel, told Navy Times. “Fitness should truly be about being healthy and mission readiness: Are you physically fit for times of combat and stress in the fleet? We need a system that speaks to better health, to the readiness of our sailors. And part of that is, are we doing things to encourage a culture of fitness.”
