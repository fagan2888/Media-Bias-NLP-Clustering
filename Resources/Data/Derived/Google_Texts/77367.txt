MANILA – Filipino nurses stand to gain from the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the U.S. Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare.”

In a statement, Pasig City Rep. Roman Romulo, House committee on higher and technical education chairman, said the Philippine units of Accenture and EXL Service Holdings have ramped up hiring of Filipino nurses particularly at their hubs in Cebu City.

Both Accenture and EXL provide outsourced business support services to American health insurers. Accenture has 16 Philippine centers, while EXL has three.

“Both firms are signing up Filipino nurses with US licenses as well as those who have passed the NCLEX but still without US licenses,” said Romulo, referring to the National Council Licensure Examination, the U.S. counterpart of the Philippines’ Nursing Licensure Exam.

“There’s no question Obamacare is driving US health insurers to transfer additional contact center, insurance claims processing, clinical support analysis, medical coding, and other non-core, business support jobs to the Philippines, either through independent BPO providers, or through in-house back offices,” Romulo said.

The US law puts pressure on health insurers to lower their premiums and expand their coverage of uninsured Americans, regardless of pre-existing conditions or sex.
