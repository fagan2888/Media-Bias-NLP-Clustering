More recently, the Kendall-Endicott neighborhood in Table Mesa has earned the same designation.\n\nBee Safe Boulder's goal is to eventually make all of Boulder County bee safe. The organization is fighting against the use of pesticides that contain neonicotinoids, neurotoxic chemicals that many see as linked to the global phenomenon of colony collapse.\n\nBee Safe Boulder recently received a $5,000 grant from Beyond Pesticides.\n\nBee Safe Boulder works with the Living Systems Institute in Golden, which is championing the cause of bee safe neighborhoods. David Braden, who works at the Living Systems Institute, came up with the concept of a bee safe neighborhood.\n\nMelody-Catalpa resident Chris Allsopp, a beekeeper, estimated that there seven to nine bee hives in the neighborhood, many of which he has placed in various backyards.\n\n\"We had an allergic reaction to pesticides, and we got hives,\" joked Wheeler, also known as \"Bee Safe David.\" He participated in the walkabout while wearing a bee costume \u2014 which he also sported while competing in the Bolder Boulder.\n\nSome neighborhood residents wore tee shirts that said \"Bee Safe Neighborhood. No Bees, No Food.\"\n\nAt one stop in the walkabout, participants viewed a bee hive while Wheeler and Allsopp explained bees' part in the ecosystem.\n\nWheeler said that even though there were a lot of bees buzzing around, nobody was getting stung because the bees were too busy.\n\nBut the advocates acknowledged not everyone wants to stop using pesticides.\n\n\"Some people are always going to want their pretty lawn,\" Wheeler said.\n\nSince Melody-Catalpa has become bee safe, residents have noticed a lot more bees in the area.\n\n\"We're always trying to get people to stop using pesticides,\" said Rella Abernathy, Boulder's Integrated Pest Management Coordinator.\n\nGary Strohm, a local realtor, was impressed with the conscientiousness showed by those in the neighborhood.\n\n\"Things happen in Boulder that don't happen anywhere else,\" Strohm said.\n\nGo Boulder led the walkabout as part of its Boulder Walks program, which, according to Boulder bike and pedestrian transportation planner Marni Ratzel, celebrates the community, social and health benefits of walking.\n\nParticipants in the walkabout, primarily residents of the Melody-Catalpa neighborhood, gave Go Boulder feedback on how to better the walking experience in the neighborhood.\n\n\"I think everyone on the walk learned something about their neighborhood,\" Ratzel said. More walkabouts are being planned for other Boulder neighborhoods, he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26528529/boulders-first-bee-safe-neighborhood-struts-its-stuff", "sailthru.author": "By Sam Klomhaus \n \n  For the Camera", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26528529:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-13T16:26:55-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Bees joined a group walk in Boulder today, and, perhaps sensing the visitors' friendly intentions, no one reported being stung.", "title": "Boulder's first bee-safe neighborhood struts its stuff", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26528529/boulders-first-bee-safe-neighborhood-struts-its-stuff", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0913/20140913__14dcabeew.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2014-09-13T17:11:35-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-13T16:22:23-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Sam KlomhausFor", "pubDate": "2014-09-13T16:30:16-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-13T16:26:55-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder's first bee-safe neighborhood struts its stuff", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0913/20140913__14dcabeew_300.jpg", "description": "Bees joined a group walk in Boulder today, and, perhaps sensing the visitors' friendly intentions, no one reported being stung.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26528529/boulders-first-bee-safe-neighborhood-struts-its-stuff", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Bees joined a group walk in Boulder today, and, perhaps sensing the visitors' friendly intentions, no one reported being stung.", "title": "Boulder's first bee-safe neighborhood struts its stuff"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0913/20140913__14dcabeew.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca11a\"", "article_summary": "Bee Safe Boulder works with the Living Systems Institute in Golden, which is championing the cause of bee safe neighborhoods.\nBee Safe Boulder's goal is to eventually make all of Boulder County bee safe.\nSome neighborhood residents wore tee shirts that said \"Bee Safe Neighborhood.\nDavid Braden, who works at the Living Systems Institute, came up with the concept of a bee safe neighborhood.\nMelody-Catalpa has been bee safe since early May, thanks largely to the efforts of David Wheeler, Anne Bliss and Molly Greacen, the founders of Bee Safe Boulder."}
