So when British teen Melissa Sutton went to the doctor for a sports injury and was diagnosed with a pulled muscle, she thought everything would be fine.\n\nEverything wasn\u2019t fine, however. The 16-year-old, from Rochdale, UK, had pain in her lower rib cage and shortness of breath, but every time she went to the doctor it was the same story \u2014 nothing but a pulled muscle. It wasn\u2019t until her mother rushed her to the ER that the real cause of her pain and discomfort was revealed: It was Ewing sarcoma, a rare type of bone cancer.\n\n\u201cWe felt like our world had been turned upside down when we were given the diagnosis,\u201d Alison Brookes, Melissa\u2019s mom, told news.com.au. \u201cFor months we knew something was wrong, but we weren\u2019t listened to. We were just fobbed off.\u201d\n\nEwing sarcoma is a tumor that forms in the bone or soft tissue and is common in teens and children. The survival rate of the cancer for children under 15 is 76 percent, while the survival rate for teens 15 to 19 is 60 percent.\n\n\u201cWhen I was diagnosed with cancer it was a huge shock. It was news that no teenage girl wants to hear, Sutton said. \u201cThe treatment has made me [feel] very poorly, but I am just glad the cancer was detected when it was.\u201d\n\nShe has had 12 rounds of chemotherapy since the cancer was found, with three more scheduled for later this year. By the time Sutton is done, she\u2019ll have completed 30 rounds of radiotherapy altogether. Although she was initially concerned about losing her hair, she knows now that she is bald for a reason. \u201cI want to raise awareness so that other people who experience the same symptoms don\u2019t give up and trust their instincts,\u201d Sutton said.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t yet been any movement by the family against the doctor or doctors who diagnosed her initially, according to Raj Patel, medical director for NHS England in Greater Manchester and Lancashire. \u201cOur priority is to ensure that patients receive the highest quality primary care services at all times. We have not yet received a complaint by Alison or her family, but should we do so, we will take the issue forward and investigate it thoroughly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cancer misdiagnosis ewing sarcoma", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "What doctors mistook for a pulled muscle in a British teen was actually Ewing sarcoma, a rare bone cancer.", "title": "Teen Fighting Rare Bone Cancer After Doctors Mistake It For A Pulled Muscle", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-misdiagnosis-doctors-called-it-pulled-muscle-when-it-was-actually-rare-bone-348204", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/17/misdiagnosis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What doctors mistook for a pulled muscle in a British teen was actually Ewing sarcoma, a rare bone cancer.", "title": "Teen Fighting Rare Bone Cancer After Doctors Mistake It For A Pulled Muscle", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-misdiagnosis-doctors-called-it-pulled-muscle-when-it-was-actually-rare-bone-348204", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/17/misdiagnosis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/17/misdiagnosis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-17T17:50:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-17T17:50:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "What doctors mistook for a pulled muscle in a British teen was actually Ewing sarcoma, a rare bone cancer."}, "article_summary": "So when British teen Melissa Sutton went to the doctor for a sports injury and was diagnosed with a pulled muscle, she thought everything would be fine.\nIt wasn\u2019t until her mother rushed her to the ER that the real cause of her pain and discomfort was revealed: It was Ewing sarcoma, a rare type of bone cancer.\nThe survival rate of the cancer for children under 15 is 76 percent, while the survival rate for teens 15 to 19 is 60 percent.\n\u201cWhen I was diagnosed with cancer it was a huge shock.\nWe were just fobbed off.\u201dEwing sarcoma is a tumor that forms in the bone or soft tissue and is common in teens and children."}
