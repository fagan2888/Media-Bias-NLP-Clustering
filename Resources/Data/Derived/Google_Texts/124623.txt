Sioux Falls, SD

Students at George McGovern Middle School in Sioux Falls dedicated part of their day to learning about Martin Luther King, Jr. While the civil rights activist's "I Have A Dream" speech is more than 50 years old, the message still has an impact on students today.

It's not your standard Monday on the northwest side of town. It's a special day and sixth graders like these know it.

Kayli Cwach: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

Matt Holsen: What did you learn today in class about him?

Cwach: That he had an 'I Have A Dream' speech that talks about people that can't be judged by the color of their skin but how they actually are.

Several classrooms at McGovern focused on Martin Luther King, Jr.

From his iconic speech to life of non-violent activism, King's story is still relevant and some would say his message is still needed.

"I think it's good because people shouldn't be hating on other people just for the color of their skin and where they come from," Ramiro Ordonez said.

Ordonez tries to show his character by getting good grades. He says in a school full of people of different backgrounds, he also tries to treat others the right way.

"Yeah, because people need to come together because this is a free country. That's why the people came to this country, for freedom," Ordonez said.

Some of the students reading King's famous speech in this story are part of the school's immersion program and have been in the country less than two years.
