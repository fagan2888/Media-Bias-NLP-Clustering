It also includes genetic tests for BRCA 1 and 2.\n\n[Also: University of Michigan Health spends $160 million to upgrade lab testing]\n\nInvitae announced the pricing at this week\u2019s American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting.\n\n\u201cMost of the conversations about reimbursement for genetic testing have focused on economic issues. However, an under-appreciated dimension in using genetic testing for genetic care is an ethical one. For years, many people and their families have not had the benefit of clearly indicated genetic testing due to unwillingness of third-party payers to pay the historically high cost,\u201d Robert Nussbaum, Invitae\u2019s incoming chief medical officer who is currently the chief of the Division of Genomic Medicine at UCSF Health, said in a statement.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\n\u201cNow that the genetics market is becoming a generic market\u2014and thanks to the ongoing innovations and cost reductions in sample preparation, sequencing and medical interpretation\u2014we are beginning to see the benefits translated into affordable testing for patients.\u201d\n\nInvitae isn\u2019t the only company trying to bring down the costs for genetic testing, especially for BRCA 1 and 2 since a positive test can mean a person\u2019s risk for certain cancers skyrockets. Silicon Valley-based Color Genomics is marketing a $250 \u201cspit test\u201d for BRCA 1 and 2 that patients can mail to its laboratories for testing.\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/invitae-sidesteps-insurance-offers-genetic-tests-475-flat-fee", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/DNA-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Invitae has rolled out a one-price-fits-all payment model for its range of tests, charging a set $475 for any test for patients who don't go through their health insurance.", "title": "Invitae sidesteps insurance, offers genetic tests for $475 flat fee"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/DNA-feature.gif"}, "description": "Invitae has rolled out a one-price-fits-all payment model for its range of tests, charging a set $475 for any test for patients who don't go through their health insurance.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Invitae sidesteps insurance, offers genetic tests for $475 flat fee"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "San Francisco-based genetic testing company Invitae has rolled out a one-price-fits-all payment model for its range of tests, charging a set $475 for any test for patients who don\u2019t go through their health insurance.&#13; The company\u2019s genetic tests are usually billed at $950 for in-network providers or $1,500 or out-of-network providers, a cost that is often passed on to patients as more people than ever are enrolled in high-deductible plans.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb21\"", "article_summary": "However, an under-appreciated dimension in using genetic testing for genetic care is an ethical one.\n\u201cMost of the conversations about reimbursement for genetic testing have focused on economic issues.\nIt also includes genetic tests for BRCA 1 and 2.\nSan Francisco-based genetic testing company Invitae has rolled out a one-price-fits-all payment model for its range of tests, charging a set $475 for any test for patients who don\u2019t go through their health insurance.\nInvitae has rolled out a one-price-fits-all payment model for its range of tests, charging a set $475 for any test for patients who don't go through their health insurance."}
