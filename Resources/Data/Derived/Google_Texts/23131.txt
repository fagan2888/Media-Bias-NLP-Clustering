Helen Lovejoy/Michele Bachmann

Michele Bachmann may want to use Helen Lovejoy's shrieking catchphrase, "Won't somebody think of the" as her campaign slogan. After all, Bachmann certainly has thought of them enough -- she claims to have raised 23 foster kids as well as five of her own. Plus, despite her small-government credentials, she's so intent on imposing sexual morality that we could easily see her getting up in arms about Springfield's burlesque house.
