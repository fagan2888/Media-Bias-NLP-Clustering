So far fundraising for his super PAC has been weak, but the Kochs aren\u2019t taking any chances.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that \u201cthe billionaire Koch brothers and scores of wealthy allies have set an initial 2014 fundraising target of $290 million which should boost GOP candidates and support dozens of conservative groups \u2014 including a new energy initiative with what looks like a deregulatory, pro-consumer spin.\u201d Here\u2019s more:\n\nA few Koch network-backed nonprofit groups including [Americans for Prosperity] have long fought against climate change regulations, a carbon tax, and subsidies for renewable energy. But lately, the Koch universe seem to be facing bigger energy threats stemming from Washington, state governments and big liberal checkbooks. The new energy initiative is the handiwork of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the Koch network\u2019s central fundraising hub, which was established in late 2011 as a trade group, according to an email to the group\u2019s members from [Koch fundraiser Kevin] Gentry. In 2012, the fledgling group \u2014 which claims some 200 members who each kick in at least $100,000 yearly \u2014 funneled over $230 million dollars to numerous other non-profits in the Koch ecosystem according to the group\u2019s 2012 tax returns. \u2026 Gentry\u2019s email stressed that liberal donors, led by hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer, have plans to spend as much as $100 million on climate change issues and ads to make it a top-tier issue in the election. He noted that environmental groups had recently run a $5 million \u201cclean energy\u201d ad blitz in Iowa, Michigan, and North Carolina, all of which are considered \u201cfocus\u201d states for Freedom Partners and among the states where Americans for Prosperity has spent over $35 million on attack ads against Democratic Senate candidates on Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough that the Kochs and their pals want to condemn you to climatic misery. They also want to prevent you from accessing affordable health care. Those issues are mostly unrelated but, in Gentry\u2019s email, he links them, opining that the \u201cnew multi million dollar campaign by environmentalists is arguably an effort to distract from the failures of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBecause with all of the environmental challenges facing the U.S. and the world, what else would environmentalists want to do but \u201cdistract\u201d voters from an affordable health-care law?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/koch-brothers-blimp-detail.jpg?w=50", "sailthru.author": "John Upton", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "The brothers and their allies are gearing up to spend $290 million on this year\u2019s elections, including money for a new energy initiative.", "title": "The Kochs are cooking up a new dirty-energy political scheme", "url": "http://grist.org/politics/the-kochs-are-cooking-up-a-new-dirty-energy-political-scheme/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/koch-brothers-blimp-detail.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/koch-brothers-blimp-detail.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "grist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-16 20:36:57", "robots": "noodp", "sailthru.title": "The Kochs are cooking up a new dirty-energy political scheme", "msapplication-tooltip": "We're an online news organization that uses humor to interpret green issues & inspire environmental action.", "p": {"domain_verify": "c293daabda398bd8ceee45abea0b3201"}, "fb": {"app_id": 548917378618963}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Grist", "sailthru.tags": "climate-energy, news, politics, john-upton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/grist.org", "published_time": "2014-06-17T00:36:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T02:52:41+00:00"}, "sailthru.description": "The brothers and their allies are gearing up to spend $290 million on this year's elections, including money for a new energy initiative.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/koch-brothers-blimp-detail.jpg", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://grist.org/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/330e84b0272aae748d059cd70e3f8f8d?s=16", "description": "The brothers and their allies are gearing up to spend $290 million on this year's elections, including money for a new energy initiative."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa48\"", "article_summary": "So far fundraising for his super PAC has been weak, but the Kochs aren\u2019t taking any chances.\nThe Koch brothers have seen Tom Steyer\u2019s $100 million bet and they\u2019re raising it by almost $200 million more.\nSteyer, billionaire hedge-fund manager turned climate activist, set a goal earlier this year of spending $100 million in the 2014 midterm elections to support candidates who care about climate change.\nIt\u2019s not enough that the Kochs and their pals want to condemn you to climatic misery.\nBut lately, the Koch universe seem to be facing bigger energy threats stemming from Washington, state governments and big liberal checkbooks."}
