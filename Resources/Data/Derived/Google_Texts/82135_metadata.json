In addition to locking in ad rates and inventory access for Omnicom agencies, the arrangement will also give the holding company a \u201cfirst look\u201d at new ad units and opportunities being developed by the social network. Like many of these deals, it will include an element of \u201cresearch,\u201d the companies said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first holding company agreement we\u2019ve done on the mobile ad exchange side,\u201d said Twitter\u2019s president of global revenue, Adam Bain, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s great for us because we\u2019ll now have high-quality advertisers coming through the exchange.\u201d\n\nTwitter has struck similar partnerships with other holding companies over the past two years. Last April it signed one with Publicis-owned Starcom MediaVest Group worth a reported $200 million over two years, for example.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bain, each of these deals is different, depending on what the agency wants from the social network. \u201cEach one is unique. They\u2019re rooted in the unique points of view these agencies bring,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis one is unique because it focusses on the tech part of how ads will be delivered.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, ads purchased programmatically from Twitter only show up across third-party sites in its MoPub network, but the social network plans to let marketers buy ads on its own site soon that way too.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made an announcement about opening up Twitter to programmatic buys, but it\u2019s natural that we\u2019ll do it,\u201d Mr. Bain said. Based on this new relationship with Omnicom, it\u2019s possible the agency group will be the first to do so.\n\n\u201cOur agreement with Twitter reflects what we look for in a media partnership \u2013 the opportunity to deliver first-to-market benefits that impact all aspects of all Omnicom clients\u2019 digital investments, from content to placement to measurement,\u201c a statement from Omnicom read.\n\nTwitter isn\u2019t the only social network striking this type of deal, of course. Last week Facebook signed a multi-year deal with Publicis worth \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars. That arrangement is designed to more closely integrate the two companies\u2019 data, the pair said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Omnicom Media Group announced a mobile-focused deal with Twitter on Tuesday, worth $230 million over the next two years.
