And Democrats were nearly as adamant about this point as Republicans (71 percent to 87 percent).\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Aces Democratic Debate, Sending Red Flag to Biden\n\nThat is something to keep in mind in the wake of Tuesday night\u2019s first Democratic presidential debate of the season in Las Vegas, where Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont appeared on shaky ground whenever the topic of defense and national security came up.\n\nThe self-described Democratic socialist has startled the political world with his strong challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, largely on the strength of his populist salvos against Wall Street and repeated demands for income equality for the middle class.\n\nBut his major claim to fame in matters of defense and national security is that \u2013 unlike Clinton \u2013 he voted against the Iraq war in 2002, and has devoted his energies to beefing up Veterans Affairs Department services for veterans.\n\nSanders, 74, seemed to struggle in explaining why \u2013 as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War and long-time critic of U.S. intervention overseas \u2013 he was qualified to be the country\u2019s next commander in chief. It didn\u2019t help that he was bracketed on the debate stage by Clinton, the hawkish former secretary of state, and former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, a decorated Marine and one-time Navy Secretary who repeatedly boasted of his military experience.\n\nRelated: Can Russia Afford Its Syria Campaign\n\n\u201cWhen I was a young man \u2013 I\u2019m not a young man today \u2013 I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat was my view then . . . I am not a pacifist.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientist Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, noted that in 2008, Barack Obama had problems on national security as well as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination, \u201cand Sanders is more pacifist than Obama.\u201d\n\nDuring last night\u2019s debate, Sanders stressed that he has supported some military intervention \u2013 including former president Bill Clinton\u2019s decision to intervene in the war in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing. But he opposes U.S. intervention in Syria or any other country that in his view doesn\u2019t directly threaten U.S. national security.\n\n\u201cWar should be the last resort,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got to exercise diplomacy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Is Raking In the Cash, $25 at a Time\n\nYet Sanders looked weak and tentative contrasted with Hillary Clinton, who at one point said that the U.S. must stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cbullying,\u201d especially in Syria.\n\nSanders was a conscientious objector as a young man during the Vietnam War era, and as mayor of Burlington he condemned Reagan administration support of military action again the communist Sandinistas in Nicaragua.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In post-recession America, when three quarters of people surveyed say they are as conc", "title": "Is Sanders Too Soft on Defense for Mainstream Democrats?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/14/Sanders-Too-Soft-Defense-Mainstream-Democrats", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/bernie_sanders_delivering_speech.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/14/Sanders-Too-Soft-Defense-Mainstream-Democrats", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/bernie_sanders_delivering_speech.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In post-recession America, when three quarters of people surveyed say they are as conc", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca05\"", "article_summary": "But he opposes U.S. intervention in Syria or any other country that in his view doesn\u2019t directly threaten U.S. national security.\nRelated: Can Russia Afford Its Syria Campaign\u201cWhen I was a young man \u2013 I\u2019m not a young man today \u2013 I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam,\u201d Sanders said.\nAnd Democrats were nearly as adamant about this point as Republicans (71 percent to 87 percent).\nSanders was a conscientious objector as a young man during the Vietnam War era, and as mayor of Burlington he condemned Reagan administration support of military action again the communist Sandinistas in Nicaragua.\nSanders, 74, seemed to struggle in explaining why \u2013 as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War and long-time critic of U.S. intervention overseas \u2013 he was qualified to be the country\u2019s next commander in chief."}
