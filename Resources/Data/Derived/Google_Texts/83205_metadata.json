They also took surveys to measure depression, self-esteem and life satisfaction. Not surprisingly, the researchers found, LGBT-related abuse at school was tied to negative adjustment during young adulthood. The abuse occurred whether the students tried to hide their sexual orientations or not.\n\n\u201cI think one of the sobering things we learned is that saying you\u2019re out to others is linked to victimization and saying you need to hide was linked to victimization,\u201d Russell said.\n\nBut after accounting for abuse, people who were \"out\" at school were better adjusted in young adulthood, compared to people who weren\u2019t out.\n\nThe study can't prove that being out as an adolescent guarantees better adjustment later on. And the researchers caution that the results can\u2019t be applied to all LGBT youths. Russell hopes to confirm the findings in an ongoing study with nearly 900 participants.\n\nCo-author Caitlin Ryan said the results point to the need for schools to have trained staff and policies that protect all students.\n\n\u201cWe still have school settings where there aren\u2019t policies in place,\u201d said Ryan, director of the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University.\n\nSean Cahill, who was not involved with the new study but co-authored the 2012 book \"LGBT Youth in America\u2019s Schools,\" agreed that it's important to help youth to be out at school.\n\nWays to do that include statewide LGBT youth initiatives to help schools create safe environments, said Cahill, who directs health policy research at The Fenway Institute of Fenway Health, which provides healthcare to the LGBT community in Boston.\n\nGay-straight alliances are known to create better school environments for students whether they\u2019re out or not, he said. Also, having openly LGBT role models in schools is beneficial.\n\nTeaching about LGBT historical figures, such as Walt Whitman and Gertrude Stein, also helps create an accepting environment, said Cahill.\n\nFor adolescents, Russell said, it\u2019s beneficial to think through a plan of the coming out process, possibly with the help of adults. Plans should consider sources of support, and vulnerabilities, he said.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s promising about this study is even though coming out comes with risks, being out is going to come with benefits in the long run,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study was published online in November and appears in print this month.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1ETqPfl American Journal of Osteopsychiatry, published February 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lgbt, adults, are, better, adjusted, if, they, were, out, school", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have better self esteem and less depression as young adults if they were open about their sexual orientations as adolescents.", "title": "LGBT Adults Are Better Adjusted If They Were 'Out' In School", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lgbt-adults-are-better-adjusted-if-they-were-out-school-321778", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/11/lgbt-self-esteem.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have better self esteem and less depression as young adults if they were open about their sexual orientations as adolescents.", "title": "LGBT Adults Are Better Adjusted If They Were 'Out' In School", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/lgbt-adults-are-better-adjusted-if-they-were-out-school-321778", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/11/lgbt-self-esteem.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/11/lgbt-self-esteem.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-02-11T11:16:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-11T11:16:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have better self esteem and less depression as young adults if they were open about their sexual orientations as adolescents."}, "article_summary": "Gay-straight alliances are known to create better school environments for students whether they\u2019re out or not, he said.\nBut after accounting for abuse, people who were \"out\" at school were better adjusted in young adulthood, compared to people who weren\u2019t out.\nThe new findings are from a study of 245 LGBT young adults in California, ages 21 to 25, who reported their openness with their sexual orientations during middle and high school.\nLesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have better self esteem and less depression as young adults if they were open about their sexual orientations as adolescents, a new study suggests.\nThe abuse occurred whether the students tried to hide their sexual orientations or not."}
