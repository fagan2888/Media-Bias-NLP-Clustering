How do you measure a year? There’s always daylights, sunsets, midnights and cups of coffee, as suggested in the musical Rent — or there’s Democrats’ failures, as suggested by the National Republican Congressional Committee.

To close out 2013, the NRCC compiled a list of the “35 Biggest Democrat Fails.” And there are definitely some priceless fails.

“Whether it’s ObamaCare’s rocky implementation, the party’s sharply dropping poll numbers, or President Obama awarded the ‘Lie of the Year,’ 2013 was an absolute disaster for Democrats,” the post’s author, Matt Gorman, told Red Alert Politics in an email. “Before we ring in 2014, it’s important to look back at some of their biggest failures in the past year. 2013 may be rapidly coming to an end, but the Democrats’ troubles are just beginning.”

Of course, the list includes some familiar favorites.

There’s President Barack Obama’s ‘if you like it, you can keep it’ promise, which, as Gorman pointed out, was dubbed PolitiFact’s “Lie of the Year.”

And no one could forget the time HealthCare.gov crashed right in front of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

Plus, there’s Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) and his burning cross email in which he compared the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan. (Yikes!)

This list also features some gems that might have slipped memory, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi saying there are no more spending cuts to make.

Or there’s when Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.) refused to talk about the Benghazi attack.

Gorman, an NRCC spokesman, chose Arizona State University professor Kyrsten Sinema as his favorite ‘fail’ on the list. Sinema helped create the Affordable Care Act, which led to the hours of ASU associate faculty being cut. Awkward.
