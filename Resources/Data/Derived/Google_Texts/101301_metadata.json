Can we afford the fees? Is this a good education? In the troika of preschool concerns, access and affordability directly affect parents\u2019 lives while the elusive concept of \u201cquality\u201d is mainly felt by the children themselves. Studies show that parents often miss many of the scientifically validated preschool measures linked to social-emotional and academic success, one of the most important of which involves the use of spoken language we hear in the classroom.\n\nConversation is central to children\u2019s cognitive and emotional development, but too often in preschool classrooms, kids are asked questions with predetermined answers, doled out in calibrated doses by the teacher. What gets in the way of giving young children a real voice?\n\nChildren have always learned from talking and listening to peers, and we\u2019ve known for decades that children in language-rich preschool classrooms \u2013 where kids have long stretches of time for active play and conversation \u2013 ultimately do better academically than preschoolers who are taught primarily by scripted \u201cletter-of-the-week\u201d methods focusing on alphabet and vocabulary recall. We know, too, that children learn impulse control and other key self-regulation skills through the natural give-and-take of play.\n\nListen to young children building a space station, as I recently did in a Pittsburgh kindergarten, and you\u2019ll hear them grappling with deep and difficult questions: \u201cEven though he was already dead, I think Jesus probably made the white dwarf stars and the red giants,\u201d a 4-year-old gravely informed a friend. \u201cSo, who made all the new planets and everything?\u201d his interlocutor responded. \u201cWell, that\u2019s the big mystery about God,\u201d the little boy replied.\n\nIt certainly is.\n\nThis young child pondering the imponderable hadn\u2019t spoken a word of English only a year previously, yet he had found a way to engage in conversation that really mattered. Unfortunately, too many children miss these precious learning opportunities because adults are cued from years of conditioning to see preschool \u201cquality\u201d in materials, not human connections \u2013materials that are as luridly colored and adorable as possible. We view packed schedules, hokey craft projects, and curriculum themes based on seasons or food groups as a sign that learning must be going on.\n\nAdults ought to be asking if children have the chance to talk, to know and to influence one another. Are children encouraged to wrestle with ideas, put them into words, and listen mindfully to their peers? Are they encouraged to make their learning visible, to think out loud, to be heard and not merely seen? To put this more directly: Do you see signs of laughter, spontaneity, joy and affection in the classroom? Do you see teachers on the floor with children, seeing things at their level? Can a child go off-script, tell a meandering story, opt out of a planned activity to talk about something that captivates her? Can children respond to distress in themselves and others?", "article_metadata": {"description": "It can't be only rich kids who have access to rich conversational environments.
