If Troy Tulowitzki isn\u2019t asking for a trade, why would the Rockies even consider doing so unless the other team is willing to take on all of the salary? If we are going to pay for him to play, how about just keeping him in a Rockies uniform?\n\n\u2014 Dan, Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida\n\nDan, that\u2019s a very good question, but the answer is complicated. Tulo says he\u2019s not pressing for a trade \u2014 right now \u2014 but in the past he\u2019s certainly indicated that he wants out of Colorado if the Rockies can\u2019t win. And right now, they are one of the worst teams in the majors.\n\nRemember, last July that Tulo told The Denver Post:\n\n\u201cIn Todd Helton, there\u2019s someone who\u2019s easy to look at his career here and how it played out. I have the utmost respect for Todd, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to be the next in line as somebody who was here for a long time and didn\u2019t have a chance to win every single year. He played in a couple postseason games and went to one World Series. But that\u2019s not me. I want to be somewhere where there\u2019s a chance to be in the playoffs every single year.\u201d\n\nRockies general manager Jeff Bridich last week said that the recent Tulo trade talk is a \u201cmedia production.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s a crock and I told Bridich as much. I believe that it was Tulo\u2019s own agent, Paul Cohen, who ignited the trade talk with his comments to New York Post baseball writer Joel Sherman. Bridich vehemently disagreed.\n\nWe obviously see this situation from two totally different perspectives.\n\nAnyway, given Tulo\u2019s injury history and his salary, you might get your wish and see Tulo in a Rockies uniform for a long time to come. Trading him now is problematic.\n\nHi Patrick, What is wrong with the Rockies development? It seems everybody has taken a step backwards as the pitchers can\u2019t find the strike zone, established hitters like Carlos Gonzalez are hitting below the Mendoza line and Drew Stubbs must need his eye sight checked as he is striking out at an alarming rate.\n\nThis season is over before it barely began. \u2026 What type of changes do you think are needed at 20th and Blake? There had to have been some serious miscalculations as to the where they felt the team was compared to what we are witnessing on the field.\n\n\u2014 Mike S. Highlands Ranch\n\nMike, that\u2019s a mouthful of questions and opinions, so I\u2019m not sure where to begin, or finish.\n\nCarGo is not really about \u201cdevelopment,\u201d since he\u2019s an established star. But his is going through a prolonged slump after missing much of last season with an injury. CarGo told me recently that he still has a goal to hit .300 this season, and he\u2019s shown signs of busting out. Still, he\u2019s been one of the team\u2019s biggest disappointments this season \u2014 and he knows it.\n\nStubbs \u2014 who, by the way, is making $5.28 million this season \u2014 has been a disaster. As I write this, he\u2019s hitting .120, with three walks vs. 30 strikeouts in 50 at-bats, for an on-base percentage of .185.\n\nThe company line is that \u201che\u2019s a veteran, and he\u2019ll come around,\u201d but I can\u2019t imagine the Rockies will have patience much longer.\n\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s game, Weiss said: \u201cI wish all it took was saying the magic words. You work through it. Athletes have a feel for when they are going well, and it\u2019s about that feeling and trying to get back to it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what (Stubbs) is doing. He\u2019s struggling, and it\u2019s tough as an athlete to struggle at that level in this league when there is a lot at stake every night.\u201d\n\nThe big-picture problem with the Stubbs situation is he\u2019s the only one who can back up Charlie Blackman in center field. CarGo could do it, but Weiss said recently that he has no plans to play switch CarGo from right field into center, even as a backup.\n\nBrandon Barnes would seem to be the logical call-up from Triple-A Albuquerque, but he\u2019s currently hitting .198.\n\nAt Double-A New Britain (Conn.), prospect David Dahl has hit .419 over his last 10 games, hiking his average to .283. But his on-base percentage is only .311 and he just turned 21 years old. I doubt the Rockies would call up Dahl now.\n\nI get the impression (I may be wrong) that the Rockies draft young pitchers who have been successful (i.e. Jon Gray) and then tinker with their mechanics until they become a mess (either physically or mentally). Is this true? If so, why don\u2019t they just let them do whatever made them successful to get to this point?\n\n\u2014 Brian, Evergreen\n\nBrian, I think that\u2019s brushing with too broad of a brush. No matter how talented a pitcher is coming out of college (and especially high school), he simply can\u2019t succeed throwing the same stuff at the major-league level.\n\nPlease check out my recent story on Gray, which explains a little bit of this.\n\nEven with a great fastball and slider, Gray has to learn to pitch at the next level. He\u2019s not the only young pitcher going through growing pains.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s unfair to say the Rockies tinker with pitchers\u2019 mechanics until they become \u201ca mess.\u201d It\u2019s more complicated than that.\n\nHowever, it is true that Colorado\u2019s record for drafting and developing pitchers has been the organization\u2019s biggest weakness.\n\nWhy in the name of Rob Scahill do the Rockies keep using a Triple-A pitcher like Scott Oberg in close late-inning situations?\n\n\u2014 Jon, Louisville\n\nJon, Oberg\u2019s numbers are not good: 6.35 ERA and a 1.68 WHIP in 11 1/3 innings. Worse, he\u2019s given up five home runs.\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 like his stuff, but has simply not executed as the Rockies expected him too. He\u2019s hung the ball in the strike zone too many time. I don\u2019t think Weiss wants to use him in late-game situations, but with the overuse of the bullpen for much of May, Oberg fell into that role from time to time.\n\nAs a Rockies fan since the World Series run in 2007. I know a great deal of the fan base wants Dick Monfort to go. However Dick doesn\u2019t want to go. My question, is there any future Rockies owner out there that can pressure Monfort to go?\n\n\u2014 Emily, Littleton\n\nDick, as well as his brother Charlie, have no desire to sell the team. And no one from the outside is going to pressure then to do so. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nThere have long been rumors the Denver billionaire Phil Anschutz would be interested, but there has been no substance to those rumors.\n\nDan O\u2019Dowd was unwilling to make midseason trades to build for the future, even when the Rockies had no hope of making the playoffs. Is there reason to think Bridich will be more open to trades this year? Everybody mentions Tulo, but it seems like Justin Morneau could bring back a good prospect, and that would allow the Rockies to give Willin Rosario and Ben Paulsen a real look at first base.\n\n\u2014 Ben, Boulder\n\nBen, as you surely know, trades in the majors are complicated. There is a lot more to it than saying, \u201cTrade Morneau for prospects.\u201d Everybody is looking for a deal, while at the same time, everyone is trying to protect their prospects.\n\nI do think Bridich will pull the trigger on a trade, if not for Tulo or CarGo, than certainly for Morneau, who\u2019s in the final year of his contract. There is a $9 million mutual option for 2016, but I can\u2019t imagine the Rockies picking it up.\n\nI\u2019m sure there will be a contender looking for a solid, left-handed hitter at the trade deadline. However, Morneau\u2019s current stint on the disabled list for concussion-like symptoms complicates things. His trade value will depend on how long he\u2019s out and how he performs when he returns.\n\nWhat is Mark Wiley\u2019s role regarding the Rockies major and minor league pitching development? When he was hired, wasn\u2019t he supposed to address the Rockies\u2019 pitching problems? Instead it seems like it\u2019s more of the same: ineffective starters, injuries and too many walks, and first round draft picks Rex Brothers and Jonathan Gray are a mess.\n\n\u2014 Steve, Aurora\n\nMark Wiley\u2019s official title is director of pitching operations, a role he began in October 2012. His job is to oversee all things pitching \u2014 from what the Rockies look for at the amateur level, through the minors to the majors.\n\nWiley is not attempting to install a cookie-cutter approach to Colorado pitching, because the talents and styles vary so much. However, he does preach the club\u2019s overall philosophy of pitching low in the strike zone and getting groundball outs.\n\nI understand your frustration with the Rockies\u2019 problems to develop solid pitching, but it would be unfair to put on the blame on Wiley.\n\nDenver Post sports writer Patrick Saunders posts his Rockies Mailbag every other week on Tuesdays.\n\nPose a Rockies- or MLB-related question for the Rockies Mailbag.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies Mailbag: Troy Tulowitzki trade talk not a \u201cmedia production\u201d", "title": "Rockies Mailbag: Troy Tulowitzki trade talk not a \u201cmedia production\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/19/rockies-mailbag-troy-tulowitzki-trade-talk-not-a-media-production/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-19T20:14:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T10:37:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Rockies Mailbag, Troy Tulowitzki"}, "article_summary": "When he was hired, wasn\u2019t he supposed to address the Rockies\u2019 pitching problems?\n\u2014 Brian, EvergreenBrian, I think that\u2019s brushing with too broad of a brush.\nTulo says he\u2019s not pressing for a trade \u2014 right now \u2014 but in the past he\u2019s certainly indicated that he wants out of Colorado if the Rockies can\u2019t win.\nI believe that it was Tulo\u2019s own agent, Paul Cohen, who ignited the trade talk with his comments to New York Post baseball writer Joel Sherman.\nIf Troy Tulowitzki isn\u2019t asking for a trade, why would the Rockies even consider doing so unless the other team is willing to take on all of the salary?"}
