Pat Roberts on Friday pledged to stage a filibuster if President Barack Obama attempts to close Guantanamo Bay prison and send the current inmates to facilities within the U.S.\n\n\u201cI stopped him once from trying to send the Gitmo terrorists to Leavenworth\u201d prison, the Republican senator said in Topeka, according to a Wall Street Journal report. In 2009, Roberts and then-Sen. Sam Brownback, now the state\u2019s governor, expressed significant opposition to a proposal considered by the Obama administration to transfer inmates to a maximum security facility at a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which ultimately never took place.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRoberts on Friday likened his potential move on Gitmo to that of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who spoke on the Senate floor for more than 21 hours in September 2013 to express his opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Roberts campaigned with Cruz, a favorite in the tea party movement, on Thursday in an effort to energize the conservative base in Kansas.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Democratic fundraiser wages Florida drug war)\n\n\u201cTed Cruz did it with regards to Obamacare, if necessary I\u2019ll do it for terrorists,\u201d Roberts said.\n\n\u201cI shall do it again, I shall do it again and if he tries it I will shut down the Senate,\u201d Roberts added in reference to Obama.\n\nThe incumbent senator, locked in a close general election battle with independent Greg Orman, said he thought he could get the backing from several Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Billionaires for Greg Orman)\n\n\u201cI will have help on this,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see John McCain there, I could see Lindsey Graham there. I could see Kelly Ayotte there and I could see a whole bunch of other people there.\u201d The Hill also reported that GOP Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma vowed to participate in a potential filibuster.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the Obama administration is considering proposals to use executive action close the prison at Guantanamo Bay and send its 149 inmates to the U.S. One option would include vetoing the National Defense Authorization Act. Congress passed legislation in 2010 to prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the U.S.\n\nIn a statement later Friday, Orman didn\u2019t explicitly mention Roberts or the filibuster, but said that Guantanamo inmates should not be transferred to the U.S. \u201cPresident Obama is absolutely wrong on this, and the solution is not to bring these terrorists onto U.S. soil,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Kansas senator pledges to stage a filibuster if Obama attempts to close Guantanamo Bay prison.", "title": "Roberts vows filibuster on Gitmo", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/pat-roberts-guantanamo-bay-111776.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/10/141010_pat_roberts_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Pat Roberts,Kansas,Gitmo,Guantanamo Bay", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Kansas senator pledges to stage a filibuster if Obama attempts to close Guantanamo Bay prison.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0c2\"", "article_summary": "( Also on POLITICO: Democratic fundraiser wages Florida drug war)\u201cTed Cruz did it with regards to Obamacare, if necessary I\u2019ll do it for terrorists,\u201d Roberts said.\n\u201cI shall do it again, I shall do it again and if he tries it I will shut down the Senate,\u201d Roberts added in reference to Obama.\n\u201cI stopped him once from trying to send the Gitmo terrorists to Leavenworth, Roberts vows filibuster on GitmoKansas Sen.
