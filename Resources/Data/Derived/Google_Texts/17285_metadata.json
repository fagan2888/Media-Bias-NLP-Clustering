In my view I think this, on top of the sequestration cuts, seriously damages the safety and security of the nation,\u201d James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said during a Wednesday Senate Judiciary Committee hearing which was convened to discuss NSA surveillance powers.\n\n\u201cThis affects our global capability to support the military, to support diplomacy, and to support our policymakers. And the danger here, of course, that this will accumulate over time - the damage will be insidious. So each day that goes by, the jeopardy increases,\" said Clapper.\n\nThe army is currently furloughing all \u201cnon-essential\u201d personnel, particularly those not involved in live operations abroad.\n\nHagel said while on an official visit to south Asia this week that lawyers for the Pentagon and the US administration were looking at ways to expand the number of defense department personnel who are exempt from furloughs.\n\nHe also voiced concern that the shutdown damages America\u2019s reputation among its allies as a reliable partner.\n\n\u201cIt does cast a very significant pall over America\u2019s credibility to our allies when this kind of thing happens,\u201d Hagel told reporters traveling with him.\n\n\n\nFor many Pentagon workers, the shutdown is the second time this year that they have been forced to take unpaid leave. Back in August, over 600,000 civilian defense employees were required to take unpaid leave in an effort to reduce spending after across-the-board budget cuts went into force in March.\n\n\u201cThis has been a very disruptive year for our people,\u201d Hagel said.\n\nMeanwhile, US sailors have complained about delays in annual payments of re-enlistment bonuses, which are typically paid by October 1. Military academies have reduced their scheduled classes and even commissaries that sell groceries to military families have been closed.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the Republican-dominated House of Representatives unanimously voted to approve a bill which will see the 800,000 furloughed workers paid retrospectively once the crisis has been resolved.\n\nThe House voted 407-0 and the bill will now be sent to the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats. The White House has announced that President Obama will sign the measure into law once it passes Congress.\n\nThe shutdown was the result of a lack of agreement between Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives over the passing of the federal budget.\n\nThe Republican majority in the House refused to accept President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which formally went into effect on Tuesday.\n\nOn Saturday, Obama urged the House to \u201cstop this farce\u201d and end the shutdown by unconditionally approving the federal budget.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pentagon is ordering most of its approximately 400,000 civilian Defense Department employees back to work after being furloughed following the government shutdown.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "The Pentagon is ordering most of its approximately 400,000 civilian Defense Department employees back to work after being furloughed following the government shutdown.", "title": "Pentagon to recall most furloughed employees despite shutdown", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/20/a9/b0/00/18.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/pentagon-recall-furloughed-employees-787/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "The Pentagon is ordering most of its approximately 400,000 civilian Defense Department employees back to work after being furloughed following the government shutdown.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/20/a9/b0/00/18.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4b1\"", "article_summary": "The Pentagon is ordering most of its approximately 400,000 civilian Defense Department employees back to work after being furloughed following the government shutdown.\nFor many Pentagon workers, the shutdown is the second time this year that they have been forced to take unpaid leave.\n\u201cThis affects our global capability to support the military, to support diplomacy, and to support our policymakers.\nOn Saturday, Obama urged the House to \u201cstop this farce\u201d and end the shutdown by unconditionally approving the federal budget.\nBack in August, over 600,000 civilian defense employees were required to take unpaid leave in an effort to reduce spending after across-the-board budget cuts went into force in March."}
