Marco Rubio was among the Republican Party\u2019s biggest stars when he burst onto the national stage in the tea party wave of 2010. Now, he is facing a home-state showing on Tuesday that could devastate his 2016 presidential campaign and damage his political brand for years to come.\n\nHis desire to become the nation\u2019s first Hispanic president, and his past support for a forgiving immigration policy, have failed to excite conservative primary voters who instead have flocked to Donald Trump\u2019s nativist politics.\n\n\u201cMarco\u2019s always had good timing. This time, the timing just wasn\u2019t there,\u201d said Albert Lorenzo, who managed Rubio\u2019s first state house campaign nearly two decades ago and stays in close contact with him.\n\nYet Lorenzo, like those closest to Rubio, suggest that should his bid end in disappointment, the senator\u2019s career in public service is far from over. The 44-year-old Republican could run for Florida governor in two years, president in four years or even his own Senate seat later this year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a talent you don\u2019t find,\u201d Lorenzo said.\n\nAdded Rubio ally, Miami city commissioner Francis Suarez: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody more popular in Florida than he is \u2014 except maybe the man he\u2019s losing to.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the first-term senator has been looking up at Trump in Florida preference polls for months. Rubio is the decided underdog to the billionaire businessman in Tuesday\u2019s do-or-die home-state contest.\n\nDespite long odds, Rubio insists he\u2019s focused only on winning his party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even thought about what I\u2019m having for lunch today, much less what I\u2019m going to run for in two years or nothing at all,\u201d he told reporters in West Palm Beach this week.\n\n\u201cIf I never hold public office again, I\u2019m comfortable with that,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen two to four years from now. But I have no plans. No thoughts. No contemplation. No meetings. Nothing about any future political run of any sort.\u201d\n\nShould his presidential bid end in disappointment, many who know him expect a political comeback, though those closest to Rubio believe he could turn to the private sector to help provide for his family.\n\nWith four school-age children, Rubio has struggled with his personal finances in recent years, cashing out a retirement account as recently as 2014 to upgrade home appliances and pay for school costs. The Republican would have such well-compensated options as becoming a media personality or joining a law firm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rubio\u2019s political reckoning arrives in Florida primary", "title": "Rubio\u2019s political reckoning arrives in Florida primary", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rubio\u2019s political reckoning arrives in Florida primary", "title": "Rubio\u2019s political reckoning arrives in Florida primary", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/13/rubios_political_reckoning_arrives_in_florida_primary/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/gop-2016-rubio-future.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rubio\u2019s political reckoning arrives in Florida primary", "title": "Rubio\u2019s political reckoning arrives in Florida primary", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/gop-2016-rubio-future.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steve Peoples", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The 44-year-old Republican could run for Florida governor in two years, president in four years or even his own Senate seat later this year.\nNow, he is facing a home-state showing on Tuesday that could devastate his 2016 presidential campaign and damage his political brand for years to come.\nThis time, the timing just wasn\u2019t there,\u201d said Albert Lorenzo, who managed Rubio\u2019s first state house campaign nearly two decades ago and stays in close contact with him.\nThe Republican would have such well-compensated options as becoming a media personality or joining a law firm.\nNothing about any future political run of any sort.\u201dShould his presidential bid end in disappointment, many who know him expect a political comeback, though those closest to Rubio believe he could turn to the private sector to help provide for his family."}
