With the Republican-led Senate having already passed its version, GOP congressional leaders will send the measure to President Obama, daring him to veto it.\n\nObama will undoubtedly veto the measure to undo his signature health care law, and Congress has nowhere near the votes to override a presidential veto.\n\nBut Republicans hope the entire exercise might start to change the circumstance on Capitol Hill regarding the years-old argument about ObamaCare and its repeal.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is promising to unveil a bill to, in fact, replace ObamaCare.\n\nFor all of the GOP\u2019s Sturm und Drang about ObamaCare, neither the House nor the Senate has ever debated a bill that attempts to succeed the law.\n\nThe reason is that nobody has crafted a plan that would pass in either chamber.\n\nIn 2010, House Republicans concocted the \u201cPledge to America.\u201d It was a political compact created to help the GOP seize control of the House from Democrats and tell voters what they would do if in control.\n\nOne of the promises was to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d ObamaCare. After Republicans earned the House majority, the first major vote of 2011 was to repeal the health care law. The House and Senate have voted more than 60 times to either fully or partially repeal the Affordable Care Act, as it is more formally know. Yet they\u2019ve never held a vote to replace ObamaCare.\n\nBut with Ryan now at the helm in the House and the GOP controlling the Senate, this may be one of the few chances the party has to come together around a bill which would replace the six-year-old law.\n\nRyan is, nevertheless, tempering expectations. In a recent meeting with reporters, he indicated that the House was practically obligated to pass a replacement bill. And though Ryan was confident about the House doing so this year, he underscored the unlikelihood that Obama would sign the legislation into law.\n\nStill, the effort is part of Ryan\u2019s attempt to contrast Republicans with the agenda of Obama and the left. Democrats have long hectored Republicans for failing to cough up a bill to succeed ObamaCare.\n\nSuch a measure is a unicorn.\n\nIf there were the votes to approve that elusive bill, Republicans would have done it. But if they finally at least draft a bill and better yet pass it, then the sides can argue about policy and not just exchange hypothetical catcalls.\n\nStill, if Ryan is correct, the House GOP will write an ObamaCare alternative seven years after a triumvirate of House committees prepped the initial iterations of the ACA in the summer of 2009.\n\nThe House approved the first version of ObamaCare in November 2009. The Senate did so on Christmas Eve of 2009. Both bodies ushered the final health care packages to passage in March, 2010.\n\nThis enterprise won\u2019t be easy for Republicans.\n\nSome GOP aides defended not having a replacement bill at the ready.\n\nThey suggested the promise in the Pledge to America was to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the ACA. Certainly there were votes to repeal the law (at least in the House). But the law was never repealed. Therefore, they argued, it wasn\u2019t yet incumbent upon Republicans to make good on the second contingency and replace the statute.\n\nRyan won\u2019t be able to implement the replacement package either with Obama still in the White House in 2016 -- if it does, in fact, get that far. But if Ryan\u2019s successful, he\u2019ll have come a lot further than anyone else has before.\n\nWhich brings us back to what the House is up to next week.\n\nThough the House has approved dozens of repeal bills over the years, the Senate has not until a few weeks ago taken a direct, up-or-down vote on eliminating ObamaCare.\n\nDemocrats controlled the Senate until January 2015. That meant they could block any Republican effort to deposit a repeal bill on the floor.\n\nHowever, the story changed when the GOP won the majority. Still, Senate rules often favor the minority party. Republicans would have to vault two anticipated Democratic-filibusters just to bring up a repeal bill for debate. Overcoming those filibusters would require two roll call votes of 60 yeas. That wasn\u2019t happening.\n\nThe GOP nevertheless had one option at its disposal -- something called \u201cbudget reconciliation.\u201d\n\nBudget reconciliation is a unique, once-a-shot piece of legislation that operates under special rules. It\u2019s inoculated from pesky Senate filibusters. And if you can jam something into a budget reconciliation measure, you can usually get it through the Senate because it just requires a simple majority for passage.\n\nThe House recently started this process and knocked out a dual reconciliation bill that simultaneously repealed ObamaCare and defunded Planned Parenthood. It then shipped the measure to the Senate. But because of special Senate rules governing budget reconciliation, the upper chamber had to tweak the plan to pass it. That meant that the House and Senate had approved slightly different bills. So the Senate then bounced its updated version back to the House.\n\nThis is where things stand: The House is expected to debate and vote on the final, Senate-amended version of the reconciliation plan. If approved, the House and Senate are in alignment and the bill goes to Obama to sign or veto -- though this is a fait accompli.\n\nHouse Republicans initially planned to take up the reworked Senate bill right before Christmas. But at the last minute, they decided to delay that gambit. They had a new tactic. Wait until after the holiday to maximize exposure of the House debate and vote -- as well as the President\u2019s planned veto. Plus, it might help tee up Republican plans on health care in the new year.\n\nThe GOP hopes it can artfully message its plans to design and approve a replacement bill for ObamaCare -- with something with a lot more policy teeth than the other parliamentary gymnastics of just voting to repeal parts or all of the legislation over and over again.\n\nRepublicans also are hoping the public embraces these policy ideas as a contrast to those propounded by Obama and Democrats with health care topping the list.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-04 10:22:31 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"description": "Within hours of reconvening Tuesday, the GOP-led Congress will finally act to fulfill a 2010 promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.", "title": "GOP-led Congress set for first time to vote, pass bill to replace ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/04/gop-led-congress-set-for-first-time-to-vote-pass-bill-to-replace-obamacare-not-just-repeal.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2015/12/15/0/0/694940094001_4662212775001_4530bce8-93fd-4e3c-bbd4-fbe46b559da7.jpg?ve=1", "creator": "@foxnews", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\"],\"author\":\"Chad Pergram\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"GOP-led Congress set for first time to vote, pass bill to replace ObamaCare\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2015/12/15/0/0/694940094001_4662212775001_4530bce8-93fd-4e3c-bbd4-fbe46b559da7.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-04T05:15:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/04/gop-led-congress-set-for-first-time-to-vote-pass-bill-to-replace-obamacare-not-just-repeal.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"52b7f992-7591-4447-928f-714e5f27ae7d\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "Within hours of reconvening Tuesday, the GOP-led Congress will finally act to fulfill a 2010 promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.", "dc.description": "Within hours of reconvening Tuesday, the GOP-led Congress will finally act to fulfill a 2010 promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.", "dc.identifier": "52b7f992-7591-4447-928f-714e5f27ae7d", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "housereps", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Gop-led Congress Set For First Time To Vote, Pass Bill To Replace Obamacare", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-04 10:22:31 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Within hours of reconvening Tuesday, the GOP-led Congress will finally act to fulfill a 2010 promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.", "title": "GOP-led Congress set for first time to vote, pass bill to replace ObamaCare | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/04/gop-led-congress-set-for-first-time-to-vote-pass-bill-to-replace-obamacare-not-just-repeal.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2015/12/15/0/0/694940094001_4662212775001_4530bce8-93fd-4e3c-bbd4-fbe46b559da7.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "Within hours of reconvening Tuesday, the GOP-led Congress will finally act to fulfill a 2010 promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.", "dc.date": "2016-01-04", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\"],\"author\":\"Chad Pergram\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"GOP-led Congress set for first time to vote, pass bill to replace ObamaCare\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2015/12/15/0/0/694940094001_4662212775001_4530bce8-93fd-4e3c-bbd4-fbe46b559da7.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-01-04T05:15:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/04/gop-led-congress-set-for-first-time-to-vote-pass-bill-to-replace-obamacare-not-just-repeal.html\",\"post_id\":\"52b7f992-7591-4447-928f-714e5f27ae7d\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Chad Pergram"}, "article_summary": "Within hours of reconvening Tuesday, the GOP-led Congress will finally act to fulfill a 2010 promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is promising to unveil a bill to, in fact, replace ObamaCare.\nYet they\u2019ve never held a vote to replace ObamaCare.\nOne of the promises was to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d ObamaCare.\nThat meant they could block any Republican effort to deposit a repeal bill on the floor."}
