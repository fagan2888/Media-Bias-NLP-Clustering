Rescue teams continue their grim search after a deadly Washington state landslide. And next week's Obamacare deadline may get stretched to mid-April.\n\nIt's Wednesday, and here are the 5 things to know for your \"New Day.\"\n\n1. MISSING PLANE\n\nIt's going to take time: Nearly three weeks after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, search teams have little to show for their efforts. Complex calculations based on satellite data indicate about where the Boeing 777 went down, but no debris has been recovered that can be linked to the plane. It's a full-blown international effort. Seven military reconnaissance planes from Australia, China, New Zealand, the United States, Japan and South Korea are combing the waters about 1,500 miles southwest of Australia.\n\nWe're deeply saddened by the loss of #MH370. Our prayers & condolences are with the families in this moment of sorrow pic.twitter.com/H6i1Y2GdL4 \u2014 Malaysia Airlines (@MAS) March 26, 2014\n\n2. WASHINGTON LANDSLIDE\n\nBuried in mud: A handful of people were miraculously pulled from the wreckage in Washington right after a mountain of mud rolled over two towns there Saturday. But no one has been found alive since, and the grim toll rises by the day. At least 16 have been confirmed dead. And today, rescuers will work to salvage another eight bodies they believe they have found under rubble of the landslide that covers about a square mile. At least 176 people are unaccounted for. But officials think some of the names of the missing have been duplicated, so they're hoping the actual number will be smaller.\n\nA massive landslide in Washington state has become a \"living nightmare\" - http://t.co/9v4xDtQQy4 pic.twitter.com/DKmnupXPUP \u2014 CNN International (@cnni) March 26, 2014\n\n3. OBAMACARE EXTENSION\n\nSquishy deadline: The deadline to sign up for Obamacare is Monday, but apparently there's some wiggle room. Administration officials tell us that there's a last-minute surge in folks trying to enroll and they don't want anyone who's already in the pipeline to get shut out. Nothing's official yet, but applicants may get until mid-April to wrap up the application process. Also, the White House is short of its goal of 6 million enrollees. A little extra time might make those numbers look better.\n\n4. NAVY SHOOTING\n\nCivilian and sailor die: There are lots of questions to answer after a civilian boarded a U.S. Navy destroyer at the world's largest naval base, took a gun from a Navy guard and used it to fatally shoot another sailor before security personnel shot and killed him. The incident took place Monday at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. While the man had credentials to be on the base, he wasn't supposed to be on the ship. The scuffle broke out when security stopped the man on the quarterdeck of the USS Mahan. Investigators aren't sure why he was there.\n\n5. TEXAS OIL SPILL\n\nCleanup headache: Cleanup crews are doing their best, but they've got a mess on their hands at the Port of Houston, where 168,000 gallons of thick, black oil are mucking up the habitat of birds and marine life. The spill happened over the weekend after two vessels collided. The U.S. Coast Guard and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department are all over this, but port traffic is pretty much at a standstill until things get sorted out. More than 15 miles of shoreline have been affected, and more than 750 people are working to resolve the spill.\n\nThose are your five biggies for the day. Here are a few others that are brewing and have the Internet buzzing.\n\n- Cookie czar: That's the way the Girl Scout cookie record crumbles. How crazy is this? Sixth-grader Katie Francis sold more than 18,000 boxes of addictive Girl Scout cookies over the last two months, setting a national record. And she's not done yet. Katie hopes to hit 20,000 by the end of the month.\n\n\n\n- Everyone say \"awwww\": Momma gorilla and baby meet for the first time after mom's emergency C-section and the little one's bout with pneumonia.\n\n\n\n- Celebrity split: Actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her husband, Chris Martin of Coldplay, have decided to \"uncouple\" - their term, not ours - after more than 10 years of marriage. \"It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate,\" they said in a prepared statement. \"We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner.\" The no-longer-a-couple have two children, Apple and Moses.\n\n- Too much speed: Speed killed \"Fast & Furious\" star Paul Walker, according to an investigation of the fiery car crash that ended his life last year. Walker and friend Roger Rodas had no drugs or alcohol in their blood. Both men were wearing seat belts. The car's air bags deployed after they clipped a light pole and some trees. And nothing mechanical went wrong to cause their Porsche to leave the wide road. They were going too fast, though, between 80 and 93 mph. The report says neither man lived long after the accident.\n\n- High-flying tooth pull: A clever dad uses a quadcopter and lots of dental floss to pull off this trick.\n\n\n\nThere you go. All you need to know to get an early start to your morning.\n\nBe sure to tune in to \"New Day,\" from 6 to 9 a.m. ET, join us at NewDayCNN.com and go and have a GREAT NEW DAY!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Complex calculations help pinpoint where the Malaysia Airlines jetliner went down.
