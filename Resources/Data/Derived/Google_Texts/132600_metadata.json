Coloradans are already bracing for its impact.\n\nIn the general election, Colorado residents will not only head to the polls to cast their votes for president, but they\u2019ll also weigh in on a controversial ballot measure: Amendment 69, which would create a government-run health care plan in the Centennial State.\n\nThe plan, formally known as ColoradoCare, is the first in the country that would replace Obamacare, action made possible by Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act, which allows states to receive a waiver from the health care law if their own plan provides residents with \u201caccess to high quality, affordable health insurance while retaining the basic protections of\u201d the health care law.\n\nIn Obamacare\u2019s place: universal health care.\n\nUnder the initiative, funded largely by a 10-percent tax on payroll, Colorado residents would qualify for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d health insurance coverage. According to a study from the Colorado Health Institute, ColoradoCare would cover nearly 83 percent of the state\u2019s residents, including those currently enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nThe rest of the state\u2019s population would receive coverage through Medicare or the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nIn the Centennial State, supporters of the plan are hoping that ColoradoCare will expand access to coverage for its residents. Opponents, meanwhile, are warning that government-run insurance will cause residents and health care providers to flee the state in search of more options and better quality care.\n\n\u201cColoradoCare is a higher dosage of the same failed prescription of Obamacare,\u201d Jonathan Lockwood, executive director of Advancing Colorado, told The Daily Signal. \u201cIt\u2019s Obamacare that has made ColoradoCare possible.\u201d\n\nAdvancing Colorado launched in 2014 as a nonprofit free market advocacy group focused on fighting growing government intervention. The group, thus far, has emerged as one of the few actively fighting ColoradoCare.\n\nWith seven months to go before Colorado voters hit the polls, residents of the state who spoke to The Daily Signal said talk of the proposal is slowly starting to bubble up.\n\nHowever, a bipartisan campaign called Coloradans for Coloradans and led by state Treasurer Walker Stapleton, a Republican, and former Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, launched in January with the goal of defeating Amendment 69.\n\nIn a press release, the campaign focused on ColoradoCare\u2019s high cost and called it a \u201crisky and untested state-run health insurance system.\u201d\n\nColorado residents are shying away from speculating about whether Amendment 69 will pass, but some Coloradans are already warning that they may be forced to leave the state in anticipation of what a single-payer model will bring.\n\n\u201cIf we were to heed this all, I would probably have to move,\u201d Marjorie Haun, a resident of Colorado\u2019s Western Slope and activist with Heritage Action for America who has also written for The Daily Signal previously, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe thought of not having any choice at all, the thought of the unknowns, as you get older, you start looking at potential health problems. It\u2019s pretty frightening.\u201d\n\nGetting on the Ballot\n\nIf Amendment 69 wins support from voters in November, Colorado would become the first state in the country to implement universal health care.\n\nSuch a model was first attempted in Vermont back in 2014. However, Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin eventually ended his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d approach to health care after admitting it would be too costly for the state and \u201cmight hurt our economy.\u201d\n\nEfforts to get ColoradoCare on November\u2019s ballot were spearheaded by ColoradoCare Yes, and the campaign needed 98,492 signatures for the proposal to land before voters.\n\nMore than 500 volunteers collected a total of 158,831 signatures. In October, ColoradoCare Yes delivered petitions to the Colorado secretary of state\u2019s office on a gurney in a rented ambulance, where they were rolled into the Denver office for validation.\n\nMore than 109,000 were approved, according to ColoradoCare Yes.\n\nColoradoCare Yes did not respond to interview requests.\n\nOpponents of Amendment 69 liken the drive to qualify ColoradoCare for November\u2019s ballot to last year\u2019s initiative legalizing marijuana in the state, though they expect the impact to be worse.\n\n\u201cI just think legalizing pot was pretty crazy,\u201d Haun said. \u201cThis is that times 10. This would really devastate the state. Anything could happen in Colorado.\u201d\n\n\u2018We Can Do Better\u2019\n\nThe state estimates that ColoradoCare will cost $25 billion, paid for by a 10-percent payroll tax increase divided between employers, who pay 6.67 percent, and employees, who pay 3.33 percent.\n\nWith the tax hikes, Colorado\u2019s state income tax will rise to 14.63 percent, the highest in the country. Currently, the highest state income tax in the country is California\u2019s, which is 13.3 percent.\n\nColoradoCare\u2019s supporters praise the plan for ultimately lessening the amount of money Coloradans have to pay for health care, since residents won\u2019t have to pay co-pays or worry about deductibles.\n\nHowever, Linda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Denver-based Independence Institute, warned that ColoradoCare would ultimately end up costing the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really bad idea, and we can do better,\u201d Gorman told The Daily Signal. \u201cNot only are you covering yourself with this expensive health care system, but you\u2019re reducing the economic prospect of the state as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe new proposal would also receive $11.6 billion in federal funding that currently flows to the state through Medicaid and its Obamacare exchange. To receive the federal dollars allocated through its state-run exchange, ColoradoCare would need to qualify for a waiver from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting a share of tax money forever, which is bad government,\u201d Gorman said.\n\nColorado residents all qualify for ColoradoCare, but supporters of the measure say that it\u2019s not truly single-payer, since private health insurance companies can still sell competing coverage in the state.\n\nThough insurance companies can continue to sell coverage in the state, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper warned in January that ColoradoCare\u2019s implementation would likely deter those companies from moving into the state.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s any chance that [ColoradoCare] will pass,\u201d he said during a Jan. 6 meeting. \u201cBut I can tell you there are a couple [of] large health care related companies that are looking at moving their headquarters here, and they saw that, that that\u2019s going to be on the ballot, and they paused.\u201d\n\nThough much of ColoradoCare will be funded through a tax increase and supplemented with federal dollars, Coloradans are worried about the impact a 14.63 percent income tax would have on their own budgets.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a significant tax for people,\u201d Haun said. \u201cPeople and businesses will move, because that\u2019s how grave the cost of this will be. The impact on our lifestyles will be so significant that businesses will simply relocate.\u201d\n\nColoradoCare\u2019s structure is similar to that of a cooperative, in that residents\u2014which opponents of the plan say hasn\u2019t been defined\u2014elect a 21-member board of trustees. The board is tasked with setting reimbursement rates for providers and governing ColoradoCare\u2019s financing.\n\nIt\u2019s the board of trustees\u2019 ability to control medical prices for health care providers that has Gorman warning of the consequences this will have on residents\u2019 access to and quality of care.\n\n\u201cThe control mechanism in all of this is you\u2019re voting on an initiative that says no health care provider licensed by the state of Colorado, which covers hospitals, pharmacies, nurses, doctors, massage therapists, everybody, can charge a co-pay or deductible that isn\u2019t allowed by ColoradoCare,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cSo basically what it is is it\u2019s a giant price-fixing mechanism. Under threat of losing your license, you\u2019ve got to charge the price that they set.\u201d\n\nGorman said she expects to see physicians leaving the state for other places where they can charge more for their services and shortages in the services available to Colorado residents, particularly among the most vulnerable populations.\n\n\u201cWhat that leads to when it\u2019s tried in other places in the world like the [Department of Veterans Affairs] is that you stint on people who have serious illnesses because they generate cost, you stint on fragile babies because they generate a lot of cost, and you stint on frail elderly people because they\u2019re expensive, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see big shortages, and why as a physician would you stay in a state that limits your compensation?\u201d\n\nIn addition to worries about the board of trustees\u2019 ability to set prices, ColoradoCare\u2019s structure as a cooperative has provided additional fodder for those against the proposal. Many point to the failed consumer operated and oriented plan, or co-op, created in Colorado under Obamacare as a case study for why government intervention in the health insurance market doesn\u2019t work.\n\nColorado HealthOp launched with $72.3 million in loans from the federal government but closed its doors in October after receiving less money than it anticipated from Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Colorado\u2019s cooperative on the state exchange fail. Young people who were enthusiastic about Obamacare have lost their coverage, and a lot of them are facing the tax penalties this year for the first time because the timing was wrong with obtaining health care, or they just forgot,\u201d Haun said. \u201cThose lessons you would think are something that alert people to government controlling the health care system.\u201d\n\n\u2018Massive Impact\u2019\n\nThough campaigns surrounding ColoradoCare and the ballot initiative have yet to ramp up, Mary Clark, an activist with Heritage Action for America, said she is already bracing for the impact the law\u2014\u201dObamacare on steroids\u201d\u2014will have on providers and consumers.\n\n\u201cIt will have massive impact,\u201d Clark told The Daily Signal. \u201cPeople will leave. Doctors will leave. I don\u2019t know a state in the union [that] has this. I cannot imagine what this would do. It\u2019s just horrific.\u201d\n\nInstead, she, along with other Republican activists, said that the state needs more \u201cfree-market\u201d solutions that move further away from both the changes Obamacare made to the insurance market and what ColoradoCare will impose on the state.\n\n\u201cSingle payer is the exact opposite way that we need to go,\u201d Tina Bogani, another activist who works with Heritage Action, told The Daily Signal. \u201cWe need a system that has as much competition as possible. It reduces costs, it serves everyone and people can choose the doctor they want. That competition creates the innovation we\u2019re looking for in terms of better technologies and options for people.\u201d\n\nAdvancing Colorado\u2019s Lockwood, meanwhile, said he would prefer a system of health care that gives consumers as many options as they have in choosing phone plans.\n\n\u201cWe have the right to health care freedom, and this just takes it away,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people should be involved in the health care decision-making than less. We should be putting power in consumers\u2019 hands. This whole thing is a major scam.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colorado voters will vote in November on a proposal replacing Obamacare with ColoradoCare, a single-payer model of health care.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Colorado voters will vote in November on a proposal replacing Obamacare with ColoradoCare, a single-payer model of health care.", "title": "Beyond Obamacare: Colorado Considers Single-Payer Model", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160412_ColoradoCare_Quinn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/20F6X7z"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Colorado voters will vote in November on a proposal replacing Obamacare with ColoradoCare, a single-payer model of health care.", "title": "Beyond Obamacare: Colorado Considers Single-Payer Model", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160412_ColoradoCare_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "state reforms", "published_time": "2016-04-14T16:22:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ColoradoCare, single-payer health care, Amendment 69, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, ColoradCare Yes, Medicaid, Jonathan Lockwood, Independence Institute, Linda Gorman"}, "article_summary": "As Republican policymakers nationwide continue debating ways to replace Obamacare with patient-centered solutions, a Colorado group has landed a plan implementing a single-payer model of health care on November\u2019s ballot.\nUnder the initiative, funded largely by a 10-percent tax on payroll, Colorado residents would qualify for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d health insurance coverage.\n\u201cWe have the right to health care freedom, and this just takes it away,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Obamacare that has made ColoradoCare possible.\u201dAdvancing Colorado launched in 2014 as a nonprofit free market advocacy group focused on fighting growing government intervention.\n\u201cColoradoCare is a higher dosage of the same failed prescription of Obamacare,\u201d Jonathan Lockwood, executive director of Advancing Colorado, told The Daily Signal."}
