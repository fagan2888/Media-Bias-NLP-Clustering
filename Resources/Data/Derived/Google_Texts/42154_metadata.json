Yet despite amazing advances in medical research, patients and their doctors far too often must make critical choices without good evidence, basing their decisions on a combination of anecdotes and educated guesswork.\n\nThis is why the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) was created: to fund more studies that help patients, families, and clinicians make better-informed health decisions by comparing which clinical options will be most effective given their individual needs and preferences.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe\u2019ve been clear in articulating PCORI\u2019s purpose, but there seems to be some lingering confusion . These cases of mistaken identity offer an opportunity to remind everyone who we are and what we do.\n\nPCORI is an independent, non-profit research institute authorized by Congress. It\u2019s governed by a 21-member board representing the entire healthcare community, including patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, employers, insurers and industry. Our approach to research is unusual -- we believe the best way to provide patients and clinicians with the most useful information is to ask them, and other stakeholders, what kinds of evidence they need, then engage them as partners throughout the research process.\n\nThis helps ensure we address meaningful, real-world questions and focus on outcomes that matter to patients. It\u2019s an approach I welcome as a practicing psychiatrist who daily faces the challenge of determining which treatments will result in the outcomes my patients seek. For example, I frequently need more specific information about treatments most likely to relieve a patient\u2019s depression symptoms without causing over-sedation and other side effects he or she might not be willing to tolerate.\n\nPCORI\u2019s approach differs from traditional research because it does not stop at what works best for the \u201caverage\u201d patient. We ask whether treatment effectiveness varies depending on patient characteristics and preferences. It\u2019s a model that can advance personalized medicine by giving patients and those who care for them more personalized information about their options.\n\nPCORI was established barely four years ago -- an incredibly short time for a major research institute. Yet we have begun to see our work yield results.\n\nWith PCORI funding, researchers at the prestigious Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia found that when treating a type of serious bone infection in otherwise healthy children, physicians should reconsider using intravenous antibiotics after hospital discharge if an equally effective oral alternative exists. As prolonged IV use is associated with more side effects, this is very useful information -- published Dec. 15 in JAMA Pediatrics -- for pediatricians and parents to use at their discretion.\n\nAnd that\u2019s an important aspect of PCORI\u2019s work -- the studies we fund are not mandates for practice. We don\u2019t dictate which care options are available for doctors to use. PCORI was created to provide patients and their doctors with information to better inform, not restrict, their choices.\n\nWe look forward to releasing the results of many more funded studies in coming years. We\u2019re also working to support a large national health data network, called PCORnet, which can allow our country to produce greater volumes of patient-centered research, faster and at lower cost than ever before.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019re sharing with the entire healthcare community our growing experience with engaging patients and other stakeholders in guiding the research we fund. As we show impact, and develop methods and best practices to make this approach easier and more effective, we anticipate more researchers will follow our lead.\n\nThe astonishing advances of modern medicine have been built on the gradual emergence of more sophisticated research that helps us better understand and deliver quality patient care. PCORI\u2019s ambitious goal, and our promise to patients, is to push us further down that path and contribute to a new era of personalized medicine and better-informed patients and clinicians.\n\nNorquist is a professor in Emory University Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior; chief of Psychiatry Service, Grady Health System; and chair of PCORI Board of Governors.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Patients and their doctors far too often must make critical choices without good evidence.", "description": "Patients and their doctors far too often must make critical choices without good evidence.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Patients and their doctors far too often must make critical choices without good evidence.", "title": "PCORI\u2019s promise to patients", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/229532-pcoris-promise-to-patients", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/229532-pcoris-promise-to-patients", "dcterms.date": "2015-01-15T12:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Grayson Norquist, M.D. MSPH", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-15T12:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/229532-pcoris-promise-to-patients", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Patients and their doctors far too often must make critical choices without good evidence.", "card": "summary", "title": "PCORI\u2019s promise to patients"}, "dcterms.title": "PCORI\u2019s promise to patients"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9b8\"", "article_summary": "PCORI\u2019s ambitious goal, and our promise to patients, is to push us further down that path and contribute to a new era of personalized medicine and better-informed patients and clinicians.\nPCORI was created to provide patients and their doctors with information to better inform, not restrict, their choices.\nYet despite amazing advances in medical research, patients and their doctors far too often must make critical choices without good evidence, basing their decisions on a combination of anecdotes and educated guesswork.\nPCORI\u2019s approach differs from traditional research because it does not stop at what works best for the \u201caverage\u201d patient.\nWhen patients and their doctors have multiple care options for a health problem, solid evidence is the compass that guides them toward the best decision."}
