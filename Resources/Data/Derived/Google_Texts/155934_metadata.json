(AP) - Off the coast of Georgia, researchers and pilots from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently tested the ability of a small unmanned aircraft \u2014 a drone \u2014 to conduct fish population surveys.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a proof of concept mission,\u201d said Joe Smith, leader of menhaden sampling for the National Marine Fisheries Service lab in Beaufort, N.C. Smith had been planning an Atlantic coast survey of the fish with traditional aircraft but found the price tag steep at an estimated $500,000 for start up.\n\n\u201cLast summer we started talking about using drones,\u201d he said.\n\nThe aircraft NOAA uses is the AeroVironment PUMA AE.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the all environment,\u201d said NOAA Corps Officer Kevin Doremus. \u201cIt\u2019s a hand-launched, 13-pound UAS or unmanned aerial system.\u201d\n\nIt can be recovered on water or land. Battery operated, it\u2019s quiet, a plus when looking for wildlife, and it can cover a range of about 50 square miles flying for two hours on a charge.\n\nEquipped with real-time video and still photo capability, the system of three planes, plus cameras and controls, costs about $250,000. NOAA owns two such systems and has used them to look for sea birds, whales, turtles and marine debris.\n\nNOAA Corps Officer Mike Marino launched the PUMA from the deck of the R/V Joe Ferguson Friday, pushing it with his right arm as he held the nose aloft with his left. It arced upward and buzzed off on its mission. The PUMA was programmed to fly a zig-zag pattern several miles off the coast of St. Catherines and Sapelo islands while the R/V Ferguson sailed through the middle of its path, never more than a mile away.\n\nTo retrieve the PUMA, its operators stall it, allowing it to stow its camera in the fuselage before it plops unharmed in the water. The crew then motors close enough to pull it back into the boat by hand.\n\nUnmanned aircraft were developed for military purposes, but NOAA prefers to leave that connotation aside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a drone; we\u2019re not allowed to call it a drone,\u201d Doremus said.\n\nAs the PUMA flew, Doremus controlled the camera from the cabin of the Ferguson. Marino controlled the plane\u2019s speed and altitude. And Smith donned goggles that allowed him to watch for menhaden in the live-streamed images.\n\nThe fish, which look like a \u201cbig fat sardine,\u201d are a type of herring. Low on the food chain, lots of other fish eat them, including tuna, mackerel and red drum. People consume them, too, in the form of fish oil. And because menhaden are fed to poultry, you might be eating them without knowing it.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re eating chicken, you\u2019re eating menhaden indirectly,\u201d said George Sedberry, acting superintendent of Gray\u2019s Reef National Marine Sanctuary.\n\nSedberry is eager to see what the PUMA can do. Gray\u2019s Reef National Marine Sanctuary could use it in a variety of ways, including sea turtle and right whale counts, he said. It could even give managers a better idea of how many boats are out in the sanctuary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much cheaper than putting an aircraft or a boat out,\u201d Sedberry said.\n\nWildlife researchers around the world see the advantages. The nonprofit Conservationdrones.org shares information about low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles for conservation applications, especially in developing countries. It\u2019s already seen successful missions ranging from orangutans counts in Indonesia to anti-poaching flights to protect rhinos, elephants and tigers in Nepal\u2019s national parks.\n\nObserving aboard the Ferguson, Layne Bolen Pankratz, a doctoral student at George Mason University, could see how they drones will be of use to her as she researches how sea turtles use seagrass meadows in the shallow blue water of the Florida Keys. Last week\u2019s survey was a dry run to test the technology here. The menhaden weren\u2019t entirely cooperative, though. The fish typically migrate at this time of year from Florida to Cape Cod, but the colder-than-normal spring means they are lagging behind schedule. Still, on Thursday Smith did get one image of a large school of fish with birds feeding on it. When threatened, menhaden form a ball, with all the fish struggling to get to the protective center. The ball Smith saw was a couple hundred feet across and was likely menhaden.\n\nIt was enough to sell him on the technology.\n\n\u201cI think this is the way to go,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is a cheaper, probably safer way to go to do coastal surveys.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Savannah Morning News, http://www.savannahnow.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Off the coast of Georgia, researchers and pilots from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently tested the ability of a small unmanned aircraft -- a drone -- to conduct fish population surveys.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/5/researchers-use-drone-for-fish-population-surveys/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Off the coast of Georgia, researchers and pilots from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently tested the ability of a small unmanned aircraft \u2014 a drone \u2014 to conduct fish population surveys.", "title": "Researchers use drone for fish population surveys"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Off the coast of Georgia, researchers and pilots from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently tested the ability of a small unmanned aircraft -- a drone -- to conduct fish populat", "card": "summary", "title": "Researchers use drone for fish population surveys"}, "Author": "MARY LANDERS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Joe Smith, National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration, Kevin Doremus"}, "article_summary": "SAVANNAH, Ga.
