Of those schools, the average parental income is $43,300 compared to the average income of $73,000 for the overall report card.\n\n\u201cIf people still want to believe that it\u2019s how much money parents make that decides success in schools, they\u2019re simply wrong,\u201d said Fraser Institute\u2019s Peter Cowley, who co-authored the report.\n\nThe Toronto District School Board has remained consistently around a 6.6 out of 10 in recent report cards.\n\nOf the board\u2019s 283 public schools listed in this year\u2019s study, J.G. Workman in Scarborough continues to be on the top of the fastest improving list with a score of 5.5 out of 10.\n\nIn 2009, that school started at 2.0, increasing to 2.8 the next year and 4.8 in 2011. It received 6.5 the year after, and and dipped back to 5.5 in 2013 \u2014 but regardless, they are the fifth-fastest improving school in terms of improvement over time. And that\u2019s with a parental income of $54,000 and one out of three kids are special needs students.\n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on at Workman? We know who is improving, but we don\u2019t know why,\u201d Cowley said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried if you ask the minister of education what the fastest improving elementary of the province is, she won\u2019t know. But she should. Because if you can find those aspects of practice that have resulted in schools going from a 1 to a 5 (out of 10) in just five years, you might be able to magnify that result to the benefit of hundreds of thousands of kids.\u201d\n\nIn J.G. Workman\u2019s case, it was designated as a high-needs school by the TDSB in 2012. As a result, additional funding and resources have been funnelled into student learning and parental engagement, including $3,000 for library books, new literacy-based computer technology, and an emphasis on writing-based class trips that are kept affordable for parents.\n\n\u201cA lot of our model schools are in areas where there are high-priority neighbourhoods,\u201d Vicky Branco, a Model Schools for Inner Cities coordinator for the TDSB, told the Sun last year. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t provide all these pieces, they wouldn\u2019t have access to them.\u201d\n\nDoretta Wilson, of the Society for Quality Education, said there is also now a strong emphasis on tutoring, be it parents working with children after school or paying for private lessons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become almost a requirement in some areas and we still don\u2019t know the link between affluence and student achievement,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that fair? Of course it isn\u2019t. But it still says in either case of affluent or less-affluent households, the school system is not meeting the needs of our students.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Toronto Sun", "description": "Money can\u2019t buy brains.", "title": "No link between family income, student improvement: Fraser Institute", "url": "http://www.torontosun.com/2014/02/01/no-link-between-family-income-student-improvement-fraser-institute?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=No link between family income, student improvement: Fraser Institute", "image": "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/suns-prod-images/1297305405898_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464203579711", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "pinterest": "nopin", "description": "Money can\u2019t buy brains.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf71a\"", "article_summary": "There are 188 schools across the province in this year\u2019s Fraser Institute Elementary School Report Card that have shown improvement over five years.\nOf those schools, the average parental income is $43,300 compared to the average income of $73,000 for the overall report card.\nAnd that\u2019s with a parental income of $54,000 and one out of three kids are special needs students.\nIt received 6.5 the year after, and and dipped back to 5.5 in 2013 \u2014 but regardless, they are the fifth-fastest improving school in terms of improvement over time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become almost a requirement in some areas and we still don\u2019t know the link between affluence and student achievement,\u201d she said."}
