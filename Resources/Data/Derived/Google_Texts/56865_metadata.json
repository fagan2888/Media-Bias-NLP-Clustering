The CDC says the number of Tennessee residents visiting a dentist routinely is on the decline.Working but poor families like Emily\u2019s have the hardest time accessing dental care. They make too much money to qualify for government aid, but too little to pay for the care at market rates.So Emily and her sister are being treated at the Interfaith Dental Clinic , a medical charity operated by a faith-based ministry. It can be especially important for people struggling to find or keep a job to have good oral health.\u201cUnfortunately, our society looks at people\u2019s weight, their dialect, and their teeth in making decisions like, is that person educated or employable,\u201d Executive Director Rhonda Switzer said.And just as unfortunately, the problem is only getting worse. The Pew Research Center released a study earlier this year that indicates the U.S. has a severe shortage of dentists.More than half of those currently in practice are nearing retirement. Even more alarming, a growing number of Americans are showing up at hospital emergency rooms looking for dental care.\u201cThis is the 'canary in the coal mine.' This is the symptom that tells you we have a broken dental delivery system,\u201d said Shelly Gehshan, director of the Pew Children\u2019s Dental Campaign. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough dentists. We don\u2019t have enough clinics. We don\u2019t have enough dental insurance. We don\u2019t have enough financing in the system. We don\u2019t have enough prevention. It\u2019s a neglected area.\u201dGehshan says the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare reform initiative, will, in theory, extend dental coverage to every child in the nation, but she says the poorest of those children may still have trouble accessing care.\u201cThey need help with transportation, or translation, or child care, and most dental care is provided by private dentists and they\u2019re not set up to provide those extra services,\u201d she said.Gehshan says non-profit clinics like Switzer\u2019s facility are better equipped to address those needs, but charitable operations are rare. She says one possible solution some states are exploring is introducing what she calls \u201cmid-level\u201d dental practitioners. Currently, only fully accredited doctors are allowed to practice dentistry in the U.S.\u201cIn other countries there are other more different types of providers. So they have dental hygienists with extra training, or dental therapists, or people with both types of training,\" Gehshan said.Little Emily Bratcher\u2019s mother, Deborah, is not really interested in the politics of health care. She just wants her daughters to see a dentist regularly, and she\u2019s a little angry it is not happening now.\u201cIt\u2019s just upsetting, because I don\u2019t want my children to go through life having bad teeth, because I can\u2019t afford $3,000 for dental work every other month or something,\u201d Deborah Bratcher said.The Pew Center\u2019s Shelly Gehshan notes that the Affordable Care Act does not mandate dental coverage for adults, meaning millions of Americans will continue to struggle to maintain good oral health.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, Health, health, CDC, dentist, Affordable Health Care Act, dental care, dentist shortage", "Author": "Mike Osborne", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "Study finds 130 million Americans lack access to affordable dental care, and to complicate matters US has a severe shortage of dentists", "title": "More Americans Turn to ER for Dental Care", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/more-americans-turning-to-er-for-dental-care/1742253.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/AFE20D57-EF86-43DB-96B8-904542681BCE_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/AFE20D57-EF86-43DB-96B8-904542681BCE_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "More Americans Turn to ER for Dental Care", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
