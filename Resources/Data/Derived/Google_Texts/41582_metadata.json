The justices said federal law does not require companies to pay employees for the extra time because it is unrelated to their primary job duties.\n\nAdditional Images Workers like these at an Amazon fulfillment center in Lebanon, Tenn., are not entitled to pay for their time spent waiting to get through security, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nSome workers at Amazon contractor Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc., claim they wait up to 25 minutes to clear security before they can go home. Amazon has disputed those claims.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed a ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the screenings should be compensated because they were performed for the employer\u2019s benefit and were integral to the workers\u2019 jobs.\n\nWriting for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas said the screenings are not the \u201cprincipal activity\u201d which the workers are employed to perform.\n\n\u201cIntegrity Staffing did not employ its workers to undergo security screenings, but to retrieve products from warehouse shelves and package those products for shipment to Amazon customers,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nThomas also said the security checks were not \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to the employees\u2019 duties as warehouse workers. He based his decision on a federal law called the Portal-to-Portal Act, which specifically exempts employers from paying for pre- and post-work activities such as waiting to pick up protective gear or waiting in line to punch the clock.\n\nThe case was brought by Jesse Busk and Laurie Castro, two former workers at a Nevada Amazon warehouse who were employed by Integrity. Their lawyer argued that waiting in long security lines to go through metal detectors and empty their pockets each day was work because their employer required them to do it to keep merchandise from being stolen.\n\nAmazon was not a party to the Supreme Court case. The company declined to comment on the decision, but it disputed claims of long wait times for security checks.\n\n\u201cData shows that employees typically walk through security with little or no wait, and Amazon has a global process that ensures the time employees spend waiting in security is less than 90 seconds,\u201d said company spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman.\n\nJosh Buck, an attorney representing Busk and Castro, called the court\u2019s ruling disappointing.\n\n\u201cThe well-known idiom \u2018time is money\u2019 obviously does not apply to working people,\u201d Buck said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The unanimous decision is a victory for companies that routinely screen workers to prevent theft.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The unanimous decision is a victory for companies that routinely screen workers to prevent theft.", "title": "Supreme Court: Companies don't have to pay workers for time spent in security lines - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/551742_AP936468147735.jpg", "height": 706}, "updated_time": "2014-12-10T08:31:07-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/12/10/supreme-court-companies-dont-have-to-pay-workers-for-time-spent-in-security-lines/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The unanimous decision is a victory for companies that routinely screen workers to prevent theft.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/551742_AP936468147735.jpg", "title": "Supreme Court: Companies don't have to pay workers for time spent in security lines - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-12-10T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T08:31:07-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1e3\"", "article_summary": "Additional Images Workers like these at an Amazon fulfillment center in Lebanon, Tenn., are not entitled to pay for their time spent waiting to get through security, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.\nThe Supreme Court reversed a ruling from the 9th U.S.\nThomas also said the security checks were not \u201cintegral and indispensable\u201d to the employees\u2019 duties as warehouse workers.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that warehouse workers who fill orders for retail giant Amazon don\u2019t have to be paid for time spent waiting to pass through security checks at the end of their shifts.\nThe case was brought by Jesse Busk and Laurie Castro, two former workers at a Nevada Amazon warehouse who were employed by Integrity."}
