It talks about the infidels, their refuge being the fire,\u201d Father Doug Marcotte, of Saint Bartholomew\u2019s, told the station.\n\nSpecifically, Quran 3:151 reads: \u201cWe will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve for what they have associated with Allah of which He had not sent down [any] authority. And their refuge will be the Fire, and wretched is the residence of the wrongdoers.\u201d\n\nThe messages left residents and religious leaders shaken as they question the motive behind the messages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really bizarre and the fact that they hit two other Christian Churches. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re all in a line. So why did they pick the three of us?\u201d asked Father Marcotte. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bad stuff being done in the name of Allah and so when people see this happening in Columbus \u2026 it makes people nervous. It makes people upset. It makes them scared.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Islamic Society condemned the graffiti and offered to help clean it up. Member Nassim Khaled said he thinks the Quran verse had been taken out of context, because it refers to a time when people were persecuting Muslims.\n\n\u201cThe first reaction was I was very sad,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cWe are almost certain that it\u2019s someone from outside of our community or it\u2019s an unstable person.\u201d\n\nRon Bridgewater, a minister at East Columbus Christian, agreed.\n\n\u201cNobody really thought it was somebody from the Islamic community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just thought it was probably some kids trying to stir up some hate.\u201d\n\nColumbus police said they are using church surveillance video to try to identify the suspects.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police in Columbus, Indiana, are searching for the vandals responsible for spray-painting \"Infidels!\" and Quran verses on three Christian churches overnight Saturday.", "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Police in Columbus, Indiana, are searching for the vandals responsible for spray-painting \u201cInfidels!\u201d and Quran verses on three Christian churches overnight Saturday.", "title": "\u2018Infidels,\u2019 Quran verses painted on Christian churches in Indiana", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/2/infidels-quran-verses-painted-christian-churches-i/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/02/quran3151.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/02/quran3151.jpg", "title": "\u2018Infidels,\u2019 Quran verses painted on Christian churches in", "description": "Police in Columbus, Indiana, are searching for the vandals responsible for spray-painting \"Infidels!\" and Quran verses on three Christian churches overnight Saturday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Columbus"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9532\"", "article_summary": "Police in Columbus, Indiana, are searching for the vandals responsible for spray-painting \u201cInfidels!\u201d and Quran verses on three Christian churches overnight Saturday.\nThe words \u201cInfidels!\u201d and \u201cQur\u2019an 3:151\u201d were found painted in black outside Saint Bartholomew\u2019s Catholic Church, East Columbus Christian Church and Lakeview Church of Christ, the NBC-affiliated WTHR reported.\n\u201cWe are almost certain that it\u2019s someone from outside of our community or it\u2019s an unstable person.\u201dRon Bridgewater, a minister at East Columbus Christian, agreed.\nMember Nassim Khaled said he thinks the Quran verse had been taken out of context, because it refers to a time when people were persecuting Muslims.\nIt talks about the infidels, their refuge being the fire,\u201d Father Doug Marcotte, of Saint Bartholomew\u2019s, told the station."}
