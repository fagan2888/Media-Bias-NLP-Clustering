Rihanna\u2019s video aims to shock and titillate viewers with scenes of sexualized violence. In one of the first scenes a kidnapped woman is hung upside down, topless. We see images of her incapacitated, forced to drink and vomit in a bucket, and hit over the head with a glass bottle when she tries to seek out help. In the end, the twist of the video is that the \u201cbitch\u201d refers not to the beautiful woman who has been kidnapped, but her husband, who refuses to dish out money, even after learning that his wife is being tortured.\n\nWhat happens to the kidnapped woman is ambiguous; some viewers contend that she was drowned in a swimming pool: In one scene toward the end we see her lifeless facedown under the water next to Rihanna, who is buoyant and beautiful. Others claim, as a friend expanded on in detail over lunch, that she becomes a member of Rihanna\u2019s girl gang: at times in the video she seems to really enjoy hanging out with the women who kidnapped her, smiling and laughing, even as she is tied up. In an essay for New Statesman, writer Margaret Corvid suggests that \u201cBBHMM\u201d is a BDSM fantasy. The video features a number of pieces of S&M gear, and plays with many taboos regarding gender, race, and class.\n\nOne of the intriguing aspects of \u201cBBHMM\u201d is just how divided women have been in their response to the seven-minute music video. Rihanna\u2019s use of a female body as kidnapping victim has caused many feminists to express concern, just as Rihanna\u2019s reclaiming of power from a white, wealthy couple who tried to victimize her has been seen by other feminists as brave and triumphant. In her article \u201cThis Is What Rihanna\u2019s BBHMM Video Says About Black Women, White Women and Feminism,\u201d Mia McKenzie says,\n\n\u201cThe harm done to us by white men and white women isn\u2019t vastly different to many of us. White women have been unapologetically violent towards black women for centuries. They\u2019ve used the power of the state, of the police, of the courts, of the media, and of individual white men to harm black people, including black women, time and time again. They are as harmful to us as white men are. So, for many of us, kidnapping the white brother or the white wife is all the same.\u201d\n\nIs \u201cBBHMM\u201d a power anthem, reclaiming troubling images of sexualized violence, with an empowered black woman at the helm, or is it simply feeding into a culture that habitually features beautiful, tortured women as a trope?\n\nOften, when we talk about images of violence against women we assume that we are talking about how these images titillate male audiences. But the advent of videos like Rihanna\u2019s \u201cBBHMM\u201d and other female revenge fantasies like Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBad Blood\u201d make a case for the ways in which women have also been socialized to view enacting violence, and especially enacting violence on female bodies, as a sign of strength. Throughout \u201cBBHMM,\u201d Rihanna plays with elements of what is today often referred to as \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d \u2014 guns, money, expensive foreign cars, yachts, swimming pools, drugs and sexualized violence abound, and the revenge fantasy is predicated on a sense of absolute entitlement. Rather than transforming or reimagining any of these images, Rihanna adopts them, even using the language of pimps to demand that the male \u201cbitch\u201d give her hard earned cash.\n\nLikewise, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBad Blood\u201d presents an all-female army who use an arsenal of deadly weapons to eviscerate the woman who betrayed her. Each video is an escape to a world of fantasy violence that is typically read as \u201cmasculine\u201d\u2014the women seeking retribution are hard-eyed, focused, and bent on getting what is owed to them, even if it means destroying everything around them in the process. In the world of \u201cBBHMM\u201d and \u201cBad Blood,\u201d empathy and kindness are presented as weak, while the kind of cold sadism necessary to destroy an enemy is presented as intrinsically powerful.\n\nIn her essay \u201cDead Girls Sold Here,\u201d writer Anna March argues that feminists should push back on images of women being brutalized for entertainment, rather than silently accept that the influx of these narratives is unchangeable. One of the reasons rejecting sexism is challenging for women is not simply because they feel powerless; it\u2019s that women have also been seduced by these same images. Who wouldn\u2019t be? We grew up on artists, musicians and directors who taught us that violence is sexy, that true power comes from calling the shots. For the past 10 years, we\u2019ve watched male antiheroes dominate on-screen and become the most lauded shows on television. The iconography of these worlds always includes objectified women, who are frequently the victims of violence. Videos like \u201cBBHMM\u201d and \u201cBad Blood\u201d show how the women who are watching these iconic films and TV shows are not necessarily identifying with female victims at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the sadistic power-charged worlds of \"Bad Blood\" and \"Bitch Better Have My Money,\" empathy is for the weak", "title": "Girl swagger and blood lust: Rihanna, Taylor Swift and repackaging toxic masculinity for a female audience", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In the sadistic power-charged worlds of \"Bad Blood\" and \"Bitch Better Have My Money,\" empathy is for the weak", "title": "Girl swagger and blood lust: Rihanna, Taylor Swift and repackaging toxic masculinity for a female audience", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/girl_swagger_and_blood_lust_rihanna_taylor_swift_and_repackaging_toxic_masculinity_for_a_female_audience/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/rihanna_swift.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the sadistic power-charged worlds of \"Bad Blood\" and \"Bitch Better Have My Money,\" empathy is for the weak", "title": "Girl swagger and blood lust: Rihanna, Taylor Swift and repackaging toxic masculinity for a female audience", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/rihanna_swift.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Arielle Bernstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bad blood, Bitch Better, Feminism, Music, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ceb\"", "article_summary": "White women have been unapologetically violent towards black women for centuries.\nIn her article \u201cThis Is What Rihanna\u2019s BBHMM Video Says About Black Women, White Women and Feminism,\u201d Mia McKenzie says,\u201cThe harm done to us by white men and white women isn\u2019t vastly different to many of us.\nRather than transforming or reimagining any of these images, Rihanna adopts them, even using the language of pimps to demand that the male \u201cbitch\u201d give her hard earned cash.\nRihanna\u2019s video aims to shock and titillate viewers with scenes of sexualized violence.\nOften, when we talk about images of violence against women we assume that we are talking about how these images titillate male audiences."}
