As he explains to Reason's Nick Gillespie, the revolution is beginning in the most unlikeliest of states: Kansas.\n\n\"Kansas is the future. Kansas is the model,\" Norquist says. \"It became a Reagan-Republican House, Senate and governorship only with Governor Brownback's governorship. He...passed a law that fazes out the income tax over time. As revenue comes in from economic growth\u2013more than 2%\u2013you ratchet down the income tax.\"\n\nAs Americans realize states don't need an income tax to fit their budgets, Norquist argues, people will start to question why the federal government needs one too. \"For most of our country's history we didn't have an income tax,\" Norquist explains. \"In our 50 states, nine don't have income taxes. I think in the next 15 years it will be 25 that don't have income taxes.\"\n\nFor Norquist stopping ever-growing government and taxation is the only way to bring economic competitiveness back, but it's average Americans that will make that change. \"For those of us who think small government and low taxes is a better idea, guess what? Most people are with us. People are moving from high-tax states to low-tax states.\"\n\nAbout 18 minutes.\n\nProduced by Joshua Swain.
