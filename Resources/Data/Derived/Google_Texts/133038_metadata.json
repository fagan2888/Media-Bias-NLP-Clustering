Estrada, Esq.\n\nDirector of Federal Relations\n\nTAKE ACTION Protect your family. Join >> Defend homeschooling. Donate >> Stay informed. Subscribe >>\n\nYOUR ATTORNEY Will Estrada\n\nLast December, the United States Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services released a draft policy document outlining how the federal government can better \u201chelp\u201d children and families. On page one, the federal agencies made this stunning declaration:\n\n\u201cIt is the position of the Departments that all early childhood programs and schools recognize families as equal partners in improving children\u2019s development, learning and wellness across all settings, and over the course of their children\u2019s developmental and educational experiences.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nThis one sentence unmasks the federal government\u2019s true philosophy behind decades of federal involvement in welfare, kindergarten through 12th grade education spending and policies, programs like Head Start, and now the push to create universal early education for young children from birth through age 5: the federal government believes that its role is equal with the role of parents.\n\nA redefinition of the family\n\nNot only does this draft document expose the federal government\u2019s breathtaking arrogance, a footnote at the bottom of page one goes so far as to redefine the family:\n\nThe term \u201cfamily\u201d is used to include all the people who play a role in a child\u2019s life and interact with a child\u2019s early childhood program or school. This may include fathers, mothers, grandparents, foster parents, formal and informal guardians, and siblings, among others.\n\n\u201cAll the people who play a role in a child\u2019s life.\u201d All those who \u201cinteract with a child\u2019s early childhood program or school.\u201d \u201cInformal guardians.\u201d According to this footnote, a close family friend (an \u201cinformal guardian\u201d) could be considered part of a child\u2019s family. This could include a parent\u2019s boyfriend or girlfriend, even if the relationship is temporary or uncommitted. There have already been cases in which custody of a child was granted to the parent\u2019s former lover, against the parent\u2019s wishes. And a child\u2019s siblings are also important to family, but siblings shouldn\u2019t have the legal authority to make parenting decisions.\n\nHaving a relaxed definition of family is fine at Thanksgiving and Christmas, but parents, not the government, should be the sole decisionmakers where their children are concerned. This casual and open-ended (\u201camong others\u201d) definition of family sets up a slippery slope for parental rights and family freedom.\n\nAcross the nation, parents whose children attend public schools are fighting desperately to protect their children\u2019s privacy from big businesses that are using and selling their children\u2019s personal data, as a result of Obama Administration regulations that opened the floodgates to corporate exploitation. But why should parents fight this data collection if the federal government is ready to cozy up to those businesses as \u201cfamily\u201d?\n\nAt HSLDA, we believe that these statements reveal these agencies\u2019 true beliefs: that a child\u2019s God-given family does not matter. Family is whoever or whatever the government says it is.\n\nAll is not lost\n\nIt is important to recognize that this is a draft policy paper\u2014it is not yet finalized. Also, no new federal programs are being created in this draft policy paper. Rather, the paper represents recommendations from the Early Learning Interagency Policy Board (IPB) regarding federally funded early education programs currently providing services to children from birth through age 8. The IPB has been established jointly by the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services.\n\nAny new recommendations that are provided by the IPB would also need to be approved by Congress as part of the legislative process. But the document is extremely telling: for once, federal policymakers are being honest about their beliefs and goals. And their references in this draft document to families being \u201cequal partners\u201d with government agencies (the term is used multiple times), and their casual and breathtakingly broad redefinition of the family, highlights the federal government\u2019s arrogance when it comes to education and family policy.\n\nA culture of control\n\nSadly, this document only underscores what we have observed for a while: the federal government is intent on taking more and more power from parents when it comes to their children\u2019s lives.\n\nWhether it was the big businesses that worked hand in glove with big government bureaucrats to push the Common Core on our nation, dangerous UN treaties that would elevate UN bureaucrats over parents, the Pentagon\u2019s attempt to track all military families by where their children are educated, former MSNBC host and Tulane University Professor Melissa Harris-Perry\u2019s claim that \u201ckids belong to whole communities,\u201d President Obama\u2019s call in 2012 for all states to change their compulsory attendance statutes to keep kids in school until age 18, or his 2013 push to advance universal federally funded preschool, we see an intensifying movement of the federal government to consolidate control over all children from cradle to college.\n\nThe biggest advancement of this philosophy in recent years came in 2010 when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. HSLDA opposed this bill because it created a program of (voluntary for now) government home visitation programs. Unfortunately, when President Obama signed the ACA into law, these federally funded home visitation and parent training programs\u2014which had always been defeated before then\u2014became a reality.\n\nHSLDA has long fought attempts by the federal government to expand early childhood programs. There are already dozens of federally funded early education programs, most notably Head Start. Many of these programs are deeply flawed and don\u2019t produce the intended results, but instead of cutting back, the federal government is doubling down.\n\nAt its heart, these programs are not about education. The research proves this. It is more about government babysitting. And ultimately, it is about controlling parents and citizens. The example of Scotland\u2014a nation which recently enacted legislation mandating state supervision of all parents and children\u2014shows us the ultimate goal of this statist philosophy toward parents, children, and freedom itself.\n\nWhat can parents do to protect freedom?\n\nThe good news is that, for now, all of these programs are voluntary. It is why more families are choosing to homeschool, and leave a system that considers itself to be equal with parents. If your children are homeschooled or in private school, you are not affected. But this is not what we want for ourselves or our neighbors. It is a troubling and dangerous trend. This is why HSLDA is working so hard to enshrine parental rights in the U.S. Constitution through passage and ratification of the Parental Rights Amendment. We must do this before it is too late.\n\nOur federal representatives need to know that we care about this. They need to hear that instead of multiplying these programs, Congress must end federal involvement in early childhood programs. States and local governments, with more accountability from the people, should be making decisions about these issues. This draft policy statement shows that we cannot trust federal bureaucrats when it comes to raising and educating our children.\n\nIn the interest of ordinary American moms and dads, the ones who truly can and do make the life-changing difference in their children\u2019s lives, we need to be the ones who stand up to the federal government.\n\nThat\u2019s why we choose to homeschool our children: we don\u2019t want the public school\u2019s one-size-fits-all approach to education. We don\u2019t want the Common Core. We don\u2019t want help from Washington to raise our children. We remember what President Ronald Reagan said: \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I\u2019m from the government, and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d We have taken a stand for freedom. And ultimately, loving parents who care, educate, and provide for their children, will make the difference.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.hslda.org/about/logo_color.png"}, "Description": "Washington policymakers think they are \u201cequal partners\u201d with parents.
