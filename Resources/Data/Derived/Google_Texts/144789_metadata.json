I\u2019m heading out to buy ginger candies for my wife, Marsha, who\u2019s upstairs in bed, feeling queasy after her latest round of chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cGoing to get something for Mom; be right back,\u201d I call to my 15-year-old.\n\n\u201cHow is she doing?\u201d asks Maya.\n\nIn my head I think: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask her yourself since she is just one flight of stairs away!\u201d But I bite my tongue. I don\u2019t want to add to the tension cancer has already brought to our home.\n\nLooking back, I realize that Maya wasn\u2019t the only family member to avoid direct communication during the seemingly endless months of treatment. Consumed with all things cancer, my wife and I never asked her and her younger sister, Daniela, who was 13 at the time: \u201cHow are you guys doing?\u201d\n\nMany families find themselves in a similar situation: parent with cancer, teens in the house, not a lot of cross-generational conversation. Nearly 3 million American children live with a parent who is a cancer survivor. Roughly a third of those kids are 13 to 17 years old. While parents pay a lot of attention to the needs of younger kids, they may figure, as we did, that teens are old enough to cope.\n\nUnfortunately, the nature of adolescence fights against openness of any kind. With their kids locked behind a mask of teen indifference, parents \u201care often intimidated and don\u2019t know how to talk to them,\u201d says Sharon Sosa, an oncology counselor in Fairfax, Va. The news that a parent has cancer yanks the adolescent back into the fold \u2014 exactly where the kid doesn\u2019t want to be.\n\nTEENS AND CANCER\n\nYour spouse has cancer. Your teen is giving you the cold shoulder. What to do:\n\n\u2022 Determine the best way to talk: family meeting (if that\u2019s already part of your routine, keep it going), carpool rides (captive audience and no eye contact required), in a notebook where teens write questions and you respond.\n\n\u2022 Be honest: That way, your teen won\u2019t fear that you\u2019re hiding bad news. But you don\u2019t have to share every little thing. You may not want to tell your child the degree of pain a parent is in, for example, unless necessary.\n\n\u2022 Follow up: \u201cThat stuff I told you about the surgery: too much information, not enough? Any questions?\u201d\n\n\u2022 Let them eavesdrop: If your teens say they really don\u2019t want to know anything but you think they should, try discussing cancer matters when the kids are nearby.\n\n\u2022 Alert your child\u2019s school: Your teen\u2019s academic performance may become erratic. Teachers can keep an eye out and let you know if things slide too far. Source: Marc Silver, The Washington Post Your spouse has cancer. Your teen is giving you the cold shoulder.

Teachers can keep an eye out and let you know if things slide too far.\n\nSome respond with a disappearing act: After-school activities, mall excursions, sleepovers, you name it, they\u2019ll do it to avoid the uncertain environment at home. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care; it\u2019s just their way of dealing with it all, says Maureen Davey, a family therapy professor at Drexel University College of Nursing and Health Professions.\n\nOther kids respond by defying their developmental stage, assuming responsibilities that normally fall to the parents. Out of sync with their peers, these kids sometimes talk about their real age and their \u201ccancer age.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 16, and I have to act like I\u2019m 40,\u201d a teen named Lyndsey told me. While her mother is in treatment for breast cancer, she says, \u201cI have to cook, clean, make sure my mom eats, my brothers are fed.\u201d\n\nA \u201cparentified\u201d teenager will inevitably feel frustrated. Teens may be \u201cangry they have to take over everything and nobody appreciates that they\u2019re doing so much more than they used to,\u201d says psychiatrist Karen Weihs, medical director for supportive care at the University of Arizona Cancer Center in Tucson.\n\nNo matter how the teenager responds, the parents can help. That means sharing, whether the news is good or bad.\n\nIt is critical for parents to remember that, cancer or no cancer, they still need to keep an eye on their teens \u2014 no easy task, especially when a parent is ill. The key, Sosa points out, is listening closely even though \u201cyour head is in so many different places\u201d because of the cancer diagnosis.\n\nThat means not just going \u201cun-huh, un-huh,\u201d but asking follow-up questions, even challenging your teen at times. If teens know you\u2019re truly paying attention, she says, \u201cthey\u2019re going to tell you all sorts of things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Parents may tend to emotional needs of younger kids, but overlook teens"}, "article_summary": "If teens know you\u2019re truly paying attention, she says, \u201cthey\u2019re going to tell you all sorts of things.\u201d\nWith their kids locked behind a mask of teen indifference, parents \u201care often intimidated and don\u2019t know how to talk to them,\u201d says Sharon Sosa, an oncology counselor in Fairfax, Va.\nThe news that a parent has cancer yanks the adolescent back into the fold \u2014 exactly where the kid doesn\u2019t want to be.\nOther kids respond by defying their developmental stage, assuming responsibilities that normally fall to the parents.\nWhile parents pay a lot of attention to the needs of younger kids, they may figure, as we did, that teens are old enough to cope."}
