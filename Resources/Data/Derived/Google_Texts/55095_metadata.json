In 2003, he helped set up a charity to test his bold idea and build a fund of contributions to dole out to needy patients.\n\n\n\nLong before he considered a presidential bid, the world famous neurosurgeon envisioned building Angels of the OR into an endowment that would generate enough interest income to cover uninsured patients expenses for neurological surgeries and other medical costs. He even pitched the idea to a congressional subcommittee in 2006, testifying that a small federal grant could help the charity prove that the concept could work on a grander scale.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're looking forward to a time when we can use our God-given talents once again to stomp out disease and maybe even help to create a model for national medical access,\u201d he told a House appropriations subcommittee.\n\n\n\nBut it didn't work out that way: The national fund did not materialize, and over nine years of operation, Angels of the OR [Operating Room] generated less than $150,000 for patient care and helped 34 patients cover portions of their medical bills, according to its tax forms. Carson had said he wanted to raise as much as $20 million in seed money, but the charity collected less than $1 million from donations and celebrity-studded events \u2014 like a private benefit headlined by Kenny Rogers and the 2003 film premiere of \u201cStuck on You,\u201d in which Carson made a cameo appearance.\n\n\n\nAngels of the OR spent $1.03 million during its life span, and at least 53 percent of its funds went to salaries and fundraising costs, according to POLITICO\u2019s review of its records.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charity shut down in 2013 when Carson stepped down as director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt was a quiet end to an effort that Carson once described as \u201crevolutionary\u201d and destined to help solve the problem of providing medical services to the needy. In his 2007 book, \u201cTake the Risk,\u201d Carson suggested that if the nation could set aside one of every seven health care dollars into such an endowment for at least a decade, the result would be a $3 trillion health care fund, \u201clarge enough to fund American health care forever.\u201d\n\nBut he hasn't yet mentioned the idea of a health care endowment on the presidential campaign trail. Instead, his discussion of health care has focused on scalding critiques of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and a pitch for a system of health savings accounts to take the place of entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. He suggested in recent weeks that he\u2019ll soon unveil a new health care plan. And despite a deep-seated commitment to the power of charity \u2014 his much-praised Carson Scholars Fund has awarded more than $4.2 million in scholarships to 6,700 students, according to its website \u2014 Carson hasn\u2019t cited Angels of the OR in his health care plans. The Carson campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nJoseph Chadwick Jr., an investment adviser and former president of Angels of the OR, called the charity \u201cmodestly successful. We gave it a try.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe told POLITICO the organization wound down because donors expected Obama's health reform to take care of the problems the charity was trying to address.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t really going anywhere, and we felt it would be some time before we could get effective interest because of the belief that the Affordable Care Act was going to take care of these issues, we then put it into a passive category,\u201d Chadwick said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSusan Thompson, a nonprofit administrator who served as the charity's executive director for less than a year, described it as a well-intentioned effort that never gained traction. She said most decision-making was \u201cdriven by the board of directors\u201d and that the organization functioned in \u201cfits and starts.\u201d\n\n\n\nExperts in nonprofit management who discussed the charity\u2019s tax forms with POLITICO said Angels of the OR never developed a sound business plan and spent much of its early income on fundraising and personnel rather than patients.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no clear pattern of operation here,\u201d said Christine W. Letts, a senior lecturer in nonprofit leadership at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. \u201cIt is clear that they never had consistent fundraising, and in the later years, it dwindled to very little.\u201d\n\n\n\nMike Burns, a consultant with BWB Solutions, a national consulting firm in Branford, Connecticut, called the charity\u2019s grants \u201cdisproportionately small\u201d compared to its expenses, especially in 2008, when it spent only $10,000 on what its tax returns categorized as \u201cpatient services.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe rule of thumb is 75 percent toward program-related initiatives and 25 percent for administrative stuff,\u201d said Will Brown, a professor and director of the nonprofit management program at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.\n\n\n\nDesiree Adaway, a 30-year veteran of nonprofit management, said Carson's charity may have fallen into a trap faced by thousands of nonprofits. Heavy startup costs drain money, then donations fall off. \u201cA lot of them are floundering because they don\u2019t have resources,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nChadwick told POLITICO that almost all of the money spent on patient services went into a \u201cpatient relief fund\u201d operated by Johns Hopkins, which performed largely the same function as Carson\u2019s charity \u2014 covering costs of care for patients who couldn\u2019t afford it on their own. The charity paid $135,000 into the Hopkins fund.\n\n\n\nBut Lynn Salganik, a Maryland consultant who worked as treasurer for Angels of the OR, said its tax records do not reflect the full range of assistance it provided patients. She said it arranged for no-cost care for many patients without having to use its own funds. \u201cA mention of Dr. Carson, that would open doors,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nCarson originally set up the medical charity as the Benevolent Endowment Network, or BEN Fund, with an emphasis on children. He and another Johns Hopkins Hospital neurosurgeon, Clifford T. Solomon, expanded the project to cover medically needy adults and changed the charity\u2019s to name to Angels of the OR. Solomon, who testified alongside Carson at the House hearing in 2006, did not return phone calls. He is not listed as a Carson campaign donor. Today, Solomon leads the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Spine & Neuroscience Center.\n\n\n\nIn describing its mission, the charity said it hoped \u201cto conduct a range of surgeries at Johns Hopkins Hospital, to finalize legal issues and apply/secure for insurance coverage, [and] to develop approach to request congressional funding award.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2006, Carson and Solomon testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, asking for a \u201csmall investment of federal dollars.\u201d Both doctors described desperate patients who needed brain surgeries but could not get medical attention without insurance. The charity\u2019s filings show no record that any such appropriation ever came. Carson testified that he had invested $70,000 of his own money to get the charity going, but after its first year, the nonprofit did not list its donors.\n\n\n\nCarson and Solomon said during their committee appearance that they had spoken to celebrities like cyclist Lance Armstrong and former Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist, another doctor-turned-politician, about securing support for their effort. The charity held a December 2006 fundraising event at Baltimore\u2019s Hippodrome headlined by Kenny Rogers, according to a news account.\n\n\n\nCarson testified that he grew discouraged by the financial struggles faced by uninsured patients. \u201cThis reached the point where I was about to leave medicine about six years ago and then came up with the idea of creating an endowment, the interest of which could be used to take care of such people,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut Angels of the OR operated at a deficit after its first two years. It invested in furnishing a Baltimore office and establishing a website that included an application for medical assistance.\n\n\n\nIt paid out $50,000 for \u201cpatient services\u201d in 2006 and $15,000 in 2007, the tax filings show.\n\n\n\nContributions fell off in 2008, and the charity spent $12,500 to help 15 patients in 2008 and 2009, according to its tax forms. It tried to reduce overhead costs by turning over some of its work to another charity, the Baltimore Community Foundation, which charged it $12,000 in fees, according to foundation spokeswoman Gigi Wirtz.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the group reported helping five patients, allocating $2,837. That same year, it spent $4,832 to purchase tiles from Hopkins' historic dome that it could resell to raise funds.\n\n\n\nThe charity's endowment \u2014 which was supposed to be a vehicle for generating interest income \u2014 peaked at $372,902 in 2006 and dwindled to $13,503 by 2011. The fund never earned more than $7,200 a year from investments, which included, at one point, $2,274 of Coca-Cola stock, according to the tax forms.\n\nThe organization's website highlighted 10 success stories, including how the organization helped a family pay its deductible for a daughter's MRI, gave $5,000 to help a 47-year-old Virginia man pay out-of-pocket expenses for brain tumor surgery and funded $5,000 for a woman who needed a transfusion. The descriptions acknowledged that Angels of the OR defrayed only a fraction of the patients' medical costs for expensive procedures.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust a couple weeks ago, I remember seeing a young family, devastated, had just found out that their 5-year-old had multiple brain tumors,\u201d Carson said in a 2008 promotional video in which he and Solomon appealed for donations. \u201cThere were multiple financial obstacles that precluded this patient from being able to be taken care of here. But through Angels of the OR we were able to overcome those obstacles. That child underwent successful surgery last week.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Ben Carson set up a fund to help needy patients, but most of its money went to overhead.", "title": "Carsoncare: The doctor's ill-fated dream of solving America's health care woes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/carsoncare-the-doctors-needy-patients-fund-that-went-nowhere-216111", "image": "http://static.politico.com/25/bb/b48ae49946b2b3d0b1f83a8d3419/151123-ben-carson-charity-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Ben Carson set up a fund to help needy patients, but most of its money went to overhead.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Instead, his discussion of health care has focused on scalding critiques of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and a pitch for a system of health savings accounts to take the place of entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\nHe suggested in recent weeks that he\u2019ll soon unveil a new health care plan.\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson thought he had a way to create a system of universal health care to cover millions of uninsured Americans.\nIn his 2007 book, \u201cTake the Risk,\u201d Carson suggested that if the nation could set aside one of every seven health care dollars into such an endowment for at least a decade, the result would be a $3 trillion health care fund, \u201clarge enough to fund American health care forever.\u201dBut he hasn't yet mentioned the idea of a health care endowment on the presidential campaign trail.\nCarson originally set up the medical charity as the Benevolent Endowment Network, or BEN Fund, with an emphasis on children."}
