Analysts were expecting full-year revenue of $10.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe company also forecast current-quarter revenue to range between $2.55 billion and $2.58 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $2.66 billion.\n\nCognizant provides services such as claims processing, billing and call center operations to insurers, hospitals and some state-run healthcare exchanges set up under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nFor the second quarter, Cognizant's profit came in above the average analyst estimate, helped by higher IT spending in North America and Europe and growth in its healthcare business division.\n\nNet income in the second quarter ended June 30 rose to $371.9 million, or 61 cents per share, above analysts' average estimate of a profit of 58 cents per share.\n\nRevenue rose 16.5 percent to $2.52 billion, in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nCognizant's rivals Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd reported better-than-expected profit for the same period.\n\n(Reporting by Soham Chatterjee, Supantha Mukherjee and Lehar Maan in Bangalore; Editing by Simon Jennings and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Soham Chatterjee and Lehar Maan", "Author": "Soham Chatterjee and Lehar Maan", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "REUTERS -
