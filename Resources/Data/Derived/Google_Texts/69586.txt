Patricia Marx is a staff writer for The New Yorker and an author. Her latest book, “Let’s Be Less Stupid,” publishes next summer.

She says she reads the paper on her computer late at night.

“I know it is very unfashionable to dislike paper,” she says, “but I could never get the hang of folding The Times (it always looked as if I was trying to make a hat for a children’s birthday party).

“Also, who has time to look for the continuation of the story on Page A16?”

Q.

Does the late-night, online way you read the paper affect what you read?

A.

My approach has made me fairly malnourished, news-wise, in the same way that someone who eats only at buffets tends to concentrate on dessert.

Also, it means that I am never sure when anything happened. Often, I know about a development in a story or about the death of a famous person hours before the news is printed in the morning paper. It’s like being a visitor from the future.

On the other hand, I sometimes read old news without knowing it was written weeks ago, so I have to be careful not to say things like, “Hey, can you believe the Visigoths sacked Rome?!”



Q.

Are there kinds of articles that you always read or that you reliably don’t?

A.

When a story breaks in the news — say, a junta seizes power in a country you can’t find on a map — you have to make a snap decision about whether it will have legs or whether you will never see a report on that subject again.

If it is a story that will become major, you must get in on the ground floor, or otherwise there will be too many political factions and similar sounding names and you will never catch up enough to know what’s going on.

It’s like buying stock in a current event — you want something that’s going to pay off in the long term. Decades ago, I made a bad judgment call about the crisis in the Mideast, thinking it would blow over in a few days, and consequently, I’ve never been straight about, for instance, Hamas versus Hezbollah versus P.L.O. versus Fatah. You can ask me anything about the Symbionese Liberation Army or the Y2K problem, though.

There was a small not-much-to-it article this week about education in Nepal. I read every word, and now, if things go well for Nepal (which is to say not well), I am poised to become a pundit on Katmandu.

Q.

And are there kinds of articles you are happy to skip?

A.

There are some articles I really appreciate because I don’t feel guilty about skipping them. “How to Cook a Thanksgiving Dinner” was an example this week. Ditto the entire sports section except for occasional baseball news. Ditto weather events, such as record-breaking cold waves, that take over the headlines, giving me a news holiday.

Nowadays, so much of what I read I forget the next day. In order to minimize this kind of brain spillage, I have developed a strategy for reading a hard news story that involves figuring out when the article has moved on to details I’ll never remember and stopping there.

Q.

Editorials. Do you read them? Do they ever change your mind?

A.

I am a knee-jerk liberal and I want to stay that way no matter how compelling the argument on the other side is. I also have a habit of agreeing with whatever I read last. Therefore, I avoid editorials written by conservative columnists. The libertarians often make some good points and many of them write articulately and persuasively, so I never read anything by them. I basically stick with Krugman, Bruni and Dowd.

Q.

Obits. Do you read them with special interest?

A.

Everyone I know likes obituaries, and I’m no different. I feel, though, that Paragraph No. 2, the one that contains the cause of death, should be expanded. I am sure I am not the only one who wants to know the first symptom of the deadly disease. Also, if you could include the deceased’s last words, that would be helpful.

Q.

Is The Times a good source of material for a humor writer (you)?

A.

I am always on the lookout for stories with comedy potential. Unfortunately, so is every other humorist. This week it was disclosed that yet another former Navy SEAL claimed credit for firing the shot that killed Osama. I barely read that item because I knew Andy Borowitz, who writes a hilarious humor column for The New Yorker, would deal with it (as would late-night talk show hosts, who are also funnier than I am). I couldn’t resist reading the amusing and intriguing squib, however, about the invention of a color that is the blackest black. It is called Vantablack. Doesn’t that sound like the opposite of Vanna White?

Q.

Any good news in the paper this week?

A.

This was a good week for fortuitous accidents, which made me happy because I am careless and I like to think something good might result. There was an obituary of the guy who invented CorningWare not on purpose and also a letter to the editor attributing the fall of the Berlin Wall to blunders made by Eastern European politicians.

On the other hand, Paul Krugman says that Obamacare might be felled by a typo in a clause of the Affordable Care Act. This makes me think that if they don’t make auto-correct illegal (or should I say: “Room swallows next cone dip photocopier eject the paint penis”), there might not be any laws left. Of course, they’d probably end up banning automobiles instead, which would be O.K. with me.

Q.

Last word?

A.

The story I most wish I’d read when I was in college was the one reporting that New York City police will soon no longer arrest you for possessing a small amount of marijuana. This is like hearing from your parents long after you’ve moved away from home that you no longer have a curfew.
