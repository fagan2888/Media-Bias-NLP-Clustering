And his office continued to beat back the not-exactly-library-voice whisper campaign favoring a coup at the Republican convention in July that would elevate Ryan to the top of the ticket.\n\nRyan is, indeed, at the center of a national campaign \u2014 one he calls \u201cConfident America\u201d \u2014 but it is not necessarily for president.\n\nWhile Ryan has repeatedly said he has no intention of becoming his party\u2019s nominee this year, he is already deep into his own parallel national operation to counter Donald Trump and help House and Senate candidates navigate the political headwinds that Trump would generate as the party\u2019s standard-bearer \u2014 or, for that matter, Sen. Ted Cruz, who is only slightly more popular.\n\nRyan is creating a personality and policy alternative to run alongside the presidential effort \u2014 one that provides a foundation to rebuild if Republicans splinter and lose in the fall. \u201cHe is running a parallel policy campaign,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.\n\nHe is shaping an agenda that he plans to roll out right before the convention, a supplement of sorts to the official party platform. He gives regular speeches on politics and policy \u2014 particularly on poverty and economic issues \u2014 then backs them up in the news media.\n\nIt is not a move without risks. His policy positions on immigration and trade, which have contributed to his mirage candidacy, are in great tension with the views of many Republican primary voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Paul,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., one of the very few Trump supporters in Congress. \u201cHe\u2019s a good person and he\u2019s smart, but issues like trade and immigration are going to be important, and I don\u2019t think anybody gets the Republican nomination that\u2019s not in sync with a substantial majority of the American people on those two key issues.\u201d\n\nStill, his name is a major draw. Ryan raises substantial sums of money for Republicans, even while keeping his promise to spend Sunday at his children\u2019s sporting events in Janesville, Wisc., instead of golfing with donors as his predecessor John Boehner did. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $185,000 from two emails from Ryan last month, more than the group\u2019s entire haul in March 2014, during the last House races. He became speaker late last year.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that Ryan is operating in a very ambitious way,\u201d said Peter Wehner, a former director of the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives under President George W. Bush who has known Ryan for two decades. \u201cHe is trying to set forth a path for the party with ideas and policy proposals and principles,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is unusual for a speaker in an election year, but Ryan himself is a very different person, and this is the product of this very unusual presidential year.\u201d\n\nHis office is adept at using social media to further Ryan\u2019s agenda \u2014 and deepen speculation about his ambitions. During a winter snowstorm, the speaker\u2019s Snowcam drove record traffic to his website, especially new visitors. Then there was his \u201cI am definitely not running\u201d campaign-style video, another big draw, as well as the SpeakerSelfie and in-video captions designed to accommodate the autoplay features on Twitter and Facebook that keep people watching.\n\nRyan\u2019s parallel track is intended largely to counter Trump, who stands apart from him and many of the party\u2019s policy traditions. While Ryan is a vocal advocate of trade deals and wrote legislation that gave President Obama expanded authority to negotiate them, Trump is equally vocal in opposing free trade.\n\nRyan is the architect of his party\u2019s plan to rein in spending on entitlement programs, while Trump has vowed to leave such spending untouched. Ryan also has been a leader in his party in supporting an overhaul of the immigration system; opposing this is at the center of Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nWhile Cruz shares more of Ryan\u2019s views, especially on issues like defunding Planned Parenthood, he turned against Ryan\u2019s trade legislation \u2014 which he once supported \u2014 and has embraced Trump\u2019s hard-line views on immigration.\n\nYet even if Cruz prevails, Ryan may still offer a supplemental set of talking points for the rest of his party to follow.\n\nFor example, if the Republican nominee does not provide an alternative to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something Republicans have failed to do since it passed in 2010 \u2014 Ryan intends to do so, just as he will lay out an anti-poverty plan. Ryan will even take the highly unusual step of presenting a national-security agenda that may not be in step with the nominee\u2019s.\n\nAt this point, Ryan\u2019s early efforts have done little more than to elevate the speculation about a presidential candidacy that he keeps publicly tamping down. His moves certainly have not unified the party.\n\nAnd while Ryan\u2019s positions remain popular with many Republicans in Washington, they are out of step with the white-hot populism that has fueled this year\u2019s campaign. He remains a proponent of changes to the immigration system even though some Republican voters have been attracted to Trump\u2019s plan to ban Muslims from entering the country and force Mexico to pay for a wall at the border.\n\nEven within the House, Ryan\u2019s ideas have met with resistance. He cannot get a budget passed, largely because he will not support the deep spending cuts favored by conservatives like Cruz.\n\nRyan has long said that he will support the party\u2019s nominee, even as he has taken frequent shots at Trump\u2019s comments. But many Republicans expect that if Trump prevails, Ryan will avoid directly helping him, choosing, instead, to shore up vulnerable House Republicans, particularly those who may be running away from Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he would use his position as the stick in the eye of Trump or taunt him,\u201d Wehner said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Ryan would be at all shy about laying out the agenda of the Republican Party, because, remember, there are a lot of people voting against Trump out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan is at the center of a national campaign \u2014 one he calls \u201cConfident America\u201d \u2014 but it is not necessarily for president.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Paul Ryan is at the center of a national campaign \u2014 one he calls \u201cConfident America\u201d \u2014 but it is not necessarily for president.", "title": "Paul Ryan wages policy battle parallel to Republican presidential race", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/paul-ryan-wages-policy-battle-parallel-to-republican-presidential-race/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1c4671a0-ff81-11e5-b537-5cf9d7d7b807-1560x1040.jpg", "height": 1040}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "Paul Ryan is at the center of a national campaign \u2014 one he calls \u201cConfident America\u201d \u2014 but it is not necessarily for president.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1c4671a0-ff81-11e5-b537-5cf9d7d7b807-780x520.jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan wages policy battle parallel to Republican presidential race"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124, app-argument=st://article/9974116", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2016-04-10 20:02:07", "modified_time": "2016-04-12 18:09:09"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nation & World, Nation & World Politics"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe is running a parallel policy campaign,\u201d said Sen.
