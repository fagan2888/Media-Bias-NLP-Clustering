Obama blasted Republicans in the U.S. Senate for blocking a Democratic-supported bill earlier in the day aimed at addressing a gap in pay between male and female workers. Republicans argued that pay discrimination is already illegal. Obama also cited Republicans\u2019 refusal to agree to an immigration overhaul and an increase in the minimum wage as examples of what he called obstruction by his political opponents.\n\nThough the president\u2019s remarks were not recorded, the pool report quoted him as saying, \u201cThis has become the least productive Congress in modern history, recent memory. And that\u2019s by objective measures \u2013 just basic activity.\u201d\n\nThe notion of a do-nothing Congress comes up from time to time, so it\u2019s probably worth pausing occasionally to ask whether Obama\u2019s criticism is true.\n\nIn reality, it is.\n\nSo far, the 113th Congress \u2013 the current one that officially began early last year \u2013 has passed a grand total of 98 bills. That includes literally everything, from national security to health care to bills that change the names of post offices.\n\nIf that total sounds at all impressive, just compare it to every other modern Congress. Indeed, as the above chart shows, this Congress is easily on track to pass fewer laws than any Congress since clerks started keeping track nearly seven decades ago.\n\nIn fairness, the above chart tells an incomplete picture, since the current Congress isn\u2019t finished yet and I\u2019m comparing it against other two-year totals.\n\nBut since lawmakers don\u2019t intend to work too much between now and the end of the year, chances are extremely good that this Congress will break the record \u2013 a record set by the last Congress, which governed (or at least tried to) in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIndeed, even if lawmakers showed an unexpected interest in legislating and quickly doubled their productivity before the year ends, this Congress would still be the least productive on record.\n\nSome political scientists will argue that these bill counts aren\u2019t the ideal metric for evaluating a Congress, and it\u2019s a credible point \u2013 as we\u2019ve discussed before, quality tends to matter more than quantity, and if a Congress passes worthwhile legislation, that arguably matters more than the raw totals.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The president told supporters last night, \"This has become the least productive Congress in modern history.\" Is that true?
