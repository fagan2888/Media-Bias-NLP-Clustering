The implications may be long lasting, not only for the cable channel, but also for the Republican Party.\n\nSince its inception nearly 20 years ago, Ailes has ruled the Fox News fiefdom within Murdoch\u2019s sprawling 21stCentury Fox media empire and built it into a hugely influential moneymaker. The Ailes programming fingerprint has always been omnipresent at Fox.\n\nBut now as Murdoch signals his eventual withdrawal from corporate leadership and hands the reigns over his sons, James and Lachlan, Ailes is suddenly left without his key ally and now faces a somewhat uncertain future. (Fox\u2019s contract with Ailes, who is 75, expires next year.)
