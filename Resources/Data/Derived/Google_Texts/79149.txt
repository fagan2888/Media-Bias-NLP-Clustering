McLean Faulconer Inc.

Established in 1980, McLean Faulconer Inc. has become one of the premier real estate agencies in Charlottesville, Virginia. Founders Stephen McLean and Jim Faulconer grew up in Charlottesville and knew there was no other place they would like to raise a family of their own. Based on their own personal experience, Stephen and Jim realized they could offer clients unmatched knowledge about the local area and all that it has to offer. Over thirty years later, McLean Faulconer continues to embrace this concept and so do the agents that represent them. Stephen and Jim have assembled a roster of the areaâ€™s most experienced agents. Like the company founders, our dedicated agents are long-established locals and have deep-rooted relationships throughout the local community. Careful assessment goes into every property we list and our agents can offer a referral network that you will not find at any other agency. McLean Faulconer may not be the largest agency, but we have proven our personal approach offers the best real estate service possible to both buyers and sellers. McLean Faulconer currently has more than one-third of the total area market listings and outsells every other firm in the area on a per capita basis. We believe our success is a direct reflection of our personal approach, attention to detail, and the overwhelming depth of knowledge we can provide to our clients. Real estate is a complex business, but thanks to our experienced, well-respected agents, McLean Faulconer can make the process of buying or selling your home easy and enjoyable.
