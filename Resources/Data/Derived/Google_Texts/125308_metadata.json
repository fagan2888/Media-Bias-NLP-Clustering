That includes betting on the outcome of a future event.\n\nSB1515 would specifically exclude \u201cfantasy sports league competitions.\u201d\n\nBut Kelsey Lundy, who lobbies for the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, insisted that the legislation her group is pushing does not, in fact, legalize anything. Instead, she told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday this simply seeks to clarify the law.\n\nThat, however, is not the conclusion of Attorney General Mark Brnovich.\n\nIn a letter to the chief executive of DraftKings, one of the fantasy league firms, Brnovich noted the company is soliciting players nationwide. But in the letter, obtained by Capitol Media Services, Brnovich told Jason Robins that DraftKings is apparently failing to warn Arizonans that they would be breaking the law by participating and collecting any winnings.\n\nFantasy sports is a kind of online game where players choose \u201cvirtual teams\u201d of real players in a professional sport. Based on each of those player\u2019s performances in actual games, the team accumulates points.\n\nPlayers win and lose money depending on the performance of their teams.\n\nWhat at one time started as seasonal wagers have now exploded into daily games and payouts.\n\nLundy said Arizonans have been participating in online fantasy leagues since the early 1990s.\n\nThe problem, she said, is state law spells out exceptions from its ban on gambling, ranging from bingo nights at churches to the games of skill at places like Dave and Buster\u2019s.\n\n\u201cBut the law is silent on fantasy sports in Arizona which has created this legal gray zone that my client would like to clarify,\u201d Lundy said.\n\nThat contention that fantasy sports always has been legal is crucial to what happens even if the measure is approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor.\n\nIn 2002 the state signed a deal giving Indian tribes the exclusive right to operate certain kinds of gambling. That compact includes limits on types of gaming, the number of casinos and the number of machines.\n\nMore significant, that deal says if the state expands the kinds of gaming allowed off reservation it triggers a \u201cpoison pill\u201d in that compact that eliminates any limits on what the tribes can do. And that also would absolve the tribes of any further obligation to share profits with the state.\n\nFor the most recent budget year, that figure exceeds $88.4 million.\n\nGaming interests crafted the legislation to have a specific legislative finding that the competitions have been in Arizona since the 1990s, \u201cproviding business and fan opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Legislature has never considered fantasy sports league competitions to be a form of gambling,\u201d reads the language approved by the committee.\n\nBut Valerie Spicer, executive director of the Indian Gaming Association of Arizona, said her members believe the law would trigger the \u201cpoison pill,\u201d even with the legislative disclaimer.\n\nProponents said they don\u2019t need to resolve that: The legislation contains language saying the law goes away if a court ultimately determines that it does, in fact, expand gaming in Arizona.\n\nBut Spicer said by that point, it will be too late. She said simply approving the law \u2014 even if can be voided later \u2014 triggers the provision.\n\nAnd she derided the premise of the measure and its wording.\n\n\u201cSimply stating that it is not gambling doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not gambling,\u201d Spicer said, pointing out actions taking place across the nation by attorneys general in other states to review the issue, a review she said is likely to end the daily fantasy sports operations.\n\nThat\u2019s the conclusion that Brnovich already has reached.\n\n\u201cParticipation in your games for monetary winnings violates Arizona law,\u201d he wrote to Robins.\n\nAnd even if Arizona cannot shut down DrafKings, Brnovich warned Robins his firm could be in violation of the state\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act for failing to warn Arizona consumers \u201cthat they are ineligible to play for monetary winnings.\u201d\n\nThe 5-2 vote occurred over the objections of Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, who said her organization is opposed to any kind of legal gaming in the state.\n\nHerrod said she understands that some people enjoy these fantasy leagues.\n\n\u201cThat is not the issue before you today,\u201d she told lawmakers. She said the issue is that \u201cgambling harms families.\u201d\n\nAnd Herrod said it\u2019s irrelevant that winning does require some skill, versus a lottery which is simply a game of chance. She said it is being advertised to would-be players as a quick way to get rich, with daily games versus a payoff at the end of the season.\n\n\u201cIt does involve luring people in to bet on big payouts,\u201d Herrod said. \u201cPeople lose money while other people are making money off of some losing their money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "State lawmakers are moving to spell out that the \u201cfantasy sports\u201d leagues being advertised heavily on TV -- and the wagering around them -- is legal in Arizona, even as prosecutors in some other states are trying to close them down.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Howard Fischer, Capitol Media Services", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "State lawmakers are moving to spell out that the \u201cfantasy sports\u201d leagues being advertised heavily on TV -- and the wagering around them -- is legal in Arizona, even as prosecutors in some other st...", "title": "Bill to exclude fantasy sports from gambling law draws derision", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2016/02/18/bill-to-exclude-fantasy-sports-from-gambling-law-draws-derision/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2016/02/fantasy-sports-620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Bill to exclude fantasy sports from gambling law draws derisionArizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "fantasy sports, fantasy football, legal fantasy sports arizona, gambling, online gambling,fantasy football,gambling,legal fantasy sports arizona,online gambling", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Current Arizona law makes it to illegal to spend money to participate in any game or contest of chance of skill.\n\u201cParticipation in your games for monetary winnings violates Arizona law,\u201d he wrote to Robins.\nFantasy sports is a kind of online game where players choose \u201cvirtual teams\u201d of real players in a professional sport.\n\u201cBut the law is silent on fantasy sports in Arizona which has created this legal gray zone that my client would like to clarify,\u201d Lundy said.\nInstead, she told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday this simply seeks to clarify the law."}
