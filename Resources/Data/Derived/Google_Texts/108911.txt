Vice-President Joe Biden, besides being the coolest white guy since LCD Soundsystem broke up, is legendary for saying corny, cheerful, slightly inappropriate things. Like the time he yelled “you did it! This is a big fuckin’ deal” in Barack Obama’s ear when Obamacare got passed, at the Presidential podium, in front of a room full of reporters. That kinda thing.

Now two heroes over at the Washington Post have come up with the Joe Biden Compliment Generator, a revolutionary new piece of Joe Biden tech that randomly assigns you a strange, well-intentioned but ultimately slightly unsettling compliment as though you were meeting him for the first time and his mouth just did what it does best.
