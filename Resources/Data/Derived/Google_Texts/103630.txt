Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) said Monday he is "very disappointed" in Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel over his handling of police-involved shootings and supported a bill allowing a recall of Chicago mayors.

Rauner said during a news conference unveiling a government consolidation plan that while Emanuel "inherited a mess," he has done little to change how Chicago operates, according to the Chicago Tribune

ADVERTISEMENT Rauner declined to discuss specifics of the Chicago Police Department, which is under federal investigation for its use of force, but dished up a criticism of Emanuel and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez.

"I am very disappointed in the mayor and the state's attorney of Cook County, very disappointed," Rauner said, according to the Tribune. "I am not going to say more than that right now."
