Sen. Ted Cruz stars in a new YouTube video that shows the presidential hopeful cooking bacon on the barrel of a rifle.

The Texas Republican is seen purchasing bacon, then wrapping it around the barrel of the weapon at Central Iowa Impact gun range in Boone.

Cruz fires off several rounds, pausing to notice bacon grease dripping from the barrel, before reloading. Cruz then tastes the crispy bacon, as does Matt Halsrun, with the gun range.

The video was posted to YouTube by IJR Review.
