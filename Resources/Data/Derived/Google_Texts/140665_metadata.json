According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, a duck farm in Gochang, North Jeolla Province \u2014 about 186 miles from the capital, Seoul \u2014 may have been the origin of the H5N1 outbreak among poultry.\n\nTests are being carried through to identify whether the Gochang duck farm was indeed the source of the virus, and the results will be available in the next few days. The provincial government has also ordered a cull, or slaughter, of over 20,000 poultry at the contaminated farm, Reuters reports. Twenty-four more poultry farms in four different provinces will also be quarantined as preventative measures.\n\nIn the past decade, there have been four major outbreaks of bird flu in South Korea. In 2011, more than 3 million birds were slaughtered after the country experienced an outbreak.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), H5N1, also referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza A, is a strain of bird flu that is highly contagious, though it\u2019s not typically found in humans. It's also impossible to transmit the virus from human to human. Most H5N1 cases are reported after the victim has had contact with contaminated poultry. Up to 60 percent of those infected die from the illness. Nearly 600 cases of human infections, have been reported since 2003 \u2014 throughout 15 different countries.\n\nAbout 150 people throughout Asia have been infected by the newest strain of bird flu, H7N9, since it emerged in China last year. Forty-six people have died, and cases have been reported in China, including Hong Kong, as well as Taiwan. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 62 human cases of the virus in 2011, with 34 deaths that occurred in five countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, and Indonesia. These countries along with India and Vietnam currently have ongoing infections.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "h5n1 avian flu, bird flu, south korea duck farm", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A duck farm in South Korea has reportedly been infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus, and health officials are urging poultry farms to take precautions.", "title": "Bird Flu Outbreak In South Korea: 20,000 Ducks Slaughtered At Contaminated Farm", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bird-flu-outbreak-south-korea-20000-ducks-slaughtered-contaminated-farm-267384", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/17/poultry-farm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A duck farm in South Korea has reportedly been infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus, and health officials are urging poultry farms to take precautions.", "title": "Bird Flu Outbreak In South Korea: 20,000 Ducks Slaughtered At Contaminated Farm", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bird-flu-outbreak-south-korea-20000-ducks-slaughtered-contaminated-farm-267384", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/17/poultry-farm.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/17/poultry-farm.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-17T17:06:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-17T18:46:57-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A duck farm in South Korea has reportedly been infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus, and health officials are urging poultry farms to take precautions."}, "article_summary": "The provincial government has also ordered a cull, or slaughter, of over 20,000 poultry at the contaminated farm, Reuters reports.\nIn the past decade, there have been four major outbreaks of bird flu in South Korea.\nMost H5N1 cases are reported after the victim has had contact with contaminated poultry.\nThe H5N1 avian flu virus has now reportedly reached South Korea, though no cases of human infection have yet been confirmed.\nAbout 150 people throughout Asia have been infected by the newest strain of bird flu, H7N9, since it emerged in China last year."}
