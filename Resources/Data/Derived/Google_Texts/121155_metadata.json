I would have missed no shots. I would have made no turnovers. I would have went right instead of going left when I was supposed to, every game. I would have got on [I-76] at 4 o\u2019clock instead of getting on 76 at 5. I can\u2019t take it back. I can\u2019t take anything back. So I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d\n\nThe 38-year-old Iverson played large despite his 165-pound frame. He made 11 consecutive All-Star Games and took the Sixers to the 2001 NBA Finals, where they lost in five games to the Los Angeles Lakers. He was a seven time All-NBA selection, the 1997 Rookie of the Year, a three time steals leader, and a four time NBA scoring champion.\n\nIverson, who was drafted No. 1 overall in 1996 from Georgetown, said he was grateful for his change to play in the league.\n\n\u201cIt was a blessing for [God] to even get me here, get me to this point so I can retire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a blessing just to play one NBA basketball game\u2026. But I\u2019ve won scoring titles, MVPs, I\u2019ve done a lot in this league. Being 160 pounds soaking wet, coming from Newport News, Va. I mean, what more can you ask for? And my family is taken care of for the rest of their life. Regrets? I don\u2019t have none.\u201d\n\nThough he may have no regrets, Allen Iverson had a difficult transition out of the league. Despite earning $200 million during his 15-year NBA career and scoring $50 million in Reebok endorsements, he was broke when he retired.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Allen Iverson had an NBA filled with near-misses, controversies both on and off the court, and ended his playing days broke.
