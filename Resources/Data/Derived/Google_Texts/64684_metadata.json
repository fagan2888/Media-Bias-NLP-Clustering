Sherinian is one of the center\u2019s health-benefits advocates trained to help people enroll. \u201cI have absolutely no idea when this is going to work.\u201d\n\nSherinian has yet to enroll anyone in health insurance through the federal marketplace despite more than a month of trying.\n\nThe frustration that has characterized the first weeks of enrollment is more pronounced in and around Arizona\u2019s smaller towns and communities, like Ash Fork, Bullhead City or Flagstaff, where the need for coverage is acute.\n\nRural Americans are more likely to be uninsured and have higher rates of chronic disease, disability and mortality than people in urban areas. They have more difficulty finding health-care services, and they often travel much farther for specialty and emergency care.\n\nRural Arizonans are more likely to be self-employed or in low-wage or seasonal jobs that make it harder to take time off. Many travel 50 miles or more for appointments with health-insurance counselors, only to make another appointment because the website isn\u2019t working.\n\nHealth experts say, however, that people who may seem off the grid by city standards already are familiar with the Affordable Care Act, and most are eager to learn more.\n\nRural health officials, some aided by federal grants, are spreading the word through direct mail, door-to-door canvassing and health fairs, setting up tables at local hospitals and community events, visiting Head Start classrooms and enlisting libraries to help people without Internet access learn more about the health-care law.\n\nThey\u2019ve encountered pushback, but by and large, outreach and enrollment workers say, people in rural communities are excited about getting health insurance and regular access to health care.\n\nCounselors such as Sherinian have full appointment schedules from now until the end of the year in community health clinics around the state. Since enrollment began, North Country\u2019s 14 clinics, which cover northern Arizona from Bullhead City to Round Valley, have reached out to 8,000 patients by mail, enrolled nearly 100 people in the state\u2019s Medicaid program and set up 350 appointments. About 40 workers have been trained to help people navigate the online application process.\n\nThe law requires nearly every American to have health insurance next year or pay a penalty. The penalty in 2014 is the greater of $95 or 1 percent of income. By 2015, the fee increases to $695, or 2.5 percent of income.\n\nRural Arizonans are more likely to qualify for Medicaid under Arizona\u2019s expanded eligibility for the low-income health-insurance program, another provision of the Affordable Care Act. Thousands of people have enrolled in the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System in the past month, and the agency\u2019s new Health-e-Arizona Plus website has been operating almost glitch-free.\n\nKathy Trammel, who coordinates North County\u2019s health-benefits advocates, travels throughout northwestern Arizona trying to get more people insured. Like Sherinian, she has yet to complete a single healthcare.gov application, and she knows the needs are great.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here, to help our communities,\u201d Trammel said. \u201cAnd it is frustrating when we can\u2019t help them.\u201d\n\nMore barriers\n\nAlthough roughly three-fourths of the state\u2019s 1 million uninsured live in metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson, rural Arizona is proportionally poorer, older and sicker, experts say, with access to a fraction of the medical specialists and other health-care providers in urban areas.\n\nNational studies show that difficulty accessing health-care providers and facilities can lead to poorer health outcomes, increasing stress and reducing the likelihood that patients will keep follow-up appointments. Rural residents are less likely to be enrolled in Medicaid, even if they\u2019re eligible, or have employer-provided health coverage or prescription drug benefits.\n\nFormer state Sen. Amanda Aguirre has been working on Arizona rural and border health issues for decades. Aguirre, CEO of the San Luis Walk-in Clinic and president of Yuma\u2019s Regional Center for Border Health, began outreach over the summer to some of the state\u2019s most medically underserved areas in anticipation of Medicaid expansion, which takes effect Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot of chronic illnesses. They\u2019re more advanced because people have had minimal access to health care for quite some time,\u201d Aguirre said. \u201cThey come to us when they\u2019re really, really sick.\u201d\n\nPeople try home remedies, travel to Mexico to get cheaper prescription drugs and other treatments, or wait in the hope that their illness will resolve itself. When none of that works, Aguirre said, they come to the clinic.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have insurance. They don\u2019t have the money. They don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said.\n\nUnlike the marketplace enrollment, which ends March 31, Medicaid has rolling enrollment. That means anyone who is eligible, with individual income below about $15,000 and higher income levels for families, pregnant women and children, can enroll at any time.\n\nAguirre\u2019s staff has been signing up 40 to 50 people a week for Medicaid over the past month.\n\nFear of deportation also presents barriers to health care. In Yuma and elsewhere, parents who are undocumented \u2014 and who are ineligible for Medicaid coverage \u2014 may delay care for their U.S.-born children or not seek health insurance for them because the parents are afraid of being taken away from their families.\n\nFederal programs already provide health insurance to poor and low-income children. Among its many provisions, the Affordable Care Act expands eligibility for children ages 6 to 18, which is expected to add 29,000 kids to the state\u2019s rolls by 2015.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that children are completely immunized and they have access to good health care,\u201d Aguirre said.\n\nParents also can get treated through the clinic on a sliding-fee scale.\n\nClinic outreach\n\nCommunity health centers and clinics play a key role in getting people enrolled in Medicaid and trying to get them insurance through the marketplace.\n\nArizona health-care and non-profit groups have received $4.4 million for outreach, education and health-care \u201cnavigators,\u201d or guides, to help people enroll. The resources are being used roughly in proportion to the population, health officials say, with rural Arizona getting a fraction of the paid staff.\n\nAguirre and other rural health agencies use U.S. census data to target medically isolated and low-income areas. Trained workers and student interns, who are familiar with the area and some of the families, canvass neighborhoods and isolated housing settlements to educate people about health-care options and encourage them to visit the clinics.\n\nIn some tightly knit rural towns, health-care advocates enlist prominent community members to talk up the Affordable Care Act and the local health centers. But what works in one town doesn\u2019t always work in another. \u201cWe\u2019ve realized that we have to take it clinic by clinic,\u201d Sherinian said.\n\nHealth clinics are spread throughout Arizona, but transportation remains a challenge in rural areas, where there is no mass transit and weather and road conditions can make travel difficult.\n\nNorth Country has two clinics along Interstate 40 between Kingman and Flagstaff, but depending on where they live, people can still have a long trip to Ash Fork or Seligman. Outreach and enrollment workers, already frustrated by the website failures, have the added worry that some people may not be willing to make the trip again.\n\n\u201cThe more rural you are, the harder it is to get into town,\u201d Sherinian said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to help an impoverished community, (the website problems) are just creating more barriers. And that\u2019s what we don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nPeople also can be harder to find. Much of Arizona\u2019s wide-open spaces don\u2019t lend themselves to door-to-door canvassing. Public libraries will be key links, with computer access, workshops and counselors available to help.\n\nPushback on law\n\nSome of Arizona\u2019s smallest communities are among its most politically conservative. Outreach workers have faced pushback from residents angry about what they perceive as a government takeover of health care.\n\nThe workers say they avoid shouting matches and try to educate people about the law.\n\n\u201cEverybody that I\u2019ve talked to so far has heard about it,\u201d Trammel said. \u201cThey might not agree with it, but they\u2019ve heard of it.\n\n\u201cOne woman flat out told me they could arrest her, but she was not investing in Obamacare,\u201d Trammel said. \u201cBut overall, people want insurance. They want to see a provider.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance help\n\nWhile the marketplace website, healthcare.gov, is having problems, here are other ways to find help getting signed up for health insurance:\n\nGo to localhelp.healthcare.gov and enter your city or ZIP code to find local organizations with staff trained to help you compare options under the Affordable Care Act and enroll.\n\nTo apply for Medicaid, go to healthearizonaplus.gov or call 855-432-7587 during business hours.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not ready to apply, healthcare.gov has lots of FAQs and other information about plans available in your area. Or call 800-318-2596 to speak with someone 24/7.\n\nReach the reporter at maryk.reinhart@arizonarepublic.com.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Mary K.
