The question is whether the GOP presidential contenders are paying heed to the concerns of New Hampshire Republicans\u2014or pandering to their fears. It can be hard to tell the difference.\n\nThe topic of the most recent debate was national security, and with rare exceptions, the Republicans auditioning to be America\u2019s next commander-in-chief are a bellicose crew. \u201cAmerica is at war!\u201d warned Ted Cruz. \u201cIf I am elected president, we will hunt down and kill the terrorists. We will utterly destroy ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to get rid of all this PC stuff,\u201d added Ben Carson. \u201cPeople are worried \u2026 that I\u2019m Islamophobic or what have you. This is craziness because we are at war.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump went further, suggesting that the U.S. military kill family members of terrorists. Jeb Bush, to his credit, dismissed this gambit as unserious, while Rand Paul pointed out that it would violate the Geneva Conventions. But Bush and Carson, along with Carly Fiorina, called for the U.S. to arm the Kurds and were among the five candidates calling for a U.S.-imposed no-fly zone over Syria.\n\n\u201cWe must have a no-fly zone in Syria,\u201d said Fiorina, \u201cbecause Russia cannot tell the United States of America where and when to fly our planes.\u201d\n\nChris Christie was asked if a President Christie would order Russian fighter jets that encroached in the no-fly zone be shot down. \u201cYes,\u201d replied New Jersey\u2019s governor. \u201cWe would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless weakling.\u201d\n\nThis characterization caused heads to nod in unison on the Nevada stage\u2014and in Republican households in New Hampshire. On this subject, the fractious field of Republican presidential candidates has reached consensus: President Obama, they assert, is an ineffectual commander-in-chief whose faintheartedness is exemplified by his unwillingness to even accurately name the opponent.\n\n\u201cOur enemy is not \u2018violent extremism,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt is not some unnamed malevolent force. It is radical Islamic terrorists.\u201d\n\nPolling among Republican voters indicates that Cruz & Co. are on solid ground with the GOP base when they talk this way. A survey done in late October and early November by a reputable New England firm, MassINC Polling Group, found that 83 percent of New Hampshire Republicans say \u201cdefeating ISIS\u201d is a major national priority. This was the highest ranking of any issue surveyed, including stopping illegal immigration (72 percent), simplifying the tax code (67 percent), repealing Obamacare (62), and reducing federal regulations (61).\n\nIf anything, these numbers have become starker since then. Steve Koczela, president of MassINC, notes that this poll was done before the jihadist massacres in Paris and San Bernardino. \u201cNew Hampshire voters were already there in terms of ISIS,\u201d he told me.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently unreasonable about this, but there are pitfalls for Republicans. The most immediate is that their primary electorate is more hawkish than the independent voters likely to determine the outcome of the 2016 general election. Rand Paul spoke for many of them when he responded to Christie\u2019s blithe willingness to blow Russian pilots out of the sky by saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re in favor of World War III, you have your candidate.\u201d\n\nThe other issue for Republicans to contemplate is more subtle, but crucial. Yes, they\u2019re critical of a Democratic president\u2019s handling of international affairs. That\u2019s commonplace for the opposition political party, and it\u2019s not new.\n\nBut Republicans expecting this president, or any president, to \u201cwin\u201d the global fight against Islamic-inspired terrorism are misreading the nature of what the civilized world is up against. They are underestimating the task ahead. In other words they are doing exactly what they accuse Obama (and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders) of doing: minimizing the challenge.\n\nThis fight is the new Cold War. We don\u2019t have as catchy a name for it yet. Although both this president and his predecessor deemed it counterproductive to include the word \u201cIslam\u201d in the name of the conflict, \u201cGlobal War on Terror\u201d doesn\u2019t do it justice. Then again, \u201cCold War,\u201d a phrase coined by George Orwell and popularized by Walter Lippmann, wasn\u2019t terribly precise either. In many years, the Cold War was a hot war\u2014a shooting war.\n\nThe first casualty was John Morrison Birch, an American missionary to China who became an intelligence officer in the Second World War. He was shot for no reason by communist Chinese forces on August 25, 1945. The last was Arthur D. Nicholson, also a U.S. Army intelligence officer, shot in the back by a Soviet sentry in East Germany. In between were many others, and not only on our side. Some 37,000 Americans died in Korea. If one adds the total number of Korean deaths, north and south, including civilians, and the horrific losses suffered by Chinese troops, estimates range as high as 3 million. By some estimates, the total deaths in Vietnam were even higher, including 58,220 Americans.\n\nThe first president to fight the Cold War was Harry Truman; the last was George H.W. Bush. It\u2019s undeniable that some were more effective than others. To my thinking the most effective were Truman and Ronald Reagan. But none of the nine Americans who served in the Oval Office from 1945 to 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down, shirked their duty. Republicans who give credit to Reagan for \u201cwinning\u201d the Cold War are being fanciful.\n\nOn a recent trip to Iowa, Ted Cruz vowed to \u201ccarpet-bomb\u201d the Islamic State \u201cinto oblivion.\u201d He also ruminated about seeing \u201cif sand can glow in the dark.\u201d This kind of talk does not prepare Americans for the fight ahead, one that may last even longer than the Cold War. It\u2019s also not how Ronald Reagan spoke about the challenge.\n\nIn 1976, when he ran unsuccessfully for president\u2014and at a time policymakers considered the Cold War a more or less permanent feature of geopolitics\u2014Reagan shared his ideas with future White House national security adviser Richard Allen: \u201cMy theory about the Cold War is simple: We win, they lose.\u201d\n\nReagan helped effectuate that vision as president. The last American to die in the Cold War, Arthur \u201cNick\u201d Nicholson, was killed on his watch. But Reagan kept his rhetoric in check, so much so that when a reporter suggested that he had not expressed \u201coutrage\u201d at the killing, Reagan replied, \u201cA lack of outrage? You can\u2019t print what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\nSometimes that\u2019s what is needed in a statesman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2013 Although last week\u2019s hawkish Republican presidential debate was held in Las Vegas, the voters foremost in the candidates\u2019 minds reside here, in New Hampshire,...", "title": "Combating ISIS: Another Cold War | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/12/20/combating_isis_another_cold_war_129091.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/335924_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2013 Although last week\u2019s hawkish Republican presidential debate was held in Las Vegas, the voters foremost in the candidates\u2019 minds reside here, in New Hampshire,...", "title": "Combating ISIS: Another Cold War | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Combating ISIS: Another Cold War | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Election 2016,war on terror,ISIS,"}, "article_summary": "In many years, the Cold War was a hot war\u2014a shooting war.\nThe last American to die in the Cold War, Arthur \u201cNick\u201d Nicholson, was killed on his watch.\nThen again, \u201cCold War,\u201d a phrase coined by George Orwell and popularized by Walter Lippmann, wasn\u2019t terribly precise either.\nThe first president to fight the Cold War was Harry Truman; the last was George H.W.\nRepublicans who give credit to Reagan for \u201cwinning\u201d the Cold War are being fanciful."}
