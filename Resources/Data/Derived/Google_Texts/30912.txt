Salerno devotes much of the first half of his film to examining Salinger's Army service as a combatant and counterintelligence agent in World War II.

Within a nine-month period, Salinger participated in brutal battles on Normandy's Utah Beach on D-Day and in Germany's Hurtgen Forest, where U.S. troops suffered 33,000 casualties.

He was among the first U.S. soldiers to enter the liberated Nazi concentration camp Kaufering IV at the end of the war; he later told his daughter, Margaret, "You can never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely, no matter how long you live."

Hence, it comes as no surprise that in the summer of 1945, he suffered a breakdown and was hospitalized at Nuremberg. Yet we realize just how much Salinger's war experience and subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder factored into his writing and his very being when in one especially poignant scene in the film, Paul Fitzgerald, who served in Salinger's infantry unit, admits something he's never even told his own wife: For years after the war, he imagined bombs landing in his front yard, or even in his living room.

Surely Salinger's enduring postwar pain is what his readers — many felt the writer was speaking directly to them — tapped into. More than 60 million copies of The Catcher in the Rye have been sold to this day, and the novel's huge success drove Salinger further and further into hiding. Salerno shares the stories of obsessed fans that tracked him down at his remote hilltop home in New Hampshire.

"I'm a fiction writer, not a counselor," Salinger would tell them. While Salerno's inclusion of Hollywood stars, including Martin Sheen offering commentary on the man of letters, seems questionable, Philip Seymour Hoffman's explanation of how sudden fame can feel oppressive is enlightening.
