Patty Murray (D-Wash.), center, and other congressional Democrats speak Wednesday about new legislation to mandate contraceptive coverage by employers, after the Supreme Court ruled that private companies could seek exemptions. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nCongressional Democrats vowed Wednesday to bypass the Supreme Court decision in the Hobby Lobby case, unveiling new legislation that would require all employers to pay for contraception as part of the health-care mandates included in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe legislation comes a week after the high court ruled that many private companies \u2014 including plaintiff Hobby Lobby craft stores \u2014 were within their rights to seek an exemption from the contraception mandate if they could cite a religious objection to providing health plans that include some kinds of birth control.\n\nThat ruling outraged Democrats and women\u2019s groups, who vowed to pass legislation that would require all employers to cover contraception.\n\n\u201cWomen across the country are outraged, they are demanding a change,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). \u201cAnd today . . . we are here to be their voice.\u201d\n\nThe legislation, being introduced by Democrats in both the Senate and the House, would require all employers to abide by the contraception mandate included in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 even if they claim religious objections.\n\nFrom left, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) address reporters Wednesday in Washington. (Lauren Victoria Burke/AP)\n\nThe bill would override the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, forcing most employers to comply with federal health-care requirements despite their religious objections. It would, however, include an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for religious nonprofits.\n\nEfforts to craft the legislation were spearheaded by Murray and Sens. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), among others. In the House, the effort is being ed by Reps. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), and Louise M. Slaughter (D-NY).\n\n\u201cNinety-nine percent of women \u2014 our sisters, daughters, friends, colleagues and neighbors \u2014 will use some form of birth control in their lifetime, and strong majorities of Americans support the notion that women should be able to make their reproductive-care decisions without interference from their employer,\u201d said Sen. Tom Harkin (Iowa), the top Democrat on the Senate Health Committee and the author of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. \u201cThe Protect Women\u2019s Health from Corporate Interference Act reinstates the ACA\u2019s contraceptive coverage and protects the right of all Americans, men and women alike, to make decisions about their medical care in consultation with their doctor, not their boss.\u201d\n\nStill unclear is whether Democrats can muster the votes to turn this legislation into law.\n\nEven with a slight majority in the Senate, it is not a certainty that all of the Democratic senators \u2014 especially those facing tight reelection bids in conservative states \u2014 would be willing to vote in favor of it.\n\nOne encouraging sign for the bill\u2019s sponsors was that Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents, was openly supportive.\n\n\u201cThere are so many women in Alaska who will be affected,\u201d Begich said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s woken up the women of Alaska, what\u2019s happening here in D.C.\u201d\n\nBut even if Democrats can keep their caucus in line, they also must persuade at least five Republicans in the Senate to support the legislation. Democrats conceded Wednesday that they do not have any Republican co-sponsors for the bill in the Senate or the House and that no Republican lawmaker had publicly voiced support for the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe women of America . . . are saying it: It is not our boss\u2019s business, it is our business what kind of health care we need,\u201d DeGette said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we invite our Republican colleagues to join us in this effort.\u201d\n\nLack of bipartisan support in the Senate has been the death knell for several other high-profile proposals this year, such as a minimum-wage increase and a paycheck-fairness bill.\n\nEven if the legislation is unsuccessful, political strategists on both sides of the aisle anticipate that the Democrats will attempt to use the issue to turn out voters during the midterms. Democrats are working to hold onto control of the Senate while not losing more ground in the House, where they are in the minority.\n\nBut Democrats who are working on the legislation insist that it is too soon to discuss the political implications, even as they say that it is an issue that will mobilize voters.\n\n\u201cRight now we have a decision that said to women in this country that your boss\u2019s religion is more important than yours,\u201d said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). \u201cMy view is that women are already mobilizing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Effort comes a week after Supreme Court rules private companies could seek exemptions from mandate", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wesley.lowery.9", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Effort comes a week after Supreme Court rules private companies could seek exemptions from mandate", "title": "Democrats introduce bill requiring employers to pay for contraception", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-introduce-bill-requiring-employers-to-pay-for-contraception/2014/07/09/a15d846a-07ac-11e4-bbf1-cc51275e7f8f_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/10/Web-Resampled/2014-07-09/451905454-4741-kafD--296x201@wp.com-politics.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WesleyLowery"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-introduce-bill-requiring-employers-to-pay-for-contraception/2014/07/09/a15d846a-07ac-11e4-bbf1-cc51275e7f8f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "contraception, Hobby Lobby, Supreme Court, Democrats, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wesley.lowery.9"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a15d846a-07ac-11e4-bbf1-cc51275e7f8f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "contraception, Hobby Lobby, Supreme Court, Democrats, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc654\"", "article_summary": "From left, Sen.
