She now receives $13.60 an hour, up from $10.50 a few years ago. \u201cI can pay my rent with one check. One check,\u201d she said.\n\nKnowing what a difference higher pay can make, Reece joined a movement that launched last week to raise wages and improve workplace protections for home health-care aides nationwide. Backed by the Service Employees International Union, the effort seeks to replicate the \u201cFight for 15,\u201d a push early this year to raise the income of fast-food workers through high-profile strikes.\n\nIt\u2019s part of actions aimed at putting the concerns of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing workforce \u2014 one that\u2019s 91 percent female, 56 percent non-white and highly dependent on public aid \u2014 on the political agenda. About 600,000 of the country\u2019s 2.1 million home health-care aides are members of the SEIU.\n\nBut it\u2019s a long way to $15 in most states, and that remains the rallying cry. Reece is being paid substantially more than the median wage for home health aides, which is $10.01. But she and others describe a wide range of problems in the field: Agencies don\u2019t always pay their employees promptly, they don\u2019t always keep wages on track with local laws, and local governments don\u2019t always enforce the laws.\n\nAccording to the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit consultancy affiliated with a worker-owned home-care co-op, 58 percent of home-care aides are either uninsured or are covered through the safety net.\n\nAnother obstacle in the Fight for 15 is dealing with the public sector. About three-quarters of home health aides are paid through Medicaid, which means that higher wages are a blow to public budgets, not shareholders.\n\nBy and large, states haven\u2019t been increasing budgets to keep pace. That has squeezed providers.\n\nAccording to Joanne Cunningham of the Home Care Association of New York State, which represents the private providers that employ health aides, agencies have been cutting other priorities such as training and administrative staff to comply.\n\n\u201cNo one, least of all the agencies, wants to pay their workers anything less than a living wage,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cThe issue is, the health-care system now is going through such change and challenge that home healthagency providers are feeling a lot of fiscal pressure, and they\u2019re having a very hard time coping with the wage mandate.\u201d\n\nLifting the elderly in and out of beds, keeping track of their medicine, doing their shopping and generally keeping them healthy is just as challenging as the factory jobs of days past, Reece said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be their mother that died, their son that died, their daughter that doesn\u2019t come around, their niece that doesn\u2019t come around. We\u2019re like their whole family. So why can\u2019t we get paid?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/hfaging04.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6f6\"", "article_summary": "About three-quarters of home health aides are paid through Medicaid, which means that higher wages are a blow to public budgets, not shareholders.\nAbout 600,000 of the country\u2019s 2.1 million home health-care aides are members of the SEIU.\nReece is being paid substantially more than the median wage for home health aides, which is $10.01.\nKnowing what a difference higher pay can make, Reece joined a movement that launched last week to raise wages and improve workplace protections for home health-care aides nationwide.\nAccording to Joanne Cunningham of the Home Care Association of New York State, which represents the private providers that employ health aides, agencies have been cutting other priorities such as training and administrative staff to comply."}
