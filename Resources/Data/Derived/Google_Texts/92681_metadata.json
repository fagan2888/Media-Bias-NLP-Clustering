The increase shrunk the conservative-liberal gap to a 14 percent difference, the smallest since the poll\u2019s inception in 1992.\n\nThe greatest gap was in 1996 with a 22 percent divide between conservatives and liberals.\n\nThe number of moderates was unchanged from last year\u2019s survey, falling slightly behind conservatives at 34 percent. Gallup notes this number has dropped from the 40 percent of moderates in 1992.\n\nIndependents hit a record high of 43 percent, contributing to the shrink in the number who identify as Democrat or Republican.\n\nDemocrats were hit the hardest by the increase in independents, falling from 36 percent to 30 percent. Republicans dropped by two points, down from 2008\u2019s 28 percent to 26 percent.\n\nIn the beginning of 2014, Democrats edged out Republicans by five points with 46 percent identifying as such versus the 41 percent identifying as Republican.\n\nBy the end of year this gap had flipped, likely in response to the Republican midterm election wave. Democrats trailed Republicans by one point from October through December.\n\nThe poll surveyed 16,479 adults through landline and cell phones from January to December 2014. It has a margin of error of plus-or-minus one percentage point.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives maintained their stronghold on America\u2019s political leanings this past year, outnumbering those who identify as liberals and moderates in 2014.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservatives maintained their stronghold on America\u2019s political leanings this past year, outnumbering those who identify as liberals and moderates in 2014.", "title": "How Many Americans Are Conservative, Liberal?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericasfive700458.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-09T16:42:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BVbaaI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Conservatives maintained their stronghold on America\u2019s political leanings this past year, outnumbering those who identify as liberals and moderates in 2014.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericasfive700458.jpg"}, "title": "How Many Americans Are Conservative, Liberal?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2015-01-09T13:23:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T16:42:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gallup Poll, political ideology, wave election, conservative, liberal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bb5\"", "article_summary": "It has a margin of error of plus-or-minus one percentage point.\nIndependents hit a record high of 43 percent, contributing to the shrink in the number who identify as Democrat or Republican.\nConservatives maintained their stronghold on America\u2019s political leanings this past year, outnumbering those who identify as liberals and moderates in 2014.\nThe number of moderates was unchanged from last year\u2019s survey, falling slightly behind conservatives at 34 percent.\nThe increase shrunk the conservative-liberal gap to a 14 percent difference, the smallest since the poll\u2019s inception in 1992."}
