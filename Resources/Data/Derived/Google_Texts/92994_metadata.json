However, less than one-fifth of people who experienced these early warning signs took the step of calling emergency medical services (EMS) afterwards. It\u2019s a step that might have greatly increased their chance of survival, since those who called 911 after were six times more likely to survive their SCA than those who hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWarning symptoms frequently occur before SCA, but most are ignored. Emergent medical care was associated with survival in patients with symptoms, so new approaches are needed for short-term prevention of SCA,\u201d wrote the authors.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 350,000 people are beset by SCA annually, with its more than 90 percent fatality rate making SCA the second leading cause of cardiovascular death in America.\n\nSince 2002, the Arrhythmia Research Laboratory at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles has kept extensive tabs on people who have suffered from SCA, defined as an\u201cunexpected loss of pulse due to a collapse of the heart's electrical system\u201d in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. They\u2019ve done so by obtaining the medical history and demographics of SCA patients as well as through interviews with survivors or those close to the patient, all in an effort to better understand the mysterious, often fatal, condition. This effort has uncreatively, if accurately, been called the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (SUDS).\n\nFor the latest study, the researchers initially looked at the records of 1099 people collected by Oregon SUDS (ages 35 to 65). In part because SCA so rarely leaves behind survivors, though, they only had enough detailed information on 839 patients. Of these, 430 (51 percent) experienced symptoms prior to their SCA, most often chest pains (199 patients) or trouble breathing (78 patients). Though the percentage of warning signs was similar among both genders, women were more likely to experience the latter while men more often reported the former. Regardless of whether they experienced warning symptoms or not, 23 percent had a history of diabetes, while 37 percent already had prior heart issues, most often coronary artery disease.\n\nMore crucially, though only 81 people called 911 upon experiencing their symptoms, this group had a 32 percent survival rate compared to 6 percent among non-callers. The former group was more likely to contain people who already had prior heart issues, indicating that their greater awareness of potential warning signs. Those who experienced symptoms earlier than others were also more likely to have them recur in the hours right before their SCA.\n\n\u201cOur findings emphasize the need to encourage efforts that target public awareness of SCA as a largely fatal event,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cIt is important to reinforce knowledge of prodromal (early) symptoms of SCA in the general public and in patients affected by heart disease and their family members.\u201d\n\nThese efforts may not only involve public education campaigns but the development of technologies that take advantage of smart phones to instantly locate emergency defibrillators, the researchers suggested as an example. As reported by Medical Daily this June, there are ongoing efforts to design apps that actively recruit bystanders to provide CPR to cardiac arrest victims, with some degree of success.\n\n\u201cFurther studies are needed to improve risk stratification among patients with symptoms as well as investigations of whether early intervention based on symptoms may improve outcomes or even prevent SCA,\u201d they concluded.\n\nSource: Marijon E, Uy-Evanado A, Dumas F, et al.
