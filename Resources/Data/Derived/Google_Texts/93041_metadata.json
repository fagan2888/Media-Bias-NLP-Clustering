The biggest loss was among primary care physicians and specialists.\n\nDr. Jesus Alvarez, a \"maternal fetal medicine specialist,\" left the island in April. He was one of just five MFM specialists on the island and is now working at Hackensack Medical Center in New Jersey.\n\n\"The reimbursement from Medicaid and Mi Salud is abysmal and the public hospitals don\u2019t have the infrastructure to deal with an influx of patients and regulations,\" Dr. Alvarez said. \"For the physicians to survive, they can see 20 patients in one day in the U.S., but in Puerto Rico they have to see 50.\"\n\nRicardo Rivera, Puerto Rico's point person in managing the island's Obamacare funding, denied that the objective is government-sponsored universal health care access.\n\n\"The end goal is to improve the economy,\" he told Fox News Latino. \"And as people find jobs they will move out of the \u2018Mi Salud\u2019 program and into private insurance plans.\"\n\nAnother major concern for doctors like Alvarez and Tirada is that the Puerto Rican government has hired a third party private insurance company, Triple S, to handle claims, billing, and the ins and outs of the government\u2019s public insurance program.\n\nTirada said putting Obamacare money in the hands of just one private insurance company is going to put profits ahead of patients and physicians.\n\n\"The more claims that get denied, the more money the government will save and the more money the private insurer will make,\" Alvarez said.\n\nBut Rivera, who holds the position of executive director of the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, said that he's just as concerned about smart expenditures as anyone else.\n\n\"I'm in line with the doctors,\u201d he said, adding that he currently has 16 auditing programs running through his office to make sure those under Medicaid and Mi Salud get quality services.\n\n\u201cI cannot just go on the word of a manage care organization, they have all the incentive in the world to lie to me,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, Puerto Rico has the funding to continue offering public health services, but with unemployment hovering around 15 percent and with 55 percent of the population out of the labor force, the question is how will the island sustain its health care system past 2019.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen but we\u2019re not alone,\" said Rivera. \"We have 50 other states asking the same questions.\"\n\nBottom line, he said, it's about striking a balance.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to approach how can we maximize all the resources around us and we need the private sector.\u201d\n\nBryan Llenas currently serves as a New York-based correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC) and a reporter for Fox News Latino (FNL).
