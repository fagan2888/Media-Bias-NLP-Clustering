The man had been drinking a lot of beer, he said.\n\nA toxicology test is pending, but the volume of alcohol inside the man\u2019s body indicates he was highly intoxicated, Fairman said.\n\nHoward was sitting in a camp chair next to his RV at about 2 a.m. when he apparently stumbled out of the chair, struck his head on the side of the vehicle and tumbled down an 8-foot embankment into the water, he said.\n\nDuring the fall, Howard\u2019s face was severely impacted and he was probably knocked unconscious, Fairman said. He landed prone in shallow water near the bank of the river.\n\nHoward\u2019s wife and family attempted to resuscitate him but were unable to do so, he said.\n\nLarimer County Sheriff\u2019s deputies were called at 2:15 a.m. about the accident, which happened near the 2400 block of River Rim Road.\n\nAlthough sheriff\u2019s deputies continue to investigate the circumstances of the man\u2019s death, authorities do not believe foul play was involved.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Federal Heights man dies after falling into Big Thompson River", "title": "Federal Heights man dies after falling into Big Thompson River", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/03/federal-heights-man-dies-after-falling-into-big-thompson-river/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-03T08:18:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T08:18:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He landed prone in shallow water near the bank of the river.\nAn intoxicated 55-year-old Federal Heights man died early Friday after he fell from his camp chair, smacked his head on his RV, tumbled down an embankment and landed face-down in the Big Thompson River.\nDavid Lee Howard drowned in a matter of minutes in shallow water, according to Greg Fairman, Larimer County deputy coroner and investigator.\nLarimer County Sheriff\u2019s deputies were called at 2:15 a.m. about the accident, which happened near the 2400 block of River Rim Road.\nAlthough sheriff\u2019s deputies continue to investigate the circumstances of the man\u2019s death, authorities do not believe foul play was involved."}
