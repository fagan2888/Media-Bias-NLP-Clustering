They\u2019re easy targets for complaints of rising premiums and high profits.\n\nBut in the case of Obamacare \u2014 in which Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas and other insurers have stepped up to the plate to help millions of Americans get affordable health care \u2014 it seems some have truly unfairly gotten the shaft.\n\nBlue Cross, the state\u2019s largest insurer, alone reported losing $400 million in the first year of the program because it paid out more in claims than it got in premiums. And now it\u2019s getting shortchanged by the feds more than $250 million in risk-related payments.\n\nAnd last month, UnitedHealth \u2014 the biggest insurer in the country \u2014 said it suffered hundreds of millions in losses on its plans.\n\nThat\u2019s just not right and doesn\u2019t make good business sense. If the trend continues, more insurers like UnitedHealth will threaten to pull out of the program or seriously restrict the types and numbers of plans they offer.\n\nAnd premiums are already going up.\n\nWhere will that leave the nearly 10 million Americans \u2014 1 million in Texas \u2014 who have gotten coverage through the program? Consider that this state has the highest rate of uninsured in the country.\n\nObamacare certainly has its detractors in some areas of Texas. This newspaper opposed it in 2010, not so much over the insurance mandate but because lawmakers weren\u2019t clear about how they intended to fund it.\n\nBut once the measure passed - just as other measures have when political roles were reversed - we\u2019ve urged lawmakers of both parties to recognize reality and figure out ways to make it work. The GOP\u2019s refrain to \u201crepeal or replace\u201d and the Democrats\u2019 contention that \u201cthe law is fine as is\u201d are simply not effective paths to finding solutions.\n\nBut how did we get here?\n\nFirst, Texans flocked to the program, with many needing more expensive organ transplants and knee replacements when pre-existing conditions were allowed.\n\nThen, as DMN business columnist Mitchell Schnurman correctly pointed out last week, after insurers answered the call to offer affordable coverage, \u201ca Republican Congress changed the rules and left insurers holding the bag.\u201d For example, GOP opponents opposed using federal funds for the risk payments that were supposed to cushion the hit for insurers.\n\nSchnurman reports that two-thirds of insurers in the program lost money. It doesn\u2019t take an economics whiz to figure out the companies won\u2019t continue to endure that.\n\nThe continued participation of private insurers is critical to making the system work. The health care of thousands of Texans is on the line.\n\nBetraying the very companies that tried to do the right thing isn\u2019t the answer. At some point, Uncle Sam has to make good on its promise to help. It\u2019s past time for our leaders to recognize that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The health care of thousands of Texans depends on Uncle Sam playing fair", "og": {"description": "The health care of thousands of Texans depends on Uncle Sam playing fair", "title": "Editorial: Congress unfairly deals insurers big losses", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20151224-editorial-congress-unfairly-deals-insurers-big-losses.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20151224-obamains.ece/BINARY/original/obamains", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-12-24T18:19:34Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-12-24T18:19:34Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Editorial: Congress unfairly deals insurers big losses\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20151224-editorial-congress-unfairly-deals-insurers-big-losses.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20151224-insurance1.ece/BINARY/original/insurance1\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2590541\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-24T18:19:34Z\", \"section\": \"Editorials\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20151224-insurance1.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/insurance1", "publishtime": "2015-12-24T18:19:34Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Where will that leave the nearly 10 million Americans \u2014 1 million in Texas \u2014 who have gotten coverage through the program?\nAnd last month, UnitedHealth \u2014 the biggest insurer in the country \u2014 said it suffered hundreds of millions in losses on its plans.\nIf the trend continues, more insurers like UnitedHealth will threaten to pull out of the program or seriously restrict the types and numbers of plans they offer.\nFirst, Texans flocked to the program, with many needing more expensive organ transplants and knee replacements when pre-existing conditions were allowed.\nSchnurman reports that two-thirds of insurers in the program lost money."}
