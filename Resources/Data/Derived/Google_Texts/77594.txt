Two Indiana girls who nearly lost their lives in a parasailing accident in Panama City Beach last summer graduated from high school on Friday.

Their accident in Panama City Beach was caught on tape as they slammed into a condominium wall and then crashed into a nearby parking lot.

This all happened after the parasail detached from the boat that was pulling them.

The accident left Sydney Good and Alexis Fairchild in critical condition.

But Friday they proved just how far they've come since the accident.

They were all smiles as they walked across the stage at Huntington North High School's graduation ceremony.
