Bob Goodlatte, Judiciary Committee chairman, who was speaking about criminal justice reform at an event hosted by The Atlantic.\n\nA push by Obama and both parties in Congress to reduce mandatory minimum prison sentences for low-level drug offenders is the centerpiece of the larger criminal justice reform effort.\n\nBut some influential Republicans believe that their colleagues won\u2019t agree to ease drug sentences unless it is included in a package that contains a provision dealing with the intent requirement, known as \u201cmens rea,\u201d the Latin phrase for \u201cguilty knowledge\u201d or \u201cguilty mind.\u201d\n\nThe catch: The White House is opposed to expanding a requirement to prove mens rea, arguing that it would make it harder to prosecute corporations that commit fraud, taint food, or pollute the environment, because these violators could allege they didn\u2019t intend to break the law.\n\nThe disagreement over mens rea could kill the entire effort, which is especially fragile because some have suggested that Congress and Obama have a short time frame to act on criminal justice reform as the rhetoric of the 2016 presidential campaign heats up.\n\nGoodlatte, R-Va., and other supporters of mens rea believe that the issue is a matter of fairness, and that it is too easy for people to unknowingly violate obscure federal laws.\n\n\u201cTo me, the core of criminal justice is the requirement that someone not go to prison if they don\u2019t have criminal intent,\u201d Goodlatte said. \u201cIt is happening today, and it should not happen, and it has to be part of the reforms we do.\u201d\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, with bipartisan support, has already approved a package of bills addressing the criminal justice system, including one reducing mandatory minimum prison sentences\u2014giving judges greater discretion in imposing punishment\u2014and another changing the criminal code to make more laws subject to proof of criminal intent.\n\n>>>House Judiciary Rolls Out Bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform Bill\n\nProsecutors already must prove that defendants intended to commit crimes such as murder, robbery, and assault.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has passed its own criminal justice reform legislation that does not add more mens rea requirements. The Senate\u2019s bill would reduce mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain nonviolent drug offenses and allow well-behaved inmates to earn time off their prison terms.\n\nIts package would also require the government to conduct a study demonstrating how often prosecutors obtained convictions for crimes without criminal intent provisions.\n\n>>>Senators Reach Long-Elusive Deal to Reduce \u2018Unjust\u2019 Prison Sentences\n\nThe full House and Senate have not yet taken up the reform bills, and the two chambers will have to eventually reconcile their differences for legislation to get to the White House.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has cited criminal justice reform as one of his main priorities this year, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been non-committal.\n\nIn a sign of the urgency to get something done on the issue soon, advocates from both sides are portraying optimism.\n\nIn December, Mark Holden of Koch Industries, one of the biggest criminal justice reform proponents on the conservative side, met with Obama\u2019s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett to smooth over disagreements.\n\nBrothers Charles and David Koch have been among the biggest supporters of the mens rea provision. Some critics have questioned their motives, alleging that the conservative billionaires want to prevent federal regulators from pursuing criminal complaints against the family\u2019s energy and industrial companies.\n\n>>>Congress Is Finally Considering Real Criminal Justice Reform\n\nHolden, in a recent interview with The Daily Signal, denied those allegations and said the Kochs could support a criminal justice reform deal that does not include a mens rea provision.\n\n\u201cWe think we need criminal intent standards,\u201d Holden said. \u201cNo one should lose life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness unless they intend to commit a crime. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s just, moral, or constitutional. All that being said, we have supported the Senate bill, and that does not deal with mens rea issues. Our position is if it\u2019s in there, great; if not, let\u2019s get something done.\u201d\n\nWhile Goodlatte said the House is discussing with the Senate and the White House ways to find common ground on the mens rea issue, the resistance to compromise is strong for some Republicans.\n\n\u201cMens rea is something that is non-negotiable for us,\u201d said Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador, R-Idaho, a conservative member of the Judiciary Committee, in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThe president wants to only do what he likes, and we are telling him there are concerns we also have, and one of those concerns is mens rea, and we have to make sure we do it.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte believes there is a way forward to send legislation the president will sign\u2014even as the mens rea issue threatens to tear the alliance apart\u2014but the chairman won\u2019t put a timeline on solving the dispute.\n\n\u201cNot only do I think it\u2019s overcomable, but I think it has to be overcome,\u201d Goodlatte said. \u201cWith things that are truly bipartisan, I don\u2019t think there is a time limit on that, but I do want to get it done as quickly as possible. It is absolutely critical all of the elements are included in this process, or the process will bog down and fail.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said Tuesday a criminal justice reform deal must include a provision related to \"mens rea\" for it to pass.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said Tuesday a criminal justice reform deal must include a provision related to \"mens rea\" for it to pass.", "title": "'Criminal Intent' Dispute Could Kill Criminal Justice Reform Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/GoodlatteMensRea.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-12T16:36:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1P8uE0e"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said Tuesday a criminal justice reform deal must include a provision related to \"mens rea\" for it to pass.", "title": "'Criminal Intent' Dispute Could Kill Criminal Justice Reform Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/GoodlatteMensRea.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2016-01-12T16:04:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T16:36:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "mens rea, The Atlantic, criminal justice reform, State of the Union, Koch Brothers, Judiciary Committee, Mark Holden, prison reform, mandatory minimum, Paul Ryan"}, "article_summary": "The Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, has passed its own criminal justice reform legislation that does not add more mens rea requirements.\n>>>Congress Is Finally Considering Real Criminal Justice ReformHolden, in a recent interview with The Daily Signal, denied those allegations and said the Kochs could support a criminal justice reform deal that does not include a mens rea provision.\n\u201cTo me, the core of criminal justice is the requirement that someone not go to prison if they don\u2019t have criminal intent,\u201d Goodlatte said.\n>>>House Judiciary Rolls Out Bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform BillProsecutors already must prove that defendants intended to commit crimes such as murder, robbery, and assault.\nIn December, Mark Holden of Koch Industries, one of the biggest criminal justice reform proponents on the conservative side, met with Obama\u2019s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett to smooth over disagreements."}
