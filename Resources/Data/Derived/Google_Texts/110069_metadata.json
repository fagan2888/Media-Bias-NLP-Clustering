Cook reportedly declined to provide specifics about the size of each class, but said \u201cwe are working on vetting additional cohorts beyond that.\u201d\n\nCongress approved $500 million for the effort last year on the premise that the Pentagon would have over 3,000 opposition fighters on the ground in Syria by the end of the calendar year.\n\nPresident Obama considers the program to be a key pillar of his strategy to degrade and defeat ISIS without committing U.S. ground forces to Iraq or Syria.\n\nRelated: Why Even Obama Doesn\u2019t Know If We\u2019re Winning the War Against ISIS\n\nIn July, the first group of graduates from the program entered Syria and were quickly attacked by an al Qaeda-affiliated group. Pentagon officials have admitted they have had trouble keeping track of the rebels since they crossed back into Turkey and aren\u2019t quite sure what they are up to right now.\n\nThe string of embarrassments has prompted the Pentagon to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the program, which is increasingly seen as a military and policy failure in Washington and among anti-ISIS ally nations.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when exactly the examination will wrap up or if the administration will chose to abandon the effort all together. For the time being, the effort will be held up by White House opponents as a prime example that the president has no real strategy for defeating ISIS.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Defense Department has finally provided a price tag for its deeply troubled program to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to battle the Islamic State.", "title": "$42 Million for 54 Recruits: U.S. Program to Train Syrian Rebels Is a Disaster", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/10/42-Million-54-Recruits-US-Program-Train-Syrian-Rebels-Dud", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09102015_Syrian_Rebel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/10/42-Million-54-Recruits-US-Program-Train-Syrian-Rebels-Dud", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09102015_Syrian_Rebel.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Defense Department has finally provided a price tag for its deeply troubled program to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to battle the Islamic State.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbf8\"", "article_summary": "The Defense Department has finally provided a price tag for its deeply troubled program to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to battle the Islamic State.\nThe amount spent on the program has no doubt increased, with a second and third class now in training.\nIt\u2019s unclear when exactly the examination will wrap up or if the administration will chose to abandon the effort all together.\nPresident Obama considers the program to be a key pillar of his strategy to degrade and defeat ISIS without committing U.S. ground forces to Iraq or Syria.\nRelated: Why Even Obama Doesn\u2019t Know If We\u2019re Winning the War Against ISISIn July, the first group of graduates from the program entered Syria and were quickly attacked by an al Qaeda-affiliated group."}
