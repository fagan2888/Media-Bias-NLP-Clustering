Connecticut lawmakers held a hearing on Monday to learn more about the state's protocols for handling any future Ebola cases.

The legislature's Public Health Committee met to get information from the Department Public Health, the Connecticut Hospital Association, and others about policies currently in place to deal with any suspected cases.

Nine people have been quarantined in Connecticut in the past two months for potential exposure to Ebola after returning from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, the committee learned.

State epidemiologist Dr. Matthew Carter said he is concerned that more people under quarantine for Ebola could become ill as the peak flu season approaches.

"As respiratory illnesses become more common," Carter said, "people get more fevers. We might well start see more travelers with illnesses. Having to sort out exactly whatâ€™s going on with those travelers will be a challenge."

Windham Representative Susan Johnson, the committee's co-chairman, said lawmakers want to determine whether there are any weaknesses in the current policies, and if they need to pass new legislation when the General Assembly convenes in January.

Governor Dannel Malloy signed an executive order in October giving the state's public health commissioner the ability to quarantine people who may have been exposed to or infected with the potentially deadly virus.
