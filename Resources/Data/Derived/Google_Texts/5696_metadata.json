Unemployment in the District stayed flat at 6.8 for the second straight month, its lowest point since 2008 and a full percentage point lower than it was a year ago.\n\nMaryland\u2019s jobless rate ticked down to 5.1 percent, down from 5.7 percent a year ago. Virginia\u2019s rate, one of the lowest of any state, dropped from 4.8 percent to 4.5 percent.\n\nThose percentages are a far cry from the years immediately after the recession, when jobless rates across the country climbed into double digits. But new jobs and falling unemployment doesn\u2019t necessarily mean growth in the local labor market is accelerating.\n\n\u201cAs baby boomers start to retire we\u2019ve seen the growth in the labor market decline,\u201d said Andy Bauer, a regional economist at the Richmond Fed.\n\nTo his point, the size of the civilian labor force dropped by almost 4,000 workers in Maryland since last year, and by a whopping 66,000 in Virginia over the same time period. The District\u2019s labor force edged up only slightly.\n\nStill, the types of jobs being added in the D.C. metropolitan area are making many analysts optimistic. The strongest sectors were education and health services, which added 24,300 jobs since this time last year, and professional and businesses services, which added 16,100 jobs in the same time period. Both sectors tend to be high-wage jobs with opportunities for advancement.\n\n\u201cHealth services is hitting it out of the park in terms of job growth,\u201d said Anirban Basu, chief executive of Sage Policy Group, an economic consultancy in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cOne would think this is the result of the broadening utilization of health services by the newly-insured. This may by the effect of the Affordable Care Act, and it\u2019s really supporting job growth in the D.C. metro area.\u201d\n\nThs is the third jobs report in recent memory in which analysts have noted a surging market for jobs in healthcare. But the growth in professional services jobs, even as it came in second, raised even more eyebrows. This is the sector hit hard when the mandatory federal budget cuts took place a few years ago as part of the so-called sequestration process.\n\nAnecdotal information captured in August by the Richmond Fed found that demand for employees went up particularly in specialized occupations like information technology, accounting and financial services.\n\nMost of the region\u2019s new jobs in this area come directly or indirectly from government money. If Congress orchestrates another government shutdown, growth in that sector will almost certainly be affected.\n\n\u201cGovernment is still the region\u2019s biggest industry by far,\u201d Basu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit better-diversified than it was, but it\u2019s still very dependent on federal activities, and an October government shutdown would ripple throughout the economy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia leads region with lowest unemployment rate.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Virginia leads region with lowest unemployment rate.", "title": "The job market improves across the Washington area", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-business/wp/2015/09/18/the-job-market-improves-across-the-washington-area/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/wonkblog/Images/Economy-05670-053.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Post_AG"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-business/wp/2015/09/18/the-job-market-improves-across-the-washington-area/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiztopnews, unemployment, washington area, bizpage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbiztopnews, unemployment, washington area, bizpage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97f9\"", "article_summary": "But new jobs and falling unemployment doesn\u2019t necessarily mean growth in the local labor market is accelerating.\n\u201cAs baby boomers start to retire we\u2019ve seen the growth in the labor market decline,\u201d said Andy Bauer, a regional economist at the Richmond Fed.\n(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)The D.C. metropolitan area added about 64,200 jobs in the one-year period ending in August, according to new seasonally adjusted government data.\nBut the growth in professional services jobs, even as it came in second, raised even more eyebrows.\nStill, the types of jobs being added in the D.C. metropolitan area are making many analysts optimistic."}
