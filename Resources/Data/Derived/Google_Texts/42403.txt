Sioux Falls, SD

South Dakota Senator John Thune says he's open to lifting some of the restrictions on Cuba if the Caribbean country is open to making political reforms.

Thune spoke about President Obama's proposal to normalize relations with the country in front of the Downtown Rotary Club in Sioux Falls Monday.

"It's had some beneficial effects for the economy here in South Dakota particularly with regard to agriculture," Thune said as he addressed his 2001 vote approving some limited agricultural trade with Cuba.

Thune sees the benefits for South Dakota farmers and ranchers in lifting the embargo with the country.

"Soybean production here in South Dakota could meet a lot of needs they have in Cuba for that product and that commodity, so there's upside potential and I think we have to recognize that," Thune said.

Before Thune would support anything, he says, he would like to see the communist country make political reform and take other progressive steps such as opening up Internet access.

"There are some things in this that could be beneficial for South Dakota but overall lifting the embargo I think there are conditions that have to be met before I could support that. There's so much more that regime needs to do to prove to the rest of the world that they really are serious about modernizing and reforming," Thune said.

But if those conditions aren't met Thune thinks the president is going to have a tough time convincing Congress to lift the embargo.

"I think Congress is ready to work with the president if the president can demonstrate, particularly with regard to Cuba, that he can get a decent deal negotiated," Thune said.

President Obama can take actions on his own, like setting up an embassy in Cuba, but to lift the full embargo he will need support from the Republican-controlled Congress.
