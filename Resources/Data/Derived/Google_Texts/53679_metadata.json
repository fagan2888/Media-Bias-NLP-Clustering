Just last week, the EPA alleged there was deceitful software in half-a-million cars. Today, Volkswagen raised that number significantly and tried to restore customer trust.\n\nVolkswagen revealed that as many as 11 million diesel-powered cars worldwide could be affected by software that was designed to cheat on emissions tests. Most of those cars are thought to be in Europe, the automaker\u2019s primary market. The revelation caused Volkswagen stock to plummet for a second day. The company lost almost 19 percent of its stock value, or $17 billion, Monday. The price plunged another 20 percent during trading in Frankfurt today.\n\nThe CEO of Volkswagen America, Michael Horn, gave a frank apology last night at an event in Brooklyn.\n\nMICHAEL HORN, CEO, Volkswagen America: So, let\u2019s be clear about this. Our company was dishonest. We have totally screwed up.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: A year-long investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency uncovered the software. It switches on a car\u2019s emissions controls when a smog test is taking place. But the controls turn off again when the test is over, leaving cars emitting up to 40 times the legal pollution limits.\n\nThe software is installed in Volkswagen Jettas, Beetles, Golfs and Passats and Audi A3s sold in the U.S. since 2008. The Justice Department has reportedly opened a criminal investigation of the automaker. Investigations are also being launched in France, Germany and South Korea.\n\nFor more, we turn to John Stoll. He is Detroit bureau and global automotive editor for The Wall Street Journal. He has been following developments in this story closely.\n\nJohn Stoll, welcome.\n\nYou have been covering this story closely. And you have covered other auto industry problems. Where does this one rank?\n\nJOHN STOLL, The Wall Street Journal: It\u2019s up there.\n\nI mean, this is one, because of the volume of vehicles we\u2019re talking about and the sort of transatlantic implications \u2014 11 million is not a small number when you talk about the U.S. car park. About 85 million vehicles are sold a year. So, yes, that\u2019s spread over several years of production, but that\u2019s a large sum of cars. And Volkswagen right now is the biggest automaker in the world, as of the first half of 2015, huge aspiration, and obviously, in Germany, they\u2019re a big employer.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Explain exactly what Volkswagen did to these cars to make them game this emissions test.\n\nJOHN STOLL: Right.\n\nFrom what we understand \u2014 and a lot of this was explained in the story that you had \u2014 is the software is known as sort of a masking device. It works when the compliance testing is undergone, when that\u2019s ongoing. The emissions information says what the test needs it to say, so that it passes regulatory tests.\n\nAnd then in real-world condition, it emits far more of the harmful emissions such as NOx into the air than is legally allowed. And so it\u2019s pretty sophisticated software that can detect when it\u2019s being tested. And, you know, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be forensics of who exactly designed the software and authorized it and whether or not this is more widespread.\n\nBut, at the moment, the EPA has been pretty explicit on how this thing works.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you raise the question. This was something that was deliberately done by someone. I mean, who had to know? How high up the company is it thought that this went?\n\nJOHN STOLL: You know, I have talked to a lot of people about that. It\u2019s hard to believe that \u2014 well, I would say that in order to pull this off, the circle could be relatively tight.\n\nYou know, the pressure is high when it comes to meeting engineering standards. Diesel is a very important part of Volkswagen\u2019s play, not only in Europe, but in the United States. And they needed to get these cars back on the market about six or seven years ago in order to keep its momentum going.\n\nIn order to meet that objective, one could imagine that the circle would remain pretty tight and need-to-know basis. I have talked with executives who were at the company at the time who have since left, said they knew nothing about this and would imagine that this originated in Germany, but that\u2019s speculation at this point.\n\nThe interesting thing \u2014 and this is probably the silver lining and the bright light at the end of the tunnel \u2014 is Volkswagen is committing to full transparency. And we learned last year in the GM ignition crisis what that really could mean, is a full, hundreds and hundreds pages of self-revelation, usually done by an outside law firm or investigator, that will probably answer more of these questions, who knew what when, who authorized it and why. But that could be several weeks, if not months in coming.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we\u2019re talking about potentially significant amount of damage to the environment. We said, what, 40 times the pollution level is what these cars were emitting.\n\nJOHN STOLL: As much as that. That\u2019s right.\n\nAnd this is a very harmful substance. And these are very harmful emissions. There\u2019s no doubt. And I think particularly the people who buy Volkswagen diesels \u2014 and this is generalizations \u2014 but they are not only looking for a fuel economy bump, they\u2019re not only looking for a way to save fuel consumption and money. They are buying into the promise that they are reducing emissions, that these are safer for the environment, that the promise of \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 \u201cclean diesel emissions\u201d is actually what they advertise it to be.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes this so egregious, at least on the surface. A lot of people are saying, hey, this ranks up there with some of the most egregious corporate scandals in recent history because of the length of time that the deception went on. And they went up very far in terms of regulators of saying they didn\u2019t know it was going on. They didn\u2019t know why there was a disparity between real-world emissions and testing.\n\nAnd then only about a month ago, within the last month, they have come clean on this issue.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: John Stoll, any evidence? What are people saying about whether this could have extended to other diesel manufacturers?\n\nJOHN STOLL: Thus far, we haven\u2019t heard from everyone in the diesel market. But thus far, a lot of automakers have come out and said they have done their forensics. They have asked the questions of the people internally, the engineers that they need to, and they\u2019re pretty confident that they are not employing the same software.\n\nI will give you a quick for instance. I called General Motors today. They have a lot of diesels on the market in Europe. And they wanted to popularize a smaller car diesel in the United States. They say they have already looked into this and they are 100 percent confident that what they have displayed to regulators is the truth is actually the truth.\n\nSo, I think we will see more of this roll on, but you better believe that there\u2019s a lot of automakers, regulators and outside researchers looking into that exact question. And I think this isn\u2019t the last of that story that we have heard, but maybe the worst case of it.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it sounds like there\u2019s certainly more to be reported on here.\n\nJohn Stoll with The Wall Street Journal, thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "German automaker Volkswagen has revealed that as many as 11 million of its diesel-powered cars worldwide could be affected by software designed to dupe emissions tests.
