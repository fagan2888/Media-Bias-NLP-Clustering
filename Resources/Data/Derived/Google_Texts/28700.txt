Free health exams available at Walgreens for Land of Lincoln enrollees

Starting Nov. 1, people who have health insurance plans from Land of Lincoln will be able to get free health risk assessments from clinics at Walgreens.

The Affordable Care Act already requires most health plans to cover a set of preventive services like shots and screening tests at no cost to you.

But a spokeswoman for Land of Lincoln said these exams would be more comprehensive than the law requires.

People who have insurance from Land of Lincoln, Illinois’ only non-profit co-op health insurance company, will be able to visit any Healthcare Clinic location at select Walgreens throughout Illinois to get a free screening that includes checks for high-risk indicators like cholesterol and blood sugar testing.

If the person does not have a primary care physician, Walgreens can connect them with an in-network Land of Lincoln Health physician by utilizing the carrier’s provider finder, Land of Lincoln said.

“In today’s health care environment, it’s more important than ever for health plans and payers to provide their members with the tools and resources to help lead healthy lives,” Dr. Alan E. London, Walgreens Vice President of Strategic Clinical Partnerships, said in a statement. “We’re proud to work with Land of Lincoln Health to provide risk assessments that are convenient for members. This also enables Healthcare Clinic providers to work collaboratively with an individual’s primary care physician to coordinate patient care, which is key to achieving better health outcomes.”
