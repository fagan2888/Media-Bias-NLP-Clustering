Treasury Secretary Lew Signature Too Goofy for the US Dollar

Many Americans are worried about how they are going to file their taxes this year given the new details that might arise because of Obamacare. The Treasury Department and Health and Human Services Department is releasing a website to take the guesswork out of Affordable healthcare Act questions while filing taxes, as reported by the Washington Times.

While Jack Lew said that, for most taxpayers, the new healthcare rules will make filing as easy as checking a box, there is no doubt that checking a box is easier for Lew than making his signature legible. One of President Obama’s considerations before appointing Secretary Lew was that his illegible signature would have to be printed on the currency.

This website is a service to ensure that taxpayers understand the details. As HHS Secretary, Sylvia Matthews Burwell said, “We will be providing tools so millions of taxpayers who qualify for an exemption receive one.” Although a lot of preparations have been made in putting together the website to clear up any questions, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew says difficulties should not arise, “For the vast majority of Americans, tax filing under the Affordable Care Act will be as simple as checking a box to show they had health coverage all year … a fraction of taxpayers will take different steps, like claiming an exemption of they could not afford insurance.”

Concerning Lew’s signature, President Obama said, “Jack assures me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our currency, should he be confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury.”
