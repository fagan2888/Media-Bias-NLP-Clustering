Along with Aurora Mental Health and the Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, RMYC is one of the organizations that operates the clinic funded through $450,000 in money from the federal Affordable Care Act. The clinic is open to APS students and their siblings from kindergarten to\n\n8th grade.\n\nThe clinic offers routine physicals, treatment of chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes, immunizations and other basic services, all of which have a strong link to students\u2019 academic lives.\n\n\u201cThese are going to be the kids that have a tougher time accessing health care and miss a lot more school,\u201d said Taylor, referring to the students at a Title 1 school such as Crawford, which enrolls a high number of kids from poor families who qualify for free or reduced lunch. \u201cThey may have poor academic performance because they don\u2019t know that they have untreated diabetes \u2026 The ultimate goal is to raise the equity in academics among all children, because one of the biggest barriers to kids being able to learn is health issues.\u201d\n\nThe new clinic at Crawford and a similar facility opening at Laredo Elementary School in June will further that goal with more space and a bigger range of services. At Crawford, a clinic in one of the school\u2019s old classrooms launched with a similar mission in 2008. But because of space and schedule limitations, the scope of that clinic was smaller. It couldn\u2019t stay open any later than the school, Taylor said, and dental and mental health services weren\u2019t always available on-site.\n\nBy contrast, the new modular clinic is a standalone facility that stays open when the school is closed. Aurora Mental Health officials are in the clinic three times a week, and Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado staff are on hand once a week to offer restorative\n\ndental care.\n\n\u201cNow we have a fully integrated model,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nRMYC also operates mobile clinics and offers adolescent services through independent, standalone facilities, but the model at Crawford serves a\n\nspecific need.\n\nCrawford Elementary has more than 600 students, and more than 90 percent of those children qualify for free or reduced lunch. The school enrolls a high number of foreign-speaking students, including refugees from across the globe. That\u2019s part of the reason why the need for a full-service, school-based clinic is so needed, Taylor said.\n\nSergio Ortega and Marlem Ortiz were taking advantage of the clinic\u2019s care last week. The couple were at the building with their 10-year-old daughter, Andrea Emily, and their 4-year-old son, Sergio Miguel. The family recently moved to Aurora from Thornton, and quickly discovered the value of the new community clinic.\n\n\u201cThis is closer to home,\u201d Sergio Ortega said through a translator as they waited for the results of Andrea Emily\u2019s checkup. \u201cWe feel familiar with the doctors and staff here.\u201d\n\nReach reporter Adam Goldstein at 720-449-9707 or agoldstein@aurorasentinel.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Aurora Sentinel", "description": "The clinic offers routine physicals, treatment of chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes, immunizations and other basic services, all of which have a strong link to students\u2019 academic lives", "title": "Making the rounds: School clinic connecting needy students with needed health care - Aurora Sentinel", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/asuplads/AS.School-Clinic.0052.031114.WEB_.jpg", "height": 667}, "url": "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/guide/making-rounds-school-clinic-connecting-needy-students-needed-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theaurorasentinel", "section": "Education", "published_time": "2014-03-14T07:26:45-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde48c\"", "article_summary": "Physician Assistant Kristen Maddoux checks Fletcher Primary School 4th grader Andrea Ortega-Otriz's heart beat March 11 at the new Kids Clinic building at Crawford Elementary School.\nAURORA | Education is at the heart of the new Kids Clinic building that opened at Crawford Elementary School in January.\nThe Kids Clinic fits the profile of a community, school-based clinic by offering once-a-week check-ups, dental services and immunizations provided by the clinic\u2019s two full-time employees from the Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado.\nThe staff at the 1,400-square-foot modular facility off Florence Street plays the traditional role of health care providers for K-8 students from the Aurora Public School district.\n(Marla R.
