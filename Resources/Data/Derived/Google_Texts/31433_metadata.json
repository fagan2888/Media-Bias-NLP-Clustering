But with crude sticking near six-year lows, the risk of political turmoil is starting to rise.\n\nThere are several countries in which the risks are the greatest \u2013 Algeria, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, and Venezuela \u2013 and RBC Capital Markets has labeled them the \u201cFragile Five.\u201d\n\nIraq, facing instability from the ongoing fight with ISIS, has seen its problems compounded by the fall in oil prices, causing its budget to shrink significantly. The government is moving to tap the bond markets for the first time in years, looking to issue $6 billion in new debt.\n\nRevenues have been bolstered somewhat by continued gains in production. Iraq\u2019s oil output hit a record high in July at 4.18 million barrels per day, up sharply from an average of 3.42 million barrels per day in the first quarter of this year. But with Brent crude now dropping well below $50 per barrel, Iraq\u2019s finances are worsening. According to Fitch Ratings, Iraq may post a fiscal deficit in excess of 10 percent this year, and all the savings accrued during the years of high oil prices have been depleted.\n\nRelated: 6 Reasons Gas Prices Could Fall Below $2 a Gallon\n\nOther political problems loom for Iraq. The central government and the semiautonomous region of Kurdistan have been unable to resolve a dispute over oil sales. With revenues running low for the central government, it has failed to transfer adequate funds to the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG). That led to the breakdown of a tenuous deal between the two sides that saw Kurdish oil sold under the purview of the Iraqi government. The KRG is selling oil on its own now in an effort to obtain much needed revenue in order to pay private oil companies operating in its territory.\n\nMeanwhile, in southern Iraq, which produces the bulk of the country\u2019s oil and has been far from the violence associated with ISIS, protests have threatened oil operations there. Protests at the West Qurna-2 oilfield operated by Russian firm Lukoil have raised concerns within both the company and the Iraqi central government about disruptions. The Prime Minister even traveled to the site to reassure Lukoil about the stability of its operations.\n\n\u201cRecent pressure from villagers and nearby residents making demands could force us to consider halting operations if they keep extorting us,\u201d a Lukoil official reportedly said. Disruptions don\u2019t appear to be imminent, but any cutback in production would be a huge blow to Baghdad and would plunge Iraq deeper into financial despair.\n\nLow oil prices could also push Venezuela into a deeper crisis. The cost of insuring Venezuelan government bonds has hit its highest level in 12 years, indicating the growing probability of default. Critical parliamentary elections loom in December, but the government has already cracked down on opposition candidates and will likely prevent a fair election from taking place, even while President Maduro\u2019s popularity sinks. The economy is already in crisis, but it is teetering on the brink of something more acute. Bloomberg\u2019s editors openly wonder whether Venezuela\u2019s neighbors are prepared for its collapse.\n\nRelated: If Oil Is at Record Lows, Why are Gas Prices Rising?\n\nFor Libya, already torn apart by civil war and the growing presence of ISIS militants, low oil prices are the last thing the country needs. ISIS violently crusheda civilian rebellion last week in the coastal city of Sirte, according to Al-Jazeera. Libya\u2019s internationally-recognized government has called upon Arab states for help in fighting ISIS, something that the Arab League has endorsed. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s oil sector \u2013 the backbone of the economy \u2013 is producing less than 400,000 barrels per day, well below the 1.6 million barrels per day Libya produced during the Gaddafi era. In other words, Libya is selling far less oil than it used to, and at prices far below what they were as recently as last year. Citing IMF data, Bloomberg says that oil is selling for almost $160 per barrel less than what Libya would need it to be for its budget to breakeven.\n\nSaudi Arabia does not belong in the same category of troubled countries, but it is also not immune to oil prices at multiyear lows, despite its vast reserves of foreign exchange. Saudi Arabia could run a fiscal deficit that is equivalent to about 20 percent of GDP. To finance public spending, Saudi Arabia has returned to the bond markets for the first time in eight years, issuing 15 billion riyals ($4 billion) in July, only to be followed up by an additional bond offering of 20 billion riyals ($5.33 billion) in August. The government plans on taking on more debt in the coming months as well.\n\nStill, Saudi Arabia has a market share strategy that it is pursuing, and there are no signs that it will reconsider. That could spell trouble for much more fragile oil-producing countries around the world.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\nA Key Tool For Energy Investors\n\nMore Rotten News For The Commodities Markets\n\nHow Much Pressure Will Iran Put On Oil Prices?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Persistently low oil prices have already inflicted economic pain on oil-producing coun", "title": "5 Countries Getting Crushed by Low Oil Prices", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/20/5-Countries-Getting-Crushed-Low-Oil-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/venezuela-pdvsa-opec_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/20/5-Countries-Getting-Crushed-Low-Oil-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/venezuela-pdvsa-opec_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Persistently low oil prices have already inflicted economic pain on oil-producing coun", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee28\"", "article_summary": "Persistently low oil prices have already inflicted economic pain on oil-producing countries.\nLow oil prices could also push Venezuela into a deeper crisis.\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.comRead more from OilPrice.com:A Key Tool For Energy InvestorsMore Rotten News For The Commodities MarketsHow Much Pressure Will Iran Put On Oil Prices?\nFor Libya, already torn apart by civil war and the growing presence of ISIS militants, low oil prices are the last thing the country needs.\nSaudi Arabia does not belong in the same category of troubled countries, but it is also not immune to oil prices at multiyear lows, despite its vast reserves of foreign exchange."}
