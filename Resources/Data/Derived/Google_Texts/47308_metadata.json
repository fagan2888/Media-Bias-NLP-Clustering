Apparently, though Trump says they were \u201cvery well received,\u201d they just weren\u2019t enough for the ultraconservatives he\u2019s trying to reassure.\n\nDonald Trump started his hunt for the perfect justice with an invitation to the Heritage Foundation in March. Give me a list, he said, and that\u2019s who I\u2019ll consider. Five of Trump\u2019s first 11 names are from the Heritage Foundation\u2019s list, which is made up ofmostly traditional conservative choices \u2014 meaning they hold radical views on abortion, corporate speech, environmental protections, and the place of religion in public life.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation itself, conveniently, publicly released that list of \u201chighly qualified, principled individuals\u201d that \u201cthe new president should consider\u201d just a week after Donald Trump asked them for it. Perhaps Trump will include the list\u2019s remaining judges left behind when he again breaks with precedent and preemptively releases possible names before being elected to anything.\n\nHe could include Brett Kavanaugh, a Bush-appointed justice serving alongside Merrick Garland on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Kavanaugh was recommended by the Heritage Foundation as a suitable replacement for Antonin Scalia, and he has a solid record of towing the Republican Party\u2019s line, even to the point of offering \u201cadvice to the Republicans who are challenging Obama,\u201d according to a 2012 piece in The New Yorker.\n\nHe was the sole justice in the three-justice circuit court to dissent from a ruling upholding the Affordable Care Act that year, saying that the lawsuit was premature. Instead, he wrote in his dissent, \u201cUnder the Constitution, the President may decline to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the President deems the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional.\u201d That president would presumably be a Republican.\n\nThere\u2019s also Paul Clement, the 43rd U.S. solicitor general, a Bush appointee, who is now in private practice. He also fought against the Affordable Care Act, arguing that the government forcing people to buy health insurance was just the start.\n\n\u201cHe has become, in the Obama age, a sort of anti\u2013solicitor general\u2014the go-to lawyer for some of the Republican Party\u2019s most significant, and polarizing, legal causes,\u201d said a New York Magazine profile in 2012. \u201cIn January, he argued before the Court, on behalf of Rick Perry, against a Texas congressional-redistricting plan that had been crafted by a federal-district court to protect minority voters. Next month, he\u2019ll defend Arizona\u2019s restrictive immigration law.\u201d\n\nClement also defended the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act on behalf of congressional Republicans and fought against the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to block South Carolina\u2019s voter ID laws.\n\nThe last remaining candidate on the Heritage Foundation\u2019s list of Supreme Court nominees was Utah Representative and Tea Party darling Mike Lee, now known for using a procedural hold to block a vote on federal assistance to Flint, Michigan in the aftermath of revelations that the city\u2019s water supply was tainted with lead, claiming that the city, neglected for years by the state government, did not need federal aid.\n\n\u201cThe people and policymakers of Michigan right now have all the government resources they need to fix the problem,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThe only thing Congress is contributing to the Flint recovery is political grandstanding.\u201d\n\nAccording to a govtrack.us ideology score, Lee is among one of the most conservative members of the Senate based on the bills he has sponsored, sitting to the right of all but three Republican senators. He was also the first senator to endorse Ted Cruz, the man so hated in Congress that John Boehner claimed he was \u201cLucifer in the flesh.\u201d\n\nAre there more conservatives out there Trump will look to add to his list? Probably. But given his promise to outsource the job of Supreme Court nominations to a right wing think tank, watching what the Heritage Foundation says is likely a good predictor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Apparently, though Trump says his first list was \"very well received,\" it just wasn't enough for the ultraconservatives he's trying to reassure.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The National Memo", "description": "Apparently, though Trump says his first list was \"very well received,\" it just wasn't enough for the ultraconservatives he's trying to reassure.", "title": "Here's Who Trump Could Add To His Ridiculous SCOTUS List", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.nationalmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportPoliticsNews/tagreuters.com2016binary_LYNXNPEC4H1KT-BASEIMAGE.jpg", "height": 586}, "updated_time": "2016-05-19T14:53:57-04:00", "url": "http://www.nationalmemo.com/heres-who-trump-could-add-to-his-ridiculous-scotus-list/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-19T14:46:57-04:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "d3b005556643b373e87ddd5d6617469e"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004458014669}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NationalMemo", "section": "Campaign 2016", "tag": "supreme court nominee", "published_time": "2016-05-19T14:46:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-19T14:53:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "brett kavanuagh, donald trump, heritage foundation, mike lee, paul clement, scotus, supreme court nominee, politics, news, democrats, republicans, elections, nation, presidential election"}, "article_summary": "After releasing a list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees Wednesday, Donald Trump said that he may add more names to his list.\nDonald Trump started his hunt for the perfect justice with an invitation to the Heritage Foundation in March.\nApparently, though Trump says they were \u201cvery well received,\u201d they just weren\u2019t enough for the ultraconservatives he\u2019s trying to reassure.\nThe Heritage Foundation itself, conveniently, publicly released that list of \u201chighly qualified, principled individuals\u201d that \u201cthe new president should consider\u201d just a week after Donald Trump asked them for it.\nBut given his promise to outsource the job of Supreme Court nominations to a right wing think tank, watching what the Heritage Foundation says is likely a good predictor."}
