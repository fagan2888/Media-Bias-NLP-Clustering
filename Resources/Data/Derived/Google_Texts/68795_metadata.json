The data came from a national survey of American adults.\n\nBecause dementia is not always listed on the death certificate, researchers used several factors to estimate a person\u2019s probability of having had dementia.\n\nRead More: How Far Are We From a Cure for Alzheimer\u2019s? \u00bb\n\nDementia Costs Growing with Aging Population\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common form of dementia.\n\nThis number is likely to continue increasing as the population of the United States ages. At the same time, Americans are having fewer children.\n\nTogether, this means that in the future more older adults will require long-term care with fewer family members to provide it.\n\n\u201cThe cost estimates of this paper are probably going to worsen because of the lower availability of informal care over time and an increasing number of people of advanced old age,\u201d said Michael D. Hurd, PhD, an economist and director of the RAND Center for the Study of Aging, in an interview with Healthline.\n\nHurd is the author of an earlier study in the New England Journal of Medicine that found that the total cost of dementia care in the United States in 2010 was between $157 billion and $215 billion.\n\nRead More: Woman Details Mother\u2019s Battle with Alzheimer\u2019s in New Book \u00bb\n\nDementia Care Costs Overburden Certain Groups\n\nWhile dementia affects all segments of the population, it can be more of a strain for people with fewer financial resources.\n\n\u201cThose families really carried a dramatic burden of cost when you looked at it alongside family wealth,\u201d said Kelley.\n\nIn the study, those most affected included African Americans and other racial minorities, unmarried or widowed women, and people with less than a high school education.\n\nMany times, families that can\u2019t afford a nursing home or in-home assistance end up caring for their ailing spouse or parent themselves.\n\nFamilies with financial resources have the option to pay or to provide the care themselves. Whereas those who may not have the financial resources don\u2019t have that option. Dr. Amy Kelley, Icahn School of Medicine\n\n\u201cFamilies with financial resources have the option to pay or to provide the care themselves,\u201d said Kelley. \u201cWhereas those who may not have the financial resources don\u2019t have that option and so are giving their own time to make up for that difference.\u201d\n\nProviding intensive round-the-clock care for a family member with dementia, though, may also mean making long-term sacrifices \u2014 such as not working, quitting school, or cutting back on childcare.\n\nThese decisions can have much wider effects on lower income families, especially their children.\n\n\u201cIt worries me that there may be implications for the families,\u201d said Kelley, \u201cin terms of impoverishment for the next generation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, more than 6 million older adults live in poverty. Many more may be just above the poverty line.\n\nRead More: Cancer Drug Offers Hope for Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s \u00bb\n\nLong-Term Care Insurance Needed\n\nOne reason that the total cost for dementia care is higher than for other chronic conditions is that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover many specialized services required by people with dementia.\n\n\u201cMedicare doesn\u2019t spend very much on dementia because Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for long-term stays in nursing homes,\u201d said Hurd, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t pay for long-term in-home care.\u201d\n\nOne way to prevent people from being overburdened by the costs of dementia is to handle it the way we do catastrophic events such as fire or earthquakes.\n\n\u201cThis is really an insurable situation, where a relatively few number of households have very large costs,\u201d said Hurd. \u201cJust as we insure against houses burning down\u2014it doesn\u2019t happen often, but when it happens your cost is high, so we have insurance against that.\u201d\n\nJust as we insure against houses burning down \u2014 it doesn\u2019t happen often, but when it happens your cost is high, so we have insurance against that. Michael D. Hurd, RAND Center for the Study of Aging\n\nOne challenge of this approach is to make the insurance affordable for people who are already strapped by the cost of dementia care.\n\nBut convincing people to buy long-term care insurance can be a challenge. The number of these types of policies sold has been dropping over the past decade.\n\nThis study, and others like it, may focus more attention on the problem, which can improve how the country cares for its aging population.\n\n\u201cThese are really difficult problems, but I think having some of the data at hand will help us to think through some of the best solutions,\u201d said Kelley, \u201cor avoid making mistakes with policies that have unintended consequences for families.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/end-of-life-care-for-dementia-more-expensive-than-cancer-and-heart-disease-102615", "news_keywords": "dementia, heart disease, cancer, dementia care, cost of care for dementia, cost of care for heart disease, cost of care for cancer, dementia care more expensive", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "A new study found that the cost of caring for a person with dementia is much higher than for a person suffering from heart disease or cancer.", "title": "End-of-Life Care for Dementia More Expensive Than Cancer and Heart Disease", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/end-of-life-care-for-dementia-more-expensive-than-cancer-and-heart-disease-102615", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/aging/102615_dementia_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/aging/102615_dementia_THUMB.jpg", "description": "A new study found that the cost of caring for a person with dementia is much higher than for a person suffering from heart disease or cancer.", "card": "summary", "title": "End-of-Life Care for Dementia More Expensive Than Cancer and Heart Disease"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-26", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new study found that the cost of caring for a person with dementia is much higher than for a person suffering from heart disease or cancer."}, "article_summary": "Late-stage dementia care costs far outstrip the expense associated with other chronic conditions that affect older adults, including heart disease and cancer, according to a new study.\nBut convincing people to buy long-term care insurance can be a challenge.\nTogether, this means that in the future more older adults will require long-term care with fewer family members to provide it.\nRead More: Cancer Drug Offers Hope for Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s \u00bbLong-Term Care Insurance NeededOne reason that the total cost for dementia care is higher than for other chronic conditions is that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover many specialized services required by people with dementia.\n\u00bbDementia Costs Growing with Aging PopulationMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common form of dementia."}
