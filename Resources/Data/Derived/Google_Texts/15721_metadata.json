You\u2019ll also get help applying for health insurance.\n\nAt least six states and counties from Maryland to Oregon\u2019s Multnomah are getting inmates coverage under Obamacare and its expansion of Medicaid, the federal and state health-care program for the poor. The fledgling movement would shift to the federal government some of the more than $6.5 billion in annual state costs for treating prisoners. Proponents say it also will make recidivism rarer, because inmates released with coverage are more likely to get treatment for mental illness, substance abuse and other conditions that can lead them to crime.\n\n\u201cWhen someone gets discharged from the jail and they don\u2019t have insurance and they don\u2019t have a plan, we can pretty much set our watch to when we\u2019re going see them again,\u201d said Ben Breit, a spokesman for the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThe still-small programs could reach a vast population: At the end of 2012, almost 7 million people in the U.S. were on parole, probation, in prison or locked up in jail, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. About 13 million people are booked into county jails each year, according to the Washington-based National Association of Counties.\n\nHealthier Felons\n\nObamacare replaced a hodgepodge of state requirements that typically excluded childless adults from Medicaid. The 2010 law opened it to anyone making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, about $16,000 for an individual. In the 25 states that expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act, eligibility extends to many of the people most apt to be in jail or prison, said Fred Osher, director of health services and systems policy for the New York-based Council of State Governments Justice Center.\n\nGovernments generally must provide prisoners health care. Medicaid can\u2019t be used, except when inmates are hospitalized off site 24 hours or longer. That lets a state or county pass on costs for such things as heart surgery or a stay in a psychiatric facility.\n\nMedicaid expansion also enables more prisoners to have coverage when they are released. States that don\u2019t expand it can help inmates get subsidized coverage in the insurance exchanges created under the law when they\u2019re released.\n\nCounties in about half the states are responsible for some level of indigent care at hospitals, so getting inmates enrolled can reduce costs, said Paul Beddoe, deputy legislative director for the National Association of Counties.\n\nExtra Sick\n\nCook County has been operating a pilot project to enroll prisoners in Medicaid since April under a federal waiver, while states including Connecticut, Illinois and Maryland and counties such as Multnomah, which includes Portland, have helped hundreds of prisoners apply for coverage under the Affordable Care Act since it took effect Jan. 1. California, Ohio, San Francisco and other jurisdictions are starting programs or considering them.\n\nAbout 90 percent of inmates are uninsured, and many have never had treatment for their illness, Osher said. They have disproportionate rates of communicable and chronic diseases and behavioral disorders, he said. About 488,000 people in U.S. prisons and jails suffer from a mental illness, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nGetting them covered is just one way that state and local governments are using the health-care overhaul to save money. With U.S. cities facing rising benefit expenses and billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities, municipalities including Detroit and Chicago are planning to move retirees off city rolls and into federal insurance exchanges.\n\nShackled States\n\nWhile analysts couldn\u2019t estimate what states and counties could save by getting inmates covered, state and local spending on corrections in 2011 was $73.2 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Prison health-care expenses in 44 states studied by the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts increased to $6.5 billion in 2008 from $4.3 billion in 2001, and grew 90 percent or more in 11 states, according to an October report.\n\n\u201cA lot of states will come to this, because state corrections budgets are huge and county jail budgets are huge,\u201d said Maureen McDonnell of Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities, a Chicago nonprofit that helped establish inmate enrollment programs in Illinois.\n\nContinuing Care\n\nThe Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, which plans to start enrolling inmates during the next two months, expects that it will save $18 million a year on hospitalization alone, said Stu Hudson, managing director of health care and fiscal operations.\n\nEx-prisoners who have insurance will be more likely to get treatment that would help them avoid committing crimes that got them locked up in the first place, Hudson said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re provided good continuum of care from incarceration through their release into the community and onward,\u201d Hudson said by phone.\n\nIllinois is seeking to get Medicaid coverage for prisoners who must be hospitalized for 24 hours or more, and for all when their release is imminent, said Tom Shaer, a spokesman for the Corrections Department. He said the state has enrolled about 125 parolees or inmates since Jan. 1.\n\nBook \u2019Em\n\nCook County, which includes Chicago and has the largest single-site jail complex in the U.S., has started about 13,000 insurance applications since April, said Marlena Jentz of the sheriff\u2019s public-policy office. More than 2,000 prisoners have obtained coverage after their release, she said.\n\nWhen people are booked into the jail, they get photographed and fingerprinted, turn over their personal property, go through a full-body scan and head to a classification area. There, they are assigned a cell, and a worker from Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities helps them complete an application for Medicaid.\n\nIn Multnomah County, the jail has completed Medicaid applications for about 800 inmates during the past three weeks using seven eligibility specialists, said Nancy Griffith, director of corrections health.\n\nThe county is targeting inmates who have the highest costs for treatment, including those with a mental illness or chronic conditions, as well as those with frequent arrests, Griffith said.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that this benefits the whole county,\u201d Griffith said in a telephone interview.\n\nUnintended Consequences\n\nFormer U.S. Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota who was on the Senate Finance Committee when the Affordable Care Act passed, said he doesn\u2019t recall discussions about the law\u2019s being used to cover inmates.\n\nConrad said that while he agrees that it\u2019s better to have as many people as possible insured -- including prisoners -- he\u2019s bothered by federal taxpayers picking up the tab for inmate hospital stays.\n\n\u201cIt starts to look a little like a scheme by the states and local jurisdictions to avoid responsibilities that are really theirs,\u201d Conrad said in a telephone interview.\n\nStill, it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d not to adopt the strategy, said San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi. He estimates it would save $2,500 a year per inmate and reduce repeat incarcerations about 20 percent.\n\n\u201cThis is the most unsympathetic population there is,\u201d Mirkarimi said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut the evidence and the jury is in: This is the way to enhance public safety and reduce recidivism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mark Niquette", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-06/jails-enroll-inmates-in-obamacare-to-pass-hospital-costs-to-u-s-", "title": "Jails Enroll Inmates in Obamacare to Pass Hospital Costs to U.S.", "description": "Being arrested in Chicago for, say, drug possession or assault gets you sent to the Cook County Jail to be fingerprinted, photographed and X-rayed.
