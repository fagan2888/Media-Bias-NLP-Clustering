No less a deep thinker than Hillary said \u201cThe challenge is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible.\u201d\n\nWho can doubt that the left has been spectacularly successful at this? To take only the last few years, compulsory state adoption of SSM, ObamaCare, and executive amnesty have accomplished what was routinely declared impossible within the lifetime of this website.\n\nMore insidiously, the very institutions of society have been co-opted to continually redefine the possible ever-leftward. The Fourth Estate, the universities (and education as a whole), the entertainment industry, charity, and organized religion all hew to the line that \u2014 whatever the problem is \u2014 more government is the answer. And now science as been dragooned to the statist cause: if there is no actual crisis, we\u2019ll invent one.\n\nPlaying by the rules \u2014 limiting oneself to the \u2018possible\u2019 \u2014 is to lose the game before it starts. So we see Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s breathtaking audacity in trimming a percent from the acceleration in the growth of the increase in the real size of government. It\u2019s scored by the CBO! Parts are bipartisan! To suggest anything different would be \u2026 impossible! Or on amnesty and illegal immigration, to suggest anything but surrender is to push against the limits of the possible.\n\nAnother way of acting would be to see where these limits come from and remove them. Journalism? A dying industry. Help it on its way, don\u2019t pander to it. And for goodness sake, don\u2019t let it define the terms of selecting candidates. Education? Doesn\u2019t work, can\u2019t work. Shut it down and let the market \u2014 that is to say, people \u2014 develop a thousand alternatives to the monolithic, government dominated, state-worshipping boondoggle it\u2019s become. Charity and organised religion? Cease all cooperation (co-option) with (by) government. No government grants to NGOs to spend on lobbying government. No government programs that involve churches just as long as they render all to Caesar. No government sponsorship of social justice talkingshops.\n\nRadical? Yes. Unrealistic? Not really. There was a reality where there was no self-important Fourth Estate, no giant education/statist complex, no government takeover of morality. Impossible? Certainly, if one is to play the game. I note that the other side doesn\u2019t. And they\u2019re winning.\n\nIf you think politics is the art of the possible, you aren\u2019t playing politics.
