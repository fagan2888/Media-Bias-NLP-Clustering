House Republicans announced today that they are going to use the fast track process of reconciliation to pass a bill that repeals parts of ObamaCare and defunds Planned Parenthood.

The Hill reported:

House lawmakers will include repealing parts of ObamaCare in the fast-track process known as reconciliation, in addition to defunding Planned Parenthood, according to two lawmakers.

….

President Obama would still be able to veto the repeal and the defunding measures, but they would at least get to his desk using this process, which would bypass a Senate Democratic filibuster because the process allows measures to advance with just 51 votes instead of the usual 60.

….

The reconciliation process coincides with a “clean” government funding bill that includes funding for Planned Parenthood and is expected to pass with the help of Democratic votes, given the opposition of some conservative Republicans.



This bill unlike the dozens of other pointless bills to repeal ObamaCare is going to pass, but it doesn’t matter. President Obama will veto the bill, and Congressional Democrats will vote to sustain his veto.

Republicans are using the reconciliation bill to appease conservatives who want the ACA repealed, and Planned Parenthood defunded. The fact that there is a companion clean government funding bill is the real prize.

The clean government funding bill will be signed by President Obama, so the result of the latest round of Republican drama will be that government stays open, ObamaCare is not repealed, and Planned Parenthood won’t be defunded.

The whole process is full of unnecessary drama and show votes. Even though John Boehner was the worst Speaker of the House in modern history, without him, the crazy on the Republican side of the aisle may be completely unleashed.
