CareSource, a downtown Dayton-based nonprofit health insurer, has added Indiana University Health to its network of providers for health plans sold in Indiana through the state’s health insurance marketplace, created by the Affordable Care Act.

Indiana, which signed more than 37,000 Ohioans to its CareSource Just4Me marketplace plans this year, is expanding its marketplace business into Indiana and Kentucky next year.

The addition of IU Health — the largest health system in the state with more than 100 locations — will give CareSource’s Indiana marketplace customers access to more than 3,700 physicians, offering a full range of specialty and primary care services for children and adults.

CareSource’s successful participation in Ohio’s marketplace — where its new CareSource Just4Me members account for nearly a quarter of Ohio’s total enrollment of more than 154,000 — prompted the company’s expansion into the border states, company officials said.

“We are excited about the opportunity to offer CareSource Just4Me members health care through Indiana University Health. At CareSource, we have a 25-year history of making a difference in the lives of our members and this health care agreement is an example of living our mission to improve the health and well-being of our membership,” said Steve Smitherman, Executive Director Indiana Market CareSource.
