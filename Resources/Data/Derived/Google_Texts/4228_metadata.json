That\u2019s a federal crime. You can\u2019t tamper with sensitive information as irresponsibly as Clinton has reportedly done during her tenure as Secretary of State. It also rehashes what many have said about the political power couple in the past; that it\u2019s all politics, they\u2019re secretive, and they pay by their own rules. Given how Clinton and her campaign have behaved regarding the allegations stemming from her private email system, all three are demonstrated with this avoidable public relations disaster. With these new developments, it\u2019s no surprise that Congress is investigating (via The Hill):\n\nA second congressional committee has launched an investigation into the security of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) sent letters this week to four companies that played roles in maintaining and protecting the server. \u201cUnderstanding these companies\u2019 roles in providing software and services to maintain former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server is critical to improving government cybersecurity standards,\u201d Smith said in a statement. The investigation will run alongside a similar inquiry led by Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). [\u2026] Smith sent letters on Thursday to Platte River, which housed Clinton\u2019s server after she left the Obama administration in 2013; SECNAP, a security firm that installed a threat monitoring device on Clinton\u2019s server; Fortinet, which provided encryption software for Clinton; and Datto, which backed up the server.\n\nAs Guy reported, the FBI has expanded their investigation into Mrs. Clinton's email activities as well. Sen. Johnson (R-WI) has previously written a letter to Datto, asking them to turn over those back up servers to the FBI last October; they complied.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Letters have been sent....05/27/2016 1:38:20AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Letters have been sent...", "title": "Another Day, Another Congressional Investigation Into Hillary's Email Fiasco", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/01/15/another-day-another-congressional-investigation-into-hillarys-email-fiasco-n2105490", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/14/866d1332-d147-4594-b2cd-f7d2525012bb.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Letters have been sent...", "title": "Another Day, Another Congressional Investigation Into Hillary's Email Fiasco", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/01/15/another-day-another-congressional-investigation-into-hillarys-email-fiasco-n2105490", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/14/866d1332-d147-4594-b2cd-f7d2525012bb.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Another Day, Another Congressional Investigation Into Hillary's Email Fiasco , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "As Guy reported, the FBI has expanded their investigation into Mrs. Clinton's email activities as well.\nThe Hillary email fiasco has had steroids injected into it, with the revelation that she ordered an aide to remove the classified markings on a sensitive document and send it\u2013unsecured\u2013to her.\nGiven how Clinton and her campaign have behaved regarding the allegations stemming from her private email system, all three are demonstrated with this avoidable public relations disaster.\nWith these new developments, it\u2019s no surprise that Congress is investigating (via The Hill):A second congressional committee has launched an investigation into the security of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server.\n\u201cUnderstanding these companies\u2019 roles in providing software and services to maintain former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server is critical to improving government cybersecurity standards,\u201d Smith said in a statement."}
