(AP) - Alex White Plume thought his decade-long wait to produce industrial hemp on a South Dakota Indian reservation was ending when the federal government softened its stance on marijuana enforcement and lawmakers expanded the development of hemp under certain circumstances.\n\nBut federal prosecutors in South Dakota refuse to lift an injunction against White Plume that prevents the enrolled member of the Oglala Sioux Nation from growing the crop.\n\n\u201cOne thing that really hurts my feelings is to get treated as minorities,\u201d White Plume told The Associated Press. \u201cWe have always been here. We have superior standing.\u201d\n\nHemp can be used to make clothing, lotion and many other products, but growing it has been illegal under federal law because it is a type of cannabis plant and looks like marijuana. Hemp, though, doesn\u2019t make people high.\n\nThe so-called \u201cCole memo\u201d issued by the Department of Justice in August 2013 essentially says the federal government is going to concentrate on pot cases involving drug cartels, sales to minors, the use of firearms, and areas where the drugs are being sent from states where marijuana is legal to states where it is not. A subsequent DOJ guidance memo in October 2014 expressly made the Cole memo\u2019s priorities applicable on Indian reservations.\n\nWhite Plume figured he had more momentum when the federal farm bill signed last year had a provision allowing hemp to be grown through state agriculture departments and college research stations, which is happening in several states.\n\nWhite Plume\u2019s attorney, former U.S. Attorney Timothy Purdon, wrote in April to Randolph Seiler, acting U.S. attorney in South Dakota, asking Seiler to reconsider the injunction. Seiler rejected the request.\n\nPurdon said he\u2019s disappointed with the DOJ\u2019s position and says he plans to take legal action against the government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the idea that they would prioritize and then spend resources dealing with an injunction that is a relic from another era of marijuana enforcement,\u201d said Purdon, an attorney for Minneapolis-based Robins Kaplan.\n\nSeiler declined to comment to the AP, but said in a letter to Purdon that White Plume does not meet the definition under the federal farm bill that would allow him to cultivate hemp. Purdon counters that the injunction does not allow White Plume to approach college or state researchers in the first place to talk about growing hemp.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this decision, they are treating this hemp farmer in Pine Ridge completely different than hemp farmers in Kentucky and Oregon,\u201d Purdon said.\n\nSeiler said another factor is that South Dakota law does not allow the production of hemp and there is not an exception in the farm bill where industrial hemp is authorized under tribal law and not state law. White Plume said that violates treaties dating back 160 years.\n\n\u201cThey should recognize our tribal sovereignty,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White Plume family, including Alex and his brother, Percy, planted hemp for three years from 2000 through 2002, but they never harvested a crop. Federal agents conducted raids and cut down the plants each year. The injunction was ordered in December 2004.\n\nJohn Yellow Bird Steele, president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, said in a letter to Seiler that lifting the injunction would be an important step in supporting economic development on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. He said the White Plumes and other tribal members could produce products such as soaps, oils, animal feed, ropes, fabrics, rugs, furniture covers, tablecloths, building materials, insulation and fuel.\n\n\u201cSeveral of these uses have been demonstrated by Alexander and Percy White Plume, who have built a nice home out of \u2018hemp-crete\u2019 made of imported hemp fiber that they obtained lawfully in order to prove their point,\u201d Yellow Bird Steele said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alex White Plume thought his decade-long wait to produce industrial hemp on a South Dakota Indian reservation was ending when the federal government softened its stance on marijuana enforcement and lawmakers expanded the development of hemp under certain circumstances.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Alex White Plume thought his decade-long wait to produce industrial hemp on a South Dakota Indian reservation was ending when the federal government softened its stance on marijuana enforcement and lawmakers expanded the development of hemp under certain circumstances.", "title": "Oglala tribal member says he should be allowed to grow hemp", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/13/oglala-tribal-member-says-he-should-be-allowed-to-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/12/6dda55a63fd2341a790f6a706700ca92.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/12/6dda55a63fd2341a790f6a706700ca92.jpg", "description": "Alex White Plume thought his decade-long wait to produce industrial hemp on a South Dakota Indian reservation was ending when the federal government softened its stance on marijuana enforcement and la", "card": "summary", "title": "Oglala tribal member says he should be allowed to grow hemp"}, "Author": "DAVE KOLPACK", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOne thing that really hurts my feelings is to get treated as minorities,\u201d White Plume told The Associated Press.\nBut federal prosecutors in South Dakota refuse to lift an injunction against White Plume that prevents the enrolled member of the Oglala Sioux Nation from growing the crop.\nThe White Plume family, including Alex and his brother, Percy, planted hemp for three years from 2000 through 2002, but they never harvested a crop.\nWhite Plume said that violates treaties dating back 160 years.\nPurdon counters that the injunction does not allow White Plume to approach college or state researchers in the first place to talk about growing hemp."}
