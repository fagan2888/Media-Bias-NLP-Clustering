Instead, it further reduces the quantity of available housing by diminishing the profit incentive to build more. Developers who know that the city won't allow them to increase rents as demand rises will be hesitant to build rental housing and more likely to build commercial buildings or single family homes that aren't subject to rent control \u2014 if they even build at all.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

The authors specify some policies that government could implement to encourage more housing \u2014 such as tax transfers to residents to encourage them to allow more building \u2014 and governments should try these rather than continuing the failed policies that have been in place for years.\n\nIn addition to the perverse economic incentives created by rent control, there is also a legal and moral issue. As New York University law professor Richard Epstein has repeatedly pointed out, rent control conflicts with the \"takings clause\" of the 5th Amendment. This clause guarantees that Americans receive just compensation if their property is taken by the government. Rent control is in effect a taking of property, even though the government never actually takes possession of the housing units subjected to it.\n\nTo see how this works, suppose you owned an apartment building in Seattle with five units that could each be rented for $1,000 per month. Now suppose that Seattle's city council implemented rent control \u2014 which it's pursuing \u2014 in order to provide more affordable housing, and under the new law you could charge only $800 per month. Your monthly revenue would decline from $5,000 per month to $4,000, which is the economic equivalent of Seattle simply taking possession of one of your units. In effect, rent control allows a government to take one of your apartments without compensation.\n\nUnfortunately, the courts have yet to officially recognize this obvious fact. In the court case of Guggenheim v. City of Goleta, which concerned rent control in a California trailer park, the court stated that municipalities cannot be forced by the courts to implement sound economic policies, even if economics 101 shows that the policy is equivalent to a taking. Thus the regulation of property without compensation remains permissible in the U.S. even if it has the same economic effect as an actual taking of property.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Ohio Obamacare co-op collapses Thirteen of 23 consumer-oriented-and-operated plans have closed because of financial difficulties.\n\nMany people are justifiably upset when a government abuses the power of eminent domain to seize a small business for private redevelopment, but they regrettably fail to see the economic similarity when a government imposes rent control on property owners. In both cases the economic livelihood of the property owner has been damaged, but in the rent control case the owner is also denied compensation. Rent control is not only a bad economic policy that doesn't achieve its goal of restraining housing prices. It is also an unjust policy that causes real economic harm to property owners.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials and activists in cities around the United States are lamenting the lack of affordable housing in their communities.
