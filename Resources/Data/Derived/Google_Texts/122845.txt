While major health insurance plans through an employer, affordable healthcare act, private health or Medicare may cover a good percentage of medical expenses incurred due to injury or illness, they do not cover everything. Typically, you will be responsible for deductibles and co-payments, which can add up quickly. And major medical does not cover unforeseen expenses, such as transportation for diagnostic tests and physician visits, lost income from time off work, or hiring of outside help for child care and household chores.

That’s where supplemental insurance can provide financial protection and peace of mind for you and your family. Just as its name implies, supplemental insurance supplements existing coverage and can be used to help pay for the extra expenses often associated with a serious illness or injury that requires a trip to the emergency room, hospitalization, surgery, ongoing treatment and aftercare.

Not sure if supplemental insurance is right for you? Consider the following five facts:

1. Fact: According to the National Safety Council, nearly four out of 10 people are treated in hospital ERs annually, and unintentional injury is the number one cause of death for people one to 39 years old.

A supplemental accident insurance policy can be structured to provide coverage in the event of injuries incurred at home, work or play ‒ even when driving a car, truck, motorcycle or bicycle.
