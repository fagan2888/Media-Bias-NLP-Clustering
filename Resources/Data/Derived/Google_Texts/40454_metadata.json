Physicians also emphasized ACA\u2019s negative effects, such as lower reimbursement to physicians and hospitals and mounting patient debt caused by high-deductible plans.\n\nThe majority of physicians surveyed urged Congress to overturn the ACA. Physicians recommended Congress amend the ACA, \u201ca disaster for medicine.\u201d\n\nAs one surveyed physician commented, \u201c[ACA] has flaws, and will need to survive the existing legal challenges, but we really need to get everyone involved to optimize the care/cost equation.\u201d\n\nOther physicians stated support for a modification of ACA, such as removing the tax penalty or EHR requirement.\n\nChris Franklin, Executive Vice President of LocumTenens.com, spoke this week with RevCycleIntelligence.com to provide clarity about the physician survey results\u2019 overall implications.\n\nFranklin says since ACA\u2019s implementation, physicians and doctors face more definitive financial challenges.\n\n\u201cIn our survey, physicians cited lower reimbursement for treating patients as a particular challenge,\u201d Franklin says. \u201cThey also mentioned that since many of the plans through the exchange were high-deductible plans, they were also seeing higher upfront patient collections and higher patient debt.\u201d\n\nLower reimbursements continues to affect physicians and hospitals. If rising debt influences physicians to adjust their patient payment policies, the physician/patient relationship will be impacted accordingly, says Franklin.\n\n\u201cSince so many practices and hospitals were already operating on razor-thin margins prior to the implementation of the ACA, ensuring that their operations are as efficient as possible will be very important going forward,\u201d Franklin explains. \u201cPhysicians will also need to follow how the reimbursement landscape is changing from that of a fee-for-service to outcome-based reimbursement.\u201d\n\nPhysicians are burdened with increasing challenges following ACA implementation.\n\n\u201cMany of the physicians in our survey, especially private practice owners, mentioned that hitting the Meaningful Use deadlines and milestones for EHR implementation had been particularly expensive, time-consuming and burdensome for them,\u201d says Franklin. \u201cMany also mentioned more regulation and \u2018red tape\u2019 from the government and insurers who manage the plans.\u201d\n\nLess time spent with patients means the focus of healthcare must accordingly adapt, Franklin maintains.\n\n\u201cOperating with more efficiency and using team-based medicine will be more important than ever, especially as value-based reimbursement becomes more common,\u201d Franklin states. \u201cIn addition to using electronic health records to improve efficiency, physicians should look into solutions such as telemedicine to expand the team approach to managing patients with chronic conditions, or using physician extenders such as nurse practitioners to help meet the patient volume demand.\u201d\n\nWhat may happen next regarding ACA overturn is essentially open-ended. \u201cIts future remains in the hands of elected officials and judges. The only thing we know now is that the ACA is the playbook we all have to use,\u201d Franklin adds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most physicians urge Congress to overturn Affordable Care Act legislation after experiencing lower reimbursement, reports a physician survey.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/affordable-care-act-means-lower-reimbursement-for-physicians", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/chris-franklin-2.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Affordable Care Act Means Lower Reimbursement for Physicians"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most physicians urge Congress to overturn Affordable Care Act legislation after experiencing lower reimbursement, reports a physician survey.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/chris-franklin-2.jpg"}, "title": "Affordable Care Act Means Lower Reimbursement for Physicians", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb041\"", "article_summary": "One year after The Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) implementation, most physicians urge Congress to overturn the legislation after experiencing lower reimbursement, as reported in a recent physician survey.\nPhysicians also emphasized ACA\u2019s negative effects, such as lower reimbursement to physicians and hospitals and mounting patient debt caused by high-deductible plans.\n\u201cIn our survey, physicians cited lower reimbursement for treating patients as a particular challenge,\u201d Franklin says.\nThe majority of physicians surveyed urged Congress to overturn the ACA.\nFranklin says since ACA\u2019s implementation, physicians and doctors face more definitive financial challenges."}
