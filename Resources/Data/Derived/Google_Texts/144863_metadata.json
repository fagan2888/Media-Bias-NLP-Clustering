Chris Christie. Johnson has supported Christie in the past, and the New Jersey governor has been seeking to gain traction among major GOP donors in the northeast.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Jets play their home games in Christie\u2019s home state of New Jersey, although Christie is an unapologetic Dallas Cowboys fan.\n\nThe hire comes at a critical fundraising juncture for Bush.\n\nThe former Florida governor spent about six months in a testing-the-waters phase where he was able to solicit unlimited contributions for his super-PAC, Right to Rise. The group is expected to report later this year that it raised somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million in the first half of the year.\n\nBut now as an official candidate, Bush is looking to raise the smaller-dollar donations his campaign will control directly.\n\nJohnson has a reputation as an aggressive fundraiser with close ties to Wall Street and should give the Bush campaign a boost in that capacity.\n\nHe raised tens of millions of dollars for Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential bid in 2008, and did so again for Mitt Romney in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Woody Johnson, a major GOP fundraiser, will act as the Bush campaign\u2019s national finance chairman.", "description": "Woody Johnson, a major GOP fundraiser, will act as the Bush campaign\u2019s national finance chairman.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Woody Johnson, a major GOP fundraiser, will act as the Bush campaign\u2019s national finance chairman.", "title": "Bush taps New York Jets owner as finance chairman", "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/246010-bush-taps-new-york-jets-owner-as-finance-chairman", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/johnsonwoody_021915getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-24T14:53:55-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-24T14:53-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/246010-bush-taps-new-york-jets-owner-as-finance-chairman", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-24T14:50-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Jeb Bush,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-24T14:50:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-24T14:53:55-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/246010-bush-taps-new-york-jets-owner-as-finance-chairman", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Woody Johnson, a major GOP fundraiser, will act as the Bush campaign\u2019s national finance chairman.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bush taps New York Jets owner as finance chairman"}, "dcterms.title": "Bush taps New York Jets owner as finance chairman"}, "article_summary": "The billionaire owner of the New York Jets will be the top fundraiser for Jeb Bush \u2019s presidential campaign.\nJohnson has a reputation as an aggressive fundraiser with close ties to Wall Street and should give the Bush campaign a boost in that capacity.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the news Wednesday.\nWoody Johnson, a major GOP fundraiser who has served in similar roles for past Republican nominees, will act as the Bush campaign\u2019s national finance chairman, the campaign confirmed Wednesday.\nJohnson\u2019s Jets play their home games in Christie\u2019s home state of New Jersey, although Christie is an unapologetic Dallas Cowboys fan."}
