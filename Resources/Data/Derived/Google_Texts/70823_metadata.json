The rest of the world is running away from this reality,\" he told a room full of Sarasota volunteers. \"We\u2019re the firemen going in.\"\n\nWhat distinguishes hospice volunteers from other adults who may read to schoolchildren or build houses for low-income people or serve as ushers at their church? Larson described the altruistic impulse as \"the pilot flame of caring burning in all of us.\"\n\nBut it takes something more -- a heightened sense of empathy -- to answer the demanding call of hospice work, which he defined as \"courageously assisting others to live with hope in a world in which loss is inescapable.\"\n\nTo prove his point, he asked the audience to rate themselves on three questions in an \"empathic capacity test,\" measuring how deeply they identify with fictional characters. With a possible point total ranging from zero to 15, Larson said, the national average is 7.6 for women and 7.2 for men. By a show of hands, a majority of the hospice volunteers had scores above 10, and there was even a 15 in the room.\n\n\"You\u2019re all way out there on this scale. What does this mean?\" Larson asked.\n\nEmpathy, he explained, can be a double-edged sword -- motivating people to act with compassion, but also causing them to take it personally when things go wrong. To manage these emotions properly, Larson said, it helps to constrain the altruistic impulse, and find a balance in the act of comforting families who are facing a death.\n\n\"If you go in thinking 'I\u2019ve got to be the savior,' you\u2019re going to end up in a lot of trouble,\" Larson warned the volunteers. \"You should not try to be the center of all this activity. You want to help them find the support they need in their natural support system. If you become the focus, it\u2019s a problem, because you can\u2019t be there that way.\"\n\nThe cost of failing to find this balance, he said, is burnout. To stay engaged but not overinvolved, he told the volunteers, they should keep the focus off themselves, and do more listening than talking.\n\n\"You\u2019ve got to find a way to reach into the pit and help them out, without falling into the pit,\" Larson said. \"People are self-healing; they really are. They can figure things out, but they need someone to sit with them. When they can come out of this experience, and they\u2019ve made some meaning out of this, that\u2019s where the growth comes.\"\n\nFollow Barbara Peters Smith on Twitter @BarbaraPSmith.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "What distinguishes hospice volunteers from other adults who may read to schoolchildren or build houses for low-income people or serve as ushers at their church?\nBy a show of hands, a majority of the hospice volunteers had scores above 10, and there was even a 15 in the room.\nPsychology professor Dale Larson had some unsettling news for the Tidewell Hospice volunteers who came to his recent appearances in Southwest Florida: \"You're not normal.\"\nThe rest of the world is running away from this reality,\" he told a room full of Sarasota volunteers.\nTo stay engaged but not overinvolved, he told the volunteers, they should keep the focus off themselves, and do more listening than talking."}
