The marketing efforts by these for-profit residential care centers are aimed at patients with eating disorders and the clinicians who treat them.  The rapid growth of the industry - there are more than 75 centers today, compared with 22 a decade ago, according to one count - has been propelled by the Affordable Care Act and other changes in health insurance laws that have increased coverage for mental disorders, as well as by investments from private equity firms.  \"Only 15 to 30 percent of people have access to specialized care for eating disorders, which means there are a lot of people out there who have zippo,\" said Doug Bunnell, the chief clinical officer for Monte Nido, a program that began in Malibu, Calif., and now operates centers in five states.  [...] the advertising and the profusion of centers, which typically cost $1,000 a day but can run much higher, is raising concerns among some eating disorder experts, who worry that some programs may be taking advantage of vulnerable patients and their families.  The quality and form of treatment varies widely across centers, which in some cases includes approaches - equine therapy, for example, or \"faith-based\" treatment - with little or no scientific evidence behind them.  Some programs have full-time psychiatrists and medical doctors on staff, but others lack the expertise to handle emergencies or treat patients with coexisting medical or psychiatric problems.  The perks offered to outside clinicians who might refer patients, the experts say, include free trips, restaurant meals, educational seminars and small gifts like pens and key chains dispensed at professional meetings.  In an article to be published Monday in the journal Psychiatric Services, Dr. Evelyn Attia, a professor of psychiatry and director of the eating disorders program at Columbia University Medical Center, and four colleagues called for more transparency about the financial relationships between residential centers and the professionals who send them patients, and urged clinicians to be mindful of efforts to influence their recommended treatment.

The illness has the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder, with patients dying from the medical complications of starvation or from suicide.  In the past, health insurance companies placed strict limits on coverage for eating disorders, treating them differently from other medical illnesses.  In 2012, a federal appeals court ruled that health plans must cover residential treatment for anorexia under California's parity law.  \"The number of covered lives is growing faster than the availability of services to treat them, creating compelling investment opportunities,\" the accounting and consulting firm BDO noted last year in an article on its website, referring to the effects of the legal changes.  With a need to fill more beds, marketers for some centers make cold calls to psychiatrists, psychotherapists, medical doctors and others who treat eating disorders, offering to inform them about a program's advantages and inviting them to visit.
