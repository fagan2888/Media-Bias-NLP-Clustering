More recently, The Washington Post reported that an agency of DHS had contracted with the Edelman public relations firm \u201cto refine their agency messaging\u201d with reporters.\n\nRelated: Obama Administration Spent Billions on Image Advertising\n\nNow we learn that the Environmental Protection Agency spent public funds as part of a \u201ccovert propaganda\u201d campaign to promote a controversial proposed Clean Water rule. According to a new ruling by the Government Accountability Office, EPA employees made wide use of social media to urge the public to get behind President Obama\u2019s new rule, which was designed to protect the nation\u2019s streams and surface waters.\n\nThe New York Times, which first reported on the controversy, said on Monday that the GAO\u2019s findings \u201cserved as a cautionary tale to federal agencies about the perils of getting to active in using social media to push a cause.\u201d But it also highlights an anything-goes attitude within the administration about using public funds to promote the interests and agenda of the president.\n\n\u201cGAO\u2019s finding confirms what I have long suspected, that EPA will go to extreme lengths and even violate the law to promote its activist environmental agenda,\u201d Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Jim Inhofe (R-OK), said in a statement Monday.\n\nRelated: The Next Debt Crisis Could Be Much Worse than in 2013, GAO Warns\n\nWhile there\u2019s nothing wrong with agencies tooting their own horns about services they provide and policy initiatives, it is against the law for them to engage in sub rosa lobbying, propaganda or grass-roots efforts to promote new policies without disclosing the source of the advertising and lobbying.\n\nAccording to GAO, EPA officials launched a sophisticated social media campaign on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Thunderclap to overcome opposition to its clean water rule. The EPA said the rule \u2013 now under legal challenge \u2013 would prevent the pollution of water sources. However, farmers, business groups and Republicans denounced it as another example of the president\u2019s executive overreach.\n\nThe EPA hasn\u2019t quantified the amount of public funding that was spent on employees developing the lobbying effort and posting messages on social media platforms \u2013 only that the agency had spent $64,610 on video and other graphic assistance in making the government\u2019s case. The GAO has requested that the EPA go back and calculate the total cost to the taxpayers of the illegal conduct.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration got its hand slapped last year with the revelation that gover", "title": "Agencies Spent $4.4 Billion on Self-Promotion, Violating Federal Rules", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/15/Agencies-Spent-44-Billion-Self-Promotion-Violating-Federal-Rules", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/EPA_Building.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/15/Agencies-Spent-44-Billion-Self-Promotion-Violating-Federal-Rules", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/EPA_Building.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Obama administration got its hand slapped last year with the revelation that gover", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Obama Administration Spent Billions on Image AdvertisingNow we learn that the Environmental Protection Agency spent public funds as part of a \u201ccovert propaganda\u201d campaign to promote a controversial proposed Clean Water rule.\nAccording to GAO, EPA officials launched a sophisticated social media campaign on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Thunderclap to overcome opposition to its clean water rule.\nThe Obama administration got its hand slapped last year with the revelation that government agencies had spent literally billions of dollars promoting themselves with the public and news media in contravention of federal rules against just such activities.\nThe GAO has requested that the EPA go back and calculate the total cost to the taxpayers of the illegal conduct.\nThe EPA said the rule \u2013 now under legal challenge \u2013 would prevent the pollution of water sources."}
