It therefore offers its readers a complete guide to fleeing President Trump\u2019s America.\n\nSo how does a Trump foe make the big move to more progressive pastures in 2016? And of all the Trump-free countries, which is best for a soon-to-be-expat?\n\nThe Daily News rates five top prospects for emigration, beginning with Singapore:\n\nAs a bonus, Singapore boasts the No. 1 most efficient health care system in the world, as rated by Bloomberg. The U.S. ranks at No. 44, and could dip even lower with Trump at the helm. The billionaire has long blasted Obamacare and scoffed at government-run health care \u2014 even though the system seems to be working out really well for Singapore.\n\nThat is, of course, the opposite of the truth, nothing unusual for the Daily News. Trump is an advocate of socialized medicine.\n\nBut here\u2019s the point: having recommended five countries to move to, the Daily News gets serious for a moment:\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t just pick up everything you own and move across the globe. You\u2019re going to need the right documents.\n\nWhat?! You do? To move to countries other than the U.S.?\n\nWork visas through a job are likely the most secure option but they\u2019re difficult to obtain. The long process starts with applying for a job in your wannabe home. In most countries, the employers must rule out locals who may be better-suited for the job before extending an offer to foreigners.\n\nReally? Gosh, maybe that\u2019s a policy we should consider!\n\nMost nations require a foreigner to work for several years before attempting to apply for permanent residency or citizenship. \u2026 If you want to go one step further and become a citizen of another nation, get ready for a long road. That requires a lengthy legal process that starts with a temporary visa that turns into permanent resident status.\n\nThe irony, evidently, is lost on the Daily News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "The New York Daily News is a viciously left-wing newspaper that carries a special grudge against Donald Trump.
