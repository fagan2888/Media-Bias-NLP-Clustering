The substation is located on Highway 903, north of Stokes.\n\nBut in order to operate a substation, the state requires at least 8 volunteers to staff it. To run their primary station, the state requires a minimum of 20 volunteers. Currently, Holliman says the department only has a total of 22 or 23 volunteers who do the required 36 hours of training per year (3 hours a month).\n\nIf Stokes VFD doesn't have 28 trained volunteers by the end of February 2016, Holliman says they will likely have to close the substation. In addition to that, he says anyone who lives outside of a 6 mile radius by road from the fire station, will no longer have the benefit of their insurance rating. Residents will be classified by their insurance as not having fire protection and could likely see an increase in rates.\n\nThe department has sent out letters to residents and put up notices at local businesses to prevent this from happening. They are also conducting fundraisers to help spread the word.\n\nHolliman says their doors are open to anyone, provided a background check, and that volunteers are needed in every service area. This includes mechanics, nurses, safety officers, and truck operators in addition to firemen.
