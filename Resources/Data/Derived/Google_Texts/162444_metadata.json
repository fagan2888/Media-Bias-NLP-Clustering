See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nTrump\u2019s comments capped a full day of defending his controversial statements on abortion, comments about rival Ted Cruz\u2019s wife and American\u2019s continued participation in NATO.\n\nTrump pointed to the deals to defend countries such as Japan, Germany, and South Korea as an example of how the U.S. is a \"policemen to the world.\"\n\n\"We defend all these countries, we're not properly reimbursed for the kind of money that we're spending,\" he said.\n\n\"We cannot spend billions and billions and billions of dollars on defending all of these countries,\" he added.\n\nIn recent days, the first-time candidate retweeted an unflattering picture of primary rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s wife and suggested NATO is obsolete and \u201csome form of punishment\u201d is needed for women who have abortions if the procedure were illegal.\n\n\u201cI could have done without the tweet,\u201d Trump said earlier in the day on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nTrump wouldn\u2019t agree that he made a mistake on the abortion question, but said, \u201cAs a hypothetical question, I would have rather answered it in a different manner.\u201d\n\nHe eventually issued two statements to clarify his comments.\n\nTrump held firm on his position that NATO has become obsolete.\n\nHe said the international peacekeeping force doesn\u2019t focus enough on stopping terrorism and that the United States pays too much for what it gets in return.\n\n\u201cIt's obsolete,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe're not getting the benefits that we should be getting for the money. We're carrying a lot of countries. \u2026 What I said was exactly right. \u2026 I think NATO has to be readjusted.\u201d\n\nTrump also stuck by his suggestion that it\u2019s perhaps time for the U.S. to stop paying most of the bill to defend Japan and South Korea against nuclear-armed North Korea, even if that means touching off a nuclear arms race in the Korean peninsula.\n\n\u201cYou have Pakistan and you have North Korea. And you have China. And you have Russia. And you have India. And you have the United States and many other countries have nukes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou already have a nuclear arms race.\u201d\n\nTrump has run his campaign since June in an unabashed style in which he has risen in the polls in part with unapologetic remarks about deporting roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States and a call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants.\n\nOn Sunday, the New York real estate magnate still expressed confidence about doing well in Wisconsin and winning the party nomination. He acknowledged, however, being a politician for just eight months and having a \u201clearning curve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Republicans",
