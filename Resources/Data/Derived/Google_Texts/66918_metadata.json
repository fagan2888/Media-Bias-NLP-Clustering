She died March 2, after overdosing on oxycodone following surgery performed in February.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s two U.S. senators have introduced a bill that would try to prevent the misunderstanding that led to a Charleston woman\u2019s overdose on opioid pain pills earlier this year.\n\n\u201cJessie\u2019s Law,\u201d named after Jessica Grubb, would require a hospital patient\u2019s history of opioid addiction to be prominently featured in his or her medical records, if the patient gives permission.\n\nGrubb died in March after she went to a hospital for a fairly routine surgery. She and her parents repeatedly told doctors that she was in recovery from heroin addiction and shouldn\u2019t be given opioids, except under the strictest supervision.\n\nBut her discharging doctor never got the message.\n\nHe prescribed Grubb 50 oxycodone pills. She filled the prescription at the hospital pharmacy, and she overdosed that night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just too great a temptation and it\u2019s just a thing that never, ever should have been put in front of her,\u201d her father, David Grubb, said at the time. \u201cShe went home with, in essence, a loaded gun.\u201d\n\nThe new legislation, spearheaded by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, would try to put an end to such miscommunication.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t believe that this could have happened, that common sense couldn\u2019t have prevailed,\u201d Manchin said in a conference call Wednesday. \u201cThe dispensing doctor, the doctor that discharged, he had no way of knowing because that information wasn\u2019t passed down.\u201d\n\nGrubb\u2019s story gained national attention after her father, a former West Virginia legislator, told President Barack Obama of her struggle with addiction at an event in Charleston last fall.\n\nAt the time, she was in her fourth stint of rehab.\n\nGrubb\u2019s story, by all accounts, had a profound impact on the president, and played a significant role in his administration\u2019s recent effort to devote more resources to the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cYour willingness to share your family\u2019s story left a powerful impression on me, and has helped accelerate efforts to deal with this national epidemic of addiction,\u201d Obama said in a handwritten note to David Grubb last month.\n\nThe new bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to come up with standards for how a patient\u2019s addiction history should be displayed on medical records.\n\nDavid Grubb said that, after Jessie\u2019s death, the family was told that her addiction history was in the records but that it was buried near the back and the discharging doctor never saw it.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t prominently displayed, the way an allergy would be, on the front page,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cIf he\u2019d known, he would not have prescribed oxycodone.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito is co-sponsoring the bill and noted addiction\u2019s effect on entire families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that person, it\u2019s not just that child; it\u2019s the whole family,\u201d she said. \u201cThis law will not just rely on a recovering addict to bring forth that information, but it does open the doors for parents and support groups to get that information onto a hospital record.\u201d\n\nManchin said he expects the bill to have overwhelming bipartisan support and hopes it will be passed by the end of the year.\n\nIt is the latest effort by West Virginia\u2019s congressional delegation to combat the opioid epidemic.\n\nRepublican Rep. Alex Mooney recently introduced a bill that aims to eliminate an incentive that might be causing doctors and hospitals to over-prescribe pain medication. The bill removes some mandatory questions from a survey that patients receive when they leave the hospital.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, in an effort to improve hospital performance and quality of care, used the survey answers, in part, to determine the level of Medicare and Medicaid payments that hospitals get.\n\nBecause three of the questions asked about pain management, they could place pressure on doctors and hospitals to prescribe pain medication, pleasing patients and improving survey results for the hospital.\n\nMooney\u2019s legislation, co-sponsored by Manchin, Capito and Reps. David McKinley and Evan Jenkins, both R-W.Va., simply removes those three questions from the survey.\n\nOn Wednesday, a House committee passed a Jenkins-sponsored bill that aims to improve access to care for babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome to drug-addicted mothers.\n\nThe bill would identify obstacles to care for such babies.\n\nAdditionally, the Obama administration has proposed more than $1 billion in new funding for drug treatment while, at the same time, taking steps to increase private-sector funding and to reduce over-prescription of opioids.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got many steps to go to fight this epidemic; it\u2019s a multi-faceted approach we have to take,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cHow do we put the genie back into its box?\u201d\n\nReach David Gutman at david.gutman@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-5119 or follow @davidlgutman on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "\u2018Jessie\u2019s Law,\u2019 named for local woman killed by opioids, introduced in Senate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160427/GZ01/160429575/AR/0/AR-160429575.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20160427/jessies-law-named-for-local-woman-killed-by-opioids-introduced-in-senate", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160427/GZ01/160429575/AR/0/AR-160429575.jpg"}, "title": "\u2018Jessie\u2019s Law,\u2019 named for local woman killed by opioids, introduced in Senate", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "\u2018Jessie\u2019s Law,\u2019 named for local woman killed by opioids, introduced in Senate"}, "article_summary": "\u201cJessie\u2019s Law,\u201d named after Jessica Grubb, would require a hospital patient\u2019s history of opioid addiction to be prominently featured in his or her medical records, if the patient gives permission.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just too great a temptation and it\u2019s just a thing that never, ever should have been put in front of her,\u201d her father, David Grubb, said at the time.\nWest Virginia\u2019s two U.S. senators have introduced a bill that would try to prevent the misunderstanding that led to a Charleston woman\u2019s overdose on opioid pain pills earlier this year.\nThe new bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to come up with standards for how a patient\u2019s addiction history should be displayed on medical records.\nCourtesy photo Jessica Grubb (right), seen with family members, battled heroin addiction for nearly seven years before attaining sobriety last August."}
