I doubt it. What wonderful opportunities it presents to wax indignant: Shrinking-violet rich kids in a lather about patriarchy; tenured professors scheming to drain the English language of its animal spirits. It\u2019s a never-ending saga of privilege run amok, which of course allows our op-ed moralists to completely overlook the real scandal on campus\u2014the corporatization of the university, a development that has plunged an entire generation into inescapable debt but that is somehow less visible to the columnist than the latest political-correctness fantasia.\n\nBut then comes a campus outrage so gloriously stupid, so fantastically self-negating, that the prof-bashers miss its true significance. Last week, The New York Times described a push at a handful of fancy colleges to require \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d on class syllabi, which would alert sensitive students to reading materials that might cause them psychic distress. Note that \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d have been actually applied at no college campus to any literary classic. The mere suggestion here and there is all that was needed to make this 100-proof pundit bait. One after another,the columnists piled on, mocking the hypersensitive and moaning about what kids these days have come to.\n\nHowever, when I read the Times story\u2014especially the part where trigger warnings are being proposed for any text that bears hints of something called \u201cclassism\u201d\u2014I felt strangely euphoric. I\u2019d finally discovered a PC campus trend I could get behind.\n\n\u201cWarning labels!\u201d I cried. \u201cClassism! Great leaping Christ, that\u2019s it!\u201d\n\nYes! Elite university students must be warned about \u201cclassism\u201d! Not on course syllabi or the cover of a book as though it\u2019s comsymp lit or something. No, they need to see it in big red letters inscribed on those elite universities themselves \u2014 stamped on every tuition bill and financial aid form and diploma they produce, spelled out in the quadrangle pavement, flashing from a neon sign above every dormitory so no one can miss it:\n\n\u201cWarning: This place exists to enforce class distinctions.\u201d\n\nPerhaps those universities exist to educate, too. Perhaps professors here and there still concern themselves with whether students understand epic poems and differential equations. But that stuff is incidental. The university\u2019s real purpose, as just about every modern college entrance guide will confirm, is to make graduates wealthy. Not too many employers really care what you studied there, or how well you did; they only care that you got in and that you got a diploma, our society\u2019s one-and-only ticket into the middle class. Graduate from college and you have a chance of joining life\u2019s officer corps. Quit after high school and it doesn\u2019t matter how well you know your Nietzsche; you will probably spend the rest of your days as a corporal.\n\nThis power over admission to the bourgeoisie is the reason why tuition goes up constantly even as the university successfully transforms professors into low-wage freelancers (the subject of last week\u2019s column)\u2014because what those professors teach doesn\u2019t matter. This is also why people who fake their college degrees often lead long and successful corporate lives without being detected\u2014because the stuff you actually learn to get a liberal arts degree isn\u2019t important in the corporate world. Only the diploma itself has real meaning in the marketplace, and only the marketplace has real meaning in America. This is a situation that clearly requires highly visible warnings, and lots of them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The trigger warning we need: \"Borrowing to attend an American college may be hazardous to your dreams\"", "author": "Thomas Frank", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The trigger warning we need: \"Borrowing to attend an American college may be hazardous to your dreams\"", "title": "The trigger warning we need: \u201cCollege is a scam meant to perpetuate the 1 percent\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/the_1_percents_college_scam/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/harvard_gate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The trigger warning we need: \"Borrowing to attend an American college may be hazardous to your dreams\"", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/harvard_gate.jpg", "title": "The trigger warning we need: \u201cCollege is a scam meant to perpetuate the 1 percent\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The trigger warning we need: \u201cCollege is a scam meant to perpetuate the 1 percent\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, classism, College, Harvard, Higher education, princeton mom, tal fortgang, trigger warnings", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd864e\"", "article_summary": "Note that \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d have been actually applied at no college campus to any literary classic.\nHowever, when I read the Times story\u2014especially the part where trigger warnings are being proposed for any text that bears hints of something called \u201cclassism\u201d\u2014I felt strangely euphoric.\nTopics: 1 percent, classism, College, Harvard, Higher education, princeton mom, tal fortgang, trigger warnings, News, Politics NewsIs there a greater gift to the hack editorialist than the American university and its taste for sensitivity and euphemism?\nOnly the diploma itself has real meaning in the marketplace, and only the marketplace has real meaning in America.\nElite university students must be warned about \u201cclassism\u201d!"}
