There are the people who simply recoil in horror that someone even more conservative than Cantor! could be heading to Washington, and there are the people who look at the libertarian and populist elements of Brat's message and see some conservatives taking a step in the right direction. Ralph Nader belongs to the second group:\n\n\n\n\n\nBrat supported \"the end of bulk phone and email data collection by the NSA\" and other government agencies on constitutional grounds.\n\n\n\nProfessor Brat attacked the Wall Street investment bankers who nearly \"broke the financial system,\" adding the applause line: \"these guys should have gone to jail. Instead of going to jail, where did they go? They went to Eric Cantor's Rolodex.\"...\n\n\n\nBrat is a mixed bag for progressives. But in that mix is a clear populist challenge by Main Street against Wall Street and by ordinary people against the corporate government with subsidies and bailouts that the Left calls corporate welfare and the Right calls crony capitalism. Therein lies the potential for a winning majority alliance between Left and Right as my new book, Unstoppable: The Emerging Left-Right Alliance to Dismantle the Corporate State, relates in realistic detail.\n\nRead the rest here.
