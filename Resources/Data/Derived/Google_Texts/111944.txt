Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday said Republican complaints about President Obama’s unpopular health-care law are not valid criticisms, but rather “jokes.”

In a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, the Nevada Democrat didn’t address any of the GOP’s specific complaints about the law. But he playfully suggested that Republicans, in order to save time, just “number their one through 50 criticisms of Obamacare” and yell out a number when they want to reference a specific complaint.

“We’ve heard things so many times, we would immediately laugh because basically they’re jokes,” Reid said.

He continued: “It’s too bad that the Republican leader and many of his colleagues want to keep fighting an old fight. Four years ago we passed the health reform bill, four years ago. The president signed it, the Supreme Court upheld it. It is the law of the land.”

Addressing the problems with the rocky roll out, Reid acknowledged: “Of course, we want to make it better, and certainly with what’s going on with the rollout of the web site, we need to do that. I wish our Republican colleagues would stop trying to scare people out of participating in this program.”

Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said from the floor on Thursday: “Let’s work together to undo the harm of Obamacare and start over with real, bipartisan, cost-saving reforms…reforms that will actually allow Americans to keep the health plans they like.”

The Kentuckian said: “It’s way past time for Democrats to end this blame game. Instead, they need to start acknowledging the consequences of their law, and actually do something about the mess they created.”
