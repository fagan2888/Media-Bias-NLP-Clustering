Will open enrollment this year change that?\n\nMore than a quarter of those who signed up for health insurance in the Lone Star State were in North Texas. And many North Texans got help signing up from \u201cnavigators\u201d who trained at the Community Council of Greater Dallas.\n\nThe KERA radio story.\n\nSo what's a navigator?\n\n\u201cNavigators are paid professional people who help people understand first what insurance is and then help them go into the online marketplace and enroll,\u201d says executive director Martha Blaine.\n\nThe Community Council of Greater Dallas hired 13 navigators last year. This year, it hired 15.\n\nMake An Appointment\n\nThe best way to get in contact with a health care navigator is by making an appointment.\n\nBlaine hopes more people call (the number is 214-650-7724) to set up an appointment to discuss questions about their current policy, and learn about signing up for the first time.\n\n\u201cEveryone who has a current policy will have received a renewal letter in the mail,\u201d Blaine says, \u201cWe recommend that people all go online and take a look, even if you have a current policy, because there are some changes and you want to be sure that your choice for this year is your best choice.\u201d\n\nAn Improved Website\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry about having to sign up on paper, Blaine says.\n\n\u201cThe system is much improved, we are pleased to say.\u201d\n\nThis year, Blaine explains, more people will be able to fill out a shorter, simpler form than last time, which she expects will prevent any backlogs and website crashes.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health/Science", "description": "Despite a very rocky start to open enrollment last year, more than 733,000 Texans bought insurance through the federal marketplace.
