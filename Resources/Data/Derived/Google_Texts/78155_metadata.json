State Board of Elections. The information \u2013 an \u201cofficial application form\u201d \u2013 was sent by Americans for Prosperity, a national conservative group with a state chapter based in Raleigh. Since then, hundreds of people who received the forms have called and complained to the State Board of Elections, said Joshua Lawson, a public information officer for the board. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear where (Americans for Prosperity) got their list, but it\u2019s caused a lot of confusion for people in the state,\u201d Lawson said. One resident even received a voter registration form addressed to her cat, he said. \u201cThe phone calls have consistently been all day, every day,\u201d Lawson said.\n\nThe Daily Tarheel has a similar report:\n\nLawson said state officials are looking into hundreds of potentially fraudulent registration forms flagged since August. \u201cWhen you have a stack of these forms delivered at once with no return address or with very similar handwriting and signatures, the county is required to check into these forms,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWe would interview the person listed on the form and they would say they did not submit the form.\u201d\n\nLawson also told the Daily Tarheel that residents have been calling the Board about people going door-to-door and saying residents need to re-register because the state\u2019s voter database went down.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t send out people to go door-to-door,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do not need to re-register unless you have moved to a different county.\u201d\n\nThe forms mailed by AFP are inaccurate in several ways \u2014 including telling voters that the form is due at the State Board 30 days from the election. In fact, the form is due at the county board 25 days from the election.\n\nAmong other problems:\n\n\u2022 The first page also states people should return the registration to the N.C. Secretary of State\u2019s office, though the envelope is addressed to the State Board of Elections. \u2022 It states the Secretary of State\u2019s office has an elections division and can answer questions about registration. The Secretary of State\u2019s office does not handle elections, Lawson said, though other states do house their elections division within their secretary of state\u2019s office. The form also gives the wrong phone number for the Secretary of State\u2019s office \u2013 the number is actually for the State Board of Elections. \u2022 The form states that after voters mail in their information, they will be notified of their precinct by their local county clerk. \u201cThere\u2019s no county clerk that would do these things,\u201d said Lawson. \u201cIt would come from the county board of elections or the elections director, under their signature.\u201d \u2022 The registration form also includes the wrong ZIP code for the State Board of Elections. The ZIP code associated with the board\u2019s post office box is 27611, and the board\u2019s office ZIP code is 27603.\n\nMisleading people about voter registration can be a felony if it is intentional and dissuades them from voting, but no one has alleged as much, Lawson said.\n\nThis is not the first time the Koch-funded AFP has been engaged in such shenanigans. In West Virginia this past spring, the group mailed leaflets with inaccurate information to residents there, warning that if they didn\u2019t update their voter registration they might lose their right to vote in an upcoming primary election.\n\nIn 2013, AFP sent \u201creport cards\u201d to Virginia voters claiming that recipients hadn\u2019t registered to vote and threatening to \u201ctell their neighbors.\u201d\n\nAnd in Wisconsin the group sent out misleading absentee ballots before a 2011 election.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde34b\"", "article_summary": "One resident even received a voter registration form addressed to her cat, he said.\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s office does not handle elections, Lawson said, though other states do house their elections division within their secretary of state\u2019s office.\n\u2022 The form states that after voters mail in their information, they will be notified of their precinct by their local county clerk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear where (Americans for Prosperity) got their list, but it\u2019s caused a lot of confusion for people in the state,\u201d Lawson said.\nThe Daily Tarheel has a similar report:Lawson said state officials are looking into hundreds of potentially fraudulent registration forms flagged since August."}
