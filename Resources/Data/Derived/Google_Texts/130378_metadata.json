As \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d chants broke out from each packed corner of AT&T Park, Bumgarner finished off the first World Series shutout in 11 years.\n\n\u201cYou know what? For some reason, I keep getting really lucky this time of year, so I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Bumgarner said.\n\nIt must be more than luck.\n\nBecause by the time the 25-year-old from Hickory, North Carolina, outdid his own winning performance in Game 1, he had evoked memories of Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax, Curt Schilling and the top October aces of all-time.\n\n\u201cVery humbling,\u201d Bumgarner said.\n\nPHOTOS: Game 5 of the 2014 World Series\n\nHe certainly joined those names, and maybe even exceeded them.\n\nWho else has gone 4-0 in four World Series starts with an 0.29 ERA? Throw in only 12 hits in 31 innings, along with 27 strikeouts, and that math makes him the very definition of Big Game Pitcher.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s special, isn\u2019t he?\u201d manager Bruce Bochy said during a quiet moment in his office eating dinner. \u201cWhat a stud.\u201d\n\nGiants Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal mingled in the clubhouse, too, waiting his turn to congratulate the guy with the curly, stringy hair.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so smooth. I say that he\u2019s cold-blooded. When he\u2019s on the mound, he dominates everybody. Everybody,\u201d Marichal said.\n\nOn this evening, Bumgarner fanned eight without a walk and never was in trouble as he constantly changed speeds, with no runners reaching third base. There hadn\u2019t been a shutout in the Series since Josh Beckett\u2019s clinching gem for the Florida Marlins in 2003 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 work isn\u2019t done. To add to the crowns Bumgarner helped them take in 2010 and 2012, they\u2019ll need to win in Kansas City.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to getting back to our home crowd, where it\u2019s going to be absolutely wild and crazy,\u201d Royals manager Ned Yost said.\n\nJake Peavy gets the first chance to seal it for San Francisco when he starts Game 6 at Kauffman Stadium on Tuesday night against rookie Yordano Ventura.\n\nIf the Giants don\u2019t win then, there is always this possibility: Bumgarner said he\u2019s ready to come out of the bullpen in Game 7.\n\nHunter Pence once again was in the middle of things for Giants. He singled off James Shields in the second and scored on a groundout by Brandon Crawford, who had three RBIs.\n\nLater, the enigmatic Pence accidentally threw his bat past the mound while striking out, and appeared to apologize to Shields. Pence added another hit in a three-run eighth, making him 9 for 19 in the five games.\n\nPostseason star Pablo Sandoval also singled twice. Juan Perez broke it open with a two-run double off the top of the center-field fence in the eighth against Wade Davis and scored on a single by Crawford.\n\nSince trailing 4-1 in Game 4, the Giants have responded with 15 straight runs. San Francisco won that game, putting aside concern that Bumgarner should\u2019ve been moved up to pitch on short rest.\n\nBumgarner won for the fourth time against one loss in this postseason, and this blanking bookended the four-hit shutout he threw at Pittsburgh in the NL wild-card game. Durable, he\u2019s thrown 47 2-3 innings this October, trailing just Schilling\u2019s 48 1-3 in 2001 for the most in a single postseason, with a 1.13 ERA.\n\nAs Bumgarner wrapped up the win, his name echoed around the ballpark.\n\n\u201cThat was pretty cool, actually. It was really neat to hear,\u201d he said.\n\nToward the late innings, it appeared that only a lightning strike could rescue the Royals, perhaps a home run out of nowhere. Not happening \u2014 this was the third straight game without either team hitting a homer, the longest streak in the World Series since 1948 when the Boston Braves and Cleveland began with a three-game drought, STATS said.\n\nExactly why the man nicknamed MadBum is so dominant isn\u2019t easily apparent. Royals cleanup hitter Eric Hosmer said before the game that Bumgarner\u2019s \u201ccross-body\u201d delivery is tough to pick up.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 Bumgarner definitely has an impressive whip, along with an imposing WHIP in the World Series. His walks-plus-hits ratio per inning is incredible.\n\nAbout the only thing Bumgarner didn\u2019t do well was get a hit. He takes pride in his plate prowess and launched four home runs this season, including two grand slams. Bumgarner went 0 for 4, leaving him hitless in 22 postseason at-bats.\n\nYep, he\u2019s still got some work to do.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRoyals: Ventura will become the fourth rookie to start twice in a Series since 2000, joining John Lackey, Justin Verlander and Michael Wacha.\n\nGiants: Peavy started in the World Series last year for the champion Boston Red Sox. He took the loss last week in Game 2, and is 1-4 with a 7.05 ERA in eight career postseason starts.\n\nSTATS\n\nOf the 41 previous instances the World Series was tied at 2 in the best-of-seven format, the Game 5 winner won the title 27 times. \u2026 Bumgarner\u2019s ERA is the lowest in World Series history for pitchers with at least 25 innings. Jack Billingham is next at 0.36. Among the leaders are Babe Ruth (0.87) and Mariano Rivera (0.99). \u2026 Since 1982, teams down 3-2 going home for Games 6 and 7 have won eight of 10 World Series \u2014 including the Royals in 1985.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Madison Bumgarner, Giants beat Royals for 3-2 World Series lead", "title": "Madison Bumgarner, Giants beat Royals for 3-2 World Series lead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/26/madison-bumgarner-giants-beat-royals-for-3-2-world-series-lead/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141026__giants-game5p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141026__giants-game5p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-26T21:30:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:21:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2026 Bumgarner\u2019s ERA is the lowest in World Series history for pitchers with at least 25 innings.\nWho else has gone 4-0 in four World Series starts with an 0.29 ERA?\nMVP!\u201d chants broke out from each packed corner of AT&T Park, Bumgarner finished off the first World Series shutout in 11 years.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With every pitch, Madison Bumgarner etched his place among the World Series greats.\n\u2026 Since 1982, teams down 3-2 going home for Games 6 and 7 have won eight of 10 World Series \u2014 including the Royals in 1985."}
