They are shifting their responsibility to our patients, and that is just wrong.\"\n\n\"The federal government has done an injustice to emergency patients and emergency physicians by giving carte blanche to insurance companies to pay whatever they want. Historically we know that amounts to as little as possible,\" he said.\n\nHHS has said that the Affordable Care Act requires that a reasonable amount be paid based on an objective standard when patients receive emergency care from providers who are not in the plan's network. ACEP says the regulation adopted does not hold insurance companies accountable to do what the ACA requires. They also want the federal court to clarify the \"usual and customary\" standard.\n\nKaplan says emergency physicians worked with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for four years to address the out-of-network issue, and were shocked and disappointed when the final rule was published last November.\n\n'Ridiculously Low Rates of Reimbursement'\n\nACEP says the final rule allows insurance companies to arbitrarily set their own rates and shift costs to patients. The new rule says \"minimum standards of payment are not necessary\" in states that have banned balance billing.\n\nThe practical effect of this, ACEP claims, is that insurance companies can set whatever prices they want without regard to the consequences to patients, providers, or the nation's safety net of emergency care.\n\n\"Health insurance companies have taken gross advantage of patients and emergency medical providers since the ACA, arbitrarily slashing payments by as much as 70%,\" Kaplan said.\n\n\"They are forcing many providers out of their networks by imposing ridiculously low rates of reimbursement. In addition, health insurance companies are misleading patients by offering so-called 'affordable' premiums for these policies that cover very little because of the narrow networks, high co-pays and astronomical deductibles. It is insurance in name only because there is hardly any real coverage for the patient.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "ACEP claims new rules allow health insurers to arbitrarily set low out-of-network reimbursements for emergency care, putting payment responsibility on patients.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "cost, legal, government, insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "HHS Sued for ER Reimbursement PolicyACEP claims new rules allow health insurers to arbitrarily set low out-of-network reimbursements for emergency care, putting payment responsibility on patients.\nThe federal government is being sued over new rules that plaintiffs claim allow health insurance companies to unfairly and arbitrarily set low out-of-network reimbursements for emergency care.\nACEP says the regulation adopted does not hold insurance companies accountable to do what the ACA requires.\n\"The federal government has done an injustice to emergency patients and emergency physicians by giving carte blanche to insurance companies to pay whatever they want.\n\"They have a history of data manipulation and not paying for emergency care."}
