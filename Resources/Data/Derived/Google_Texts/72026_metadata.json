Credit his unusual path to the NBA.\n\nMudiay, who spent his early childhood in the Democratic Republic of Congo before moving with his family to Texas, committed to play for former Nuggets coach Larry Brown at Southern Methodist University, in 2013. But before joining the Mustangs, he decided to go pro overseas instead, signing a $1.2 million contract with the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nIt was a decision based on hardship, Mudiay said; after watching his mother and brothers struggle for years to make ends meet, he wanted to help provide for them by turning pro early and bypassing college.\n\n\n\nIt was also a decision he, and the Nuggets, say helped to prepare him for the NBA. He quickly had to adapt to playing against more physical players \u2014 men much bigger and stronger than he was as a teenager.\n\nCheck out the clip above, courtesy of MaxPreps, to see the kind of player he was before going pro, as a senior guard at Prime Prep in Dallas in 2013-14.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Chinese Basketball Association,Emmanuel Mudiay,Nuggets", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Highlights of Emmanuel Mudiay, the Nuggets' 2015 first-round draft pick, at Prime Prep in Dallas in 2013-14, before he played a season in China.", "title": "WATCH: Emmanuel Mudiay highlights from high school, at Prime Prep", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/06/27/watch-emmanuel-mudiay-high-school-highlights/13076/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/06/482100257-495x498.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Highlights of Emmanuel Mudiay, the Nuggets' 2015 first-round draft pick, at Prime Prep in Dallas in 2013-14, before he played a season in China.", "title": "WATCH: Emmanuel Mudiay high school highlights", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/06/27/watch-emmanuel-mudiay-high-school-highlights/13076/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/06/482100257-495x498.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Highlights of Emmanuel Mudiay, the Nuggets' 2015 first-round draft pick, at Prime Prep in Dallas in 2013-14, before he played a season in China."}, "article_summary": "Emmanuel Mudiay, the Nuggets\u2019 first-round draft pick, is relatively unknown to most, despite spending much of his youth in Texas.\nCheck out the clip above, courtesy of MaxPreps, to see the kind of player he was before going pro, as a senior guard at Prime Prep in Dallas in 2013-14.\nIt was also a decision he, and the Nuggets, say helped to prepare him for the NBA.\nHe quickly had to adapt to playing against more physical players \u2014 men much bigger and stronger than he was as a teenager.\nIt was a decision based on hardship, Mudiay said; after watching his mother and brothers struggle for years to make ends meet, he wanted to help provide for them by turning pro early and bypassing college."}
