Participate in our project by sharing your women's health story here.\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services finalized strict new abortion regulations on Friday, claiming that none of the 19,000 public comments on the rules provided evidence that they are unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe department is aware of no comments that explain how particular abortion-seeking patients will face unconstitutionally long travel distances, unconstitutionally long wait times or unconstitutionally high costs for abortion services in any particular part of the state,\u201d according to the department\u2019s background and justification for the rules, published in the Texas Register.\n\nGov. Rick Perry called lawmakers back for two special legislative sessions to ensure the anti-abortion regulations \u2014 including nearby hospital admitting privileges for abortion doctors and a ban on the procedure after 20 weeks \u2014 passed. Although thousands of protesters descended on the Capitol to support a filibuster of the proposed rules by state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, Republican lawmakers eventually passed the omnibus abortion bill.\n\nPart of the new law took effect in October, and many abortion clinics that do not meet the new requirements have been unable to perform the procedure. But the department wrote in the Texas Register that commenters failed to identify particular clinics that would be permanently shut down by the new rules.\n\nFurthermore, the department wrote that the state could be reasonably skeptical of allegations of future harm, given abortion providers\u2019 failure to prove in a federal lawsuit that particular clinics would be forced to close if the admitting-privileges requirement went into effect.\n\n\u201cThose allegations proved to be overstated because multiple providers that allegedly would be forced to close nonetheless received admitting privileges and either stayed open or reopened,\u201d according to the department. \u201cNot one of the comments received by the department provides any basis to believe that abortion providers would be unable to make similar adjustments and likewise comply with the rule.\u201d\n\nAmy Hagstrom Miller, executive director of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates five abortion clinics in Texas, called the department's claim that it doesn't know of any abortion clinics that have closed or will close \"preposterous.\" She emphasized that the new restrictions have already caused abortion facilities in the Rio Grande Valley, Killeen and Waco to stop performing abortions, leaving thousands of women without access to care.\n\n\u201cWomen can still decide to terminate a pregnancy, but thousands of them can no longer actually access safe, professional medical care to receive that termination,\u201d Miller said in an email to the Tribune. \u201cA right is meaningless if you cannot act on it. Without providers, the right to an abortion is an abstraction that does not exist for thousands of Texan women.\u201d\n\nAbortion providers in Texas have challenged the constitutionality of two laws that took effect in November: the admitting-privileges rule and another requiring doctors to follow federal guidelines \u2014 rather than a common, evidence-based protocol \u2014 when administering drug-induced abortions. The rules finalized on Friday also require abortion facilities to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers starting in September.\n\nAlthough six abortion facilities already qualify as ambulatory surgical centers, only three of them currently have a physician on staff with hospital admitting privileges. The department wrote in the rules that it's aware of three ambulatory surgical facilities that abortion providers plan to open in Dallas, San Antonio and Houston by September.\n\nIn November, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it would not intervene in the abortion providers\u2019 case or reinstate an injunction by a lower federal court that blocked implementation of the laws. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana overturned that injunction on Oct. 31, which allowed the law to take effect. The case on the law's constitutionality will still proceed in the 5th Circuit, which has scheduled a hearing in January.\n\nAs the case moves through the courts, roughly a third of abortion providers operating in Texas have discontinued abortion services because they do not have a physician with hospital admitting privileges. Some facilities that discontinued services when the law first took effect now have physicians who have obtained hospital admitting privileges, such as the Whole Woman\u2019s Health facility in Fort Worth.\n\nPlanned Parenthood was forced to stop performing abortions at four facilities in Texas when the new law took effect in November because those facilities do not have physicians with such privileges. Planned Parenthood facilities that offered abortions in Bryan, Midland and San Angelo have also recently closed.\n\nAlthough the finalization of the new rules are a \"deeply troubling development,\" said Sarah Wheat, vice president of community affairs for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, the organization would continue to evaluate its options and take steps to secure women's access to health services.\n\n\"These restrictions will do nothing to protect women's health and safety, which is why doctors and leading medical groups \u2014 as well as thousands of Texans \u2014 opposed them,\" Wheat said in a statement. \"By cutting off access to safe, high-quality medical care, these restrictions will endanger women's health and safety.\"\n\nAs WOAI in San Antonio reported, a federal judge in Houston also ruled on Friday that two universities, East Texas Baptist University and Houston Baptist University, will be exempt from a provision in the federal Affordable Care Act that requires employers to provide coverage for contraception and abortion-inducing drugs in employees\u2019 health plans. Although the Obama administration provided an exemption to the rule for churches and some religious institutions, other organizations often affiliated with religion, such as universities and hospitals, are not exempt from the rule.\n\nThe lower court case will likely be impacted by a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, which plans to consider two other cases that challenge the contraception coverage mandate under Obamacare: a case filed by the Green family, which owns Hobby Lobby, and a case filed by the Mennonite owners of Conestoga Wood Specialties in Pennsylvania. The owners of both companies oppose abortion and argue that they\u2019ll be forced to pay millions of dollars in fines for refusing to provide health care coverage that violates their religious beliefs.\n\nThis story was produced with the support of the Dennis A.
