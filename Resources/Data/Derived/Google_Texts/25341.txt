First Lady Karen Pence says she’s particularly proud of the way she and the governor have opened up the Governor’s residence to the public over the last two years.

Mitch Daniels and his wife Cheri chose not to live in the governor’s residence, bucking decades of tradition and opting instead to live in their Carmel home. Governor Mike Pence and his wife Karen reverted to tradition, taking up residence at the mansion on Indianapolis’ northside.

And, Karen says unlike other First Families, she and her husband wanted to make the residence more accessible.

“Mike likes to use it a lot, likes to have all the legislators over, dinner for the JAG people… there’s just a lot of things that we’ve done over the course of two years,” she says.

Karen says opening the house to tours and activities has helped make it seem more like a home.

“I didn’t know in the beginning if we would be able to; it just seemed daunting to me to have people touring the place where you live,”she says. “But, it’s worked out great.”

Karen says there’s only one day in December without some sort of event scheduled at the residence.
