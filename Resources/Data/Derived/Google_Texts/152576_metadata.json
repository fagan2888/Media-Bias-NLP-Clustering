Yet, in so doing, they have exposed the acute faith-derangement syndrome (FDS) afflicting large swaths of the American public and thus, potentially, cleared the way for sanity-inducing treatment.\n\nThis week\u2019s essay concerns one Colton Burpo \u2014 no, I\u2019m not making up this burbling eructation of a name \u2014 and his father Todd and the immensely remunerative product of their collaboration, \u201cHeaven Is for Real: A Little Boy\u2019s Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back.\u201d Based on alleged happenings in 2003, the book hit the stands only in 2010. Todd Burpo, originally (and not incidentally) a cash-strapped Nebraskan preacher, relied on Lynn Vincent (who helped Sarah Palin write \u201cGoing Rogue: An American Life\u201d) as co-author to tell the story of Babe Burpo\u2019s putative excursion to paradise and back, and his supernal jaunt\u2019s effect on his family and community.\n\nTodd Burpo\u2019s choice of co-author hints at the credibility we should grant him. Not surprisingly, however, the book the two came up with became a New York Times nonfiction bestseller that sold more than ten million copies. Sony Pictures took note and cashed in, casting Academy-Award nominee Greg Kinnear (\u201cLittle Miss Sunshine\u201d and \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d) as Burpo Senior, and stage actress Kelly Reilly as his wife Sonja, with Colton played by the cherubic (no exaggeration) Connor Corum. The outcome: a shameful waste of celluloid no one involved with should be allowed to live down, but that earned in excess of a hundred million dollars \u2014 almost ten times the production budget. If nonbelievers ever needed proof that divine justice is a cruel myth, \u201cHeaven Is for Real\u201d is it.\n\nI\u2019ll concern myself herein with the movie, which the Burpos helped promote and say is accurate. Though they inhabit a near-palatial home, not much is going well financially with the Burpos in the quintessentially All-American small town idyll of Imperial. (Hollywood skimped on idylls and actually shot in Canada.) In fact, they are nearing destitution. Todd\u2019s job as pastor of the Crossroads Wesleyan Church is just not cutting it. He\u2019s a randy pastor, we see, indulged in hinted-at S&M tendencies by his All-American wife (who happens really to be British). His sermons, however, are of the insipid sort, not spiced up with any of the vicious nonsense bespattering the Bible. (A rationalist viewer wonders why anyone would attend this entirely run-of-the-mill mortal\u2019s homilies at all.) Except for bizarre tarantula-petting sessions, life unwinds in Imperial much as a non-red-stater might expect, with barbeques and softball matches and, of course, lots of neighborly bonhomie, which helps Todd Burpo endure a splintered shinbone, kidney stones and (again, not incidentally) mounting money problems.\n\nThen tragedy strikes. Little Colton begins vomiting and develops a 104-degree fever. Symptoms persist for four full days before the Burpos think to take the delirious lad to the hospital. There they learn his appendix has burst. Orderlies rush him to the operating room. As the surgeons are removing scraps of the exploded organ (a remnant, incidentally, of our Darwinian evolution from herbivores to omnivores), the anesthetized Colton undergoes what appears to be a rather typical out-of-body experience, or so we are at first led to believe.\n\nColton later provides \u201cevidence\u201d of it; he recounts seeing himself from above, watching his mother in the waiting room organize a communal pray-in to help him recover (a big mistake, research shows), and spying on his father as he rages in the chapel at the imaginary tyrant worshipped by devotees of his chosen Abrahamic cult. Nota Bene: at no time do attending physicians or the Burpos themselves contend that Colton died and was revived. Essentially, the boy does nothing more than talk about what he dreamed while drugged up.\n\nThat should have been the end of this story of parental neglect, faith-delusion, bad budgeting and kidney stones. All the more so since none of what Colton dreamed sounded extraordinary; it could have all derived from memories of his daily life, with a pastor father who prayed and a mother who might well have, within his earshot, organized pray-ins. But then, one stormy night, after the Burpos\u2019 discuss money woes, which are so bad mom exclaims \u201cI\u2019m going to have to get a job!\u201d (perish the thought!), Colton says he ranged far and wide while he was out cold, consorting with Jesus and journeying to heaven on Christ\u2019s horse. As the film progresses, it turns out he also encountered a miscarried sister he allegedly never heard of and met Todd\u2019s deceased father. (In another venue, Colton even claims to have conversed with the Almighty Himself, but more on that below.)\n\nExcept for Christ\u2019s ungulate, everything Colton describes he could have seen earlier on Hallmark cards or in a picture Bible for kiddies, or learned about from his parents. This includes the stock-image Jesus, of course, who, in his telling, is white, light-eyed and English-speaking. Not a shred of evidence shows Jesus even existed, but if he had, he would have likely sported a duskier Mediterranean complexion, curlier and darker hair, and spoken not Midwestern American English, but Aramaic and some Hebrew.\n\nHerewith begins the film\u2019s internal inconsistency, nay, incomprehensibility. Colton\u2019s regurgitation of all this pop-Christian rubbish astounds and even disturbs Todd so much that he seeks succor from a psychologist. (Of course, he rejects her rational explanations). Todd then complains to his banker (we are never allowed to forget he\u2019s broke) that \u201cWe ask these kids to believe this stuff\u201d \u2014 about heaven and God \u2014 \u201cand I don\u2019t even know if I believe it myself . . . the Bible tells us to believe as children. What my child\u2019s tellin\u2019 me could get me laughed out of this town.\u201d Later, in church, still discombobulated, he voices his doubts to his incredulous \u201cflock;\u201d one of them, disturbed by all this ungainly talk of Colton\u2019s purported visit with the Godhead, bleats, \u201cGood lord, what\u2019s happened to our preacher?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Heaven Is for Real\" is lame \"heaven tourism,\" a \"divine travelogue for dummies.\" But not to Sean Hannity!", "title": "Sean Hannity, very bad critic: Fox News, Sony, Sarah Palin pal help hit movie prey on the gullible", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Heaven Is for Real\" is lame \"heaven tourism,\" a \"divine travelogue for dummies.\" But not to Sean Hannity!", "title": "Sean Hannity, very bad critic: Fox News, Sony, Sarah Palin pal help hit movie prey on the gullible", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/28/sean_hannity_very_bad_critic_fox_news_sony_sarah_palin_pal_help_hit_movie_prey_on_the_gullible/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/hannity_heaven.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Heaven Is for Real\" is lame \"heaven tourism,\" a \"divine travelogue for dummies.\" But not to Sean Hannity!", "title": "Sean Hannity, very bad critic: Fox News, Sony, Sarah Palin pal help hit movie prey on the gullible", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/hannity_heaven.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Colton Burpo, Editor's Picks, Fox News, Greg Kinnear, Heaven Is for Real, Movies, Sarah Palin, Sean Hannity, Todd Burpo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7066\"", "article_summary": "Todd Burpo\u2019s choice of co-author hints at the credibility we should grant him.\nLittle Colton begins vomiting and develops a 104-degree fever.\nIf nonbelievers ever needed proof that divine justice is a cruel myth, \u201cHeaven Is for Real\u201d is it.\nNota Bene: at no time do attending physicians or the Burpos themselves contend that Colton died and was revived.\nColton\u2019s regurgitation of all this pop-Christian rubbish astounds and even disturbs Todd so much that he seeks succor from a psychologist."}
