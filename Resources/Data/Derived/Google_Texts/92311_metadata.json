Retailing behemoth Amazon and publishing giant Hachette Book Group on Thursday announced they had reached a new multiyear deal covering print and e-book sales, ending a long and public dispute.\n\nIn any other context, this would have been a clash of titans. After all, Hachette is one of publishing\u2019s Big Five (the others are Penguin Random House, Macmillan, HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster) whose market clout still has the power to make or break an author\u2019s career. But this is Amazon.com, the Everything Store, that Hachette took on in what turned into a nasty fight over how prices on e-books would be set for customers using Amazon\u2019s Kindle devices.\n\nWho won? Well, we don\u2019t really know, though if Amazon was looking to gain control over Hachette\u2019s e-book prices, it appears to have fallen short of that goal. Neither side is disclosing details of the settlement (just as both managed to keep the precise terms of what they were wrangling about secret for nearly six months). Both say they are happy. Hachette\u2019s CEO says it\u2019s a great day for authors; that the new agreement will benefit them \u201cfor years to come.\u201d Amazon execs took to the airwaves, proclaiming that it includes incentives for Hachette to lower prices on e-books, a win for consumers.\n\nThe news arrived only a week after The New Republic published a scathing cover story attacking the web retailer, entitled \u201cAmazon Must Be Stopped.\u201d In the piece, Franklin Foer, editor of The New Republic, focuses on the company\u2019s allegedly pernicious \u201crecord of shredding young businesses\u2026 just as they begin to pose a competitive challenge\u201d and its tendency to use \u201cits riches to undercut opponents on price.\u201d\n\nThe dispute with Hachette \u2014 which resulted in Amazon deliberately delaying shipments of the publisher\u2019s titles to customers \u2014 serves as a case study in The New Republic\u2019s attack, and has galvanized opposition to Amazon on a number of fronts. \u201cThere seems to be no limits to Amazon\u2019s demands,\u201d and the Hachette negotiations proved this, the magazine argued.\n\nRelated: Amazon Faces Growing Backlash in Showdown with Hachette\n\nOther authors lined up in two camps. On one side was a hastily organized group, Authors United, spearheaded by Hachette-published Douglas Preston, who organized protests that included publishing a full-page ad in The New York Times criticizing Amazon\u2019s business practices and its demands. Self-published authors, a group that includes best-selling writers like Hugh Howey, rallied to defend Amazon, which has helped them to create new online markets for their work and reach readers. \u201cRather than innovate and serve their customers, publishers have been resisting technology,\u201d they said scornfully, in a Change.org petition that attracted 8,665 signatures and suggested that \u201call the complaints about Amazon should be directed at Hachette\u201d instead.\n\nIt was clear in recent weeks that the publishers and Amazon were inching closer toward a settlement. The level of vitriol was unsustainably high; Amazon might be able to do without income from Hachette, but the controversy was getting harder to manage. Meanwhile, Hachette and its authors were suffering: Recent research shows that Amazon controls 41 percent of all new books, including 64 percent of all new books purchased online and a 67 percent share of all e-books. Amazon removed the preorder button, making it impossible for customers to shop in advance for books by favorite authors \u2014 and making it much, much harder for that book to make it onto a bestseller list, and having a knock-on effect on sales.\n\nIt was a kind of death spiral that took a toll on both authors and even consumers, even though Amazon claimed to be fighting the battle in their name. Anyone who wanted specific books delivered in a timely manner ended up having to take their business elsewhere. Almost the only group for whom this bitter dispute was a boon were independent booksellers, a crowd that is long overdue for a break.\n\nHachette couldn\u2019t live without that market, and neither could its authors. Hachette-published novelist Luis Urrea tweeted Thursday in response to the news that the dispute had been settled: \u201cI only lost \u00bd of my book income during that fight. Didn\u2019t hurt, he gasped.\u201d\n\nIndeed, authors quickly went to Amazon\u2019s website to see whether the \u201cshipping delays\u201d had been altered (\u201cusually ships in one to four weeks\u201d was a common sight for any new book published by a Hachette imprint, as well as popular backlist titles). Thriller author Jeff Abbott was disappointed. \u201cMy books still say 1-4 weeks to ship,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how quickly that changes.\u201d\n\nWhat some authors don\u2019t expect to change is the bad blood that the dispute has brought to the surface and aggravated between the publishing industry and Amazon. \u201cIf anyone thinks this is over, they are deluding themselves,\u201d Douglas Preston told The New York Times. \u201cAmazon covets market share the way Napoleon coveted territory.\u201d\n\nIf Amazon compromised on what it wanted this time, the balance of power is clearly in its favor \u2014 too many of us have become too Amazon dependent \u2014 and the conflict between Amazon and publishers, or anyone else that might get in its way, is likely to be a long, complicated and very messy one.\n\nRelated: Why Amazon\u2019s $1 Billion Deal for Twitch Was Totally Worth It\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is finding that there may be more than one route to victory. Even as it does battle with traditional publishers, it has been building up its own in-house publishing arm, with divisions dedicated to all kinds of genre fiction, heavy promotional activity, lots of treats for authors (flowers and chocolates on publication day) and big, big sales for the most successful authors under its umbrella. (CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019s own wife, MacKenzie, opted for a Penguin Random House imprint for her own novel, but writers with less powerful connections are big, big fans.) Consumers, meanwhile, love the low prices, which often max out at $4.99 or lower, and can be free via the Kindle Unlimited program.\n\nSo, Hachette authors may be grateful that their pain is over; consumers may be glad to have instant gratification once more. But anyone who is worried about shifting balance of power in the book industry shouldn\u2019t relax any time soon.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Great Publishing Battle of 2014 is over.", "title": "Amazon vs. Hachette: The Battle Is Over, the War Isn\u2019t", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/16/Amazon-vs-Hachette-Battle-Over-War-Isn-t", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/06202014_Jeff_Bezos_Amazon_Fire.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/11/16/Amazon-vs-Hachette-Battle-Over-War-Isn-t", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/06202014_Jeff_Bezos_Amazon_Fire.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Great Publishing Battle of 2014 is over.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf551\"", "article_summary": "(CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019s own wife, MacKenzie, opted for a Penguin Random House imprint for her own novel, but writers with less powerful connections are big, big fans.)\nSo, Hachette authors may be grateful that their pain is over; consumers may be glad to have instant gratification once more.\nRetailing behemoth Amazon and publishing giant Hachette Book Group on Thursday announced they had reached a new multiyear deal covering print and e-book sales, ending a long and public dispute.\nIt was clear in recent weeks that the publishers and Amazon were inching closer toward a settlement.\n\u201cThere seems to be no limits to Amazon\u2019s demands,\u201d and the Hachette negotiations proved this, the magazine argued."}
