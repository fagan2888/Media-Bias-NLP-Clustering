Burwell, cutting off Obamacare\u2019s tax credits in roughly two-thirds of the states. Without that financial assistance, most of the people now buying insurance through healthcare.gov, the online marketplace run by the federal government, wouldn\u2019t be able to pay for their coverage anymore.\n\n\n\nA ruling wouldn\u2019t affect people living in states like California and Kentucky, which operate their own insurance marketplaces. But the results in the rest of the country would be dramatic and visible. More than 8 million people would end up uninsured, according to estimates by the non-partisan Urban Institute. Economic disarray would follow, as panicked insurance companies hiked premiums and pulled out of markets suddenly bereft of customers.\n\nWhat the experts can\u2019t say is how people would feel about such a shock, because it\u2019s hard to think of a time when government took away benefits from so many people, across such a large swath of the country, within such a short time. There just isn\u2019t a great historical analogue for predicting how people would react -- or, for that matter, how that reaction would affect politics. Even veteran strategists seem stumped.\n\n\n\nBut one recent episode may offer some clues. It comes, ironically enough, from Obamacare\u2019s own history.\n\n\n\nIn the fall of 2013, insurance companies canceled coverage for millions of Americans, either because the old policies weren\u2019t up to Obamacare\u2019s standards or because the insurers decided the old policies were no longer profitable to sell. The cancellations surprised most Americans, not least because President Barack Obama had famously promised that people who liked their old insurance plans could keep them. You couldn\u2019t turn on the television without hearing from somebody dismayed, angry, or scared about what was happening. Looking back at 2013, it\u2019s hard to remember a time when, for better or worse, a change in domestic policy created so much turmoil.\n\n\n\nThe differences between 2013 and a potential Supreme Court decision are large enough to make direct comparisons impossible. That\u2019s particularly true when it comes to figuring out who an angry public would hold responsible this time around. The court\u2019s conservative majority, for issuing such a decision? Republicans, for backing this case and trying to take away people\u2019s insurance? Obama and the Democrats, for creating the law in the first place?\n\n\n\nBut if the 2013 controversy doesn\u2019t indicate much about the shape of a reaction to a Supreme Court reaction, it may say something about the scale -- and why the intensity of reaction this time, whatever its direction, is likely to be even larger than it was last time.\n\n\n\nOne reason for this is the raw numbers involved. Nobody knows exactly how many policies insurance companies actually canceled in the fall of 2013. At one point, The Associated Press compiled an estimate, based on reports from state insurance officials, suggesting that the number was close to 5 million. But subsequent estimates suggested that number was far too high. One of the most thorough examinations available came from Lisa Clemans-Cope and Nathaniel Anderson at the Urban Institute. They concluded that cancellations probably numbered around 2.6 million. Jon Gabel, from the University of Chicago, came up with an even smaller number: 1.9 million.\n\nYou shouldn't take either figure as gospel. In both cases, the scholars in effect juxtaposed survey data with estimates of the number of people with \u201cnon-group\u201d insurance, which itself has been difficult for experts to measure. But even if the Urban Institute and Gabel estimates are low by a million or two -- which would be a huge error -- it\u2019d still be far less than the 7.7 million who would instantly lose insurance from an adverse ruling in King v. Burwell -- to say nothing of the millions more who would have to pay higher premiums in the future because state insurance markets would be in such trouble.\n\n\n\nAnd the people who got cancellation notices last time didn\u2019t necessarily end up in worse shape. On the contrary, a large percentage of the people with canceled policies became eligible either for Medicaid, which is basically free, or subsidized insurance, which cost much less than the old, unsubsidized policies. Exactly how many has been difficult to pin down, because the data on what people were paying before the change -- and what they were getting for that money -- is so spotty. But some of the best information available comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which surveyed people buying coverage in the new markets. Forty-six percent of respondents who\u2019d lost non-compliant plans said they had found new policies that cost less, while another 15 percent said they found new policies that cost roughly the same. Just 39 percent -- a significant fraction, but still a minority -- ended up paying more.\n\nBy contrast, if the Supreme Court yanks tax credits in the states using healthcare.gov, then 100 percent of the people who were receiving that assistance will see their premiums go up. The increases will not be small. Calculations from the Kaiser Foundation suggest that, for people who now rely on tax credits, premiums would rise on average by $268 each month -- enough, again, to make the cost of maintaining coverage prohibitive.\n\nAnd that, ultimately, is the biggest difference between the 2013 cancellations and what would happen, this summer, if the court strikes down subsidies in the healthcare.gov states. Two years ago, if you were one of those people who lost your coverage, you were still able to find an alternative. And thanks to the law\u2019s regulations -- yes, the same ones that sometimes made coverage more expensive -- you at least knew that your new policy was comprehensive. It had to include all essential benefits, including mental health and prescription coverage. And it had to limit your out-of-pocket expenses. This summer, if the Supreme Court takes away your coverage, you'll end up with ... nothing. Just like that, you\u2019ll go from the ranks of the safely insured to the ranks of the uninsured -- a far more drastic, and hazardous, transition than people experienced because of plan cancellations in 2013.\n\nTo be clear, forcing millions of people to change insurance policies back then was plenty disruptive, far more so than the law\u2019s advocates realized it would be. But that disruption was part of a transition to a new environment for health insurance -- one in which more people had coverage and those with coverage were more secure. By contrast, the (considerably) greater disruptions from a Supreme Court decision eliminating tax credits would signal a return to the pre-Obamacare status quo -- an environment in which many fewer people had insurance and those with coverage couldn\u2019t be as confident it would pay for their needs.\n\n\n\nSuch a transformation could be a nightmare for whichever politicians the public holds responsible -- to say nothing of the people who suddenly find themselves with no way to pay their medical bills.\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate\n\n1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it? Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce. What do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, overpriced and underperforming -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing. When the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'\" Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Experts have a pretty good sense of what will happen if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in King v.
