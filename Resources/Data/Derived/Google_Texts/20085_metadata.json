Gina Raimondo's budget coming Thursday, and cautiously optimistic that her leadership will bring better things to our state in time, her support for the fourth minimum wage hike in four years is discouraging. This governor, who knows how the high cost of regulations is strangling the state, starts off with a new regulation, a costly mandate on businesses large and small.\n\nWhen the price of your cup of coffee or five-dollar footlong goes up, you'll know who to blame. The General Assembly will be right there waving the flag, too.\n\nJust for a little background, I thought it was interesting that Raimondo made her announcement at the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 328 union hall. I used to be a member back in my college days, and my good Almacs job (in part thanks to that union) helped get me through school.\n\nBut in case you think Democrats are all \"down for the struggle\" with the working stiff, consider that the same UFCW was one among many unions that lobbied Congress (when the Democrats were in charge of the Senate) and President Obama (do I have to tell you his party?) to allow cuts in pensions for union retirees. On Dec. 15, the President signed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 into law, allowing many unions to cut benefits to union workers and retirees. Their sorry claim: They had not properly funded member pension plans. This despite spending $8 million on lobbying to influence the last election. Phonies!\n\nMinimum Wage Collateral Damage\n\nDo you know anybody - any family or friends - who have a loved one in need of home health care from an agency that provides certified nursing assistants, or CNAs? You might soon find that, thanks to this slam-dunk minimum wage hike, you won't be able to find anyone to care for your family member. Being a CNA, while rewarding, can also be rugged and dirty work. Why should CNAs labor so hard - and travel from client to client in snow and ice - when they can get a warm, clean job, with no training or license needed, for nearly the same money?\n\nYou see, at the same time our governor and General Assembly will be raising the minimum wage, they will also be looking for a way to rein in out-of-control Medicaid spending. Medicaid. As in \"the money which pays many CNAs.\"\n\nLet me explain. While I'm no expert, I'm getting an earful from my brother, Vincent, the 18-year owner of Home Care Services of Rhode Island. He's been warning about this coming crack-up for a few years, and frankly, no one in government is listening. He does expect they will start listening, however, when nobody shows up to do home care for chronically ill or disabled people in need. The crisis is coming.\n\nA few short years ago, when the minimum wage was $7.40 per hour, the average pay for a CNA there was $11 per hour, a $3.60 per hour difference. On Jan. 1, that difference will be 90 cents per hour for this critical work. Would you do it?\n\nOf course, you might say: Don't be a cheapskate. Give CNAs a raise. But here's the rub: My brother and other providers have had only one-plus increase in what they are paid by the state for patient care in 14 years! Wrote Vinnie in a letter to the Providence Journal last Dec. 19, \"Since 2001, home care agencies providing care for Medicaid patients have had but two rate increases - one in 2001 and one in 2008. Then, in 2009, a portion of the 2008 increase was taken back when DHS changed one of the forms...\" (You can read the entire letter online at the end of this column). My brother tells me that for him to give a $2 per hour raise to his employees would cost him $125,000, in a business where he can't raise prices.\n\nSo three cheers for the politicians. They're raising the minimum wage. But as always, many of those same politicians will barely understand - and certainly will not take responsibility for - the collateral damage they are about to inflict on many of the state's most needy and vulnerable people.\n\nWard is publisher of The Valley Breeze newspapers\n\nDecember 18, 2014\n\nBy Vincent P. Ward, owner\n\nHome Care Services of R.I., Inc.\n\nWoonsocket\n\nOn December 17, 2014, I read with interest the article entitled \u201cStudy finds many R.I. families don\u2019t earn enough to make ends meet.\u201d Did that hit home with me! As the owner of a Home Care agency in northern R.I., for over 18 years, I have had to tell 15-year employees that I am sorry but there will be no raise again this year, as EOHHS (formerly DHS) has once again decided that we should be treated as insignificant people caring for the state\u2019s indigent pediatric, adult and elderly population. Since 2001, home care agencies providing care for Medicaid patients have had but 2 rate increases - one in 2001 and one in 2008. Then, in 2009, a portion of the 2008 increase was taken back when DHS changed one of the forms we use to determine how acute the patient needs are.\n\nIn R.I., CNAs are mostly women, many single, trying to make ends meet. With ever-increasing food, energy, fuel and housing costs, it is becoming more and more difficult for them to get by, requiring many of them to require federal and state assistance to get by. It is truly disheartening to see the State treat home care agencies and their employees this way. The common theme is always that there is no money for an increase. Yet, in this year\u2019s budget, the state had to increase Medicaid costs under the old program (prior to the Affordable Care Act) by $20 million dollars. A raise was given to State employees this year, because it had been THREE years since they had received a raise - another $20 million dollars - and none of this was budgeted! This amount is more than 25 times the $1.5 million dollars that a 10% raise to agencies would cost. Since most home care CNAs are paid somewhere between $10 and $12 per hour, one can easily see why we have a big problem in R.I. as it relates to the future of home care.\n\nGovernor-elect Raimondo seems to want to assist small businesses throughout the state, and has expressed an interest in raising the minimum wage to the $10.10 per hour wage that has been desired by President Obama. Seems like a good idea, right? Well, once EVERY employer in the State has to pay at least $10.10 per hour to its employees, please tell me why CNAs should not leave the industry in droves. Almost any job will be easier than the personal care and homemaking chores that are done daily by CNAs. I believe that, should minimum wage be increased to over $10 per hour, without an increase in home care agency reimbursement rates, we will see a shortage of CNAs willing to provide care for the state\u2019s patients. A nice, clean job in any retail or manufacturing field may be much more enticing that the work required in home care. If they choose to leave the industry, it will not take long for the industry to find itself short of qualified, caring employees. In fact, away from Providence and large cities, it is already becoming more difficult to find enough qualified CNAs to care for the caseload of state Medicaid patients in these areas.\n\nToday, the State is already looking at ever-increasing deficits as the slot parlor and casinos open in Massachusetts. The state continues to be ranked as one of the worst states in the country to do business, the higher tax-paying residents are leaving for greener, lower-taxed pastures when they retire, and the middle and lower income citizens are left struggling. As we have been seeking raises in reimbursements for several years now, it has become more and more difficult to just sit back and accept the states claim of its inability to increase reimbursement rates while spending continues to balloon to unsustainable proportions. Without major changes to the Medicaid system as it relates to home care reimbursement rates in the state, there will be fewer and fewer persons willing to care for the states most vulnerable and needy. I believe that Governor-elect Raimondo, as well as her proposed new Secretary of EOHHS, former Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts, have a much clearer understanding of the plight of home care employees than Governor Chafee ever had. Hopefully, I am correct in my beliefs. The future of CNAs working in home care in Rhode Island depends on it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Valley Breeze", "description": "While I remain watchful for Gov.
