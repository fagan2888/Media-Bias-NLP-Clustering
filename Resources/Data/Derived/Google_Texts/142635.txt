The Sedgwick County Commission will discuss its goals for next year's legislative session. But a proposed checklist may have a paradox when it comes to taxes.

The six-page proposal on Wednesday's agenda asks state lawmakers to allow a county sales tax, to replace the property tax levy. "Sedgwick County only receives about 27 cents for every $1 raised by the current one cent local sales tax," the proposal point says.

But the document also has a section declaring "Kansas taxes are too high," and calling for a change to "an impediment to economic growth."

Another section of the legislative wish list deals with weapons. County leaders recommend one uniform set of rules for concealed carry weapons in government buildings.

"Concealed carry should be allowed in as many local government facilities as possible, as well as state government buildings," the proposal says.

The proposed wish list also continues Sedgwick County Commission opposition to the Affordable Care Act.
