A pro-Obamacare event hosted by Covered California, the state’s heath insurance marketplace, descended into the bizarre Thursday as fitness enthusiast Richard Simmons led a series of dance-offs.

Yes, it’s as weird as it sounds.

The online event, which lasted more than six hours, was advertised as a “live celebration of the 35 million Americans who now gain access to affordable health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.” But it quickly became a smorgasbord of bizarre and unusual behavior.

Simmons was joined during the event by contortionist Nathan Barnatt and YouTube celebrity Hannah Hart.

“What’s he doing?” Simmons asked as Barnatt began to shake his body.

“He’s extending his livelihood! That’s what he’s doing!” Hannah Hart replied.

“His moves are telling us something,” Barnatt said as Simmons started shaking.

“They are, and I think they’re saying, ‘Be flexible about your health insurance options,” Hart replied.

The event goes on like that for quite some time.

You can see the dance-off weirdness at the 20 minute mark:

The entire point of the online event was to encourage younger consumers to enroll in Obamacare. But based on how the event turned out, you have to wonder what the people behind Covered California think of the state’s young people.
