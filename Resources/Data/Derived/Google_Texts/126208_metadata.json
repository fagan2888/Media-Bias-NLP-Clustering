Directors Jane Campion and James Cameron also attended.\n\nJackson is a World War I history buff who owns a number of planes from the era.\n\nHe said the plan for the Wellington museum was to open during April to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli battle.\n\nHe said more galleries would be opened over the coming four years to mark other battles in which New Zealanders fought.\n\nThe New Zealand Herald newspaper reported earlier that Jackson had been recruited by the government to curate the museum, and he was expected to gather aircraft, tanks and other artifacts from private and public collections.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where most of my time is now, which is good,\u201d Jackson said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. And it\u2019s free. The exhibits will be very, very interesting, and I\u2019m enjoying it.\u201d\n\nJackson said he was also enjoying getting some rest after finishing the \u201cHobbit\u201d - although he wasn\u2019t entirely done, because he was still working on an extended version for DVD release.\n\nBut he said he was happy to take a break from new film projects for a while.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in five years that I haven\u2019t woken up in the morning and had deadlines\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 no phones ringing, screaming \u2018When are we going to see this? When are we going to do that?\u2019 And I\u2019d forgotten what that\u2019s like. So I\u2019ll let that last for a little bit longer before I destroy it.\u201d\n\nThe trilogy finale, \u201cThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,\u201d has so far earned $783 million in the U.S. and around the world after opening in most places in mid-December. To date, the trilogy has earned a total $2.76 billion at the box office.\n\n___\n\nFollow Nick Perry at www.twitter.com/nickgbperry", "article_metadata": {"description": "Director Peter Jackson said Wednesday he's putting his energy into helping launch a museum to commemorate World War I after finishing his \"Hobbit\" movie trilogy.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Director Peter Jackson said Wednesday he\u2019s putting his energy into helping launch a museum to commemorate World War I after finishing his \u201cHobbit\u201d movie trilogy.", "title": "Peter Jackson helping to open WWI museum after \u2018Hobbit\u2019 wrap", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/14/peter-jackson-helping-to-open-wwi-museum-after-hob/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/14/5f98a071433433026b0f6a706700ef8c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/14/5f98a071433433026b0f6a706700ef8c.jpg", "description": "Director Peter Jackson said Wednesday he's putting his energy into helping launch a museum to commemorate World War I after finishing his \"Hobbit\" movie trilogy.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Peter Jackson helping to open WWI museum after \u2018Hobbit\u2019 wr"}, "Author": "NICK PERRY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d16\"", "article_summary": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - Director Peter Jackson said Wednesday he\u2019s putting his energy into helping launch a museum to commemorate World War I after finishing his \u201cHobbit\u201d movie trilogy.\nHe said the plan for the Wellington museum was to open during April to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli battle.\nJackson is a World War I history buff who owns a number of planes from the era.\nJackson was speaking at his New Zealand post-production facility where he was helping host an event to promote the local film industry.\nHe said more galleries would be opened over the coming four years to mark other battles in which New Zealanders fought."}
