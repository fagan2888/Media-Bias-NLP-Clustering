Couldn\u2019t we at least do this little thing to stop people who are mentally ill, people who are criminals from purchasing guns?\u201d Reid asked plaintively on the Senate floor.\n\nThe answer probably is yes, that\u2019s too much to ask.\n\nRelated: Many U.S. mayors skeptical Charleston will inspire gun law changes\n\nAs Toomey and Manchin discovered two years ago, even the weakest version of fresh gun control legislation will not pass muster with the powerful National Rifle Association and its many allies on Capitol Hill. Truly tough gun measures, such as banning the sale of certain semi-automatic weapons and large magazines for bullets that are better used for military combat than hunting or civilian target practice, don\u2019t stand a chance \u2013 despite the success of other western countries in containing gun violence.\n\nAustralia, for example, banned automatic and semi-automatic weapons and instigated a gun buyback for high-powered and rapid fire rifles in 1996 shortly after a gunman killed 35 people and wounded 18 others in Port Arthur and has scored some impressive successes in curbing gun violence. A uniform system for registering and licensing firearms was introduced as part of the reforms.\n\nThe bipartisan compromise offered by Manchin and Toomey was a much scaled back version of a larger Senate bill on guns favored by Obama that would have mandated criminal background checks on all sales between private parties with few exceptions.\n\nRelated: South Carolina\u2019s Leaders Unite to Call for Removal of Confederate Flag\n\nCurrent law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers. The Manchin-Toomey amendment sought a middle ground by broadening the checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other.\n\nIn waging war on the Manchin-Toomey amendment in 2013, the NRA asserted that the amendment would have \u201ccriminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members\u201d to get government approval.\n\nRelated: Despite Setback, Manchin Vows to Press for Gun Control\n\nThe NRA and its chief executive officer Wayne LaPierre argued that ordinary school children like the ones in Newtown were entitled to the same protection from violent criminals as President Obama\u2019s two daughters were. If only school teachers and administrators were properly armed, he argued, then they would be better able to foil assaults on schools by deranged gunmen\u2014a comment repeated by an NRA board member in light of the Charleston murders.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s unlikely that the young white supremacist, would have been prevented from acquiri", "title": "Charleston Massacre May Rekindle Gun Control Debate", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/24/Charleston-Massacre-May-Rekindle-Gun-Control-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-01-19T154510Z_2_CBRE90I17KX00_RTROPTP_2_USA-GUNS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/24/Charleston-Massacre-May-Rekindle-Gun-Control-Debate", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-01-19T154510Z_2_CBRE90I17KX00_RTROPTP_2_USA-GUNS.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s unlikely that the young white supremacist, would have been prevented from acquiri", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out if there is something that could get the support of the 60 votes that we would need in the Senate,\u201d Toomey said.\ndeclared on Tuesday that something must be done to expand background checks.\nToomey, who is up for reelection next year and risks incurring the wrath of gun owners, and Manchin were honored last night for their work on behalf of gun control.\nHis father bought the gun for his troubled son to celebrate his 21st birthday in April, according to media reports.\nRelated: South Carolina\u2019s Leaders Unite to Call for Removal of Confederate FlagCurrent law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers."}
