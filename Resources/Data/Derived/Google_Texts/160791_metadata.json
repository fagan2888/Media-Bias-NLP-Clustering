But in the fascist pursuit of restricting your Second Amendment civil rights, the Post is desperately furthering a Big Lie about mass-shootings that even the New York Times refuses to spread.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nUsing biased sources and a definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d that is so wide open it includes gang fights and family disputes, the Post\u2019s Philip Bump re-published this Saturday: \u201cThe San Bernardino shooting continues a disturbing trend: No week since 2013 without a mass shooting.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not even close to the truth. The truth is four \u2014 four mass-shootings this year. Still four too many but a far cry from Bump\u2019s manufactured number.\n\nBump is not practicing journalism, he is practicing propaganda \u2014 propaganda so noxious and dishonest even the gun-grabbers at The New York Times felt the need to debunk it:\n\nOn Wednesday, a Washington Post article announced that \u201cThe San Bernardino shooting is the second mass shooting today and the 355th this year.\u201d Vox, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, this newspaper and others reported similar statistics. Grim details from the church in Charleston, a college classroom in Oregon and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado are still fresh, but you could be forgiven for wondering how you missed more than 300 other such attacks in 2015. At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four \u201cmass shootings\u201d this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.\n\nBump isn\u2019t only trying to take guns away from law-abiding citizens, he is playing Palace Guard for a White House desperate to distract from the fact that they have failed to keep the homefront safe.\n\nHey, maybe Bump\u2019s colleague, Chris Cillizza, can write another one of those columns crybabying over how terrible it is that the American public no longer trusts the media.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fact Check: Washington Post Spreads Debunked Mass-Shooting Stats", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Fact Check: Washington Post Spreads Debunked Mass-Shooting Stats", "title": "Fact Check: Washington Post Spreads Debunked Mass-Shooting Stats - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/GettyImages-469216474.jpg", "height": 2038}, "updated_time": "2015-12-05T08:03:31-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/12/05/fact-check-washington-post-spreads-debunked-mass-shooting-stats/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fact Check: Washington Post Spreads Debunked Mass-Shooting Stats", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/GettyImages-469216474.jpg", "title": "Fact Check: Washington Post Spreads Debunked Mass-Shooting Stats - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chris Cillizza, Mass Shooting, Media Bias, New York Times, Philip Bump, Washington Post,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-05T07:57:55-07:00", "section": "Big Journalism", "modified_time": "2015-12-05T08:03:31-07:00", "tag": "Washington Post", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have compiled an in-depth, open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings.\nBy our measure, there have been four \u201cmass shootings\u201d this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.\nBut in the fascist pursuit of restricting your Second Amendment civil rights, the Post is desperately furthering a Big Lie about mass-shootings that even the New York Times refuses to spread.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhen The New York Times is more honest about gun violence than you, that\u2019s when your integrity has gone off the deep end, which is where the leftwing Washington Post has practiced its dishonest tradecraft for quite some time now.\nHey, maybe Bump\u2019s colleague, Chris Cillizza, can write another one of those columns crybabying over how terrible it is that the American public no longer trusts the media."}
