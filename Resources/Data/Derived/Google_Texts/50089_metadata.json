If your company offers a self-insured health plan, such as Health Reimbursement Account or Healthcare Reimbursement Plan, with a plan year ending on or after October 1, 2012 and before October 1, 2019, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee may apply.\n\nQ. How Much is the PCORI Fee?\n\nA. The PCORI fee is tabulated as follows:\n\nPlan year ending October 1, 2013 \u2013 September 30, 2014: $2 multiplied by the average number of lives.\n\nPlan year ending October 1, 2014 \u2013 September 30, 2015: $2.08 multiplied by the average number of lives.\n\nQ.

The snapshot method. For policy years that end on or after October 1, 2012, but that began before May 14, 2012, issuers using the snapshot method may use counts from quarters beginning on or after May 14, 2012, to determine the average number of lives covered under the policy.

To adjust for 2012, issuers will use a pro rata approach for calculating the average number of lives covered using the member months method or the state form method for 2012. For example, issuers using the member months number for 2012 will divide the member months number by 12 and multiply the resulting number by one quarter to arrive at the average number of lives covered for October through December 2012.\n\nTip: If you use a health reimbursement software, such as ZaneHealth, look for IRS reporting tools in your online account.\n\nQ. Does Our Business Need to Submit IRS Form 720?\n\nA. If you owe a PCORI fee for 2014, it must be paid using IRS Form 720 by July 31, 2015.
