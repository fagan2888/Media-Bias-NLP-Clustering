The theocratic authors and the Republican Party sponsors of this bill are fully cognizant of the fact that the bill is unconstitutional, and thus it will, inevitably, be struck down by the courts.\n\nThe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is clear: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.\u201d It is the very basis of the separation of church and state.\n\nFor state Sen. Trip Pittman (R-AL), the constitution is a secondary concern. \u201cWe talk about the constitutionality of them, but we have to understand the purpose of these is the laws of God,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we think they may have passed irrelevance because of the constitutional question, but beyond that, which is the most important, it\u2019s also about behavior and conduct through the ages.\u201d\n\nState Rep. DuWayne Bridges (R-AL) declared, \u201cSchool shootings, patricide and matricide are due to the Ten Commandments not being displayed in schools and other government buildings.\u201d Bridges also said, \u201cThe Tenth Amendment [sic] was adopted before the people of Israel crossed the Red Sea because Moses didn\u2019t get to cross the Red Sea.\u201d\n\nWhile both Pittman and Bridges may sound like idiots, they\u2019re actually shrewd political strategists, for the promise of tax cuts for the rich is hardly an effective platform for rallying the Republican Party base in a midterm election year. The promise of the Ten Commandments, however, is how you get a person without healthcare to vote for the party whose platform is based on repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Alabama is the second most religious state in the nation with 74 percent of residents saying religion is very important in their lives. Number one is Mississippi. It is a pitiful irony that those states that are most religious are also states with the most individual suffering. More than 30 percent of the children in these two states suffer extreme poverty. In both states, the primary reason for abject poverty is that more than a third of children have parents who lack secure employment, decent wages, and healthcare. But thanks to Jesus, these poor saps vote for the party that rejects Medicaid expansion, opposes early education expansion, legislates larger cuts to education, and slashes food stamps to make room for oil and agriculture subsidies on top of tax cuts and loopholes for corporations and the wealthy.\n\nAll this despair comes courtesy of low-information voters being duped by the corporate elite to vote against their own economic self-interest. The corporate elite and their political appointees have convinced tens of millions of Americans that a vote for the Ten Commandments is more important to a Christian\u2019s needs than a vote against cuts in education spending, food stamp reductions, the elimination of school lunches and the abolition of healthcare programs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you want to know why nine out of the 10 poorest states are located in the hyper-religious South, look no further", "title": "Bible barons: How the GOP uses religion to keep voters captive to corporate ideology", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If you want to know why nine out of the 10 poorest states are located in the hyper-religious South, look no further", "title": "Bible barons: How the GOP uses religion to keep voters captive to corporate ideology", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/04/bible_barons_how_the_gop_uses_religion_to_keep_voters_captive_to_corporate_ideology_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/huckabee_bachmann1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you want to know why nine out of the 10 poorest states are located in the hyper-religious South, look no further", "title": "Bible barons: How the GOP uses religion to keep voters captive to corporate ideology", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/huckabee_bachmann1.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "CJ Werleman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Christian Fundamentalism, Conservatism, Religious Right, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd111\"", "article_summary": "According to the Pew Research Center, Alabama is the second most religious state in the nation with 74 percent of residents saying religion is very important in their lives.\nIf passed by the state Senate and signed by the governor, the state would put a constitutional amendment on the next ballot to let Alabama voters decide the issue.\nAll this despair comes courtesy of low-information voters being duped by the corporate elite to vote against their own economic self-interest.\nThe theocratic authors and the Republican Party sponsors of this bill are fully cognizant of the fact that the bill is unconstitutional, and thus it will, inevitably, be struck down by the courts.\nIt is a pitiful irony that those states that are most religious are also states with the most individual suffering."}
