(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nUpdated September 7, 2015, 5:00 pm\n\nPresident Obama announced an executive order requiring paid sick leave for more than 300,000 employees of federal contractors Monday morning.\n\nThe announcement came during remarks at the annual Labor Day breakfast in Boston hosted by the Greater Boston Labor Council.\n\nDespite his order, Obama says 44 million American still won\u2019t have the benefit, and he\u2019s calling on Congress to change that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on Congress, take a cue from the rest of the world,\u201d Obama said to the breakfast crowd at the Park Plaza Hotel. \u201cMake paid family and medical leave a reality for all Americans.\u201d\n\nPOTUS: We are the only advanced nation on earth that does not guarantee paid maternity leave. \u2014 Sim\u00f3n R\u00edos (@simonfrios) September 7, 2015\n\nObama says Republicans who stand in the way of helping workers have been wrecking the economy for \u201ca long, long time.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans oppose the idea of forcing companies to implement paid sick leave. Mass. GOP spokesman Terry MacCormack would not comment on earned sick time, but he faulted the president for not discussing cost increases under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that President Obama today chose not to address a real hit to Massachusetts families, and especially union households, and that\u2019s the disastrous Obamacare tax on employer provided health plans,\u201d MacCormack told WBUR\u2019s Sim\u00f3n Rios.\n\nAt the breakfast, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former labor leader, praised the labor movement, but said it can still do more for workers.\n\n\u201cWe need a labor movement that helped lead the civil rights movement in the \u201960s. Instead we see some unions not doing enough to bring persons of color and women into their ranks,\u201d Walsh said. \u201c\u2026Men and women can and must earn equal pay for equal work.\u201d\n\nSome union workers used the day to voice concerns about job protection.\n\nEarlier Monday morning, hundreds of MBTA workers protested in front of the Plaza over plans to privatize some T services.\n\n@MBTA workers protest privatization on Labor Day in Boston. pic.twitter.com/0Wa2gokUnz \u2014 Sim\u00f3n R\u00edos (@simonfrios) September 7, 2015\n\nSteve Tolman, the president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, was with the protesters Monday morning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this scheme, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, they always want to try to privatize services, and when we do that we lose the continuity of public services,\u201d Tolman said. \u201cIt seems sometimes profits over people take place.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Marc Pacheco reprimanded his colleagues who voted to suspend the anti-privatization law that bears his name.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t there to see the inside deals,\u201d he said to the group of protesters. \u201cThey weren\u2019t there to see the no bid contracts handed out, so they need to be educated.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by WBUR\u2019s Sim\u00f3n Rios\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified the number of employees the executive order would affect. We regret the error.\n\nRelated:\n\nStory continues below\n\nMost Popular Expand", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama spoke at Boston's annual Labor Day breakfast, where he announced an executive order requiring paid sick leave for more than 3,000 employees of federal contractors.", "og": {"site_name": "wbur", "description": "Obama spoke at Boston's annual Labor Day breakfast, where he announced an executive order requiring paid sick leave for more than 3,000 employees of federal contractors.", "title": "Obama Announces Executive Order For Paid Sick Leave At Boston Breakfast", "url": "http://www.wbur.org/2015/09/07/obama-labor-day", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2015/09/AP_927192642185-620x413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wbur.org/2015/09/07/obama-labor-day", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2015/09/AP_927192642185-620x413.jpg", "site": "@wbur", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Announces Executive Order For Paid Sick Leave At Boston Breakfast"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-09-07", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1daf\"", "article_summary": "The announcement came during remarks at the annual Labor Day breakfast in Boston hosted by the Greater Boston Labor Council.\nPresident Obama speaks at the Greater Boston Labor Council Labor Day Breakfast Monday.\n(Andrew Harnik/AP)Updated September 7, 2015, 5:00 pmPresident Obama announced an executive order requiring paid sick leave for more than 300,000 employees of federal contractors Monday morning.\n\u201cMake paid family and medical leave a reality for all Americans.\u201dPOTUS: We are the only advanced nation on earth that does not guarantee paid maternity leave.\nAt the breakfast, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former labor leader, praised the labor movement, but said it can still do more for workers."}
