Providing retroactive pay may cost more than $6 billion, according to the Independent Budget Office, a city-funded fiscal monitor.\n\nAn $8 billion federal Medicaid waiver announced two weeks ago may help HHC weather its fiscal storm, de Blasio said when he presented his first budget on Feb. 12. The waiver will allow New York to restructure its health-care system, de Blasio said. About 80 percent of HHC\u2019s patients are on Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, or are uninsured, according to HHC.\n\nCutting Staff\n\nThe agency\u2019s deficit is growing even after it cut 3,700 positions, mostly through attrition, and restructured operations, saving $600 million annually. HHC, which has an $8 billion budget and operates 11 acute-care hospitals, received $600 million in city and federal funds to close a $1.2 billion deficit in the fiscal year that ended June 30.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government will reduce supplemental Medicaid and Medicare funding to HHC for poor patients. Those cuts could reduce the hospital corporation\u2019s federal funding by more than $325 million annually, Aviles said last month. Federal reimbursements also haven\u2019t made up $142 million in costs resulting from Hurricane Sandy, Aviles said.\n\nSince 2008, HHC has lost more than $540 million a year because of cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates. Pension and employee health-care costs have increased by $680 million since July 1, 2001, Aviles said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Martin Z.
