Paul LePage\u2019s proposal to take $10 million a year in tobacco settlement money from the Fund for a Healthy Maine and shift it to primary care doctors.\n\nWhile the Fund for a Healthy Maine pays for several public health efforts \u2013 including anti-obesity, substance abuse and child care \u2013 critics said LePage\u2019s plan would have a particularly devastating effect on anti-smoking programs.\n\nMaine DHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew says primary care physicians are in the best position to make anti-smoking programs work. 2014 Press Herald file/Kevin Bennett Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s budget would result in direct cuts of about $4 million from anti-smoking programs paid for by the Fund for a Healthy Maine. 2014 Press Herald file/Amelia Kunhardt Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nRepresenting the American Lung Association, MaineHealth, the Maine Public Health Association and other prominent health industry backers, Healthy Maine supporters held a news conference and testified at a public hearing before the Legislature\u2019s appropriations and health and human services committees.\n\nLePage\u2019s 2016-18 biennial state budget would redirect $10 million a year from the Fund for a Healthy Maine to maintain reimbursement rates for primary care physicians under MaineCare, the state\u2019s version of the federal Medicaid program. Federal reimbursement rates are scheduled to decline next year for many MaineCare physicians under a sunset provision in the Affordable Care Act, but the administration\u2019s budget proposes keeping the rates steady by tapping into Healthy Maine.\n\nBut health care advocates say the budget sets up a \u201cfalse choice,\u201d and they accuse the state of raiding Healthy Maine, which is funded from the 1998 settlement with tobacco companies.\n\n\u201cThe two issues are minimally connected,\u201d said Dr. Stephen DiGiovanni, a pediatrician at Maine Medical Center\u2019s outpatient clinics. \u201cYou need a smoking cessation and prevention message coming from a variety of different sources, from parents, the schools, at parks, where you live, not just from your doctor.\u201d\n\nMAYHEW: NEW APPROACH NEEDED\n\nBut Mary Mayhew, commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the Healthy Maine programs have not worked to deter smoking. She said that Maine has spent the seventh highest amount nationally on tobacco control and prevention programs since 1993, yet its smoking rate among adults stands at 19 percent \u2013 only 1 percent lower than the national average.\n\n\u201cWe have to try a different approach,\u201d said Mayhew, noting that MaineCare patients are more likely to be smokers than those with private insurance.\n\nBut adult smoking in Maine has declined from 29 percent to 19 percent since 1997, according to the Partnership for a Tobacco-Free Maine, and Healthy Maine advocates say youth smoking has been cut in half since the early 2000s in response to a variety of strategies, including grass-roots education, targeted advertising in schools and other locations and campaigns to ban smoking in public buildings and parks.\n\nMayhew maintains that concentrating anti-tobacco efforts at the primary care level will reap benefits.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely supporting an individualized approach to the funds. We believe early screening, identification and prevention with a primary care provider is going to have a significant impact,\u201d she said.\n\nThere would be no specific state effort to promote anti-smoking messages at doctor\u2019s offices, but reimbursing primary care doctors at reasonable rates would give physicians the time with patients to develop such strategies, DHHS spokesman David Sorensen said.\n\n\u201cSeveral studies have shown that anti-smoking intervention is one of the most effective things primary care providers do,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nSCHOOL CLINICS COULD FEEL PINCH\n\nMaine has spent roughly $12 million annually on smoking cessation and prevention in recent years, according to state budget figures. The proposed $10 million-per-year cut from Fund for a Healthy Maine includes a $4 million annual reduction in direct anti-smoking programs, as well as cutbacks in others that have anti-smoking components.\n\nDiGiovanni, the MMC pediatrician, said the school clinics \u2013 which are partially supported by Healthy Maine money \u2013 would be particularly affected. They not only provide anti-smoking messages, he said, but they also bring primary care to students.\n\n\u201cIt would be a catastrophe if those went away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a mini primary care clinic inside each school. They are very effective.\u201d\n\nSeveral high school students testified that the school clinics have helped them recover from various ailments.\n\nMaine receives about $50 million per year in tobacco settlement money, although more than half of that is spent on a number of health initiatives \u2013 such as anti-obesity and substance abuse programs \u2013 or diverted to other government spending unrelated to health care.\n\nEd Miller, senior vice president of public policy for the Northeast region of the American Lung Association, said Maine has shifted resources away from anti-tobacco programs since 2010, but LePage\u2019s latest proposal would decimate the efforts.\n\n\u201cThis would gut what\u2019s left of the whole smoking cessation infrastructure. It would essentially end the program,\u201d said Miller, who is proposing an increase in Maine\u2019s $2 per pack cigarette tax to preserve the Healthy Maine fund.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The critics say that shifting $10 million a year to maintain MaineCare reimbursement rates for primary care doctors would hobble the state's anti-smoking efforts.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The critics say that shifting $10 million a year to maintain MaineCare reimbursement rates for primary care doctors would hobble the state's anti-smoking efforts.", "title": "Public health advocates blast LePage plan to redirect tobacco settlement money - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 880, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/597815_386547-smoking-e1425378560724.jpg", "height": 592}, "updated_time": "2015-03-03T09:38:09-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/03/02/public-health-advocates-blast-lepage-plan-to-redirect-tobacco-settlement-money/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The critics say that shifting $10 million a year to maintain MaineCare reimbursement rates for primary care doctors would hobble the state's anti-smoking efforts.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/597815_386547-smoking-e1425378560724.jpg", "title": "Public health advocates blast LePage plan to redirect tobacco settlement money - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2015-03-02T17:47:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-03T09:38:09-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc747\"", "article_summary": "DiGiovanni, the MMC pediatrician, said the school clinics \u2013 which are partially supported by Healthy Maine money \u2013 would be particularly affected.\nAUGUSTA \u2014 Health care advocates packed a State House hearing Monday to protest Gov.\nIt would essentially end the program,\u201d said Miller, who is proposing an increase in Maine\u2019s $2 per pack cigarette tax to preserve the Healthy Maine fund.\nBut health care advocates say the budget sets up a \u201cfalse choice,\u201d and they accuse the state of raiding Healthy Maine, which is funded from the 1998 settlement with tobacco companies.\nWe believe early screening, identification and prevention with a primary care provider is going to have a significant impact,\u201d she said."}
