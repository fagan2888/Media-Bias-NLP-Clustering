We\u2019re seeing a rise in guns being available in our streets.\u201d\n\nCommunity members gathered at the church for a panel discussion on ways to stop the violence. The talk comes after two incidents where five teenagers were shot.\n\nFour people, all under 20 years old, were hit with bullets behind the church Jan. 28.\n\nNyreek Horne, 12, remains in critical condition at Vidant Medical Center in Greenville. He was the youngest victim. The other victims were ages 13, 17 and 19.\n\nShyheim Collins, 17, was charged with four counts of attempted murder in the incident.\n\nThe shootings came less than two weeks after Brian Freeman, 15, was gunned down Jan. 18 while walking home with a friend on East Highland Avenue. The shots were fired from a passing car.\n\nNo arrests have been made in his killing.\n\nThe recent violence highlights issues bigger than personal disputes or access to guns, said Kenard Johnson, a classmate of Collins at Rocky Mount High School who believes he was framed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re around a lot of poverty where we live,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lack of money in the homes and it\u2019s a lack of fathers.\u201d\n\nSeveral potential answers were discussed, including improving the economy and lowering the unemployment rate as well as increasing parental involvement and hope among young people.\n\n\u201cWe have to now come together as a community and really come up with some solutions where everybody is bringing a piece of the puzzle together,\u201d Gailliard said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-02-17 22:34:00", "description": "Hundreds gathered at Word Tabernacle Church in Rocky Mount Monday night in search of answers after five teens were shot in recent weeks.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-02-18 05:25:48", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13403635|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds gathered at Word Tabernacle Church in Rocky Mount Monday night in search of answers after five teens were shot in recent weeks.", "title": "Rocky Mount searches for youth violence answers after five teens shot :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/rocky-mount-searches-for-youth-violence-answers-after-five-teens-shot/13403635/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/02/17/13403699/13403700-1392750951-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-17T22:34:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Hundreds gathered at Word Tabernacle Church in Rocky Mount Monday night in search of answers after five teens were shot in recent weeks.", "title": "Rocky Mount searches for youth violence answers after five teens shot :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/rocky-mount-searches-for-youth-violence-answers-after-five-teens-shot/13403635/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/02/17/13403699/1392750892-crowd-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing violence in general.\nFour people, all under 20 years old, were hit with bullets behind the church Jan. 28.\nThe recent violence highlights issues bigger than personal disputes or access to guns, said Kenard Johnson, a classmate of Collins at Rocky Mount High School who believes he was framed.\nThey wanted to know why four teenagers were shot on the basketball court behind the church last month.\nThey wanted to know why youth violence is increasing in their community."}
