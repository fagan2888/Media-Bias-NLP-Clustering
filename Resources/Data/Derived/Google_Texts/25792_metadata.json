In his current incarnation as Florida\u2019s governor, he feels he\u2019s too ideologically pure to accept federal money that might help the citizens of his state. Sure, he reversed himself after first coming out against Medicaid expansion (with the feds paying full freight), but that\u2019s only because he\u2019s facing re-election. Fortunately, the Legislature saved his bacon with the anti-Obamacare types by refusing the Washington money \u2014 so a potentially embarrassing bill never had to cross his desk. We know where his heart is, even if you need an electron microscope to find it.\n\nLooking at Scott, you begin to discern a pattern, starting with his insistence that anyone receiving government aid be required to take a drug test \u2014 at the person\u2019s own expense if the results were positive. That blew up in his face \u2014 not only was the program ridiculously expensive in a time of belt-tightening, it revealed that those receiving welfare had a lower incidence of drug use than the general population. Maybe that\u2019s because the poor have less disposable income to spend on recreational activities than the rest of us.
