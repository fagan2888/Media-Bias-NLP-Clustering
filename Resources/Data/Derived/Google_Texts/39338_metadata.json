The deal allegedly delivers profits of 200 percent to a Russian engine maker with ties to its government.\n\nArizona Sen. John McCain on Friday made these claims in a letter to U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Kendall outlining flaws in the accounting and acquisition strategies of the RD-180 engine.\n\nSpace Exploration Technologies Corp, known as SpaceX, filed the original lawsuit in April with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, accusing the Air Force of illegally blocking competition by giving a monopoly to the Centennial-based United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. United Launch Services is a ULA subsidiary.\n\nThe company had a temporary victory when Judge Susan Braden issued an injunction to halt the government\u2019s purchase of RD-180 engines, which ULA relies on to power its popular Atlas V rocket. But she lifted the ban after several federal agencies assured her that the sale of the engines would not violate the U.S. sanctions against Russia related to conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe heart of SpaceX\u2019s complaint is the concept of competition, but the company has gained better political traction by latching onto the Russian engine issue.\n\nSpaceX is now taking up several of McCain\u2019s points, namely the price ULA pays to RD Amross, a U.S. subsidiary of the engine\u2019s Russian manufacturer NPO Energomash.\n\n\u201cVery little information is publicly available on the actual costs to build the Russian RD-180 engine compared to what ULA pays for them. But, I am aware of claims that the engines have been sold by NPO Energomash to RD Amross at a much lower price than RD Amross charges ULA for them,\u201d McCain wrote.\n\nSpaceX reiterated this concept in Wednesday\u2019s court filing, stating, \u201cHad the Air Force conducted a rational cost and price analysis as required by law, it would have realized that the sole source pricing charged by ULA included exorbitant profits for ULA\u2019s Russian supplier at the expense of the American public.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force entered into a block-buy contract with ULA in December for the purchase of 36 rocket cores over five years \u2014 a deal worth $9.5 billion. A year earlier, the Air Force said it would competitively bid out 14 additional launch contracts for missions between 2017 and 2019. But in March, it was announced that number may be cut to seven.\n\nMilitary satellite launches, which have an estimated value of $70 billion through 2030, make up the fourth-largest program in the federal defense budget, but competition could save taxpayers more than $1 billion a year, according to SpaceX founder billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nGen. William Shelton, head of Air Force Space Command, defended the Air Force\u2019s decision at a large industry gathering in Colorado Springs in May, saying the Air Force allocated $60 million and 100 people to work on certifying SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to pick up the pace on that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just takes time, it takes money, it takes people.\u201d\n\nKristen Leigh Painter: 303-954-1638, kpainter@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kristenpainter", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "SpaceX files to include McCain claims in lawsuit over Russian rockets", "title": "SpaceX files to include McCain claims in lawsuit over Russian rockets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/26/spacex-files-to-include-mccain-claims-in-lawsuit-over-russian-rockets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140626_110659_SpaceX.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140626_110659_SpaceX.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-26T17:54:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:21:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaead\"", "article_summary": "Gen.
