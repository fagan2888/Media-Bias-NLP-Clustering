Democracy can\u2019t be just for billionaires and corporations.\u201d\n\nShe added that, \u201cRepublicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.\u201d\n\nSo when Millennials are asked which presidential candidate has received the most money from four top financial firms, students predictably selected Republicans.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump getting some money from one of these boys,\u201d one Millennial responded, \u201cTrump for sure,\u201d said another.\n\nHowever, when it was revealed that Hillary was the top recipient of Wall Street cash, students were immediately befuddled. Since 1999, Hillary has banked $782,327 from Citigroup Inc, $711,490 from Goldman Sachs, $620,030 from JPMorgan Chase & Co, and $543,065 from Morgan Stanley\u2014compared Goldman Sachs\u2019s mere $82,900 to Ted Cruz and $93,722 in contributions to Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cI just kind of figured, big banks, ya know\u2014always going with the Republicans.\u201d\n\n\"I don\u2019t vote for hypocrites\u201d another student said. \u201cNot voting for Hillary.\u201d\n\nSo what do young people think of a candidate criticizing Wall Street, then soliciting them for millions of dollars in campaign funds?
