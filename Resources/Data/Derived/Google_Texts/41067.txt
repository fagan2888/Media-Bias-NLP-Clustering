Kanya Sesser is a model, surfer, snowboarder, motivational speaker, and a soon-to-be published author. Achieving all of that before the age of 24 is pretty impressive. Doing it before the age of 24 with no legs, however, perfectly illustrates how Sesser lives her life: “no legs, no limits.”

“I love showing people what beauty can look like,” Sasser told the NY Daily News. “These images show my strength.”

The self-described California girl has let very little hold her back after being adopted from an orphanage in Thailand at the age of 5. When she’s not signing modeling contracts with some of the biggest names in the sports apparel industry, including Nike, Billabong, and Rip Curl Girl, she’s training for the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
