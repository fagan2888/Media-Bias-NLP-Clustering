Shelley Moore Capito voted Friday for the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, a bill that repeals Obamacare, while Sen. Joe Manchin voted against the bill.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve a health care system that works for them and Obamacare is not it. I have consistently voted to repeal and replace this disastrous health care law, and I am glad that a repeal bill will finally reach the president\u2019s desk,\u2019 Capito said in a statement. \u201cThis legislation will enable us to revisit the problems caused by Obamacare and replace them with reforms that provide quality, affordable care for all Americans.\u201d\n\nManchin favored changes to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but not a full repeal.\n\n\u201cI have always said that this law is not perfect but we need to repair, not repeal it. It\u2019s reckless to repeal a law when, before it, we spent more than any other country on health care but still ranked only 43rd in the world in health and wellness,\u201d Manchin said in his release.\n\n\u201cIn 2015 alone, more than 29,000 West Virginians enrolled in health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange. Nationally, 11.7 million people signed up. According to one study, West Virginia has benefited more than any other state in the country except New York under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senators voted Friday on the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which aims to repeal Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Senators voted Friday on the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which aims to repeal Obamacare.", "title": "Capito, Manchin vote opposite ways on bill to repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2015/12/03/capito-manchin-vote-opposite-ways-on-bill-to-repeal-obamacare/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/metronews/images/metronews-default-color.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-04T03:01:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T05:16:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "I have consistently voted to repeal and replace this disastrous health care law, and I am glad that a repeal bill will finally reach the president\u2019s desk,\u2019 Capito said in a statement.\n\u201cThis legislation will enable us to revisit the problems caused by Obamacare and replace them with reforms that provide quality, affordable care for all Americans.\u201dManchin favored changes to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but not a full repeal.\nAccording to one study, West Virginia has benefited more than any other state in the country except New York under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\u201cAmericans deserve a health care system that works for them and Obamacare is not it.\n\u201cIn 2015 alone, more than 29,000 West Virginians enrolled in health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchange."}
