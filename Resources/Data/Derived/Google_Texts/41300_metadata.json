Yet a University of Arizona study found that the mostly Latino students who took the courses were 46 percent to 150 percent more likely to graduate from high school than those who did not. The study also determined positive effects on math and reading test scores. An independent audit of the curriculum confirmed that taking the courses helped students succeed in school. All good teachers build a bridge between what students know and what they need to learn. Yet teaching that embraces students' cultural backgrounds has largely been left out of current debates on what makes teachers effective. The drama in Tucson helps explain why: Culturally responsive teaching often requires confronting some of the most painful divides in American life.\n\n\"Basically, it's about effective teaching, but it takes into consideration the changing demographics of America's schools,\" says Jacqueline Jordan Irvine, professor emeritus of urban education at Atlanta's Emory University. Today, 63 percent of students in the Tucson Unified School District are Latino, up from 49 percent just a decade ago. Demographic changes have made it increasingly likely that a teacher's experiences don't mirror those of her students. In 2007-08, 83 percent of public school teachers were white, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. During that same year, the demographic breakdown showed a different percentage for public school students: 56 percent white; 21 percent Hispanic; 17 percent African-American, 5 percent Asian, and 1 percent Native American. \"If you don't know anything about the everyday lived experiences of your students\u2014the cultural backgrounds, the dialects, the family, the home, the community\u2014teachers tend to pull the examples for teaching from their own experiences,\" Irvine says. \"And, hence, those connections are not made for students.\" Culturally responsive pedagogy starts with the premise that race and class matter, and that some schools fail to send diverse students signals that they belong. To make sure all students feel valued, the theory goes, teachers need to be aware of their own biases, work deeply to understand their individual students, find ways to bring students' heritage and community into the classroom, and hold all students to a high academic standard. It's a philosophy that makes intuitive sense, and that's backed by a range of academic studies. But it requires subtlety. Learning about students' cultural backgrounds is an ongoing process that lasts a teacher's entire career, beginning all over again each year with a new set of students. \"It's really important to be really immersed in that local context to be able to culturally responsive. And I think that that's messy work, and it's really hard to quantify, but nevertheless vital,\" says Jason Irizarry, an associate education professor and director of urban education at the University of Massachusetts (Amherst).", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the public-school population grows increasingly diverse, creating a link between home and school becomes more and more important.", "author": "Sophie Quinton", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "As the public-school population grows increasingly diverse, creating a link between home and school becomes more and more important.", "title": "Good Teachers Embrace Their Students' Cultural Backgrounds", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/RTR3FDAU/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/good-teachers-embrace-their-students-cultural-backgrounds/281337/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb177\"", "article_summary": "Yet teaching that embraces students' cultural backgrounds has largely been left out of current debates on what makes teachers effective.\nLearning about students' cultural backgrounds is an ongoing process that lasts a teacher's entire career, beginning all over again each year with a new set of students.\nIn 2007-08, 83 percent of public school teachers were white, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\nAll good teachers build a bridge between what students know and what they need to learn.\nDuring that same year, the demographic breakdown showed a different percentage for public school students: 56 percent white; 21 percent Hispanic; 17 percent African-American, 5 percent Asian, and 1 percent Native American."}
