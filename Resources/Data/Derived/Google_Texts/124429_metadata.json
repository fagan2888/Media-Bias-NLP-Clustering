Basic economics teaches us that if you subsidize something, you get more of it, and if you tax something, you get less of it.\n\nYet, the Obama administration has continually subsidized unemployment through endlessly extending unemployment insurance benefits, resulting in unusually high and lengthy levels of unemployment. Meanwhile, the administration raised personal income tax rates on our most productive earners, seriously retarding economic growth and suppressing investments in small business\u2014the very business that employ the majority of Americans and fuel economic growth.\n\nYet, I\u2019m supposed to be up in arms over a Brazilian-owned company merging with a Canadian company and moving their corporate headquarters to Canada (while still paying U.S. corporate income taxes)?\n\nIf liberals don\u2019t want U.S. companies moving overseas, they should concentrate on international tax competition, not chastising publicly traded corporations for upholding their fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of their shareholders by relocating to more economically friendly environments.\n\nCheck Out the 1980s, Dude One needs look no further than the tax competition in the 1980s and 1990s for evidence of the economic benefits of tax competition.\n\nIn 1991, Michigan was in dire straits. Its economy was in free-fall and deficits were predicted for the foreseeable future. But Michigan Gov. John Engler, a free-market proponent, was convinced that tax competition was the answer. The governor proceeded to cut taxes 30 times during the 1990s, providing a vastly improved economic environment for businesses and people alike.\n\nThe results were overwhelming. Between 1990 and 1996, unemployment in the state fell from 11 percent to 4.5 percent. The state budget went from $2 billion in the red in 1990 to a $1.1 billion surplus in 1996\u2014the third largest in the country.\n\nThe correlation between a competitive tax regime and economic success continued in other states throughout the 1990s. For example, the ten states that significantly cut taxes during the \u201890s grew their economies nearly 25 percent faster than tax-raising states. Further, income for a family of four grew by $1,600 more in tax-cutting states than in tax-raising states.\n\nThe same held true for global tax competition in the 1980s. Following the Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher tax cuts of the early \u201880s, many other nations of the industrialized world felt they had no choice but to cut their tax rates as well in order to remain competitive The end result was the worldwide economic boom of the 1980s.\n\nMost reasonable people would conclude that tax competition is the key to America\u2019s success in the global economy. But very few people would confuse our politicians in Washington with reasonable people. So, instead we get hysterical attacks on corporations making reasonable economic decisions to benefit their employees and shareholders.\n\nForget holding the pickles and onions, these folks should be \u201cholding\u201d their righteous indignation and concentrate on lowering our corporate and personal tax rates.\n\nNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to turn off my South Korean-made flatscreen TV, hop in my German-made car, and head to the local Burger King for a Whopper.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 04 Sep 2014 07:37:58 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Instead, do something: Make America\u2019s tax rates and business climate competitive again.", "title": "Stop Complaining About Businesses Moving Abroad", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3494823614_56d87d260f_b.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/09/04/stop-complaining-about-businesses-moving-abroad/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Instead, do something: Make America\u2019s tax rates and business climate competitive again.", "creator": "@FDRLST", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3494823614_56d87d260f_b.jpg"}, "title": "Stop Complaining About Businesses Moving Abroad", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "competitive taxation,Corporate Inversions,Corporate Taxes,corproate tax rates,Margaret Thatcher,moving jobs overseas,offshoring jobs,Ronald Reagan,tax rates", "published_time": "2014-09-04T07:37:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Instead, do something: Make America\u2019s tax rates and business climate competitive again."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40e6\"", "article_summary": "So, instead we get hysterical attacks on corporations making reasonable economic decisions to benefit their employees and shareholders.\nCheck Out the 1980s, Dude One needs look no further than the tax competition in the 1980s and 1990s for evidence of the economic benefits of tax competition.\nYet, I\u2019m supposed to be up in arms over a Brazilian-owned company merging with a Canadian company and moving their corporate headquarters to Canada (while still paying U.S. corporate income taxes)?\nInstead, do something: Make America\u2019s tax rates and business climate competitive again.\nJohn Engler, a free-market proponent, was convinced that tax competition was the answer."}
