Sunset St., with enthusiasm to match the cooperating weather. Coffee, orange juice and donuts were provided to fuel their labors.\n\nThose pitching in were urged to choose a park, bike path, street, alley, open space or a section of the St. Vrain Greenway to spruce up. For those undecided, an area can be assigned to individuals or a group.\n\nAt Price Park, one volunteer was seen even picking up shards of broken Easter eggs left over from recent festivities there.\n\nFor information on the ongoing campaign, contact Lore Blattner at 303-651-8955 or email lore.blattner@ci.longmont.co.us.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27895159/longmonts-clean-up-green-up-boosted-by-blue", "modificationDate": "2015-04-11T17:40:54-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0411/20150411__12tcastaw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Times-Call staff \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Longmont's Clean Up, Green Up campaign celebrated 20 years today with a launch of this year's annual beautification initiative under sunny skies.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27895159:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-11T14:30:37-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27895159/longmonts-clean-up-green-up-boosted-by-blue", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0411/20150411__12tcastaw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Longmont's Clean Up, Green Up campaign celebrated 20 years today with a launch of this year's annual beautification initiative under sunny skies.", "title": "Longmont's Clean Up, Green Up boosted by blue skies, big turnout"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Longmont's Clean Up, Green Up campaign celebrated 20 years today with a launch of this year's annual beautification initiative under sunny skies.", "title": "Longmont's Clean Up, Green Up boosted by blue skies, big turnout", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27895159/longmonts-clean-up-green-up-boosted-by-blue", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0411/20150411__12tcastaw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-11T14:30:37-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-04-11T14:30:37-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont's Clean Up, Green Up boosted by blue skies, big turnout", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Times-Call staffStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0411/20150411__12tcastaw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-04-11T14:34:09-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb62\"", "article_summary": "At Price Park, one volunteer was seen even picking up shards of broken Easter eggs left over from recent festivities there.\nNot even broken Easter eggs escape volunteers' scrutinyFred Schulerud picks up trash and recyclables in Price Park in Longmont on Saturday morning.\n( David R.
