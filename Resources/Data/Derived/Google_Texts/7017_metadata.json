He forages for edible plants in the Mendocino coast to supplement his diet. ( Farida Jhabvala Romero/KQED )\n\nEvery Tuesday, the Mendocino Presbyterian Church offers free meals and showers to homeless locals. On this particular Tuesday, 30 or so visitors emerge from a church building carrying paper plates with scrambled eggs, pickles and bags of potato chips.\n\nThe once-a-week meal is welcome to regulars like Darion, who calls himself \u201cBlackbird\u201d and declined to give his last name.\n\nUnlike homeless people in urban areas with more options for meal programs and shelters, Blackbird has a very limited number of soup kitchens and other services nearby. Only the Mendocino Coast Hospitality Center in Fort Bragg, 10 miles up the road on Highway 1, offers daily breakfasts and dinners. Clients at the Fort Bragg Food Bank may pick up food bags just once per week.\n\nSo Blackbird turns to the wild to supplement his diet \u2014 he forages edible plants and wild eggs in the headlands near the town of Mendocino.\n\n\u201cWhen I am hungry and I don\u2019t have any money or no means of making food, I can always walk around and make a stew or a salad out of all the different plants,\u201d he says. He has been living out of his backpack for 15 years and carries pots and pans to cook the food he gathers.\n\nBlackbird lists boysenberries, peaches, apples and garlic as some of the plants he relies on.\n\nHe wanders off a trail and stops by a plant he recognizes \u2014 wild radish. He carefully picks a seed pod and munches on it. The radish grows underground.\n\nBlackbird learned about foraging after he graduated from high school and left his family and started a nomadic life that he calls traveling \u2014 living without a regular residence.\n\nHe says he wanted to get away from the people that fed his years-long methamphetamine addiction in San Luis Obispo. \u201cI had to get away from my dealer and friends there,\u201d he says.\n\nNow 33, he says he shuns fast food and avoids anything with additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) if labeling is visible. He has ample time to forage, but the amount of food he can collect is still not enough to sustain himself. So, to the dismay of some local business owners, he heads to local dumpsters and digs for food on a regular basis as well.\n\n\u201cA lot of businesses throw food [away] that\u2019s not even bad yet, and you can just jump in there and eat it,\u201d he says, adding that this is just part of his choice of lifestyle, just like living without a steady home or job. \u201cI proved to myself that you don\u2019t need money to live.\u201d\n\nBlackbird\u2019s friend Evan Singer, 28, who used to be homeless, says he also learned to pick edible plants as a way to survive.\n\n\u201cI can eat three different things I\u2019m looking at right now,\u201d said Singer, as he gazed at the bushes by the trail leading to an ocean bluff. \u201cEven if you are homeless this is the best place to be. Because I\u2019ve been places where I didn\u2019t eat for weeks, eating food off the ground in alleys, and now I\u2019m in the redwoods looking at blooming flowers.\u201d\n\nThe Northern California coast\u2019s temperate weather is a big plus for homeless people here, estimated at about 1,000 by county officials. But Susan Holli, a board member of the Mendocino County Homeless Services Continuum of Care, says that estimate is low. She believes the real number is triple that \u2014 with many living along the coast, mostly in the towns of Mendocino and Fort Bragg.\n\n\u201cThe density of homelessness is very high here,\u201d said Holli, noting that Fort Bragg and Mendocino\u2019s combined total population is about 8,200. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have enough resources.\u201d\n\nMendocino County has one of the highest poverty rates in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Finding healthy food on a regular basis can be tough for low-income residents in more remote communities such as Laytonville and Gualala. Fewer grocery stores exist there when compared to Ukiah, the county seat, or Fort Bragg.\n\nHousing is even more challenging, Holli says. Along the 140 mile coastline only one 24-bed shelter is open, the Hospitality Center in Fort Bragg, and low income residents must compete for those spaces.\n\n\u201c(Mendocino) is a very pleasant place to live if you have enough to live on,\u201d said Laura Welter, executive director at Safe Passage Family Resource Center in Fort Bragg. \u201cIf not, it\u2019s really hard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Being homeless in rural California has both similar -- and distinct -- challenges than people in cities face.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Homeless in Mendocino and Foraging for Food\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/08\\/11\\/homeless-in-mendocino-and-foraging-for-food\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-11 14:35:02\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-08-11 17:06:58\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":59885,\"author_id\":\"8659\",\"author_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"author_display_name\":\"Farida Jhabvala Romero\",\"tags\":[\"Homeless\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/08\\/RS16315_IMG_3678.JPG-qut.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Being homeless in rural California has both similar -- and distinct -- challenges than people in cities face.", "title": "Homeless in Mendocino and Foraging for Food", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/08/11/homeless-in-mendocino-and-foraging-for-food/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/08/RS16314_IMG_3664-1.JPG-qut-800x800.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@faridajhabvala"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "homeless", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Clients at the Fort Bragg Food Bank may pick up food bags just once per week.\nBut Susan Holli, a board member of the Mendocino County Homeless Services Continuum of Care, says that estimate is low.\nOnly the Mendocino Coast Hospitality Center in Fort Bragg, 10 miles up the road on Highway 1, offers daily breakfasts and dinners.\n( Farida Jhabvala Romero/KQED )Every Tuesday, the Mendocino Presbyterian Church offers free meals and showers to homeless locals.\n\u201cThe density of homelessness is very high here,\u201d said Holli, noting that Fort Bragg and Mendocino\u2019s combined total population is about 8,200."}
