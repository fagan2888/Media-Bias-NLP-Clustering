One of CMP\u2019s board members is Operation Rescue President Troy Newman, who in 2003, called the murder of an abortion doctor \u201ca justifiable defensive action.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights groups and some U.S. senators are asking that CMP be investigated for false representation and misleading the IRS when it applied for tax-exempt status\u2026.\n\nBut the smear campaign hasn\u2019t abated. CMP continues to release more of its videos, and politicians continue to site them over and over in trying to sway opinion and public policy.\n\nI\u2019m sad to say that some of our local elected officials, including U.S. Rep. Mark Walker (R-Guilford) and Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Richard Burr (R-NC) are among them.\n\nUnfortunately, a lie repeated often enough still will persuade some of the people \u2014 especially those who want to believe it. And the truth, determined over time by impartial investigations, never has the shock value or leaves quite as much of an impression as those sensational videos.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "David Daleiden, the project leader for the videos has a history of creating deceptively edited videos.\n\u201cBecause of its nationwide network of providers, Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of abortion services in the country, but abortions amount to only 3 percent of the health services this group provides.\nThe most recent attacks on Planned Parenthood were videos purporting to show the group\u2019s \u2018procuring baby parts for profit.\u2019The Center for Medical Progress, which shot these heavily edited undercover videos, is not a medical organization but a political one, founded to create inflammatory \u2018sting\u2019 videos of Planned Parenthood.\nUnfortunately, a lie repeated often enough still will persuade some of the people \u2014 especially those who want to believe it.\nCMP continues to release more of its videos, and politicians continue to site them over and over in trying to sway opinion and public policy."}
