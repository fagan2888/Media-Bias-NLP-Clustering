You have 30 days to pay us back \u2014 or we\u2019ll deduct the amount from your next check.\n\nSometimes, the amount in question is less than $5; occasionally, it\u2019s over $100. Most are in between. Some refer to care provided more than a year ago. All of it is a paperwork pain for Poonawala, a solo family medicine practitioner in Austin who has begun to fight back but doesn\u2019t expect to win.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re being slapped on both cheeks,\u201d she said.\n\nMost patients aren\u2019t aware of this behind-the-scenes tussle, but they might feel the effects \u2014 beyond encountering a frustrated doctor distracted by billing queries.\n\nSome patients might discover their doctors no longer accept coverage from their insurance carrier, and more doctors have stopped taking insurance altogether \u2014 roughly 10 percent in Texas, according to Texas Medical Association surveys. Their patients could lose access to those doctors. Some will pay more to keep seeing a favorite physician by going \u201cout-of-network.\u201d And others might face higher costs as physician overhead climbs, experts said.\n\n+ Laura Skelding Dr. Robina Poonawala has a stack of demand letters from insurance companies essentially saying, \u201cOops, we overpaid you. Pay us back.\u201d ... read more Laura Skelding \u00d7\n\nIn most cases, doctors can\u2019t legally ask patients to share the cost.\n\nVirtually all of the insurance companies and government-sponsored coverage programs in Texas and other states engage in the longstanding practice called \u201crecoupment.\u201d Doctors, lawyers and others said commercial insurers\u2019 attempts to recoup overpayments have been escalating over the past five years. Some see a money grab by an industry that might have declining profits, partly because the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to spend 80 percent of premium dollars on patient care.\n\nDoctors have contracts with insurers that detail what is covered and how much reimbursement is owed. But sometimes after the insurance company pays the doctor, it goes back and reviews the claim. The demands for recoupment can come months later, long after the doctor\u2019s office has closed the transaction. The doctors can dig back through the records to appeal, but many don\u2019t consider it worth the staff time. For Poonawala, the nickel-and-diming added up to real dollars, and many refund demands came more than a year later, she said.\n\n+ Laura Skelding Dr. Robina Poonawala has a stack of demand letters from insurance companies claiming they have overpaid her.

When there are errors, we need to address those.\u201d\n\nSome of the errors stem from physicians using the wrong billing code, she said. When doctors use paper, rather than electronic claims, error rates rise, Krusing said.\n\n\u201cOverpayments shouldn\u2019t happen in the first place,\u201d she added. \u201cThere needs to be a system where the accuracy of payments is a streamlined process.\u201d\n\nRecoupment \u2014 which can occur for many reasons, including billing a higher amount or billing the wrong carrier when a patient has additional coverage \u2014 is among the top five complaints the Texas Medical Association receives from its doctor members, regardless of practice area, said Genevieve Davis, the TMA\u2019s director of payment advocacy.\n\nThe TMA has helped some doctors with payback demands, and it\u2019s not unusual for the insurers to back off, Davis said.\n\n\u201cI would say I hear from hundreds of physicians a year about this, if not thousands,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of those things patients don\u2019t realize is even going on.\u201d\n\nUnless they lose their doctor.\n\nRecoupment is one reason Dr. Todd Crump, a primary care physician in Austin, said he no longer takes insurance.\n\nHe practiced with a group in Taylor several years ago when an insurance company audit found overpayments, many involving technicalities, he said.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018there\u2019s a checklist you didn\u2019t document,\u2019\u201d Crump said. \u201cA lot of it is just nonsense, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nAs a no-insurance provider, building a patient base takes time, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trade-off. You get paid more if you take insurance, but the flip side is you have to follow all their rules and play their game.\u201d\n\nMany doctors simply pony up when hit with a payback demand.\n\nIn the last six months, Poonawala said Humana \u2014 which has sent her the highest number of recoupment demands \u2014 has cited scores of overpayments, primarily for lab work, totaling $5,400. Poonawala hasn\u2019t paid, and Humana hasn\u2019t reimbursed her services for several months. It\u2019s still deducting what it says she owes, said her husband, Nadir Poonawala, an accountant who helps with the books.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s too high, then pay less. \u2026 We\u2019ve already done the service,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Humana\u2019s mistake.\u201d\n\nHumana, which Aetna is seeking to acquire, declined to comment. \u201cIn June, Humana announced it is observing a \u2018quiet period\u2019 on media inquiries until July 29,\u201d spokesman Ross McLerran said.\n\nDr. Poonawala has changed how she bills for laboratory services, Nadir Poonawala said, but the couple and their lawyer daughter, Omaima Poonawala, believe Humana owes the doctor for services she provided.\n\nRobina Poonawala hired an employee, Shazia Baloch, to help sort through the insurance company demands. Baloch said she spends two or three hours a day calling insurers. While doctors have 30 days to issue a refund, insurers don\u2019t have any such deadlines on recoupments, she said, citing a recent demand letter over care provided in 2008.\n\nIf the doctor doesn\u2019t pay up in a month, penalties and interest start, documents show.\n\nCalling the company to ask questions is generally an exercise in futility, the Poonawalas said. At one point, Robina Poonawala sat down with Humana\u2019s medical director but nothing changed, Nadir said.\n\nDr. Poonawala doesn\u2019t want to drop Humana or stop taking insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to excommunicate patients,\u201d she said.\n\nJust a year ago, Humana sent her a letter saying she had earned a bonus based on claims information submitted on behalf of Humana\u2019s Medicare Advantage patients. In 2012, Humana also congratulated her for receiving a 93.75 percent compliance score after a medical records review.\n\nJamie Dudensing, CEO of the Texas Association of Health Plans, said insurers are being squeezed, too. \u201cIt is a difficult task to keep health care costs affordable and competitive in the market right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe insurance companies are looking to make sure everything is appropriate.\u201d\n\nDoctors who study their health plan contracts can sometimes avoid being surprised by overpayment demands, experts said.\n\n\u201cOur contracts with the care providers participating in our network specify the rates that should be charged for various services, and if a payment exceeds the contracted rates we may follow up with the care provider to ensure the appropriate balance is collected,\u201d UnitedHealthcare spokeswoman Mary McElrath-Jones wrote in an email.\n\nTamara Rodriguez, a lawyer with Vidaurri, Lyde, Rodriguez and Haynes in Edinburg, said it pays for doctors to fight back. Some doctors are hiring lawyers, especially when the stakes are high, she said.\n\nOne reason the recoupment practice is escalating is that insurance companies have seen the government\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid programs collect substantial paybacks after fraud investigations, Rodriguez said. They want to try and get money back, too, she said.\n\nEven so, she said, in at least half of the cases she knows about, commercial insurers miscalculated. She cited two cases in which doctors protested recoupments exceeding $10,000: one was refunded 65 percent and the other got 85 percent.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re banking on you not responding,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cA lot of times it\u2019s nitpicky things, and they (doctors) just need to do a corrected claim.\u201d\n\nBradley Reiner, a practice management consultant whose clients include the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, said, \u201cPayers are trying to collect as much money as possible, and this is an easy way to do that. Doctors don\u2019t have much recourse.\u201d\n\nDr. Poonawala said that\u2019s how she feels: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to doctors, and it\u2019s not fair for patients.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Robina Poonawala riffles through a stack of letters from insurance companies that all sound the same: We\u2019ve discovered we overpaid you for taking care of a patient.", "author": "By Mary Ann Roser - American-Statesman Staff", "og": {"url": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/doctors-tussle-with-insurers-and-sometimes-patient/nm233/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/07/18/24/5a/lhs-doctor-payments-08.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Dr. Robina Poonawala riffles through a stack of letters from insurance companies that all sound the same: We\u2019ve discovered we overpaid you for taking care of a patient.", "title": "Doctors tussle with insurers and sometimes patients also lose"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/07/21/aa/b4/lhs_doctor_payments_SLOT3F.jpg", "description": "Dr. Robina Poonawala riffles through a stack of letters from insurance companies that all sound the same: We\u2019ve discovered we overpaid you for taking care of a patient.", "card": "summary", "title": "Doctors tussle with insurers \u2014 and sometimes patients lose, too"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myaas", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/doctors-tussle-with-insurers-and-sometimes-patient/nm233/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2995115/news/news/doctors-tussle-with-insurers-and-sometimes-patient/nm233/", "keywords": "statesman,Travis County,local news,health", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Doctors don\u2019t have much recourse.\u201dDr. Poonawala said that\u2019s how she feels: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to doctors, and it\u2019s not fair for patients.\u201d\n+ Laura Skelding Dr. Robina Poonawala has a stack of demand letters from insurance companies essentially saying, \u201cOops, we overpaid you.\nPay us back.\u201d ... read more Laura Skelding \u00d7In most cases, doctors can\u2019t legally ask patients to share the cost.\nSome patients might discover their doctors no longer accept coverage from their insurance carrier, and more doctors have stopped taking insurance altogether \u2014 roughly 10 percent in Texas, according to Texas Medical Association surveys.\nThe TMA has helped some doctors with payback demands, and it\u2019s not unusual for the insurers to back off, Davis said."}
