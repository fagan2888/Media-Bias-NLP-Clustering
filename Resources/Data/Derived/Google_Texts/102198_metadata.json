Now many of them are learning they owe the government money.\n\nBy Anna Gorman, Kaiser Health News\n\n\n\nRoberta and Curtis Campbell typically look forward to tax time. Most years, they receive a refund\u2014a little extra cash to pay off credit card bills.\n\nBut this year they got a shock: According to their tax preparer, they owe the IRS more than $6,000.\n\nThat\u2019s the money the Campbells received from the federal government last year to make their Obamacare health coverage more affordable. Roberta, unemployed when she signed up for the plan, got a job halfway through the year, and Curtis changed positions. The couple\u2019s total yearly income became too high to qualify for federal subsidies. Now they have to pay all the money back.\n\n\u201cOh my goodness, this is just not right,\u201d said Roberta Campbell, who lives in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville. \u201cThis is supposed to be a safety net health care, and I am getting burned left and right by having used it.\u201d\n\nAs tax day approaches, hundreds of thousands of families who enrolled in plans through the insurance marketplaces could be stuck with unexpected tax bills, research suggests. One H&R Block study found that as many as half the people who received subsidies owe at least some money back.\n\nThe result is frustration and confusion among some lower- and middle-class taxpayers, whom the Affordable Care Act was specifically intended to help. The repayment obligations could dissuade people from re-enrolling and provide more fuel to Republicans continuing push for a repeal of the law.\n\nThe problem is that many consumers didn\u2019t realize that the subsidies were based on their total year-end income and couldn\u2019t reliably project what would happen over the course of the year, said Alyene Senger, research associate at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\n\u201cHow do you know if you are going to get that promotion?\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you know what your Christmas bonus is going to be?\u201d\n\nIn addition, Senger said the government didn\u2019t go out of its way to publicize the tax consequences of receiving too much in federal subsidies. \u201cIt isn\u2019t really something the administration focused on heavily,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly popular.\u201d\n\nEven if enrollees support Obamacare, they now are realizing that those positive life changes\u2014a pay raise, a marriage, a spouse\u2019s new job\u2014can turn out to be a liability at tax time.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Tech &amp; Health", "publicationDate": 201502261015, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Tech Health", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Youre About to Pay Up for Obamacare", "tags": "Obamacare:Industryterm,topic:sci-tech/science", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Hundreds of thousands who received subsidies under the Affordable Care Act may have underestimated their incomes in 2014.
