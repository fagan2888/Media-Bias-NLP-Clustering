Bullpen meltdowns, Kyle Kendrick\u2019s string of stumbling starts, foolish baserunning and inconsistent offense were the primary symptoms of the letdown in LoDo.\n\nBut none of that mattered on a perfect Sunday afternoon as Nolan Arenado \u2014 touted as a dark-horse National League MVP candidate by manager Walt Weiss \u2014 continued his torrid September and the Rockies hammered the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-5 at Coors Field to complete a three-game series sweep.\n\n\u201cThis meant a lot, because we didn\u2019t quit. We aren\u2019t quitters,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cThe fans comes out every day, even though we haven\u2019t played very well at home and this season hasn\u2019t gone that well at all.\u201d\n\nSunday marked the first time the Rockies swept the Dodgers since Sept. 25-27, 2007, at Los Angeles during Colorado\u2019s fantastic run to the World Series. The last time the Rockies swept L.A. at Coors Field occurred just a few days earlier (Sept. 18-20) when they took four straight from the Dodgers. That series included a memorable walk-off homer by Todd Helton off Dodgers closer Takashi Saito in the second game of a doubleheader.\n\nThere was nothing quite so dramatic Sunday, but Arenado continues to do remarkable things. He hit a three-run blast in the fourth inning off L.A. left-hander Alex Wood, a sacrifice fly in the sixth and a run-scoring single in eighth for a career-high five RBIs. Arenado has 41 home runs \u2014 tied with Washington\u2019s Bryce Harper for the National League lead \u2014 and his 126 RBIs are the most in the NL.\n\nArenado has the most RBIs by a Rockies players since Matt Holliday drove in 137 runs in 2007. The last time the Rockies had anybody break the 100-RBI threshold was in 2011, when Troy Tulowitzki had 105 RBIs.\n\nArenado, likely on his way to a third consecutive Gold Glove, has hit 11 home runs and driven in 31 runs in September. That might put him in the MVP spotlight, even though Harper is the clear favorite.\n\n\u201cNolan has certainly had the year to pull it off, and he just keeps adding to his amazing season,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe did it again, and he\u2019s definitely put himself in a position to win that award.\u201d\n\nArenado, though flattered by his manager\u2019s praise, said collecting precious baseball hardware is not on his mind.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really ring a bell with me because it\u2019s never happened to me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a blessing if people are nominating me or like watching me play.\u201d\n\nA crowd of 32,870 turned out to see the home finale and watch the Rockies do their traditional thank-you lap around the ballpark.\n\nThe Rockies drew 2,506,789 fans to Coors Field this season \u2014 pretty good for a team that has lost 90 games in three of its last four seasons.\n\nThe Dodgers were no doubt thinking they would waltz into Coors Field and lock down their 14th National League West title. After all, the Pirates had just swept four games from the Rockies at Coors. But the Rockies outhit, outpitched and outplayed the Dodgers over three games. L.A. is only 2-7 over its last nine games as it heads to San Francisco on Monday to try to capture the division title.\n\nColorado finished with a 36-45 home record, the franchise\u2019s second-worst for a full season. The Rockies\u2019 worst home season in their history was in 2012, when they finished 35-46 at Coors Field.\n\nLefty Chris Rusin, who continues to audition for a spot in next year\u2019s rotation, didn\u2019t dominate the Dodgers on Sunday. But he gave the Colorado offense a chance to do its thing. Rusin, who earned his sixth win of the season, was tagged for four runs (three earned) on eight hits in 5 innings. He walked three and struck out three.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the best-worst year of my life,\u201d said Rusin, who pitched two complete games at Coors Field this season. \u201cI\u2019ve had some really, really good games and some really, really bad games. \u2026 I have to work on being consistent and not being such a roller coaster. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to work on this offseason. I\u2019ve learned a lot, and I think it was a successful season.\u201d\n\npsaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp\n\nLodo lowdown\n\nThe Rockies completed their 2015 home season at Coors Field with a 12-5 victory over the Dodgers on Sunday.
