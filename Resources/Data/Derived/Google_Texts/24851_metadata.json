Jones, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Health System.\n\nThe deal is the latest in a flurry of activity with New Jersey\u2019s community hospitals. Somerset is the second merger or acquisition completed this year, and another six are pending. The hospitals have been hurt by outpatient treatment centers that have grabbed a big chunk of their inpatient care, and the Affordable Care Act\u2019s authority to fine hospitals that don\u2019t curb readmission rates.\n\nOn paper, the merger creates one 965-bed hospital between the two campuses, but to patients and employees, little will change right away. Physician arrangements will stay the same. There is no impact on the approximately 5,200 employees in New Brunswick, while Somerset Medical Center\u2019s 2,200 employees \"have been guaranteed employment at their current number of hours and salary for one year,\" Robert Wood\u2019s spokesman Peter Haigney said.\n\n\"For more than a century, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital has been committed to improving the health of Central New Jersey. Our expansion into Somerset County will provide direct access to the highest quality medical services and a wider array of health care opportunities, allowing us to better serve our communities and neighbors,\" Jones said. \"While we\u2019ve expanded, our mission remains the same \u2014 to improve the health and well-being of the patients and communities we serve.\"\n\nRobert Wood takes control after a period of turmoil for the Somerset County hospital.\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Services reported that the hospital had posted 10 consecutive years of operating losses through 2012. The hospital carried $80 million in state-issued bonds, and had Robert Wood not committed to buy Somerset in September, Moody\u2019s said it would have downgraded the hospital\u2019s bond rating.\n\n\"As is the case with many New Jersey hospitals, Somerset Medical Center faced financial challenges resulting from the competitive health care environment in our state and region,\" Haigney said. \"We are confident that this merger will strengthen the hospital financially and position it for future growth.\"\n\nA fresh start\n\nThe fresh start also allows Somerset to distance itself from the bleakest moments in its history. Somerset was the last hospital in the New Jersey-Pennsylvania area that employed Charles Cullen, the serial-killer nurse who pleaded guilty in 2004 to murdering 13 patients there by lethal injection and attempting to murder two more.\n\nIn April, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman announced the hospital would pay a $435,000 a settlement to end a five-year investigation into allegations Somerset had improperly billed Medicare and paid kickbacks to a cardiology practice to get more patient referrals.\n\nIn anticipation of the merger with Robert Wood, Somerset CEO Kenneth Bateman and nearly his entire senior management team left Somerset two weeks ago. The sale was not contingent on the resignations, Haigney said.\n\nPaul V. Stahlin, former chairman of Somerset\u2019s board of trustees, said the two institutions have been working \"to ensure a seamless transition for our patients and staff.\"\n\n\"Our organizations have had long-standing partnerships in many areas of clinical care and share many of the same physicians,\" said Stahlin, who with former board member Steve Kalafer, chairman of the Somerset Health Care Foundation Board of Trustees, are now board members of Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and the Robert Wood Johnson Health System.\n\n\"This alliance enables us to offer expanded access to high-quality medical care close to home and strengthens our ability to serve our community for generations to come,\" Stahlin said.\n\nShared services\n\nOne example of sharing services is cancer care. Somerset\u2019s Steeplechase Cancer Center will continue, but it will have a \"strengthened partnership\" with the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Robert Wood is the institute\u2019s flagship hospital.\n\nHealth care experts see the flurry of hospital sales and mergers over the last several years \u2014 as well as the closure of nine hospitals since 2007 \u2014 as part of a necessary trend to strengthen the industry. New Jersey has long been regarded as a place with too many inpatient beds.\n\n\"Each (closure) was very difficult for the impact on the community,\" said Heather Howard, director of the State Health Reform Assistance Network at Princeton University\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, who presided over some of the hospital closures when she was state health commissioner.\n\n\"We were reducing excess bed capacity, and that made the system stronger,\" Howard told industry insiders at a conference in Ewing on Thursday. \"The ACA (Affordable Care Act) has only accelerated the pressure on hospitals to reinvent themselves.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Somerset Medical Center CEO, senior executives will leave before Robert Wood Johnson merger\n\n\u2022 Somerset Medical Center agrees to pay $435K to settle federal kickback case\n\n\u2022 Detective tells '60 Minutes' Somerset Medical Center lied during Cullen investigation\n\nMore Politics", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Susan K.
