In one recent case, the FTC shut down an alleged telemarketing scam that asked older adults to verify their bank account numbers in order to receive a new Medicare card. Within weeks, the victims' bank accounts were drained of hundreds of dollars.\n\nSchemes that milk billions of dollars a year from the federal government through fraudulent claims made by white-collar criminals or organized crime are also prevalent, says Sally Hurme, project advisor with AARP\u2019s education and outreach department. \u201cMedicare fraud is an enormous industry,\u201d she says. For example, a doctor visiting 20 nursing home patients may seek reimbursement for spending one hour with each individual, when the visits actually only lasted a few minutes.\n\nExperts offer these tips to keep the con artists at bay:\n\nProtect your medical identity. Never share personal or financial information with a stranger, whether you\u2019re contacted by phone, mail or online. Only give your insurance information to those who have provided you with medical services.\n\n\u201cGuard your Medicare number as closely as you would any other personal identifier,\u201d Hurme says. She recommends beneficiaries keep their Medicare card at home and instead carry a copy of the card with all but the last four numbers scratched out.\n\nBeware of \u201cfree\u201d services. \u201cThere\u2019s often some kind of trade-off anytime someone offers something for free,\u201d says Melissa Simpson, program manager of the Center for Benefits Access at the National Council on Aging. \u201cThey\u2019re usually after your Medicare numbers.\u201d\n\nHurme warns consumers to beware of community recruiters who direct people to storefront clinics for free medical care. \u201cThey want to draw people to the clinic, so they give up their Medicare number,\u201d she says.\n\nAnother type of fraud involves medical equipment manufacturers, like companies that offer free diabetes testing supplies. These vendors then charge Medicare or private insurers for products that were not needed or perhaps never delivered.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten reports from people who had closets full of supplies that they didn\u2019t know what to do with,\u201d Simpson says.\n\nReview your Medicare summary notice. Carefully check the quarterly Medicare \u201csummary notice\u201d mailed to your home to verify the accuracy of your doctor visits, hospital stays and medical care. Some health care providers, for example, may charge for services that were never rendered.\n\n\u201cThis summary tells you every claim that has been made to Medicare on your account,\u201d Hurme says. \u201cIf the summary says you went to the doctor when you didn\u2019t or you got a heart transplant when you actually got a flu shot, then you know there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nIf you notice an error, immediately contact the health care provider. \u201cIt could just be an honest mistake that can easily be corrected,\u201d Simpson says. But if the provider balks, it may be time to notify the authorities of a possible scam.\n\nFor help understanding your Medicare summary notice, check out AARP\u2019s decoder.
