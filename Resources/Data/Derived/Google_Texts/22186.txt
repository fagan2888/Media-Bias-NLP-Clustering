Mark it in the diary, or memorialize it on Instagram: Nashville made weather history today.

The temperature hit 75 degrees at Nashville International Airport around noon today, shattering the previous record high of 73 degrees for Dec. 26 in place since 1875, according to the National Weather Service.

Whether the city's temperature will inch higher is uncertain now that that cloud cover is back, said Justyn Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The all-time high for a December day is 79 degrees, which was set on Dec. 31, 1982.

“We’re almost flirting with setting the all-time high for December,” he said.

The mild, unseasonable weather likely came up at celebrations around the region on Friday since there were mud puddles and no chance of a storybook dusting of snow.

The temperature on the 25th reached 69 degrees — making it the sixth warmest Christmas Day on record. Before this Christmas, it’s only been 60 degrees or higher twice in the last 35 years: in 1982 and 1987.

Warm Decembers in Tennessee correlate with El Niño, or warmer than usual temperatures in the Pacific Ocean that affect weather around the world, according to Jackson. Both 1982 and 1987 were strong El Nino years, he noted.

The El Niño pattern is “holding true this year,” he said.

There’s a chance this weekend will break, or at least tie, another record.

The forecasted high for Sunday is 75, which is also the record from Dec. 27, 1982.

The warm weather of the last week brought heavier than usual storms that left six dead and wreaked havoc on several communities.

“We’re talking about things that very rarely happen in December,” said Jackson. “This is more of late March weather.”

There is a chance of rain into the start of the work week, according to the National Weather Service. There is a 50 percent change of rain and thunderstorms on Saturday although the likelihood decreases into the night and Sunday.

Parts of the state continue to have flood advisories in effect although most have been lifted for Middle Tennessee. Several creeks around Nashville are still under flood warnings, according to the NWS.

These creeks should be avoided:

• Mill Creek near Antioch.

• Mill Creek near Nolensville.

• Sevenmile Creek at Blackman Road.

• Richland Creek at Belle Meade near Harding Place.
