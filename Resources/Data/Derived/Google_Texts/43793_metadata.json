Wanakamik gave an example to CBCNews, like \u201cin natural resource management at Lakehead you will have a lot of foresters graduating that are going to have to engage First Nations communities, so they will need to understand what treaties are.\u201d\n\nThe point of this initiative goes beyond understanding indigenous people, Wanakamik told CBCNews the university also is making the indigenous education mandatory so students can talk more openly about racism.\n\n\u201cThere will be conversations in the classroom. Most people will be talking about stereotypes people have about indigenous people in northwestern Ontario, in fact across Canada,\u201d she said.\n\nWanakamik is a former Lakehead student, and is proud of the university for doing this. \u201cPeople have responded to it. People are excited. This is a boost for students,\u201d she told CBCNews.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beginning in 2016, it will be mandatory for undergraduate students at Lakehead University in Ontario, Canada to take indigenous education.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/21/lakehead-university-mandate-indigenous-learning-159317", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/lakehead-university-entrance-sign.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Lakehead University to Mandate Indigenous Learning"}, "abstract": "Beginning in 2016, it will be mandatory for undergraduate students at Lakehead University in Ontario, Canada to take indigenous education.", "keywords": "Native American Education, Aboriginal Education, Canada, Lakehead University", "dc": {"title": "Lakehead University to Mandate Indigenous Learning"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/21/lakehead-university-mandate-indigenous-learning-159317", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-02-21T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Lakehead University to Mandate Indigenous Learning"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc20\"", "article_summary": "Beginning in 2016, it will be mandatory for undergraduate students at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, to take indigenous education, reports CBCNews.\nWanakamik is a former Lakehead student, and is proud of the university for doing this.\n\u201cThe idea is that any student in an undergraduate program will graduate from Lakehead with one half credit having significant indigenous knowledge,\u201d she said.\nYolanda Wanakamik, coordinator of graduate and external relations with the office of aboriginal initiatives, told CBCNews that it\u2019s part of the overall strategic plan for the university.\nThis is a boost for students,\u201d she told CBCNews."}
