Burris 08 May 2016 at 19:18 ET\n\nEven with establishment Republicans coming out to save Donald Trump\u2019s political bum, RedState\u2019s Ben Howe refuses to cave. Sunday\u2019s Reliable Sources, on CNN had host Brian Stelter asked Howe if his problem was \u201cthe Hillary you know\u201d vs. \u201cthe Trump you don\u2019t,\u201d but a true conservative like Howe wasn\u2019t about to let Trump off the hook.\n\n\u201cNo, I think I know exactly who I\u2019m getting,\u201d Howe admitted. \u201cI think I\u2019m getting a sociopathic maniac. And not only do I feel like that\u2019s who I\u2019m getting, I think that if Donald Trump was president we have four years of him defining conservatism.\u201d\n\nThe most recent polls have Trump and potential Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton at a statistical tie in Georgia, a southern state that has voted Republican every election since former President Bill Clinton won the state in 1992. Howe is likely seeing these numbers and is concerned with the loss of power for the GOP if the conservatives and the moderates split. The last thing he wants is the brand of conservatism denigrated by the likes of Trump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been bad enough with some of the people we\u2019ve had define conservatism over the last several years,\u201d Howe continued talking about conservatives that have fallen on the wrong side of the culture war. \u201cTo have Donald Trump be our standard bearer I think would be so destructive, I don\u2019t know if we can recover. This is going to be a third party situation if we can\u2019t get him to lose the election.\u201d\n\nLast week, Ted Cruz went on a tirade about Fox News and the network suddenly becoming the \u201cDonald Trump network.\u201d It was almost as if Cruz was spinning progressive talking points blaming the Australian billionaire for the outcome of an election.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of, he creates ratings,\u201d Howe said, claiming that cable news\u2019 love-fest with Trump has all been about the ad dollars garnered, while America watches the Apprentice unfold in real life. \u201cI want to address this idea that we were all missing in action when Obamacare came around, when the stimulus came around,\u201d he said refuting that the right didn\u2019t attack the President enough. \u201cI was out there marching with the Tea Party in 2009\u2026 the fact that I\u2019m now coming out against Donald Trump is actually very consistent. I\u2019m against liberalism in the destruction of conservatism and that\u2019s what Trump represents.\u201d\n\nWatch it all in the video below:\n\nNewest Videos", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-08-at-7.06.12-PM1-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "RedState\u2019s Ben Howe just nailed Donald Trump as the GOP\u2019s new \u2018sociopathic maniac\u2019 nominee"}, "fb": {"admins": 20324257234, "app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "RedState\u2019s Ben Howe just nailed Donald Trump as the GOP\u2019s new \u2018sociopathic maniac\u2019 nomineeSarah K.
