In the discussion, Sommers highlighted two goals for October: raising the debt ceiling, which the federal government will hit Nov. 3, and reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.\n\nTim Regan of @Corning introducing Mike Sommers, @SpeakerBoehner's Chief of Staff, at today's policy discussion. pic.twitter.com/DlparTIozU \u2014 Main St. Partnership (@MainStreetGOP) October 13, 2015\n\nSommers' goals for October: 1 \u2013 Raising the debt ceiling and preventing default 2 \u2013 Reauthorization of #ExIm bank #MSPpolicy #exim4jobs \u2014 Main St. Partnership (@MainStreetGOP) October 13, 2015\n\nSommers \u2013 \"Main Street is so very valuable in electing and supporting Republicans that can govern.\" #MSPpolicy @SpeakerBoehner \u2014 Main St. Partnership (@MainStreetGOP) October 13, 2015\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Signal, Boehner spokeswoman Emily Schillinger said the speaker believes Ex-Im\u2019s future should be decided through regular legislative process.\n\n\u201cThe speaker has long believed that this issue should be worked out through regular order at the Financial Services Committee,\u201d she said.\n\nEx-Im\u2019s charter expired June 30, and moderate Republicans and Democrats have been pushing for Congress to reauthorize the bank. Earlier this month, more than 40 GOP lawmakers teamed up with their colleagues across the aisle to sign a discharge petition, a rarely successful tool that would force a vote on legislation reauthorizing Ex-Im.\n\nThe discharge petition received the 218 signatures needed to advance, and the House is expected to vote Oct. 26 on the legislation bringing the bank back to life.\n\nDuring debate over Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization earlier this year, Boehner declined to publicly take a stance on its future. Though he did say in April the bank\u2019s expiration could put \u201cthousands\u201d of jobs at risk, Boehner also deferred to House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling and said he would support \u201cany plan\u201d that passed Hensarling\u2019s committee.\n\nHensarling, R-Texas, led the charge against reauthorizing Ex-Im\u2019s charter.\n\nBoehner\u2019s decision to leave Congress, which is supposed to happen on Oct. 30, has breathed new life into the debate over the the 81-year-old agency\u2019s future. After the Ohio Republican announced he was stepping down, conservatives pushed for Ex-Im\u2019s charter to remain expired.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker John Boehner's chief of staff has made reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank one of his top priorities for October.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner's chief of staff has made reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank one of his top priorities for October.", "title": "Aide to Boehner Calls Ex-Im Reauthorization Goal for October", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151019_ExImReauth_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-19T15:00:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1M0UQsb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House Speaker John Boehner's chief of staff has made reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank one of his top priorities for October.", "title": "Aide to Boehner Calls Ex-Im Reauthorization Goal for October", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151019_ExImReauth_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "cronyism", "published_time": "2015-10-19T14:12:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-19T15:00:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Export-Import Bank, Ex-Im, John Boehner, Mike Sommers, Main Street Partnership, debt ceiling, Jeb Hensarling, House Financial Services Committee, discharge petition"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d4c\"", "article_summary": "pic.twitter.com/DlparTIozU \u2014 Main St. Partnership (@MainStreetGOP) October 13, 2015Sommers' goals for October: 1 \u2013 Raising the debt ceiling and preventing default 2 \u2013 Reauthorization of #ExIm bank #MSPpolicy #exim4jobs \u2014 Main St. Partnership (@MainStreetGOP) October 13, 2015Sommers \u2013 \"Main Street is so very valuable in electing and supporting Republicans that can govern.\"\nHensarling, R-Texas, led the charge against reauthorizing Ex-Im\u2019s charter.\n#MSPpolicy @SpeakerBoehner \u2014 Main St. Partnership (@MainStreetGOP) October 13, 2015In a statement to The Daily Signal, Boehner spokeswoman Emily Schillinger said the speaker believes Ex-Im\u2019s future should be decided through regular legislative process.\nDuring debate over Ex-Im\u2019s reauthorization earlier this year, Boehner declined to publicly take a stance on its future.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner\u2019s chief of staff has made reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank one of his top priorities for October."}
