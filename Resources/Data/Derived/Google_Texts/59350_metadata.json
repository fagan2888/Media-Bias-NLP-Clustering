Sebelius oversaw the rollout of \u201cObamacare\u201d starting in 2010. She served in President Barack Obama\u2019s cabinet from April 2009 through June 2014.\n\nRepublican governors of several states, including Kansas, have refused to participate in the Medicaid expansion program.\n\nSebelius, who also served as Kansas governor from 2003 to 2009 and Kansas Insurance Commissioner prior to that, spoke at Fort Hays State University Monday night. She kicked off this season\u2019s Keith G. Sebelius Lecture Series, named after her father-in-law, former U.S. Rep. Keith Sebelius, R-Norton, who graduated from FHSU in 1941.\n\nHer one-hour discussion with moderator Dr. Chapman Rackaway, acting chairman of the FHSU Political Science Department and Director of Liberal Education, drew laughter, numerous rounds of applause and a final standing ovation from the audience in Beach/Schmidt Performing Arts Center.\n\nSebelius met briefly with the local media prior to her public appearance.\n\nShe was asked about the ACA, the legacy and public service of Keith Sebelius, the law that will allow most people to carry concealed firearms without a permit on the campuses of Kansas universities, and her transition from longtime public servant to working as an adviser in the private sector.\n\nGary Sebelius, son of Keith and husband of Kathleen, was in the audience. He is a federal magistrate judge.\n\n(Video by James Bell)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Hays Post", "description": "By BECKY KISER Hays Post Former U.S. Dept. of\u00a0Health and Human Human Services Secretary, Democrat Kathleen Sebelius, believes \u201cpolitics is denying health care and coverage\u201d for about 15\u2026", "title": "Sebelius: Politics of health care produce \u2018unconscionable\u2019 results", "url": "http://www.hayspost.com/2015/10/13/sebelius-politics-of-health-care-produce-unconscionable-results/", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.hayspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC_1812-e1444760213774.jpg", "height": 493}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-13T21:23:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T21:02:26+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hayspost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC_1812-e1444760213774.jpg?w=640", "site": "@hayspost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hayspost"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce335\"", "article_summary": "of Health and Human Human Services Secretary, Democrat Kathleen Sebelius, believes \u201cpolitics is denying health care and coverage\u201d for about 150,000 low-income Kansans who would be covered by the expansion of Medicaid as part of the federal Affordable Care Act.\nShe kicked off this season\u2019s Keith G.
