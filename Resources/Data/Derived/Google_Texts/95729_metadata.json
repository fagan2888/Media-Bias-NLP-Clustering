Moscow says their goal is to help end terrorism in Syria, but the U.S. has warned that Russia\u2019s involvement could exacerbate Syria\u2019s multi-sided civil war and is concerned over Russia\u2019s support for Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov blamed Washington for cutting off direct military-to-military communication between Russia and NATO after the crisis in Ukraine last year.\n\nHe said such contracts were \u201cimportant for the avoidance of undesired, unintended incidents,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cWe are always in favor of military people talking to each other in a professional way. They understand each other very well,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said. \u201cIf, as (U.S. Secretary of State) John Kerry has said many times, the United States wants those channels frozen, then be our guest.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, U.S. officials have described what they say is an increase of Russian equipment and manpower, Reuters reported.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said Russia\u2019s involvement would not change U.S. strategy in the fight against Islamic State terrorists, which included U.S. planes leading an international coalition in airstrikes in Syria.\n\n\u201cBut we are going to be engaging Russia to let them know that you can\u2019t continue to double-down on a strategy that is doomed to failure,\u201d he said at an event with military service members during a visit to Maryland, Reuters reported.\n\nRecent intelligence reports have indicated that Moscow is sending anti-aircraft missiles to Syria. The system would be operated by Russia troops, rather than Syrians, a Western official said, Reuters reported.\n\nU.S. officials have also said they believe about 200 Russian naval infantry forces were now stationed at an airfield near the Syrian city of Latakia, an Assad stronghold, and that number has increased in recent days.\n\nMr. Lavrov has said Russia was sending supplies to help Mr. Assad fight extremists and said Russia servicemen were in Syria primarily to help service equipment and teach Syrian soldiers how to use it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russia warned there could be 'unintended consequences' if the U.S. does not engage in military-to-military cooperation with Moscow, as the Kremlin stages navy exercises off the coast of Syria.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Russia warned there could be \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 if the U.S. does not engage in military-to-military cooperation with Moscow, as the Kremlin stages navy exercises off the coast of Syria.", "title": "Russia to U.S.: cooperate with us or risk \u2018unintended consequences\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/12/russia-us-cooperate-us-or-risk-unintended-conseque/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/06/18/meeting.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/06/18/meeting.jpg", "description": "Russia warned there could be 'unintended consequences' if the U.S. does not engage in military-to-military cooperation with Moscow, as the Kremlin stages navy exercises off the coast of Syria.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Russia to U.S.: cooperate with us or risk \u2018unintended consequenc"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Russia, Sergei Lavrov, Syria"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1029\"", "article_summary": "Russia warned there could be \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 if the U.S. does not engage in military-to-military cooperation with Moscow, as the Kremlin stages navy exercises off the coast of Syria.\nRussia\u2019s military build up in the region has drawn concern from the U.S. and NATO.\nMr. Lavrov has said Russia was sending supplies to help Mr. Assad fight extremists and said Russia servicemen were in Syria primarily to help service equipment and teach Syrian soldiers how to use it.\nThe system would be operated by Russia troops, rather than Syrians, a Western official said, Reuters reported.\nHe said such contracts were \u201cimportant for the avoidance of undesired, unintended incidents,\u201d Reuters reported."}
