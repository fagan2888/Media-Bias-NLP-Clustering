Chris Christie is to blame.State Sen. Nia Gill says it's Christie fault because he did not establish a statewide health exchange, and now residents have no choice but to negotiate the flawed federal program to find new coverage, the New York Post reports The flaw in her argument, the Post says, is that even if Christie had created a statewide system, the insurance policies would have still been cancelled.Although the Obama administration now says insurance companies can ignore the new standards and reissue the cancelled policies, no company in New Jersey has so far been willing to try it.The Post reports that Christie warned Obama in 2010 that the law would create a flood of cancelled policies, but his pleas were ignored.\"This is a disaster and it was a train wreck that anybody who\u2019s managed anything, ever, in their lives, could\u2019ve seen coming,\" Christie said during a recent interview on New Jersey 101.5FM \"This is just an awful law. It made no sense and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t get into a state exchange,\" Christie said. \"And no, I have absolutely no regrets. In fact, I\u2019m really glad that the train wreck\u2019s not mine.\"Related stories:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Gill,Obamacare,Christie,blame", "pubdate": "2013-12-09T09:35:30", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A New Jersey Democrat says it's not the president's fault that 800,000 Garden State residents saw their insurance cancelled in anticipation of new Obamacare requirements \u2014 instead, she says Republican Gov.
