The court\u2019s decision, expected next month, may resonate through the entire health-care industry.\n\nThose words, \u201cestablished by the state,\u201d are at play because Indiana and 32 other states did not establish exchanges for their citizens to purchase health insurance. Instead, Hoosiers and others bought their coverage on an exchange established by the federal government.\n\nThe subsidies offered by the federal government under the ACA, commonly called Obamacare, go to those who are not covered by the expansion in Medicaid or are not getting insurance through their employer. Most of those who receive the subsidies fall squarely in the middle class, according to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe average subsidy in Indiana is $4,835, which covers between a third and about half of the annual premium for a so-called Bronze policy. Hoosiers are expected to receive about $1.62 billion in premium assistance in 2016, according to a Kaiser report from December 2014.\n\nAnd now we\u2019re back to the four words. The Supreme Court heard arguments in March about whether the subsidies apply in states that did not establish an exchange. Only 17 states and the District of Columbia established exchanges; people in Indiana and the other states who were required to buy insurance under the ACA used one established by the federal government tailored to the individual states.\n\nSo if the exchange wasn\u2019t \u201cestablished by the state,\u201d do its participants qualify for the subsidy that makes the insurance affordable?\n\nThis deceptively simple question, as we\u2019ve seen, carries major implications. You would think contingency plans are being readied as we await the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, expected next month.\n\nYou would be wrong.\n\nAnd the consequences reach far beyond those who might lose their subsidies. Many experts think the entire health insurance market could go into a death spiral if the Supreme Court determines the subsidies are illegal.\n\nIn these politically charged and congressionally gridlocked days, it\u2019s not a surprise that there is no legislative path toward a fix if the subsidies disappear. Some members of Congress have introduced bills to repeal and replace the ACA, but there is no apparent coordinated plan to act if the court rules against the subsidies.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s administration has admitted it has no alternative plans at the ready and Gov. Mike Pence has said his administration will wait until the court rules to determine its course of action.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision carries high stakes, according to a white paper produced by Gregory and Appel, a large local insurance agency. The decision \u201ccould do real damage \u2014 even kill the ACA over time and change how health care is paid for in the country,\u201d according to the paper, authored by Gregory and Appel\u2019s Susan Rider and Karl Ahlrichs.\n\n\u201cIf those individuals lost access to subsidies, the cost of coverage would be unaffordable for the vast majority of them,\u201d the paper determined. \u201cA subsidy shutdown could result in 9 million fewer people with coverage by 2016, a 70 percent decline. The resulting adverse selection caused by healthy people leaving the risk pool would spike insurance premiums in the individual market.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the market beyond those who receive subsidies, so those who currently can afford insurance would soon find that\u2019s not the case anymore. If this happens, health insurers like Indianapolis-based Anthem would have a smaller base over which to spread costs, which means rates for group plans provided through employers likely would spike, too.\n\n\u201cThe loss of a healthier risk pool would create unprecedented premium price growth and insurers leaving the marketplace would create an even more uncompetitive insurance market,\u201d the Appel paper observed. \u201cThe industry would be in a \u2018death spiral.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret there are many in Congress who would welcome the end of the ACA, but this plausible scenario puts a pretty high price on its demise. The effect goes beyond individuals and the insurance industry. Providers, too, will suffer if the payment system falters, which would put increasing pressure on the rates of those few who still would have insurance.\n\nLately, some members of Congress, including Central Indiana Reps. Susan Brooks and Luke Messer, have begun talking about what might happen if the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies, but it\u2019s still being addressed in the abstract.\n\nSolutions range from repealing and replacing the ACA to enacting a single-payer system through the federal government. It\u2019s much more likely Congress will tinker at the margins if the subsidies are eliminated, but the disconcerting truth is no one knows for sure.\n\nIndiana joined several other states in asking the Supreme Court to eliminate the subsidies. What we don\u2019t know is what they\u2019ll do if the court gives them what they want.\n\nJohn Ketzenberger is president of the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization to research state budget and tax issues.
