Ted Cruz chastened, mellower or more of a team player got a harsh dose of reality Wednesday.\n\nThe tea partier from Texas made a lot of enemies in the Senate \u2014 on his own side \u2014 by forcing an uncomfortable and avoidable vote on increasing the federal government\u2019s debt limit.\n\nHis filibuster put party leaders in a bind, not least among them fellow Texan Sen. John Cornyn. With 60 votes needed to ensure the measure passed and a catastrophic default was avoided, a few Republicans had to join with Democrats.\n\nThen, Cruz piled on everyone who dared to cross him, denouncing \u201cestablishment politicians from both parties\u201d and warning darkly of political consequences.\n\n\u201cSometimes, come November, the people remember,\u201d he said.\n\nThe term \u201cquixotic\u201d isn\u2019t in Cruz\u2019s lexicon, and he\u2019s clearly not angling for \u201cMost Popular\u201d in the nation\u2019s most exclusive club.\n\nOne could argue, as Cruz has, that the shutdown paid dividends for Republicans by shining a harsh spotlight on Obamacare\u2019s rough edges.\n\nIt was hard to see any such upside in Wednesday\u2019s events, other than for Cruz and fellow tea partiers.\n\nThe Senate would have raised the debt limit exclusively with Democratic votes, a political point Republicans could have exploited. In the end, in fact, that\u2019s what happened, but only after the filibuster was quashed.\n\nCornyn, the No. 2 Republican, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were determined not to let the GOP suffer the blame for roiling the world\u2019s economy. Both voted with Democrats, even though both have primary challengers as they seek re-election.\n\nRep. Steve Stockman, R-Clear Lake, accused Cornyn of using Cruz\u2019s back as \u201chis own personal cutlery holder.\u201d\n\nThat stings, but so does casting a damaging vote on a lost cause.\n\nFollow Todd J.
