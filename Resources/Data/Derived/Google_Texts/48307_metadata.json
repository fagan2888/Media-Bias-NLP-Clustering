If passed into law, according to the CBO, the Save American Workers Act would cost approximately 1 million people their health insurance and add just over $53 billion to the deficit over ten years. It would also save businesses almost $55 billion in ACA penalties over that same time period.\n\nOne million Americans would lose coverage, 500,000 would remain uninsured.\n\nAccording to the report, changing the terms of the employer mandate to require 40 hours of work per week would cause about 1 million people losing their health insurance. Many of them would qualify for coverage elsewhere, either through insurance exchange subsidies, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Up to 500,000 would not and would remain uninsured.\n\n\n\nRead More: House of Representatives Dynamic Scoring Likely to Lead to Lower Taxes, Higher Deficits\n\nSponsors of the Save American Workers Act argue that raising the definition of full time would prevent employers from cutting hours in order to avoid giving benefits, for example reducing an employee\u2019s schedule from 31 hours per week to 29. In practice; however, a 40 hour cap would make far more workers vulnerable to this kind of manipulation because more people work a 40- to 44-hour week.\n\nAccording to numbers presented by head of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Robert Greenstein, only approximately 7% of American workers work between 30 and 34 hours per week. A plurality, 44%, work 40 hours per week. While employers might currently shave hours from part time workers to avoid the mandate, the CBO concluded, \u201cbecause many more workers work 40 hours per week (or slightly more) than work 30 hours per week (or slightly more), H.R. 30 could lead employers to make changes that would affect many more workers than will be affected under current law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "House Republicans are proposing to increase Obamacare's employer mandate to 40 hours per week, a change that would add $53 billion to the deficit and increase the uninsured rate", "author": "Eric Reed", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "House Republicans are proposing to increase Obamacare's employer mandate to 40 hours per week, a change that would add $53 billion to the deficit and increase the uninsured rate", "title": "House Bill To Change Obamacare Employer Mandate Would Cost 1 Million People Their Health Insurance", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/house-bill-to-change-obamacare-employer-mandate-would-cost-1-million-people-their-health-insurance", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/officewellness-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/officewellness-mslarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "Obamacare, A.C.A., Affordable Care Act, politics, Democrats, Republicans, Congress, Employer Mandate", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "Employer Mandate", "published_time": "2015-01-08T08:34Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611368"}, "date": "2015-01-08T08:34Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13003860, "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans are proposing to increase Obamacare's employer mandate to 40 hours per week, a change that would add $53 billion to the deficit and increase the uninsured rate", "title": "House Bill To Change Obamacare Employer Mandate Would Cost 1 Million People Their Health Insurance", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/house-bill-to-change-obamacare-employer-mandate-would-cost-1-million-people-their-health-insurance", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/officewellness-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/officewellness-mslarge.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, A.C.A., Affordable Care Act, politics, Democrats, Republicans, Congress, Employer Mandate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b29\"", "article_summary": "According to the report, changing the terms of the employer mandate to require 40 hours of work per week would cause about 1 million people losing their health insurance.\nA plurality, 44%, work 40 hours per week.\nMany of them would qualify for coverage elsewhere, either through insurance exchange subsidies, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\nWhile employers might currently shave hours from part time workers to avoid the mandate, the CBO concluded, \u201cbecause many more workers work 40 hours per week (or slightly more) than work 30 hours per week (or slightly more), H.R.\nIf passed into law, according to the CBO, the Save American Workers Act would cost approximately 1 million people their health insurance and add just over $53 billion to the deficit over ten years."}
