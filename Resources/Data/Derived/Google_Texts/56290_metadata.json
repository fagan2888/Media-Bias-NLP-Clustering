Eight-nine people were killed at the Bataclan where the American band Eagles of Death Metal was playing a sold-out show.\n\nDomergue, who has lived in Dallas for five years, said a solution needs to be found for what happened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s like all the attempts that are taking place against innocents,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not resolving an issue to kill innocents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzExL2Nyb3dkLWdhdGhlcnMtaW4tZG93bnRvd24tZGFsbGFzLWluLXNvbGlkYXJpdHktd2l0aC1mcmFuY2UuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
