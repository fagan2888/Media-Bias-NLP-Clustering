Laced in a flurry of late-session opinions by the U.S. Supreme Court were bursts of sneers, hyperbole — even personalized nastiness — that one might expect from a congressional backbencher determined to get a soundbite on cable news.

He suggested he would “hide my head in a bag” if ever he fell to the level of legal reasoning behind the 5-4 ruling on same-sex marriage.
