She had always been interested in the real estate market, so she started her career in 2007. \u201cI had no idea at the time that real estate isn\u2019t quite as flexible as many imagine.\u201d said Van Dyke. \u201cI spent three years nursing my daughter back to health and it was then that I got into real estate because I couldn\u2019t remember much of the accounting and couldn\u2019t picture myself sitting behind a desk. It\u2019s been good and a good fit for the family.\u201d Van Dyke discusses her career and approach to selling real estate in this edited interview.\n\nHave you learned anything from your clients?\n\nI\u2019ve learned to be a better negotiator based on some of my clients that have been really demanding and wanted every question answered and every possible scenario played out. That has helped me negotiate in that it forced me to think far ahead and think more strategically.\n\nWhat role should an agent play for a client?\n\nThere are times when you\u2019re pop psychologist, part negotiator, part salesperson. Your role is to provide good information so that everyone knows what to expect next , what their role is and what yours is. Also to keep the transaction running smoothly. My goal is to keep everybody happy.\n\nWhat qualities make for a good realtor?\n\nGood customer service. You have to relate to people and put yourself in their shoes. Compassion goes a long way toward seeing it from both sides and explaining it from both sides, too.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve been given?\n\nTo persevere and don\u2019t give up. There are so many times it seems like the transaction may be falling apart, and if you have a positive attitude and don\u2019t give up, but do your best to approach the challenge from every angle, things usually work out.\n\nHave you had any mentors?\n\nThere is a real good group of agents in my office who have always been helpful if I have any questions, but not anyone in particular.\n\nHow have you developed as a realtor?\n\nLooking back, I don\u2019t think I knew what I was getting into, so I wasn\u2019t fully prepared for the profession, which is really different from accounting. Life experience and being a people person is really what it\u2019s all about. I like people more now and can understand better where they\u2019re coming from and what their perspective is.\n\nWhat is your business philosophy?\n\nTo treat everyone as though they were a member of my family and I\u2019m going to do everything I possibly can to provide my best service. That\u2019s really important to me because I don\u2019t really do a lot of marketing and instead rely on referrals.\n\nWhat do you consider to be your client\u2019s biggest challenge?\n\nFor some sellers, it\u2019s challenging to readjust to market conditions. They remember what the market was a few years ago and getting them into the new market paradigm is a challenge. As far as buyers go, it\u2019s tough getting them to be realistic on price when some have wanted to come in $50,000 below asking price.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite part of the process when working with clients?\n\nAfter the biggest hurdles are out of the way, and they\u2019re focused on moving toward the closing and I can focus on working to make sure everything is falling into place. In that sense, it\u2019s more about the journey than it is about the actual closing. It\u2019s doing a job well done along the way rather than collecting a paycheck.\n\nWhat do you enjoy about selling real estate?\n\nThe variety is great and there are so many different people you meet; I love that part of it. That feeling of fulfillment when you\u2019re helping someone buy their first home or is in a tricky situation is what drives it for me.\n\nWhat do you do for recreation or to relax?\n\nI walk my dog, which is a therapy dog for my daughter, for about four miles a day before I do anything as a way to reflect and connect. I also work with the dog for training. We\u2019re working to get her into a group that performs tricks for the children at the hospital. That\u2019s my thing. My kids are older now so they don\u2019t need me as much.\n\nWhat charitable organizations are you involved with?\n\nI work with the animal performance group and also Ronald McDonald House and Children\u2019s Hospital. In the past, I\u2019ve trained for and participated in team marathons to benefit the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Teri Van Dyke, First Weber Group", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/homes/realtoroftheweek/274916271.html", "image": {"width": 333, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/TerryVanDyke.jpg", "height": 500}, "type": "article", "description": "Teri Van Dyke was studying for the CPA exam when her 2 year old daughter was diagnosed with cancer, so she sought a career that offered some degree of flexibility while she cared for her.
