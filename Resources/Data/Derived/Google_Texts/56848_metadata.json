ACOs take financial responsibility for the care of their Medicare patients.\n\nTheir mission is to \u201cprovide high-quality care at the right time and in the right setting,\u201d as one of the groups, FPG Healthcare, puts it.\n\nAt the end of the year, if the government determines that a certain ACO\u2019s patients received high-quality care and cost less than expected, the ACO receives half of the savings. That means Florida ACOs recently received $16.5 million in rewards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute windfall,\u201d said Richard Lucibella, CEO of one of the winners, Accountable Care Options of Boynton Beach. He said the primary-care offices in the ACO received an average bonus of $150,000.\n\nDoctors got an average payment of $500 for each Medicare patient in their ACO practice, Lucibella said; however, those who have the best quality-of-care scores get the most.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very aggressive with preventive care,\u201d said Mitch Perelman, a primary physician in the ACO.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really our goal, to keep patients out of the hospital \u2013 that\u2019s major,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicare\u2019s quality benchmarks for ACOs \u2013 from assessments for fall hazards to mammograms -- are attached to each patient\u2019s electronic record.\n\n\u201cPatients seem happy with us doing these measures. They like going over things,\u201d said Perelman.\n\nIn addition to Accountable Care Options, the Florida-based ACOs that won performance bonuses are Palm Beach ACO and FPG Healthcare in Orlando. Palm Beach ACO received about $11 million, Accountable Care Options got $4.2 million, and FPG collected $1.45 million.\n\nThe bonuses follow a January report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on interim financial results for the first two groups of ACOs that began the partnership with CMS in 2012. Of the 114 ACOs, nearly half \u2013 54 \u2013 succeeded in slowing spending under the forecast. Only 29, however, hit the benchmark that triggers shared savings with Medicare.\n\nIn Florida, 13 ACOs opened in 2012, along with two multi-state ACOs that include Florida doctors. One of the multi-states, TP-ACO, qualified for shared savings. Attempts to reach TP-ACO to confirm the amount were unsuccessful; CMS isn\u2019t releasing performance results for each ACO.\n\nSince 2012, CMS has approved new ACOs annually. The shared-savings results announced at the end of January dealt only with the early adopters; by that time CMS said there were 360 ACOs in operation.\n\nHow ACOs are structured is up to the founders. Some are physician networks, led by doctors; others have been started by hospitals. Walgreens has Medicare ACOs in Florida, Texas and New Jersey in partnership with physicians. Insurers also are forming private-sector ACOs.\n\nThe ACO model is one of several initiatives that CMS has launched in an effort to improve care and lower costs.\n\nTo start, an ACO must serve at least 5,000 Medicare patients, have a governing body and infrastructure, and show it can deliver coordinated care.\n\nACOs may include specialists and hospitals. However primary care doctors are at the center, as care coordinators. Part of their job is to prevent duplication of services and unnecessary testing or treatment. They also make referrals.\n\nThis sounds a lot like managed care, but there is a key difference. Patients in an ACO are free to go to any doctor or healthcare facility they want, without prior approval. So their ACO primary care team has to find ways to keep their patients happy so they won't stray.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries don\u2019t sign up for ACOs; their doctors do. Patients are notified that their doctor is now in ACO and can choose to opt out.\n\n\u201cFor year one, our biggest challenge was getting doctors to believe that this would all work,\u201d said Kelly Conrad, director of Palm Beach ACO.\n\nThat ACO has 275 doctors and specialists caring for 32,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Palm Beach County. It opened in July 2012 and saved Medicare $22 million in its first 18 months.\n\nSimple suggestions have contributed to the ACO\u2019s success, said Conroy. One was wellness visits, which allow doctors to establish relationships with patients and look for preventable health problems.\n\nWellness visits can save money in the long run, but most patients -- and many doctors -- aren\u2019t aware that they are a Medicare benefit, said Conroy.\n\nThe ACO also alerted doctors about Medicare\u2019s new benefit for transitional care visits. It pays for patients to see their doctor within a week of release from a hospital. Transitional care fits neatly into the ACO\u2019s mission to control costs. Doctors reduce the risk of readmissions through identifying care gaps and seeing that patients understand post-release treatment plans.\n\nExperimenting with ways to reduce spending through quality care is a work in progress, said Conroy. \u201cNo one has all the answers yet,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Accountable Care Options in Boynton Beach, the network has focused on performance measurements that evaluate care. The organization\u2019s 50 doctors are all primary care physicians. They saved Medicare $8.4 million from mid-2012 through 2013 while meeting quality benchmarks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found educating practices about these measures to be transformational. We really had thought they would be a thorn in our side,\u201d said Lucibella.\n\nMedicare evaluates ACOs annually. Success during 2014 will trigger more bonuses at the end of the year.\n\n--Susan Hemmingway is a freelance writer in Tampa.
