Whereas American teenage boys tend to abuse marijuana, teenage girls tended to abuse alcohol in greater numbers.\n\nAnd then young women ages 18 to 24 pulled ahead of their male counterparts in marijuana abuse, with twenty-two percent reporting pot as their preferred substance of abuse, compared to three percent of men \u2014 who seemed to prefer alcohol at that point.\n\nThe U.S. government released a report this week describing gender differences in substance abuse. SAMHSA\n\nSAMHSA also reported that elderly women were nearly three times as likely to abuse prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone than men their age, suggesting that public health policymakers focus a bit on gender differences in substance abuse.\n\nAlthough the data doesn\u2019t explain the causes of variability in substance abuse, researchers said they hoped to inform the design of social services for specific groups based on sex and age across multiple settings, including the doctor\u2019s office. Clinicians and policymakers might note, for example, research finding that women begin using methamphetamine at younger ages than men.\n\n\u201cThis research, coupled with the findings in this report, might suggest that age-appropriate methamphetamine prevention and outreach efforts directed towards adolescents and young women in particular may be important in areas with moderate to high rates of methamphetamine use,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cAdditionally, the findings related to differences in the abuse of prescription pain relievers between older adult males and females may warrant further investigation.\u201d\n\nAmong other findings, the researchers noted a negligible difference in prescription painkiller abuse rates for young men and women ages 18 to 34. Among Americans ages 25 to 34, 19 percent of women admitted to abusing oxycodone and similar pills, compared to some 12.2 percent of men that age.\n\n\u201cThe only meaningful difference by effect size between males and females was observed among admissions aged 65 or older,\u201d the researchers said. Elderly women abused such drugs nearly three times as often as men their age, at 7.2 percent compared to 2.8 percent.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "oxycodone abuse, oxy abuse, prescription medication abuse, gender differences in substance abuse, men and substance abuse", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Although twice as many men seek inpatient treatment for substance abuse, elderly women are nearly three times as likely as men their age to abuse prescription painkillers such as oxycodone.", "title": "Men Twice As Likely To Enter Substance Abuse Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/men-twice-likely-enter-substance-abuse-treatment-though-elderly-women-more-likely-abuse-pills-274854", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/06/men-twice-likely-enter-substance-abuse-facilities.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although twice as many men seek inpatient treatment for substance abuse, elderly women are nearly three times as likely as men their age to abuse prescription painkillers such as oxycodone.", "title": "Men Twice As Likely To Enter Substance Abuse Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/men-twice-likely-enter-substance-abuse-treatment-though-elderly-women-more-likely-abuse-pills-274854", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/06/men-twice-likely-enter-substance-abuse-facilities.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/06/men-twice-likely-enter-substance-abuse-facilities.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-04-06T15:35:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-06T15:35:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Although twice as many men seek inpatient treatment for substance abuse, elderly women are nearly three times as likely as men their age to abuse prescription painkillers such as oxycodone."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec0a\"", "article_summary": "Although twice as many men seek inpatient treatment for substance abuse, elderly women are nearly three times as likely as men their age to abuse prescription painkillers such as oxycodone.\nMore than a million American men sought inpatient treatment for substance abuse in 2011 \u2014 twice the number of women, according to the federal government.\nThe U.S. government released a report this week describing gender differences in substance abuse.\nElderly women abused such drugs nearly three times as often as men their age, at 7.2 percent compared to 2.8 percent.\nYet, no difference in substance dependence emerged among boys and girls ages 12 to 18, after researchers at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) ran the numbers."}
