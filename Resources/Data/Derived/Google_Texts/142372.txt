Liberty Counsel, the law firm that revealed Kentucky clerk Kim Davis' secret meeting with the pope, has been accused by advocacy groups of peddling misrepresentations before.

Yet it has become the main source of details about the controversial pope meeting.

The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Liberty Counsel among its anti-gay hate groups for spreading false information. The day before the meeting with the pope, Mat Staver, the group's founder, showed a full auditorium a photo of a packed Peruvian stadium and said 100,000 gathered there to pray for Davis, the defiant clerk who spent five days in jail for defying a court order and refusing to license same-sex marriages.

Online sleuths quickly debunked the story.

The Liberty Counsel claims the pope thanked Davis for her courage.
