The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is proposing to fine the shipping company FedEx for illegally transporting hazardous materials on multiple occasions.

The FedEx branch in Memphis, Tenn., is facing a $58,600 civil penalty for allegedly shipping 1.7 liters of a flammable liquid through the air without properly identifying the package, the FAA says.

The FAA also accused FedEx of shipping hazardous materials while “incorrectly indicating the amount of hazardous materials inside” the package.

“The shipments were not properly classed, described, packaged, marked, labeled and in the condition for shipment required by the Hazardous Materials Regulations,” the agency wrote.

The FAA said FedEx pilots were not provided with accurate information about the hazardous materials, which it said included radioactive material, flammable printing ink, and flammable and combustible paint.
