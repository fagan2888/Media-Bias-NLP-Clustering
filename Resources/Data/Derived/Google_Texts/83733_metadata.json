Ted Cruz should get a declaratory judgment from a federal court, ruling that Cruz is a natural born citizen eligible to run for president. What Trump may not know\u2014but which his lawyers should have told him\u2014is that Cruz can only get such a ruling if Trump sues him first.\n\nBreitbart News has thoroughly analyzed the legal issues raised by Trump\u2019s questioning whether Cruz is eligible under Article II of the Constitution to run for president. If Trump sues Cruz now, this matter could be decided by a federal court before Iowans go to their caucuses on February 1.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhen George Washington was elected as America\u2019s first president, he had a legal question regarding America\u2019s treaty with Great Britain and sent that question to the Supreme Court for the justices to rule on the matter. In 1793, the Supreme Court responded with a letter to Washington, including, \u201cWe exceedingly regret every Event that may cause Embarrassment to your administration,\u201d but then explaining that the U.S. Constitution only gives federal courts the power to declare a legal interpretation when a proper lawsuit is brought before the courts.\n\nFrom 1793 to 2016, the federal courts have been explicit that they cannot issue \u201cadvisory opinions.\u201d Article III of the Constitution says the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d only extends to certain types of cases. One of Article III\u2019s requirements is adversity: a court can only declare legal decisions when there are at least two adverse parties\u2014a plaintiff and a defendant\u2014who are trying to defeat each other.\n\nOtherwise, people could game the court system to twist and pervert the law. A plaintiff and defendant could conspire together, with one side making great arguments and the other party deliberately filing only pathetic arguments, trying to push the court in one particular direction. It is the equivalent of a boxing match where one fighter deliberately throws the fight to the other side.\n\nAs the Supreme Court has explained many times, requiring parties to be adverse means that a federal judge will get the best possible legal briefs and oral arguments that both sides can throw at each other. This gives the judge all the tools he needs to decide the case correctly.\n\nLong ago, Congress passed the Declaratory Judgment Act, found at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, which empowers federal courts to \u201cdeclare the legal rights and other legal relations\u201d of parties to a lawsuit. But Congress can never exceed the powers granted to it by the Constitution, and the Constitution still requires both parties in a declaratory judgment lawsuit to be adverse.\n\n(Many newsworthy lawsuits are declaratory judgments. Usually when a plaintiff asks a court to strike down a law, it is asking for a declaratory judgment. Most of the biggest lawsuits\u2014such as the Obamacare case NFIB v. Sebelius, the gay-marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges, the Second Amendment case D.C. v. Heller, and the religious-liberty case Town of Greece v. Galloway\u2014were all declaratory judgment lawsuits.)\n\nNow that Trump has raised these issues, the whole country\u2014not just the Republican Party\u2014will benefit from a prompt resolution of the controversy. If Trump is right, then Republicans should know while they still have time to decide who the party\u2019s nominee should be. Otherwise, Hillary Clinton could make this a political issue but never take it to court, in a cynical effort to depress conservative turnout at the polls and elect her as a liberal Democratic president.\n\nOn the other hand, if Trump is wrong, and Cruz is constitutionally eligible\u2014as Breitbart News has already reported that both conservative and liberal legal scholars seem to think\u2014then Republicans\u2019 judgment in choosing their nominee should be informed by that knowledge, as well.\n\nThe only reason for Trump not to sue is if he intended this issue to cast doubt upon Cruz to help Trump win the Republican primaries, but believed that the law was actually on Cruz\u2019s side. If so, he could continue to erode Cruz\u2019s vote share by warning voters that the Texas senator would be an unconstitutional president, but never take it to court to be proven wrong.\n\nIn fact, if Trump is right that Cruz was not born a U.S. citizen, then even now, Cruz would not be an American citizen at all because he never went through the naturalization process required for all foreign immigrants, and would, therefore, not be eligible to be a U.S. senator. (Article I of the Constitution requires that all senators be U.S. citizens for at least nine years before being elected.)\n\nIf Trump moves for a preliminary injunction asking for the U.S. district court in Iowa to block Cruz from the Iowa caucuses because Cruz is ineligible, a federal judge would schedule briefing and oral argument within days. A court decision could be rendered within a week. The losing party (Trump or Cruz) could then file an emergency appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis, which would likely schedule the case to be heard only days later and render a decision before the end of January.\n\nThe losing party at the appeals court could then petition the U.S. Supreme Court for review. If the Court chooses to intervene, it could likewise resolve the matter with rapid speed.\n\nBut the federal courts are powerless under Article III to act until someone with standing to sue files a declaratory-judgment lawsuit against Cruz. The clearest standing is the standing of a rival GOP candidate. If Trump believes Cruz\u2019s eligibility is in doubt and that Cruz should get a declaratory judgment to settle the matter, then Trump should sue now. Either way, he would do himself, Cruz, and the country a favor by doing so.\n\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.
