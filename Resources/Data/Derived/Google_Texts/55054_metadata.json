Ted Cruz (R-Texas) becomes the GOP nominee in 2016 and is elected president. Like Cruz, Cuccinelli was known for pushing often divisive social issues, including abortion and same-sex marriage, as attorney general. Cuccinelli was also known for suing the federal government over the Affordable Care Act, going after scientists at the University of Virginia who supported the idea of climate change, and trying to prohibit state universities and colleges from adopting and enforcing LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination policies.\n\n\u201cI made my choice here, and it was to go all in on the Cruz campaign,\u201d Cuccinelli told the Post. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much that makes sense on an individual and family basis. \u2026 It\u2019s better for our family not to do both.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli\u2019s exit from the gubernatorial race appears, at first glance, to benefit former GOP strategist and 2014 U.S. Senate nominee Ed Gillespie, who came close to defeating U.S. Sen. Mark Warner (D) that year. But Gillespie is also known as a more establishment figure, the type of candidate that typically does not fare well in state conventions, which is how Republicans will select their nominee for 2017. Other Republicans who are either considering running or have been mentioned as potential candidates include U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman and Prince William County Supervisor Corey Stewart, a former candidate for lieutenant governor in 2013.\n\nWhoever emerges victorious from the Republican convention will likely face Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the presumptive Democratic nominee and an ally of the LGBT community. Northam\u2019s path to his party\u2019s nomination was largely cleared after Attorney General Mark Herring announced his plans to run for re-election rather than seek the seat being vacated by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who is term-limited.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former attorney general and conservative firebrand Ken Cuccinelli is foregoing a chance to run for the GOP nomination for governor in 2017.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Metro Weekly", "description": "Former attorney general and conservative firebrand Ken Cuccinelli is foregoing a chance to run for the GOP nomination for governor in 2017.", "title": "Cuccinelli says he won't run for Virginia governor in 2017 - Metro Weekly", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cuccinelli.jpg", "height": 542}, "updated_time": "2016-05-03T09:58:16-04:00", "url": "http://www.metroweekly.com/2016/05/cuccinelli-says-wont-run-virginia-governor-2017/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former attorney general and conservative firebrand Ken Cuccinelli is foregoing a chance to run for the GOP nomination for governor in 2017.", "creator": "@JohnAndresRiley", "image": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cuccinelli.jpg", "title": "Cuccinelli says he won't run for Virginia governor in 2017 - Metro Weekly", "site": "@metroweekly", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 118031275134}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-squareLogo_black-270x270.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroWeekly", "section": "Local", "tag": "virginia", "published_time": "2016-05-03T09:56:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-03T09:58:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Like Cruz, Cuccinelli was known for pushing often divisive social issues, including abortion and same-sex marriage, as attorney general.\n\u201cI made my choice here, and it was to go all in on the Cruz campaign,\u201d Cuccinelli told the Post.\nThe Old Dominion\u2019s LGBT community got some welcome news over the weekend after former Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R) announced he would not seek the GOP nomination for governor of Virginia in 2017.\nNortham\u2019s path to his party\u2019s nomination was largely cleared after Attorney General Mark Herring announced his plans to run for re-election rather than seek the seat being vacated by Gov.\nCuccinelli told The Washington Post that he would not be running, instead devoting his efforts to ensuring that Sen.
