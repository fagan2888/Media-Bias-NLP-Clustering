It was green-lighting the sale of Chinese processed American chicken. As Politico explained, \u201cU.S. officials have given the thumbs-up to four Chinese poultry plants, paving the way for the country to send processed chicken to American markets.\u201d But while, \u201cat first, China will only be able to process chicken that has been slaughtered in the U.S. or other certified countries,\u201d that should not be a comfort to fans of the McNugget, Campbell\u2019s chicken soup, or any other processed chicken product.\n\nTo start, that a chicken was born and bred on U.S. soil is no guarantee of its quality. It is, however, a good indicator of several other things, starting with the bird\u2019s short, miserable life. The vast majority of the almost 300 million egg-laying hens raised in the U.S. every year are kept in cages too small for them to spread their wings, and this practice is beginning to take hold in raising our 8 billion broilers (the ones we eat) as well. The broilers are fed a diet laden with arsenic and antibiotics, while egg-laying hens are often packed into barns so full of birds, feathers and feces, that, as we learned last month, an employee could literally get shot in one without anyone even noticing.\n\nDon\u2019t be comforted by the fact that chicken was processed in the U.S. either. Between slaughter and nugget-ization, chicken carcasses endure a host of perversions, making chicken less of a food and more of a food-like substance. They are injected with saltwater solutions to add weight and taste. Their bodies are mechanically separated through a processed called \u201cAdvanced Meat Recovery,\u201d stripping the meat off leftover bones and turning it into the poultry version of pink slime. The resulting goop will be cooked into something tasty and sold to you, the unwitting customer. And yes, this process does actually impact the food on your plate: According to a 2009 USDA study, 87 percent of chicken cadavers test positive for E. coli, feces\u2019 favorite bacteria, just before they are packaged and sent to a store near you.\n\nBut Big Chicken doesn\u2019t just exploit the animals \u2013 the environment and its employees suffer as well. According to a 2011 Pew study, modern-day chicken farming pollutes the water, the air and the soil. Chicken manure finds its way into everything nearby, oversaturating the land and water with phosphorous and nitrogen, depleting them of oxygen and killing aquatic life. Industry tycoons Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms have both been accused of outsourcing their labor, turning \u201cwhat were once good-paying positions\u201d into \u201cnear-poverty-level jobs.\u201d Perdue defended its practices to Salon, noting that it \u201cwas among the last of the poultry companies\u201d to outsource, and that \u201caffected associates were able to apply for positions elsewhere\u201d within the company. Tyson offered a similar response, adding that outsourcing certain positions is \u201ccommon practice in the poultry industry.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that these jobs still leave a lot to be desired. A recent study by the Southern Poverty Law Center concluded that the industry regularly sacrifices its workers\u2019 health and safety in the name of increased factory floor \u201cefficiency.\u201d According to the SPLC, \u201cthe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration reported an injury rate of 5.9 percent for poultry processing workers in 2010, a rate that is more than 50 percent higher than the 3.8 percent injury rate for all U.S. Workers.\u201d The U.S. Poultry & Egg Association and National Chicken Council answered the SPLC\u2019s study with its own five-page report, noting that overall, injuries and illnesses have dropped 74 percent over the past 20 years, and concluding, \u201cWhile the past 25 years has seen a dramatic decrease in the numbers and rates [of] injury and illnesses occurring in the industry, the poultry industry will continue to seek new and innovative ways to protect our workforce.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Processed chicken is already bad for the environment, workers and consumers -- and it's about to get a lot worse", "author": "Deena Shanker", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Processed chicken is already bad for the environment, workers and consumers -- and it's about to get a lot worse", "title": "Chicken is killing the planet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/16/chicken_is_killing_the_planet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/chicken.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Processed chicken is already bad for the environment, workers and consumers -- and it's about to get a lot worse", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/chicken.jpg", "title": "Chicken is killing the planet", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Chicken is killing the planet", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, chicken, Editor's Picks, Food, Food safety, Processed food", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfad2\"", "article_summary": "Topics: chicken, Editor's Picks, Food, Food safety, Processed food, Sustainability News, NewsThis story has been corrected since it was originally published.\nBetween slaughter and nugget-ization, chicken carcasses endure a host of perversions, making chicken less of a food and more of a food-like substance.\nofficials have given the thumbs-up to four Chinese poultry plants, paving the way for the country to send processed chicken to American markets.\u201d But while, \u201cat first, China will only be able to process chicken that has been slaughtered in the U.S. or other certified countries,\u201d that should not be a comfort to fans of the McNugget, Campbell\u2019s chicken soup, or any other processed chicken product.\nChicken manure finds its way into everything nearby, oversaturating the land and water with phosphorous and nitrogen, depleting them of oxygen and killing aquatic life.\nAccording to a 2011 Pew study, modern-day chicken farming pollutes the water, the air and the soil."}
