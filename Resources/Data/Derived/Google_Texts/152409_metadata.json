The expansion would cover the 70,000 Montanans who fall between the cracks in the Affordable Care Act by making too much to currently qualify for Medicaid and too little to be eligible for subsidies.\n\nBut the Republicans were unmoved by the more than 200 Montanans who spoke on behalf of doctors, nurses, the hospital association, low-income clinics, Native American tribes, and the state public health association \u2014 all in favor of the expansion.\n\nThe expansion would help working families, veterans and military families, increase low-cost preventive care, and reduce the leading cause of bankruptcy: medical debt. And it\u2019s funded by the federal government, saving Montana money and making it economically competitive with neighboring states.\n\nSounds like a winner doesn\u2019t it? Even the state chamber of commerce backs the expansion, but the House Republicans chose to listen to a small handful of opponents including two staffers from Koch brothers-funded Americans for Prosperity. They couldn\u2019t care less about the poor or their health.\n\nMore than 22 million women have access to healthcare in this nation thanks to Medicaid, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center, and two-thirds of adult Medicaid recipients are women. Medicaid is vital to the health of women and their families. In 2014, approximately 29 million children received health coverage through Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid expansion has worked, and Republicans need to stop being the real death panels and pulling the plug on people who are hanging on by a thread.\n\n[moko_youtube src=\u201dfGEU0a75tiw\u201d]\n\nH/T: Kaiser Health News, National Women\u2019s Law Center, State of Montana\u2019s Governor\u2019s Office", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid expansion has worked, and Republicans need to stop being the real death panels and pulling the plug on people who are hanging on by a thread.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Medicaid expansion has worked, and Republicans need to stop being the real death panels and pulling the plug on people who are hanging on by a thread.", "title": "Montana's Death Panel Just Said 'No' to This", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HeartMonitor.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-12T15:15:10-04:00", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/montanas-death-panel-just-said/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Medicaid expansion has worked, and Republicans need to stop being the real death panels and pulling the plug on people who are hanging on by a thread.", "creator": "@JillEBond", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HeartMonitor.jpg"}, "title": "Montana's Death Panel Just Said 'No' to This", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Progressives", "tag": "medicaid,Medicaid expansion,Montana,obamacare,republicans,women", "published_time": "2015-03-12T15:14:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-12T15:15:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbb8\"", "article_summary": "Medicaid expansion has worked, and Republicans need to stop being the real death panels and pulling the plug on people who are hanging on by a thread.\nRepublican lawmakers in Montana have decided that 70,000 Montanans will have to go without health care.\n[moko_youtube src=\u201dfGEU0a75tiw\u201d]H/T: Kaiser Health News, National Women\u2019s Law Center, State of Montana\u2019s Governor\u2019s Office\nThe expansion would help working families, veterans and military families, increase low-cost preventive care, and reduce the leading cause of bankruptcy: medical debt.\nMedicaid is vital to the health of women and their families."}
