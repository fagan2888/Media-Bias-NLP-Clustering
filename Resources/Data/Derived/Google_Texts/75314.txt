For more than a year, UBS AG held out hope that the U.S. Department of Justice would look past alleged violations of a 2012 settlement related to interest-rate rigging after the Swiss bank self-reported new infractions and provided evidence that will culminate in settlements with five of the world’s largest banks for allegedly manipulating foreign currencies rates.

Those hopes were dashed with a foreboding call last Thursday night when Andrew Weissmann, the Justice Department’s criminal fraud section chief, told the bank’s lawyers they should come in for a face-to-face meeting on Friday. Mr. Weissman’s message in person the next morning was blunt: The Justice Department was blowing up the 2012 deal.

The unprecedented move to void a settlement with a major financial institution comes after more than a year of talks between UBS UBS, +0.52% and the Justice Department. It is a sign of the department’s increasingly aggressive negotiating posture with financial institutions, and calls into question the staying power of past bank settlements if they run into trouble.

The negotiations with the Justice Department are expected next week to result in UBS paying a fine of about $200 million to the Justice Department and pleading guilty to allegations that UBS traders manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, prior to 2012, according to some of the people.

Those allegations were previously resolved by the December 2012 settlement, in which the U.S. agreed not to prosecute the bank on the condition that it “commit no United States crime whatsoever” for the two-year term of the agreement. Prosecutors later extended that agreement by a year as they continued to investigate whether the foreign-exchange allegations ran afoul of the earlier deal.
