For the second year in a row, all three of the major credit raters have agreed that not-for-profit hospitals will struggle more than benefit in the coming months.S&P did see a \u201cglimmer of relief\u201d on the horizon. Hospitals will benefit from a greater number of insured patients; robust investment markets; and increased consolidation that has allowed many providers to achieve economies of scale and increase their referral base, the report said.However, the agency still expected that hospitals and systems will be operating with slim margins, particularly as their costs increase and reimbursement is squeezed. Providers will continue to grapple with lower inpatient volume and payment reforms that turn the current fee-for-service model on its head. Ratings will depend on how quickly they can adapt to the new environment.This is the third consecutive year that S&P has placed a negative outlook on not-for-profit providers.Larger systems will continue to have advantages over smaller ones, and S&P acknowledged the protective benefits of increased merger and acquisition activity.
