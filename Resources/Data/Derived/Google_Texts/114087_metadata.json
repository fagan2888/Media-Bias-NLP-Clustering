Col. Samuel Kan, executive director of the Armed Forces Tax Council, which includes representatives from all of the services' tax assistance programs.\n\nWhen it comes to claiming all the deductions and credits you can, Kan said, \"Don't leave money on the table.\" Even if you prepare your own tax returns, have them reviewed for accuracy by a tax professional trained in the nuances of military tax issues.\n\nThe services emphasize that troops can go to any installation for tax assistance, regardless of the branch. That's always been DoD policy, Kan said, but in the past, service members have decided to pay someone for tax help when their own installation couldn't fit them in within their time frame. \"That's not necessary,\" he said.\n\nInstead, troops can call other installations to see if they have time available for assistance. \"Call around so you'll know in advance,\" he said.\n\nFree tax preparation help\n\nVisit the DoD Legal Services Locator for contact information for all the military legal assistance offices in your local area, at http://legalassistance.law.af.mil/content/locator.php. Tax centers with trained professionals may be in or near the legal assistance offices. Some bases, especially Navy bases, have set up kiosk centers near legal assistance offices where you can go to prepare your own taxes, with a professional to help you if needed.\n\nMilitaryOneSource.mil offers a variety of resources, including secure, free online tax preparation, filing through H&R Block and tax consultations with tax professionals. Kan said this year's Military OneSource H&R Block software is expanded and more thorough.\n\nThere are no large military-specific changes in this year's tax law, Kan said. One Affordable Care Act change requires everyone \u2014 including troops, retirees and their family members \u2014 to report health care coverage on their tax returns. Tricare meets the minimum essential coverage requirements under the law for most people.\n\nBut troops need to be reminded about some tax provisions that are constant and can provide credits and deductions that add up, he said, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. For a taxpayer with three children, depending on income, that credit alone could be over $6,000.\n\nJulie Sforza-Smith, principal tax research analyst with H&R Block, said troops also should crunch the numbers when deciding whether to include tax-free combat pay in their calculations for the Earned Income Tax Credit. \"The common mistake is to exclude it all the time,\" she said. Yet a number of factors could change the situation and the amount of the credit. She said she recently ran an example that would provide a $5,000 credit with one option, and a $244 credit with the other.\n\nShe notes that including the combat pay in the calculations doesn't mean it will be taxed. The H&R Block software \u2014 including that used for Military OneSource \u2014 automatically makes both calculations, then asks the taxpayer which option he or she chooses.\n\nShe said a common error is that troops and their spouses don't know which state to pay taxes to. The Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act allows service members and eligible spouses to pay taxes to their home of record, rather than the state where they are stationed. Under a part of the SCRA known as the Military Spouse Residency Relief Act, spouses can also retain residency in their home state if they move with their military spouse. The spouse's earned pay isn't taxed in the current state, but in the home state.\n\nBut since states have different rules and forms, and military members have constantly changing circumstances \u2014 for example, perhaps living in two or three states in one year, and having income from a second job outside their military pay \u2014 it's a good idea to have the help of a tax professional, Sforza-Smith said.\n\nAs a long-time professional and an attorney, she said, \"I firmly believe everyone should be able to do their taxes themselves. But in this situation, I really believe military people need help. It's not in their best interest to go it alone. They may miss deductions, miss income exclusions, pay to the wrong state,\" she said.\n\nShe reminds members of the Guard and Reserve who travel more than 100 miles for duty that they can deduct unreimbursed travel expenses for those extra miles. At a reimbursement rate of 56 cents per mile, those deductions can add up for multiple drill weekends in a year. For example, if you traveled an extra 50 miles each month \u2013 600 miles last year \u2013 that would add up to $336 in deductions.\n\nOther tips:\n\n*Make sure you put the correct Social Security number on the return. It's the most common mistake.\n\n*Provide the correct bank account information to the IRS for electronic refunds.\n\n*Have your documents ready. Kan suggests having a folder handy, ready to intercept all tax-related documents.\n\nHe also suggests bringing your previous year's tax returns, unless you're using the same tax preparer. That can help make sure you don't forget some income, deduction or credit.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://militari.ly/1DPSTN4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Free tax preparation and filing advice and services are available to troops and families.", "og": {"site_name": "MilitaryTimes", "description": "Free tax preparation and filing advice and services are available to troops and families.", "title": "Consumer Watch: April 15 tax deadline looms", "url": "http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/benefits/on-base/2015/02/07/consumer-watch-tax-deadline/22979987/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/militarytimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Free tax preparation and filing advice and services are available to troops and families.", "title": "Consumer Watch: April 15 tax deadline looms", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71f67f7ca2a5789457d7b9c29027088b29534d1f/c=60-0-640-580&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/02/06/GGM/MilitaryTimes/635588203178929439-ConsumerWatch5.jpg", "creator": "@MilitaryTimes", "site": "@MilitaryTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 349179911903738}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "IRS, april 15, military onesource, defense department, h&r block, u.s. navy, Armed Forces Tax Council"}, "article_summary": "Even if you prepare your own tax returns, have them reviewed for accuracy by a tax professional trained in the nuances of military tax issues.\nMilitaryOneSource.mil offers a variety of resources, including secure, free online tax preparation, filing through H&R Block and tax consultations with tax professionals.\nThe services emphasize that troops can go to any installation for tax assistance, regardless of the branch.\nBut troops need to be reminded about some tax provisions that are constant and can provide credits and deductions that add up, he said, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit.\nHe also suggests bringing your previous year's tax returns, unless you're using the same tax preparer."}
