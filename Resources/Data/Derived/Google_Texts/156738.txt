NEW ORLEANS — Two men exchanged gunfire early Sunday on the city’s Bourbon Street in the celebrated French Quarter and nine people were shot in the crossfire, including two who were critically wounded, police said.

Images captured from a surveillance camera above a bar showed people running down the famous street in the chaos of the shooting at 2:45 a.m., The Times-Picayune reported. Police and emergency workers attended to victims as other revelers looked on.

New Orleans Police Chief Ronal Serpas said six victims were hospitalized in stable condition. The other victim’s condition was not available. Some of them were from out of town, but their names have not been released.

The victims were shot two blocks from historic Jackson Square and just around the corner from the popular Pat O’Brien’s piano bar. Preservation Hall, a music venue dedicated to preserving New Orleans jazz, is also nearby.

Serpas said at a news conference in the French Quarter that the victims were shot “by two cowardly young men trying to hurt each other.” Police have not determined whether the shootings might be gang-related, Serpas said.
