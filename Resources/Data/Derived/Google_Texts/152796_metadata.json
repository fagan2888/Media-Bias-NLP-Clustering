Robert F. McDonnell\u2019s health secretary as his own, a choice that could help the new governor sell Medicaid expansion to wary Republicans but that also infuriates some abortion rights activists.\n\nMcAuliffe (D) announced Wednesday that he will reappoint William A. Hazel Jr., an orthopedic surgeon from Northern Virginia who served as secretary of health and human resources under McDonnell (R).\n\n\u201cI am confident that Secretary Hazel will be the best steward to help me carry my agenda forward and meet the challenges we face when it comes to health care in this commonwealth,\u201d McAuliffe said as he announced his choice at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond.\n\nAs a highly regarded health-policy expert and holdover from a GOP administration, Hazel could be an asset to McAuliffe in the uphill battle that is his top priority: persuading Republican state lawmakers to expand Medicaid under the federal health-care law known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cOf all the people who have held that position, probably no one is more knowledgable,\u201d said state Sen. Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax). \u201cHe got up before a joint committee and stepped through the whole Affordable Care Act with no notes. This is a super, super bright guy. He\u2019s Terry\u2019s best shot at the Medicaid expansion by far.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the move angered some of the abortion rights activists who helped propel McAuliffe to victory in November over Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R). Throughout his campaign, McAuliffe pressed the theme that Cuccinelli and other Republicans had waged a \u201cwar on women,\u201d in part with legislation that imposed strict building codes on abortion clinics and a bill that, before it was amended, would have required women to obtain a vaginal ultrasound before an abortion.\n\nSome abortion rights activists blame Hazel for standing by as those policies were considered, even if he did not publicly champion them. As rumors of his pending selection began swirling in recent weeks, RH Reality Check, an online publication focused on reproductive health, urged readers to add their names to a petition: \u201cTell Gov. Elect Terry McAuliffe: Don\u2019t rehire Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s secretary of Health and Human Resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cHazel represents the insidious face of an apparatchik advancing, supporting, and rubber stamping a war on women that McAuliffe promised to end,\u201d Erin Matson, the publication\u2019s editor at large, wrote Tuesday under the headline \u201cJust Why Is Terry McAuliffe Thinking of Renominating Bill Hazel?\u201d\n\nSome McAuliffe supporters say that anger is misplaced. The nephew of prominent Northern Virginia businessman and developer Til Hazel, the secretary was considered a moderate when McDonnell appointed him four years ago, so much so that his selection was a touchy choice for a Republican who was a longtime favorite of the anti-abortion movement. Hazel was the last cabinet secretary McDonnell named \u2014 appointed just hours before his inauguration \u2014 and the only one who did not get his own news conference. McDonnell postponed the announcement several times.\n\n\u201cHe was not responsible for that\u201d anti-abortion legislation, Saslaw said. \u201cIn fact, when you had [governors James S.] Gilmore and [George F.] Allen, their secretaries were over there all the time whooping it up for all these abortion bills. He did not appear [before legislative committees] in support of any of those anti-abortion bills.\u201d\n\nSen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfaix) said she recommended to McAuliffe that he retain Hazel.\n\n\u201cHe is a genuine expert on healthcare reform and has been moving Virginia to the forefront of the nation,\u201d she said in an e-mail.\n\nAt the VCU announcement, McAuliffe and Hazel sought to reassure abortion rights activists that the governor-elect will honor his promise to defend and even expand access to the procedure. McAuliffe repeated his campaign vow to be a \u201cbrick wall\u201d against efforts to restrict access.\n\n\u201cI will follow the governor\u2019s lead,\u201d Hazel said. \u201cHe calls the plays. . . . We [Cabinet secretaries] implement the law, and we follow the governor\u2019s direction. And Governor McAuliffe, on Jan. 11 at about noon, will be my new boss.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s top priority is to expand Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor, under the federal Affordable Care Act. The Democrat said it will provide health-care to 400,000 uninsured Virginians and create more than 30,000 jobs. House Republicans contend that Washington lacks the money to make good on its promise to pick up most of the cost, which in Virginia is estimated at $2 billion a year.\n\nMcAuliffe hopes that Hazel, with his perspective as a medical practitioner and record of seeking health-care reforms under McDonnell, will help him make the dollars-and-cents case for expansion.\n\nSome top House Republicans said the appointment was unlikely to sway opponents even as they praised McAuliffe\u2019s selection of someone they consider a skilled and dedicated secretary.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for Secretary Hazel and the work he has done over the last four years, but I don\u2019t think his appointment changes much of anything on Medicaid expansion,\u201d said House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford).\n\nSaid Del. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), the incoming chairman of the House Appropriations Committee: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly fantastic news, but it doesn\u2019t change my position on Medicaid expansion, which is reforms first.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, ran as a bipartisan deal-maker, promising to appoint Republicans and Democrats to his cabinet and find consensus on tough issues. Yet given how central abortion rights were to his campaign, some women\u2019s groups did not expect him to play the pragmatist in that arena \u2014 even on the symbolic level of hiring someone associated with, but perhaps not personally in favor of, the anti-abortion policies of the past four years.\n\nLate Tuesday, as rumors of Hazel\u2019s pending appointment swirled, the tone of the opposition to the appointment had cooled. Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, was \u201cnot applauding\u201d the appointment, but she also said she felt confident that under McAuliffe, Hazel will play a different role.\n\n\u201cWe hope that he will become more engaged and more interested in women\u2019s health issues, in helping to promote them, advance them and protect them \u2014 especially since he has a new boss,\u201d she said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia Executive Director Cianti Stewart-Reid issued a statement suggesting that the group was on board with Hazel in the context of his potential to sway Republicans toward Medicaid expansion.\n\nBut she added: \u201cWe will be watching closely to make sure that Secretary Hazel works to advance the Governor\u2019s women\u2019s health agenda.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The choice has angered some abortion-rights activists but is seen as the \u2018best shot\u2019 for Medicaid expansion.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The choice has angered some abortion-rights activists but is seen as the \u2018best shot\u2019 for Medicaid expansion.", "title": "McAuliffe reappoints McDonnell\u2019s health secretary, Bill Hazel", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-to-reappoint-mcdonnells-health-secretary-bill-hazel/2013/12/17/bcd73358-677f-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/18/Local-Politics/Images/McAuliffe_Health_Secretary-07af3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, terry mcauliffe, bill hazel, bob mcdonnell, mcdonnell health secretary, mcauliffe health secretary, virginia health secretary, virginia abortion, vaginal ultrasound, ultrasound abortion, til hazel, ken cuccinelli, war on women virginia, naral, tarina keene, janet howell, dick saslaw, richard saslaw, obamacare, obamacare medicaid expansion, medicaid expansion virginia, obamacare virginia", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "bcd73358-677f-11e3-ae56-22de072140a2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, terry mcauliffe, bill hazel, bob mcdonnell, mcdonnell health secretary, mcauliffe health secretary, virginia health secretary, virginia abortion, vaginal ultrasound, ultrasound abortion, til hazel, ken cuccinelli, war on women virginia, naral, tarina keene, janet howell, dick saslaw, richard saslaw, obamacare, obamacare medicaid expansion, medicaid expansion virginia, obamacare virginia"}, "article_summary": "But she added: \u201cWe will be watching closely to make sure that Secretary Hazel works to advance the Governor\u2019s women\u2019s health agenda.\u201d\nSome abortion rights activists blame Hazel for standing by as those policies were considered, even if he did not publicly champion them.\nRobert F.
