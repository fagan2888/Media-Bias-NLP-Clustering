Warren even declared in 2014 that a portion of President Obama\u2019s Omnibus bill \u201cwas written by Citigroup lobbyists.\u201d Few politicians have directly accused investment banks of writing U.S. laws.\n\nThe Massachusetts Senator was able to introduce the topic on a national stage, and even though Sanders has spent his entire career championing the same message, she succeeded in publicizing a sense of urgency. Warren paved the way for Bernie, and in doing so, helped the Sanders campaign undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s enormous political machine; a monstrosity that benefits from the status quo. I explain why Bernie Sanders has already made Clinton\u2019s political machine implode in the following YouTube segment.\n\nThe Atlantic has a provocative piece by Conor Friedersdorf that all Americans should read titled \u201cHillary Helps a Bank\u2013and Then It Funnels Millions to the Clintons.\u201d Let\u2019s just say the article gives some insight into why Hillary Clinton is paid millions for speaking engagements. If you haven\u2019t read Friedersdorf\u2019s article, then you won\u2019t know why there\u2019s so much desire to read Clinton\u2019s speech transcripts.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s political machine, which runs on a peculiar form of \u201chonest graft,\u201d as stated by Walter Russel Mead, has been undermined by a political revolution within the Democratic Party, and within American politics.\n\nNobody has been able to highlight why Bernie Sanders is needed by African Americans, Latinos, and all Democratic voters better than Tim Black in this powerful segment of Tim Black TV. Only Bernie Sanders has harnessed the full power of an electorate disgusted with politicians yet to disclose the transcripts of million dollar speeches. Nothing defines establishment politics better than a Democrat who takes money from the same interest that harm core constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nHillary Clinton has accepted campaign contributions from two major prison lobbyists, Wall Street, and the oil and gas industry, yet promises progressive stances against all these interests.\n\nIn fact, Marco Rubio and Clinton take almost the same amount of money from prison lobbyists, as stated in Vice article titled How Private Prisons Are Profiting From Locking Up US Immigrants:\n\nVICE reviewed federal campaign disclosures and found that lobbying firms linked to GEO and CCA have already contributed more than $288,300 to three of the leading candidates. Clinton\u2019s Ready for Hillary PAC received $133,246 from lobbying firms linked to GEO and CCA. Rubio\u2019s PACs and campaign have taken a total of $133,450 from private prison companies or groups that lobby on their behalf. Bush\u2019s campaign and his Right to Rise Super PAC have received $21,700 from lobbying groups affiliated with GEO and CCA.\n\nWhen Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton take essentially the same funding from GEO and CCA, and Jeb Bush actually receives less money than Clinton and Rubio, establishment politics proves ideology takes a back seat to cash.\n\nLike rival prison gangs, Republicans and Democrats will glare at each other across the yard, but cut lucrative deals when the guards (the American people, in this case) aren\u2019t looking.\n\nIn 2016, it\u2019s Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s economic message, along with Dr. Cornel West\u2019s social message, against America\u2019s political establishment. While Warren hasn\u2019t officially been picked as Vice President for Bernie Sanders, there\u2019s few better than Massachusetts\u2019s Senator. Anyone other than Warren or Nina Turner (Terrell Jermaine Starr has a brilliant interview with the Ohio State Senator), and I\u2019d be very disappointed, in addition to the fact that any other choice from Warren or Turner would halt the immense momentum of the campaign.\n\nAs for idealism versus pragmatism, it\u2019s not pragmatic to use a private server (\u201cIt was sitting there in the basement\u201d) for \u201cconvenience.\u201d Pragmatism, and \u201cgetting things done\u201d to both Sanders and Warren means breaking up Too Big to Fail Banks, reinstating Glass-Steagall, ensuring we never again rescue failed corporations (socialist George W. Bush forced nine major banks to \u201caccept partial nationalization\u201d and urged government to own private business in 2008), and solving the conundrum of massive wealth inequality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A political revolution within the Democratic Party has undermined Hillary Clinton's powerful political machine", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s political machine has been busted \u2014 thanks to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A political revolution within the Democratic Party has undermined Hillary Clinton's powerful political machine", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s political machine has been busted \u2014 thanks to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/09/hillary_clintons_political_machine_has_been_busted_thanks_to_bernie_sanders_and_elizabeth_warren/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/clinton_warren_sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A political revolution within the Democratic Party has undermined Hillary Clinton's powerful political machine", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s political machine has been busted \u2014 thanks to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/clinton_warren_sanders.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "H.A.
