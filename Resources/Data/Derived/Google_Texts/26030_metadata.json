(AP) - Marcus Murphy, who was the last of the Saints\u2019 nine 2015 draft picks, is showing the potential to emerge as one of their top kick and punt returners in his rookie season.\n\nAt the very least, coach Sean Payton likes what he\u2019s seen so far and wants to give Murphy ample opportunities to win the job.\n\nMurphy averaged 26.4 yards on five kickoff returns in Thursday night\u2019s preseason opener at Baltimore, with his longest return going 32 yards.\n\n\u201cWe drafted him, primarily first, for what we saw as a punt and kick returner,\u201d Payton said after Sunday\u2019s practice. \u201cHe did some good things the other night in the kick return game.\u201d\n\nMurphy, who spent his college career at Missouri as both a running back and return man, led the Southeastern Conference in all-purpose yards last season with 1,921. During his college career he brought back four punts and three kickoffs for touchdowns.\n\nYet many NFL teams passed on him, perhaps because at 5-foot-9, 195 pounds, he is small by NFL standards.\n\n\u201cPeople say I was overlooked, underrated,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI just want to be able to get an opportunity, and the Saints gave me an opportunity, so I just want to make the best of it.\u201d\n\nThe Saints have had success with smaller running backs who double as return men - namely, Darren Sproles, who in 2011 set an NFL record that still stands with 2,696 all-purpose yards.\n\nLike Sproles, Murphy has exceptional speed and agility, in addition to being deceptively strong for a player his size. He\u2019s already demonstrated he\u2019s not afraid to try to break tackles rather than veer out of bounds to avoid a hit.\n\n\u201cI am a smaller running back, so I just want to come out and show them that I can be elusive and I do have some toughness to me, too,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nHis teammates sound impressed by what they\u2019ve seen so far.\n\n\u201cHe can put his nose down and find that seam,\u201d said fullback Eric Lorig, who also plays on special teams. \u201cIn the running back game, he\u2019s getting more involved and he knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s a smart player. \u2026 Marcus seems to bring a lot to the table.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Murphy was the only player in the NCAA\u2019s Division I Football Bowl Subdivision to score touchdowns as rusher, receiver, punter returner and kick returner.\n\nAnd in the Saints\u2019 preseason opener, he easily scored a 3-yard touchdown on a run around the right end. So in discussing goals for his rookie season, he speaks in generalities and doesn\u2019t apply limits to what he can do.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is just to make the 53-man roster and contribute to the team in any way I can,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI consider myself as a playmaker, coming in with an open mindset, playing any position I can play.\u201d\n\nThird-year Saints quarterback Ryan Griffin, who is trying to secure the backup job behind Drew Brees, said Murphy has the potential to work his way into the offensive game plan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a special feel for the pass game. He\u2019s just got some instincts that are tough to teach, a little awareness of how to break routes off, how to set up routes,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of his strongest qualities and that\u2019s how we might use him this year.\u201d\n\nPayton also has mentioned Murphy\u2019s instincts, calling them \u201creally good\u201d in the return game. Payton added that he hopes his club can create more opportunities for Murphy to attempt more punt returns. He was only sent out to field one punt in Baltimore, and made a fair catch.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, as a punt returner and a kick returner, you have to play smart. So I\u2019m not going to be aggressive when I don\u2019t need to,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI want to show the coaches they can trust me, get confidence in me to make a smart judgment. If I need to fair catch it, I will. But if I have open space, I will return it.\u201d\n\nNotes: Payton said rookie linebacker Davis Tull, a fifth-round draft choice who began training camp on the physically unable to perform list, is healthy now. He had shoulder surgery in March. \u2026 Those sitting out practice on Sunday included cornerbacks Brandon Browner and Delvin Breaux, and linebacker Dannell Ellerbe, who all left the preseason opener in Baltimore with undisclosed injuries. \u2026 The Saints changed their practice schedule for the coming week. They will take Monday off and hold a morning practice and afternoon walk-through on Tuesday, which originally was scheduled as a day off. The Saints then host joint practices with the New England Patriots on Wednesday and Thursday before moving football operations from the Greenbrier Resort back to New Orleans on Friday.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marcus Murphy, who was the last of the Saints' nine 2015 draft picks, is showing the potential to emerge as one of their top kick and punt returners in his rookie season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Marcus Murphy, who was the last of the Saints\u2019 nine 2015 draft picks, is showing the potential to emerge as one of their top kick and punt returners in his rookie season.", "title": "Saints\u2019 Payton eager to see more of Murphy in return game", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/16/saints-payton-eager-to-see-more-of-murphy-in-retur/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/16/d462b22b5f870a247f0f6a706700c181.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/16/d462b22b5f870a247f0f6a706700c181.jpg", "description": "Marcus Murphy, who was the last of the Saints' nine 2015 draft picks, is showing the potential to emerge as one of their top kick and punt returners in his rookie season.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Saints\u2019 Payton eager to see more of Murphy in return game"}, "Author": "BRETT MARTEL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9afb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFirst and foremost, as a punt returner and a kick returner, you have to play smart.\n\u201cWe drafted him, primarily first, for what we saw as a punt and kick returner,\u201d Payton said after Sunday\u2019s practice.\nMurphy averaged 26.4 yards on five kickoff returns in Thursday night\u2019s preseason opener at Baltimore, with his longest return going 32 yards.\nPayton added that he hopes his club can create more opportunities for Murphy to attempt more punt returns.\nAt the very least, coach Sean Payton likes what he\u2019s seen so far and wants to give Murphy ample opportunities to win the job."}
