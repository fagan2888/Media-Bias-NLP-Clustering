This is the first such enrollment period since employers could assess the full financial impact of the federal health-care overhaul.\u201d\n\nThe Journal continues:\n\n\u201c\u2018We can\u2019t take our eyes off costs,\u2019 said Sally Welborn, senior vice president of global benefits at Wal-Mart. Ms. Welborn declined to say how much Wal-Mart will save from the plan changes.\u201d\n\nThis is a far cry from what Walmart wrote in its letter five years ago. At that time, it wrote, \u201cFrom a business perspective, health reform could not be more critical. A majority of Americans \u2014 158 million \u2014 receive their coverage through their job of their spouse\u2019s job, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But few businesses will be able to keep up the pace at which premiums are rising.\u201d\n\nWalmart\u2019s rosy prediction that costs would be contained as a result of \u201chealth reform,\u201d and the \u201cgood ideas\u201d that President Obama had \u201cput forward,\u201d have proven to be fanciful. According to the Journal, many part-time employees who liked their plans haven\u2019t been able to keep their plans:\n\n\u201cSeveral other retailers already have moved away from providing health insurance to part-time workers. Target Corp. earlier this year said it would stop offering such benefits, citing options available through public [Obamacare] exchanges. Home Depot Inc. last year ended health-care coverage for almost 20,000 part-time workers, while United Parcel Service Inc. cut coverage for workers\u2019 spouses who had access to insurance through their own employers\u2026.\n\n\u201cWal-Mart also is raising premiums for all workers next year. About 40% of enrolled workers are on its least expensive and most popular plan and will now pay $21.90 per two-week pay period, a 20% increase, starting Jan. 1. Across all three plans, Wal-Mart said it estimates workers will pay an additional $10 a pay period. The average Wal-Mart hourly worker earns $11.81 an hour.\n\n\u201c\u2018Half of my paycheck is gone before I even get the money,\u2019 said BJ Marhefka, 49 years old, who works about 40 hours a week in the Wal-Mart automotive department in Southport, N.C., and makes $10 an hour.\u201d\n\nIt seems that Obamacare\u2019s detested individual mandate has helped drive costs upward:\n\n\u201cFor Wal-Mart, [a] push from the individual mandate contributed to an influx of workers who signed up for coverage, jacking up costs. Wal-Mart, the country\u2019s largest private employer, with about 1.4 million employees, forecasts that its health-care costs will rise by $500 million more than it had expected in the year ending Jan. 31, 2015.\u201d\n\nThat same individual mandate will now coerce many of those who lost their plans to buy insurance through the Obamacare exchanges. There, taxpayers will often help pick up the tab \u2014 rather than Walmart, whose revenues are greater than any other company in America.\n\nIndeed, the Journal writes, \u201cWal-Mart has retained a third-party benefits adviser to help affected workers find coverage on public and private health exchanges or by using a spouse or partner\u2019s health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018We can\u2019t predict where they will go, but we are going to help them find affordable health care,\u2019 Ms. Welborn said.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a conservative alternative that would lower costs, secure liberty, and make sure that any American who wants to buy health insurance would be able to do so.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health Care,Jeffrey H.
