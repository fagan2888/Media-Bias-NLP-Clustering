I saw that, in this country, people trying to make ends meet in such a fashion still had to resort to food benefit programs and charity. I saw an employee fired for stealing lunches from the break room refrigerator to feed himself. I watched as a co-worker secretly brought her two kids into the store and left them to wander alone for hours because she couldn\u2019t afford childcare. (As it happens, 29% of low-wage employees are single parents.)\n\nAt that point, having worked at the State Department for 24 years, I had been booted out for being a whistleblower. I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen to me next and so took a series of minimum wage jobs. Finding myself plunged into the low-wage economy was a sobering, even frightening, experience that made me realize just how ignorant I had been about the lives of the people who rang me up at stores or served me food in restaurants. Though millions of adults work for minimum wage, until I did it myself I knew nothing about what that involved, which meant I knew next to nothing about twenty-first-century America.\n\nI was lucky. I didn\u2019t become one of those millions of people trapped as the \u201cworking poor.\u201d I made it out. But with all the election talk about the economy, I decided it was time to go back and take another look at where I had been, and where too many others still are.\n\nMy Working Life Now\n\nI found things were pretty much the same in 2016 as they were in 2012, which meant \u2014 because there was no real improvement \u2014 that things were actually worse.\n\nThis time around, I worked for a month and a half at a national retail chain in New York City. While mine was hardly a scientific experiment, I\u2019d be willing to bet an hour of my minimum-wage salary ($9 before taxes) that what follows is pretty typical of the New Economy.\n\nJust getting hired wasn\u2019t easy for this 56-year-old guy. To become a sales clerk, peddling items that were generally well under $50 a pop, I needed two previous employment references and I had to pass a credit check. Unlike some low-wage jobs, a mandatory drug test wasn\u2019t part of the process, but there was a criminal background check and I was told drug offenses would disqualify me. I was given an exam twice, by two different managers, designed to see how I\u2019d respond to various customer situations. In other words, anyone without some education, good English, a decent work history, and a clean record wouldn\u2019t even qualify for minimum-wage money at this chain.\n\nAnd believe me, I earned that money. Any shift under six hours involved only a 15-minute break (which cost the company just $2.25). Trust me, at my age, after hours standing, I needed that break and I wasn\u2019t even the oldest or least fit employee. After six hours, you did get a 45-minute break, but were only paid for 15 minutes of it.\n\nThe hardest part of the job remained dealing with\u2026 well, some of you. Customers felt entitled to raise their voices, use profanity, and commit Trumpian acts of rudeness toward my fellow employees and me. Most of our \u201cvalued guests\u201d would never act that way in other public situations or with their own coworkers, no less friends. But inside that store, shoppers seemed to interpret \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d to mean that they could do any damn thing they wished. It often felt as if we were penned animals who could be poked with a stick for sport, and without penalty. No matter what was said or done, store management tolerated no response from us other than a smile and a \u201cYes, sir\u201d (or ma\u2019am).\n\nThe store showed no more mercy in its treatment of workers than did the customers. My schedule, for instance, changed constantly. There was simply no way to plan things more than a week in advance. (Forget accepting a party invitation. I\u2019m talking about childcare and medical appointments.) If you were on the closing shift, you stayed until the manager agreed that the store was clean enough for you to go home. You never quite knew when work was going to be over and no cell phone calls were allowed to alert babysitters of any delay.\n\nAnd keep in mind that I was lucky. I was holding down only one job in one store. Most of my fellow workers were trying to juggle two or three jobs, each with constantly changing schedules, in order to stitch together something like a half-decent paycheck.\n\nIn New York City, that store was required to give us sick leave only after we\u2019d worked there for a full year \u2014 and that was generous compared to practices in many other locales. Until then, you either went to work sick or stayed home unpaid. Unlike New York, most states do not require such a store to offer any sick leave, ever, to employees who work less than 40 hours a week. Think about that the next time your waitress coughs.\n\nMinimum Wages and Minimum Hours\n\nMuch is said these days about raising the minimum wage (and it should be raised), and indeed, on January 1, 2016, 13 states did raise theirs. But what sounds like good news is unlikely to have much effect on the working poor.\n\nIn New York, for instance, the minimum went from $8.75 an hour to the $9.00 I was making. New York is relatively generous. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 and 21 states require only that federal standard. Presumably to prove some grim point or other, Georgia and Wyoming officially mandate an even lower minimum wage and then unofficially require the payment of $7.25 to avoid Department of Labor penalties. Some Southern states set no basement figure, presumably for similar reasons.\n\nDon\u2019t forget: any minimum wage figure mentioned is before taxes. Brackets vary, but let\u2019s knock an even 10% off that hourly wage just as a reasonable guess about what is taken out of a minimum-wage worker\u2019s salary. And there are expenses to consider, too. My round-trip bus fare every day, for instance, was $5.50. That meant I worked most of my first hour for bus fare and taxes. Keep in mind that some workers have to pay for childcare as well, which means that it\u2019s not impossible to imagine a scenario in which someone could actually come close to losing money by going to work for short shifts at minimum wage.\n\nIn addition to the fundamental problem of simply not paying people enough, there\u2019s the additional problem of not giving them enough hours to work. The two unfortunately go together, which means that raising the minimum rate is only part of any solution to improving life in the low-wage world.\n\nAt the store where I worked for minimum wage a few years ago, for instance, hours were capped at 39 a week. The company did that as a way to avoid providing the benefits that would kick in once one became a \u201cfull time\u201d employee. Things have changed since 2012 \u2014 and not for the better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not even raising it to $15 an hour would solve the problems many low-income workers face in America", "title": "Minimum wage, minimum chance of a future: This is how horrible living on the minimum wage has become", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Not even raising it to $15 an hour would solve the problems many low-income workers face in America", "title": "Minimum wage, minimum chance of a future: This is how horrible living on the minimum wage has become", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/18/nickel_and_dimed_in_2016_you_cant_earn_a_living_on_the_minimum_wage_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/minimum-wage.jpeg9-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Not even raising it to $15 an hour would solve the problems many low-income workers face in America", "title": "Minimum wage, minimum chance of a future: This is how horrible living on the minimum wage has become", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/minimum-wage.jpeg9-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Peter Van Buren", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Minimum wage, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen to me next and so took a series of minimum wage jobs.\nMinimum Wages and Minimum HoursMuch is said these days about raising the minimum wage (and it should be raised), and indeed, on January 1, 2016, 13 states did raise theirs.\nThe current federal minimum wage is $7.25 and 21 states require only that federal standard.\nDon\u2019t forget: any minimum wage figure mentioned is before taxes.\nAt the store where I worked for minimum wage a few years ago, for instance, hours were capped at 39 a week."}
