Conservative radio talk show host Mark Levin is appealing to Republican lawmakers to boycott President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech Jan. 28 as a symbolic gesture “to give the American people a choice between liberty and tyranny.”Long a harsh critic of the president and his policies, particularly Obamacare, Levin railed against Obama again on Thursday, calling him a “lawless president,” Mediaite.com reported . He suggested the boycott as a last ditch effort to stop his policies since Congress is “not going to take a stand constitutionally and legally.”“Here's what should happen at the State of the Union speech,” Levin began. “Since these men and women will not use the Constitution to defend this nation, since they will not use the Constitution to confront a lawless president — worse yet, since they are funding his activities with these omnibus bills filled with all kinds of crap — what the Republicans should do is boycott the State of the Union.”By such a “bold” act, he said, half of the House floor will be empty and it will grab the attention of the American people and the media, “which will attack it, but cannot ignore it.”“It would be historic, it would be profound, that finally the opposition party demonstrates that it opposes not just the Democrat Party, but the destruction of this republic, but this president and his willing dupes in Congress," he added.He suggested Republicans present their own State of the Union by, perhaps, joining together on the steps of the Capitol to lay out their case against the president's agenda.Among the subjects the president is expected to address when he appears before a joint session of the 113th Congress are jobs, the economy, tax reform, and immigration, the latter an issue that has sharply divided lawmakers and made headlines at the last State of the Union when House Speaker John Boehner remained seated while the audience rose to applaud Obama’s call for immigration reform, Bloomberg reports.In an apparent effort to engage more young people, the White House is again calling on Americans to “take part” in the president’s address by joining its State of the Union social blog this year, where members can watch the speech on line, share graphics with their own social networks, and to discuss Obama's remarks with White House officials immediately following the address.”Those interested can apply for a chance to join in the conversation at WhiteHouse.gov/social “Officially launching early next week, WhiteHouse.gov/SOTU will be your number one resource for all things State of the Union, and the best place to watch the enhanced Livestream of President Obama’s address, featuring charts, graphs, data and more to help explain the issues and policies he’s discussing alongside the remarks,” the White House announced on its blog earlier this week.
