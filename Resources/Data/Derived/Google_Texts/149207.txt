Ã— One Arrested In Franklin County After Failing To Yield On Interstate

RIVER VALLEY (KFSM) Arkansas State Police say one man was arrested after failing to yield on Interstate 40 going eastbound Sunday (August 16) afternoon in Crawford County.

According to Arkansas State Police, an officer with the Arkansas Highway Police was behind the driver of a box truck, and the driver failed to yield when the officer had his lights and sirens on. It is unclear why the Arkansas Highway Police officer initially had the lights and sirens on.

Highway police asked state police for help, and two state police units used a spike strip system on the interstate. Another state police trooper also arrived on the scene to follow the highway police officer behind the driver of the truck.

The driver of the box truck drove over the spike strip, and was able to continue traveling eastbound for several miles, according to police.

The tires eventually deflated and the vehicle was disabled near Ozark.

The driver of the truck was arrested and is being held at the Franklin County Detention Center. It is unclear at this time what charges he could face.

The driver of the truck was the only person in the vehicle, and police said it is believed the fastest the truck was traveling was at 75 mph.
