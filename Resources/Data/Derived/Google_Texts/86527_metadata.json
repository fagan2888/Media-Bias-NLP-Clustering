Although it still has a little way to go, Centene (CNC) is again getting closer to its 10-week line, which could provide another buying opportunity.\n\nCentene, which broke out from a base in September, has pulled back in soft volume, signaling that big investors are not the the ones behind the selling. Centene hasn\u2019t had a down week in above-average trade since the week that ended Sept. 5. Turnover was huge that week, when Centene was added to the S&P MidCap 400 index.\n\nThe stock has seen strong accumulation lately. Both its up/down volume ratio and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating are still at high levels.\n\nSt. Louis, Mo.-based Centene provides managed health care services. Business for Centene has ramped up thanks to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which has also helped other managed-care providers.\n\nThe company\u2019s push into a variety of state health care exchanges and states\u2019 turning over Medicaid patients to managed-care firms also helped to increase membership. At the end of 2014, Centene had nearly 4.1 million members, up about 41% from 2013.\n\nCentene reports first-quarter results before the market open on April 28. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see profit rising 20% to 48 cents a share. Sales are expected at a record $5.12 billion, up 48% from a year ago. That result would extend a long streak of double-digit gains.\n\nThe HMO industry group has been a market leader, and on Thursday it got a boost when UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the nation\u2019s biggest health insurer, posted first-quarter earnings and sales that beat analysts\u2019 expectations.
