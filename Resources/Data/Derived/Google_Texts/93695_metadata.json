Health-care-related construction is at a seven-year high in the Twin Cities, with vacancy rates in existing facilities under 10 percent and numerous \u201con-campus\u201d (in-patient) and \u201coff-campus\u201d (out-patient) projects underway.\n\nConsider this snapshot of projects in progress in the health care sector:\n\nThe 330,000-square-foot University of Minnesota Ambulatory Care Center in Minneapolis.\n\nThe 120,000-square-foot expansion at Fairview Ridges Hospital in Burnsville.\n\nThe 57,479-square-foot expansion at Fairview Southdale Hospital in Edina.\n\nA planned 57,000-square-foot addition to the Southdale Medical Center in Edina.\n\nThe 63,000-square-foot North Memorial Health Care building in Minnetonka.\n\nA planned 128,000-square-foot, four-story HealthPartners on Phalen Boulevard in St. Paul.\n\nAccording to a Cushman & Wakefield/NorthMarq Compass report released over the summer, more than 900,000 square feet of health care-related projects are already under construction and another 413,000 square feet of projects are in the planning stages. Vacancies in the medical office sector are at 9.7 percent \u2014 about half the 17.4 percent vacancy for general office space.\n\nAt the time of the report, 13 medical office buildings totaling just under a million square feet were under construction in the metro area.\n\n\u201cIs it a boom? I\u2019m not so sure I would call it that,\u201d said Camille Helou, vice president and director of Kraus-Anderson\u2019s Healthcare Group. \u201cIt\u2019s a shift \u2014 from an inpatient environment to more of an outpatient environment. So, more money is being spent in specialty and primary care clinics and ambulatory care centers than on hospitals.\u201d\n\nIndeed, projects such as clinics, ambulatory care centers and other sources for routine care are being built at a swifter rate than traditional hospitals and other in-patient care centers. Eagan-based MSP Commercial, for example, is either developing or redeveloping clinics for Allina in Champlin and Oakdale, and for Children\u2019s Hospital in Woodbury. Meanwhile, ambulatory care centers are going up in Coon Rapids, Maple Grove and the East Bank of the University of Minnesota.\n\nCredit Obamacare\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the activity? One likely reason is the implementation of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has provided access to health care insurance for about 180,000 Minnesotans.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, and similar state-level programs are driving huge numbers of new patients into the health care system, forcing providers to restructure their delivery models \u2014 in short, to go where the people are.\n\nAccording to Helou, while some outpatient efficiencies were realized by providers before the ACA, a current issue that\u2019s driving development activity is how to comply with federal and state regulations around the act.\n\n\u201cWe all knew that primary care and specialty care were where the focus should be prior to the ACA,\u201d Helou said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think many health care providers spent a lot of time and energy to go that way before the ACA was implemented.\u201d\n\nTom Stella, senior director of Brokerage Services for Bloomington-based Cushman & Wakefield/NorthMarq, contributed to the recent Compass report and agreed that the ACA was a significant spark in the current wave of projects.\n\n\u201cACA spurred it,\u201d Stella said. \u201cYou\u2019ve simply got more patients that you\u2019re going to be seeing because of it. They have to figure out how to attract and serve that volume.\u201d\n\nBut Obamacare isn\u2019t the only factor in play. Stella said his company foresaw the activity at least in part because a number of projects were being discussed \u2014 but not started \u2014 over the past several years while hospital systems were dealing with the recession and converting their medical records to electronic formats.\n\n\u201cThose things put a huge capital drain on all systems \u2014 development and new deals went by the wayside for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that those constraints are gone, they\u2019re trying to figure out how to best compete in this environment. They want to get out into communities and away from campuses.\u201d\n\nSeeking efficiency\n\nAlong with the natural consequences of pent-up demand, there\u2019s the growing prevalence of health care systems that are looking at their service areas as retail markets. With more health care options, patients are doing more shopping around, according to Alex Young, vice president of development at Eagan-based MSP Commercial.\n\n\u201cAll the systems want patients to have more choices about where they go, who they\u2019re insured by, who they\u2019re treated by,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been driving a lot of the construction.\u201d\n\nEven so, the activity in health care construction is still subject to cyclical forces and will likely level off soon, according to Stella. In the meantime, there are still enough projects in the discussion and planning stages to hold the interest of developers and construction professionals. Helou pointed to the planned consolidation of clinics owned by Hennepin County Medical Center, a project for which the selection process started recently.\n\n\u201cLike all development, this market will become saturated, and then it will slow down,\u201d said Stella. \u201cBut this will continue for a little while.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 900,000 square feet of health care-related projects are already under construction and another 413,000 square feet of projects are in the planning stages.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Dan Heilman", "og": {"site_name": "Finance & Commerce", "description": "More than 900,000 square feet of health care-related projects are already under construction and another 413,000 square feet of projects are in the planning stages.", "title": "Why is health care construction at 7-year high?", "url": "http://finance-commerce.com/2014/10/why-is-health-care-construction-at-7-year-high/", "image": "http://finance-commerce.com/files/2014/10/Ambulatory4.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Why is health care construction at 7-year high?Finance & Commerce", "keywords": "affordable care act,ambulatory care center,compass report,cushman & wakefield/northmarq,fairview ridges hospital,fairview southdale hospital,healthpartners,kraus-anderson,msp commercial,north memorial health care,obamacare,southdale medical center", "fb": {"admins": 1425649256}, "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "google-site-verification": "fsxlPNyjZwLPAj0KJhrcPjWL_3CXdi71oKBTOnATRU8", "thumbnail": "http://finance-commerce.com/files/2014/10/Ambulatory4-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf762\"", "article_summary": "Consider this snapshot of projects in progress in the health care sector:The 330,000-square-foot University of Minnesota Ambulatory Care Center in Minneapolis.\nOne likely reason is the implementation of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which has provided access to health care insurance for about 180,000 Minnesotans.\nIf you look out your window and don\u2019t see a clinic or other health care facility under construction, don\u2019t worry \u2014 one might be going up near you soon.\nThe 63,000-square-foot North Memorial Health Care building in Minnetonka.\nWith more health care options, patients are doing more shopping around, according to Alex Young, vice president of development at Eagan-based MSP Commercial."}
