SALT LAKE CITY (ABC 4 Utah) â€“ With just a few weeks left, the 113th Congress of the United States is widely considered one of the least productive of all time.



Nearly 400 bills passed the house and sat in the senate.



Representative Chris Stewart, of Utah's 2nd Congressional District sees a new standard coming in the new year.



"Finally, we're going to have a chance to hear those bills, to debate and to have a vote on those bills," said Stewart, (R) UT.



That's because the midterm election brought a new wave of republican control.



It was increased in the house and flipped in the senate.



Stewart says he and his party colleagues are ready to capitalize.



"We want to push those issues to try to help the American people. Create jobs, get the economy growing, help with energy development, actually deal with ISIS instead of turn an eye to the threat that's happening in the middle east," said Stewart.



Stewart expects the next congress to approve the Keystone Pipeline, the REIGNS Act, to limit power of regulatory agencies and repeal the Medical Device Tax in the Affordable Care Act among other things.



That doesn't mean an instant path to becoming law.



The Executive Branch, controlled by democrats must still sign off.



"I think he is going to sign some of them, maybe many of them. We'll see, but we are excited to see what happens in the next few months," says Stewart.



Stewart says the Keystone Pipeline would create 40,000 jobs and economic development in states that really need it.



He says it would likely be vetoed by the president, but thinks there just may be enough support from both parties to produce a veto proof majority.
