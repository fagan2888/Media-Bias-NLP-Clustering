Nathan MacKinnon will put his 13-game point streak on the line, which is already the highest in NHL history for an 18-year-old, and the Avs will hope to beat the Blues for the first time this season.\n\nIt\u2019s a big game, no doubt, but Avs coach Patrick Roy doesn\u2019t want his team thinking it\u2019s anything more than just one game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great situation to be in,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWhen we started the season, we had the objective to surprise the world of hockey. We also had the objective to take it one day at a time. We haven\u2019t changed. We\u2019re going to continue to go in that direction. (Saturday), it\u2019s the St. Louis Blues that are in Denver at 1 o\u2019clock. We\u2019re not looking at it any more than that. It is a good test for us. By winning this game, we have a chance to be even closer to them.\u201d\n\nThe Avs will start Semyon Varlamov in goal. The Blues recently acquired veteran goalie Ryan Miller from Buffalo, and St. Louis is 3-0 since getting him. The Blues also have handled the Avs easily in their only two matchups so far with Colorado, winning both by a combined 11-4 margin.\n\nBut Roy said he thinks the Avs are a \u201cdifferent team since then,\u201d having made some adjustments in their game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing against one of the best teams in the league and it\u2019s a great situation to be so close to them. That means you\u2019ve been doing something good as well,\u201d Roy said.\n\nThe Avs did not practice Friday, but did do some off-ice conditioning.\n\n\u201cThis is a game we\u2019ve had circled on our calendar for a while now,\u201d Avs center Matt Duchene said. \u201cThey\u2019re a real good team, but we\u2019re looking forward to the challenge.\u201d\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs\u2019 Nathan MacKinnon putting point streak on line Saturday vs. Blues", "title": "Avs\u2019 Nathan MacKinnon putting point streak on line Saturday vs. Blues", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/07/avs-nathan-mackinnon-putting-point-streak-on-line-saturday-vs-blues/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130925__nathan-mackinnon-avs-092513bp1-2.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130925__nathan-mackinnon-avs-092513bp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-07T15:53:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:19:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea3c\"", "article_summary": "(Saturday), it\u2019s the St. Louis Blues that are in Denver at 1 o\u2019clock.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a real good team, but we\u2019re looking forward to the challenge.\u201dAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater\nThe Blues recently acquired veteran goalie Ryan Miller from Buffalo, and St. Louis is 3-0 since getting him.\nIt will be a sold-out Pepsi Center on Saturday afternoon when the Avalanche hosts the St. Louis Blues, with the teams separated by just three points in the Central Division.\nIt\u2019s a big game, no doubt, but Avs coach Patrick Roy doesn\u2019t want his team thinking it\u2019s anything more than just one game."}
