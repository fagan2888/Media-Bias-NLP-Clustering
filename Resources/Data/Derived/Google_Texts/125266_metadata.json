Detective Tommy Roberts has been following the case since earlier in the fall and obtained \u201can indictment on the charge\u201d last Wednesday. From the Murfreesboro Post:\n\n\u201cRoberts began investigating the case in September when evidence showed Yocca went to her upstairs bathroom, filled the tub with water, got in and tried to \u2018self-abort\u2019 her pregnancy using a coat hanger, the report shows.\n\nShe became \u2018alarmed and concerned for her safety when she saw a great deal of blood in the tub, and her boyfriend took her to St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital emergency room. From there, she was transported to St. Thomas Mid-Town in Nashville where staff members saved \u2018Baby Yocca,\u2019 the report shows.\u201d\n\nAlthough the baby boy survived, he only weighed 1.5 pounds at delivery and his \u201cquality of life \u2018will be forever harmed.\u2019 He will need a medically-experienced foster parent, remain on oxygen and take medication daily because of problems with his eyes, lungs, and heart stemming from damage caused by the coat hanger.\u201d He will likely encounter additional medical problems as he grows older.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoberts tells the Post that according to the nurses and doctors he interviewed, Yocca had voiced a desire to terminate her pregnancy with a coat hanger when she was 24 weeks pregnant. She allegedly made other \u201cdisturbing statements\u201d regarding the fetus.\n\nYocca has been incarcerated with bail set at $200,000.\n\nSponsored\n\nContact the author at rachel.vorona.cote@jezebel.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Abortion, Anna Yocca, Self-Abortion, Pregnancy, Women&#39;s Health, First Degree Attempted Murder, Jezebel", "author": "Rachel Vorona Cote", "og": {"site_name": "Jezebel", "description": "A Tennessee woman who attempted self-abortion six months into her pregnancy has been charged with attempted murder in the first degree.", "title": "Woman Attempts Self-Abortion, Is Charged With Attempted Murder", "url": "http://jezebel.com/woman-attempts-self-abortion-is-charged-with-attempted-1747832896", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--9nx8vyN---/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/r8reeuwuimkb5qeougft.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Tennessee woman who attempted self-abortion six months into her pregnancy has been charged with attempted murder in the first degree.", "title": "Woman Attempts Self-Abortion, Is Charged With Attempted Murder", "url": "http://jezebel.com/woman-attempts-self-abortion-is-charged-with-attempted-1747832896", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--9nx8vyN---/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/r8reeuwuimkb5qeougft.jpg", "site": "@jezebel", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7IykX4GV--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"app_id": 40338819712}, "dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-621051396171a9ade757cbbd77315ea6.css", "keywords": "Abortion, Anna Yocca, Self-Abortion, Pregnancy, Women&#39;s Health, First Degree Attempted Murder, Jezebel", "google-site-verification": "y-C42IsCl0lD8sGq7_zkNy87OIpl7gFSn3Km346YC48", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2gXbBeUI--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "description": "A Tennessee woman who attempted self-abortion six months into her pregnancy has been charged with attempted murder in the first degree."}, "article_summary": "A Tennessee woman who attempted self-abortion six months into her pregnancy has been charged with attempted murder in the first degree.\nAccording to the Murfreesboro Post, 31-year-old Anna Yocca tried to terminate her pregnancy with a coat hanger.\nShe became \u2018alarmed and concerned for her safety when she saw a great deal of blood in the tub, and her boyfriend took her to St. Thomas Rutherford Hospital emergency room.\nDetective Tommy Roberts has been following the case since earlier in the fall and obtained \u201can indictment on the charge\u201d last Wednesday.\nAdvertisementRoberts tells the Post that according to the nurses and doctors he interviewed, Yocca had voiced a desire to terminate her pregnancy with a coat hanger when she was 24 weeks pregnant."}
