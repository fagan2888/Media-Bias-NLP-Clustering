AB InBev said Asahi's acquisition of the brands was conditional on the successful closing of its takeover of SAB.

Asahi Group had said in February that it was in exclusive talks to buy SAB's Peroni, Grolsch and Meantime beer brands for 2.55 billion euros ($2.9 billion), as it looks to offset slow growth in its home market.

The sale is part of AB InBev's plan to secure antitrust approval for its $100 billion-plus takeover of SAB, agreed last year.
