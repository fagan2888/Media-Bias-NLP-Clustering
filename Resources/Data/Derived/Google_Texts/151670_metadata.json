He will miss his last day of work as chairman and chief executive of the state\u2019s largest health system.\n\nTo people who know Evans, this is an unusual turn since he has been ever-present his entire career. Evans has never ducked responsibility or attention, whether he was helping then-Mayor Richard Lugar in the first administration following Uni-Gov, establishing a significant law practice at Baker and Daniels or sorting out the late-1980s federal savings-and-loan meltdown.\n\nThe same is true of his nearly 14-year run atop IU Health, a period that saw incredible consolidation and presented formidable management challenges. Since 2002, Evans has navigated the combination of Methodist Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children and the IU School of Medicine through monumental changes in health-care delivery and finance, drawing on his experience all the way.\n\nNow the system of 2,111 physicians and almost 30,000 staff that generated nearly $6 billion in revenue has a detailed management plan and an experienced successor, Dennis Murphy, who has been groomed to take over May 1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the next phase for the organization,\u201d Evans said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s time to establish a more robust partnership with the other side of the house and that\u2019s a five- to 10-year play at minimum.\u201d\n\nDaniel Evans, IU Health\u2019s chief executive officer and president, will retire in May 2016. He has led the health-care system through unprecedented growth for the past 13 years.

It requires taking the charts that line three walls of a conference room at the Fairbanks Hall headquarters \u2014 and all the thinking behind them \u2014 and making it relatable to those who interact with patients.\n\nIt\u2019s a tall order, and Evans employs two methods for conveying the information. He starts by describing the three phases of IU Health since the integration of Methodist, Riley and IU Hospital in 1997, then known as Clarian Health.\n\nThe first five years, the entities were \u201cseparate but equal.\u201d They all were hospitals, but they each had a strong identity and unique heritage. Negotiations were even necessary to determine the placement of the hospitals' names in the Clarian logo.\n\nNext came what Evans calls the \u201cFederation period,\u201d which he said ran from 2002 to 2010. This was a strong period of growth as the combined entity scooped up physician practices and regional hospitals. The Simon Cancer Center and the Neuroscience Center were established, and Riley experienced rapid growth.\n\nThe past five years have been marked by an integration that began by rebranding the enterprise IU Health and centralizing administration. It also meant enacting a consistent and high quality of care to make it standard across the entire system, a difficult process.\n\nTwo years ago, nurses in the system got serious about organizing as a union before the effort stalled last fall. Earlier this month, a prominent transplant doctor resigned to take a position at the University of Alabama, complaining that the IU Health system\u2019s priorities were out of whack.\n\nAll of these things were happening at the same time as the Affordable Care Act, further complicating the executive team\u2019s ability to mesh medical education, research and clinical care in a single entity.\n\nUnderlying these changes are questions about who pays and how much they pay for health care. Evans sees the trends as two curves. The first is the existing curve, a fee-for-services model that is often unfathomable for the patient, insurer, doctor and hospital. The second curve, when payments are made to forestall medical problems or improve conditions when they occur, is emerging thanks to moves by the federal government through Medicare and locally through the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0. The shift is profound.\n\n\u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety in the system,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt\u2019s what has caused the bumps in the road.\u201d\n\nEvans\u2019 experiences equipped him to deal with those bumps, to develop and implement a business model that Murphy and others will use to make IU Health succeed. The experience included transgenerational ties with Methodist hospital.\n\nEvans\u2019 great-great grandfather, Benjamin F. Crabbs, was among the Methodists who agreed in 1899 to raise money for a hospital. Evans\u2019 grandfather, Frank C. Evans, married Crabbs\u2019 daughter and was among the hospital\u2019s early board members. Frank's son, Evans\u2019 father, also served on the Methodist board.\n\nDan Evans Sr. was the head of the L.S. Ayres department store and imparted a retailer\u2019s sensibility to his son. Like his dad, Evans walks the floors of the IU Health hospitals to hear what people are saying and to see what they\u2019re doing. He was walking the hospitals of Methodist Hospital on Christmas Eve in 2014 when he first learned of discontent among the nursing staff.\n\nEvans\u2019 preparation included serving clients in his law practice, but it also stems from his stints as a young staffer to Lugar and relationships he made then. It stems from his political activity on the 1976 campaign of former Gov. Otis Bowen and Dan Quayle\u2019s 1980 and \u201986 U.S. Senate campaigns.\n\nAnd Evans holds a rare distinction: two presidential recess appointments \u2014 both for the same post. One hanging on the wall of his office is signed by Secretary of State James Baker and President George H.W. Bush. It is from 1990, when Bush appointed Evans to lead the Federal Housing Finance Board, which was created to clean up the mess created by the collapse of the savings-and-loan industry.\n\nEvans chaired the federal board from Indianapolis and used the power granted by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act to right the industry and regain the confidence necessary to spark economic recovery. He served into President Bill Clinton\u2019s term before resigning.\n\n\u201cBy the time I got here,\u201d Evans said of IU Health, \u201ccomplex environments and how they impact social issues wasn\u2019t really new to me.\u201d\n\nEvans turns 67 on Tuesday (April 19) and has plenty of energy and time to pursue his many interests. He\u2019ll remain engaged on several civic and corporate boards and spend a little time investing in worthy local ventures.\n\nAnd Evans plans to be present with his family, sorting through the vast personal records that stretch across generations and spending time with his grandchildren, too, to ensure a worthy legacy.\n\nJohn Ketzenberger is president of the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization to research state budget and tax issues.
