Peter Shumlin prepares to use the economist\u2019s math for single-payer health care.\n\nAs Vermonters anxiously await a Gruber-modeled financing plan for Green Mountain Care, modeling done for Colorado\u2019s health exchange by Jonathan Gruber Associates has proven wildly erroneous.\n\nIn 2011, following Colorado\u2019s decision to set up a state health exchange for Obamacare, the state hired Gruber to forecast enrollment trends from which the state and federal government could estimate costs.\n\nAccording to a presentation delivered to the Colorado Health Benefit Exchange Board on Sept. 16, 2011, Gruber predicted Medicaid enrollment in Colorado would grow from 440,000 enrollees in 2011 to 710,000 enrollees in 2016.\n\nActual 2014 data reported by the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing shows the number of people enrolled in the state\u2019s Medicaid program has grown to more than 1.1 million \u2014 a miscalculation of about 400,000 enrollees.\n\nThe miscalculation is growing rapidly, as the state reported 12,533 new Medicaid sign-ups in the two-week period between Nov. 15 and Nov. 30.\n\n\u201cMedicaid and CHP+ enrollments over the last few weeks show that we are still finding and enrolling low-income Coloradans into coverage,\u201d Susan Birch, executive director of the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, said in a Dec. 2 news release.\n\nThe errors are significant for Vermont. Shumlin has denounced Gruber for video statements disparaging American voters and rejecting government transparency, but he has continued to defend Gruber\u2019s math.\n\nIn November, Shumlin said Gruber would continue to serve as \u201ca calculator\u201d for single-payer financing options, despite not receiving additional pay. State health officials assert Gruber is one of only a few people in the nation capable of providing customized health-care forecasting data for states. Importantly, the Gruber Microsimulation Model used for Colorado also is being used to create financing scenarios for Green Mountain Care.\n\n\u201cHis models can\u2019t be relied on for policy. They\u2019re not ready for prime time,\u201d Linda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center at the Independence Institute in Colorado, told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jonathan Gruber's projections for Medicaid enrollment in Colorado have been far off the mark, but Vermont still plans to use his estimates.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jonathan Gruber's projections for Medicaid enrollment in Colorado have been far off the mark, but Vermont still plans to use his estimates.", "title": "Gruber's Numbers for Colo.
