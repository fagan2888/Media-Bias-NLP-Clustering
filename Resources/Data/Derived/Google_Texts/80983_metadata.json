After all, Oklahoma\u2019s Jim Inhofe, a climate change denier, is expected to chair the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\nMoreover, the way the GOP won should have predicted that a victory would accelerate the burning of fossil fuel. After all, the oil magnate and climate change denying Koch brothers provided huge dark money backing for GOP candidates.\n\nBut in a press conference on Wednesday, Mitch McConnell \u2014 who will become majority leader in January \u2014 made it clear how central plans to burn more fossil fuels are to the Republicans. McConnell explicitly mentioned forcing the president to approve the Keystone pipeline. But he also envisioned something more. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had an energy bill in seven years,\u201d McConnell said, \u201cwe need to embrace the energy revolution that\u2019s going on in our country, promote it.\u201d\n\nThat might suggest McConnell envisions easing already inadequate rules on fracking. Coming from a coal-state senator, it also might mean efforts to make coal competitive again; in his presser, McConnell claimed Obama had launched a war on coal. Republicans have always wanted to open up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. And as David Dayen wrote in Salon earlier this week, Republicans may be disinclined to extend tax credits on solar panels (Dayen also predicted the Republicans would emphasize trade deals, which is another item McConnell confirmed he will do).", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We need to embrace the energy revolution,\" Mitch McConnell declared this week.
