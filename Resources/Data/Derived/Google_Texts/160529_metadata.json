Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was asked about her thoughts on the recent health care rollout crisis. She avoided actually answering the question and instead devolved into a weird chant about its affordability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s called the Affordable Care Act \u2026 \u201d she told a reporter. \u201cAffordable. Affordable. Affordable. Affordable. Affordable!\u201d\n\nThe fact of the matter is simple, though. No matter how many times or places \u2014 or with varying amounts of gusto \u2014 one tries to emphasize the first word of its title, the Affordable Care Act is far from \u2018affordable.\u2019\n\nFirst of all, there are the premiums. The CEO of Aetna predicted more than a year ago that healthcare premiums would likely double, and other health industry officials have since predicted similarly. Even more troubling, one unnamed swing-state insurer recently told The Hill that in some markets, the individual-market premiums under the ACA exchanges could even triple.\n\nThen are the hidden costs that simply don\u2019t appear in basic side-by-side premium comparisons. The Department of Health and Human Services examined a hypothetical 27-year-old in Texas with an annual income of $25,000. The government claimed this individual would pay between $133 and $145 for the silver plan. However, an outside analysis noted that this plan, in reality, would then be accompanied by a $5,000 deductible and a $6,350 out-of-pocket maximum costs. For this 27-year-old earning very little \u2014 and statistically also straddled with enormous student debt \u2014 the \u201caffordable\u201d coverage through the ACA could consume up to 30 percent of his or her income.\n\nEstimations this year predict that the average millennial enrolling in the exchanges will spend an average of $1,700 per year on out-of-pocket healthcare costs. However, those who refuse to buy into the exchanges and are forced to pay the penalty will spend approximately $348 in out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe numbers are plain. It\u2019s far more \u201caffordable\u201d to not enroll, and instead be punished by the government for being financially savvy.\n\nDespite this obvious gloom on the nation\u2019s healthcare horizon, Pelosi claims that the Affordable Care Act faced resistance not because it\u2019s poor policy, but rather because we just don\u2019t understand it. She called upon America to fix its purported collective ignorance: \u201cEverybody has to spread the word as to what this is.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Democrats, people are spreading the word about what Obamacare \u201cis.\u201d As information-sharing about the Act has increased, support has appropriately decreased.\n\nHowever, the federal government and progressive marketing organizations have tried wooing millennials not with information, but rather with tactics ranging from silly to insulting.\n\nWe all remember that infamous 20-something guy smugly sipping on hot cocoa in a snuggly onesie while clamoring to stay on his parents\u2019 insurance.\n\nThen there was \u201cBrosurance,\u201d an ad campaign featuring smiling frat boys holding up their red Solo cups, framed next to the mind-blowingly clever tag line: \u201cKeg stands are crazy. Not having health insurance is crazier.\u201d An equally awkward gem was the Colorado \u201cGot Insurance?\u201d campaign, successfully conveying excitement about having sex.\n\n\u201cOMG, he\u2019s hot!\u201d read the ad. \u201cLet\u2019s hope he\u2019s as easy to get as this birth control.\u201d\n\nApparently, today\u2019s progressives, supported by the Democratic wing, have sadly reduced the millennial generation to oblivious partiers who have no desire or ability to process information. Such dumbed-down tactics are disrespectful to millennials\u2019 hard work and diligence, evidenced in their salaries \u2014 which the government undeniably needs to fund this flailing program.\n\nThankfully, millennials didn\u2019t actually fall for the ignorance-infused wooing tactics. They are over the broken promises of 2008\u2019s \u201cHope and Change.\u201d They are looking at the Act for \u201cwhat it is.\u201d And they\u2019re not impressed.\n\nA recent Harvard University Institute of Politics survey found that a majority of millennials, an age group historically supportive of progressive programming, disapprove of Obamacare. A majority rightfully believes that personal costs will increase and quality of care decrease. Only 10 percent believe the opposite \u2013 that their healthcare will be more \u201caffordable.\u201d\n\nPelosi is right about one thing, however. It is time to continue to spread the word about \u201cwhat this is.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is this: a mechanism by which government sloppily attempts to spread fiscal responsibilities, further crippling the millennial generation already straddled with unprecedented amounts of individual student debt, a broken entitlement system, an anemic economy and an ever-skyrocketing national debt. It\u2019s a taxpayer-subsidized logistical nightmare month after month, one in which the administration and national leaders have resorted to ridiculous peer pressure campaigns to sway young people.\n\nOne thing it is certainly not, Pelosi, is \u201caffordable, affordable, affordable, affordable, affordable.\u201d Nice try.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Recently, Rep.
