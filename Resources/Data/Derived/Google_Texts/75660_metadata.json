Graduate assistants voted last month 668-127 to form a union affiliated with the National Education Association. But Hank Foley, interim campus chancellor, reportedly called the vote a \u201cstraw poll more than an official tally,\u201d and said that formal union recognition and students' employee status was a matter to be settled by the courts.\n\nThe lawsuit asserts that graduate assistants are public employees, and that such workers \u201chave a constitutional right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.\u201d Christian Basi, a spokesperson for the Columbia campus, didn\u2019t comment on the legal issue but told the Post-Dispatch that graduate employees are \u201can integral part\u201d of the university, and that administrators have \u201ccontinued to work collaboratively with graduate students to address many of their ongoing concerns.\u201d\n\nThe university\u2019s sudden -- and almost as suddenly revoked -- announcement last year that it was cutting health insurance subsidies for graduate students built on-campus momentum for a union. Emails recently obtained via open records requests by the Missourian, Columbia\u2019s student newspaper, show how administrators scrambled days before students arrived on campus last summer to understand whether and how new federal guidance on the Affordable Care Act conflicted with health insurance subsidies for graduate student employees.\n\nLeona Rubin, associate vice chancellor for graduate studies, proposed a series of options for dealing with the problem in one email, including, \u201cWe can just eliminate the subsidy program, save $4.5 million, and have everyone hate us (more). Legally we can do that since providing the subsidy is breaking federal law and we don\u2019t need to adhere to our offer letters.\u201d She added, \u201cWe need to move pretty quick on this as students are arriving and some may be enrolling in the insurance thinking it will be 100 percent paid. Also, our currently enrolled students with health care will lose it in 15 days.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "description": "University of Missouri at Columbia graduate employees are suing the university system\u2019s Board of Curators for union recognition, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.", "title": "Mizzou Grad Student Workers Sue for Union Recognition"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "robots": "follow, index", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "University of Missouri at Columbia graduate employees are suing the university system\u2019s Board of Curators for union recognition, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported."}, "article_summary": "University of Missouri at Columbia graduate employees are suing the university system\u2019s Board of Curators for union recognition, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\nGraduate assistants voted last month 668-127 to form a union affiliated with the National Education Association.\nAlso, our currently enrolled students with health care will lose it in 15 days.\u201d\nBut Hank Foley, interim campus chancellor, reportedly called the vote a \u201cstraw poll more than an official tally,\u201d and said that formal union recognition and students' employee status was a matter to be settled by the courts.\nEmails recently obtained via open records requests by the Missourian, Columbia\u2019s student newspaper, show how administrators scrambled days before students arrived on campus last summer to understand whether and how new federal guidance on the Affordable Care Act conflicted with health insurance subsidies for graduate student employees."}
