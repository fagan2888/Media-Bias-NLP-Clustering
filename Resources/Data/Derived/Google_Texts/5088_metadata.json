Jerome practices obstetrics and gynecology at Foxhall OB/GYN Associates in Spring Valley, an upper northwest suburb of Washington, D.C. Jerome has practiced there since 1982. Foxhall is also where Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s wife Dr. Sharon D. Malone practices.\n\nNo physician or staff at Foxhall is listed as a Medicaid provider on the D.C. Department of Health Care Finance\u2019s database. A phone call to the office confirmed that the practice does not accept Medicaid.\n\nHowever, John Foust, a Fairfax County supervisor, has made Medicaid a signature issue of his campaign against Comstock.\n\n\u201cBarbara Comstock would stop Virginians from receiving our own tax dollars back from Washington for the sake of her right-wing agenda\u2014and having balanced seven budgets in Fairfax, I can tell you that just doesn\u2019t make any fiscal sense,\u201d Foust said last month. \u201cBut Comstock\u2019s decision to once again go along with extremists in Richmond has real consequences for us: increasing healthcare costs for everyone, costing our state more money, and jeopardizing support for important priorities that we care about like education.\u201d\n\nFoust has said Obamacare is \u201cclearly a good thing\u201d and that not expanding Medicaid to rural hospitals \u201ccould be devastating.\u201d\n\nHe has also enlisted his wife to campaign on his behalf, with Jerome using her status as an OBGYN to lead \u201cWomen for Foust.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an OBGYN, it is essential to me that any politician I vote for know that a politician\u2019s place is not between a woman and her doctor,\u201d Jerome says on her husband\u2019s campaign website. \u201cLucky for me, I married a good one. I married a man who would never try to interfere with that relationship and make a woman\u2019s choice for her.\u201d\n\nShe also authored a post for Foxhall in support of the Affordable Care Act and expanding Medicaid, noting that the government program helps low-income women, though Medicaid is not accepted at her office.\n\n\u201cMost doctors and patients do not understand the implications of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she wrote in March. \u201cThe American College of OB-Gyn provided some information that is very useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you know that 20 [percent] of women between the ages of 18-64 in the U.S. do not have health insurance? The ACA will require nearly all Americans to carry health insurance or pay a fine,\u201d Jerome continues. \u201cThe ACA will give the states the option of expanding Medicaid to cover low income women, even if they are not pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are 18.6 million women who do not have health insurance now and are eligible for this coverage, and another 4.6 million low-income women who could benefit from Medicaid expansion,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRequests for comment from the Foust campaign were not returned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eric Holder's wife practices at same OBGYN-shunning clinic", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The OBGYN practice of Marilyn Jerome, the wife of Democratic congressional candidate John Foust, does not accept Medicaid, the Washington Free Beacon has learned.
