You want it to be tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe flip of the switch may not come as quickly as Lappe wants. But CU (5-6) is in the midst of a 12-day break before the start of Pac-12 Conference play on Jan. 2, and the Buffs believe that break has come at a good time.\n\n\u201cWe come back and we have a couple practices before (the opener, against Washington), and we should be ready,\u201d Swan said.\n\nCU has had a tough schedule to this point \u2014 realtimerpi.com ranks the Buffs\u2019 schedule as the 26th-toughest in the country \u2014 but it has struggled against the better teams on that slate.\n\nAs they go into Pac-12 play, the schedule only gets tougher.\n\nFive Pac-12 teams are currently ranked among the top 22 in The Associated Press poll, and that doesn\u2019t include Southern California or Oregon, which are both unranked despite undefeated records.\n\nCU is the only Pac-12 team with a losing record. Ranking near the bottom of the conference in field-goal percentage, field-goal percentage defense and rebounding margin has a lot to do with that.\n\nWhat gives the Buffs hope, however, is those puppies.\n\nOf the 10 active players on the roster, three are true freshmen and two are true sophomores. And those five are in the regular rotation.\n\n\u201cWe are a very young team,\u201d Swan said. \u201cAs much as we want to believe that that doesn\u2019t affect us and it isn\u2019t a factor in how we play, we\u2019re young and we\u2019re going to make mistakes and we\u2019re going to miss shots and we\u2019re going to run plays wrong. We\u2019re going to do that all that stuff. We\u2019re young.\u201d\n\nIf that young talent is willing to learn, the future could be quite good for CU. In order for that to happen, however, the Buffs need their veterans \u2014 such as Swan, junior Haley Smith and fourth-year junior Lauren Huggins \u2014 to train their puppies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re great players,\u201d Smith said of the their younger teammates. \u201cThey want to win and they\u2019re really passionate. So I think if they have someone to follow and they know exactly what\u2019s expected of them and what they need to do, I think they\u2019ll easily be able to follow that.\u201d\n\nWhether there\u2019s time to lead this young team to victories this season remains to be seen. Yet even after watching her team crumble in the middle of the game in Laramie on Monday, Lappe came away believing the Buffs are on their way.\n\n\u201cOverall, I see us playing better,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re executing better, we\u2019ve gotten better defensively.\n\n\u201c(The holiday break) might be exactly what we need to finish flipping the switch. We\u2019ve started it; we just have to finish it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado women\u2019s basketball still working through growing pains with young team", "title": "Colorado women\u2019s basketball still working through growing pains with young team", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/25/colorado-womens-basketball-still-working-through-growing-pains-with-young-team/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__CUNAU181p1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__CUNAU181p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T18:50:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:29:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are a very young team,\u201d Swan said.\nCU is the only Pac-12 team with a losing record.\nColorado senior Jamee Swan sees a lot of similarities in watching her young teammates get acclimated to college basketball.\nAs they go into Pac-12 play, the schedule only gets tougher.\n\u201cI do like this team, so I know we\u2019re going to figure it out,\u201d Buffaloes coach Linda Lappe said."}
