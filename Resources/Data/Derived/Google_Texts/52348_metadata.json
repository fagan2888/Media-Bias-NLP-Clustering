McConnell previously pledged that if his party won the majority, he would advance a vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The legislation is supported by the majority of Americans \u2013 women in higher numbers than men.\n\nThe federal version of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is based on model legislation developed by National Right to Life and was first enacted in Nebraska in 2010. Since then, nine other states have enacted the law.\n\n\u201cNo U.S. senator has done more for unborn children than Sen. Mitch McConnell,\u201d said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.\n\nAs reported by National Right to Life, \u201cMcConnell has been a key supporter of every major pro-life initiative to come before the U.S. Senate during his tenure, including current legislation to protect unborn children at 20 weeks, a point by which the unborn child is capable of experiencing great pain when being killed by dismemberment or other late abortion techniques.\u201d\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell is a stalwart defender of innocent human life and a tireless advocate for pro-life principles,\u201d said Margie Montgomery, executive director of Kentucky Right to Life.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged with the new pro-life Senate and look forward to a vote on our top legislative priority, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This compassionate, popular legislation will protect the lives of more than 18,000 unborn children per year,\u201d SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser said. \u201cLeader McConnell has a 100 percent pro-life voting record and has pledged to bring the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to the floor for a vote.\u201d\n\nLast month, McConnell said he would be willing to repeal Obamacare with a simple majority.\n\n\u201cLeader McConnell is and has always been committed to the full repeal of Obamacare, and he\u2019ll continue to lead efforts to repeal and replace it with patient-centered reforms that enable greater choice at lower costs. He knows it won\u2019t be easy, but he also believes that if Republicans are fortunate enough to take back the majority we\u2019ll owe it to the American people to try through votes on full repeal, the bill\u2019s most onerous provisions, and reconciliation,\u201d McConnell spokesman Brian McGuire wrote in an emailed statement.\n\nObamacare. It\u2019s the largest expansion of government-run health care in the history of the nation. It\u2019s the largest expansion of funding for the abortion industry since Roe . Wade. It\u2019s a health care scheme that has rationed health care by driving up costs for many Americans or causing them to lose their health insurance entirely.\n\nThe pro-life movement has been unanimous in its opposition to Obamacare because of these pro-life concern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate GOP Unanimously Elects Pro-Life Mitch McConnell Leader, Promises 5-Month Abortion Ban", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Fresh from their overwhelming victory on Election Day, handing them control of the Senate over pro-abortion Democrats led by Harry Reid, Senate Republicans have", "title": "Senate GOP Elects Pro-Life Mitch McConnell Leader, Promises 5-Month Abortion Ban", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/11/13/senate-gop-unanimously-elects-pro-life-mitch-mcconnell-leader-promises-5-month-abortion-ban/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/fetalpain2-190x123.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "senate gop unanimously elects pro-life mitch mcconnell leader,promises 5-month abortion ban", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe314b\"", "article_summary": "McConnell previously pledged that if his party won the majority, he would advance a vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\nThe Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act: bans abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and would save at least 18,000 lives a year.\nFresh from their overwhelming victory on Election Day, handing them control of the Senate over pro-abortion Democrats led by Harry Reid, Senate Republicans have unanimously elected pro-life Senator Mitch McConnell as their leader.\nThe federal version of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is based on model legislation developed by National Right to Life and was first enacted in Nebraska in 2010.\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\u201cWe are encouraged with the new pro-life Senate and look forward to a vote on our top legislative priority, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act."}
