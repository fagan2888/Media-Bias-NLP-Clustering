He was 75.\n\nOn Saturday, friends and family of the N.A.A.C.P. leader gathered near him home on the gulf to spread his ashes and honor his memory, and N.A.A.C.P. chapters across the country were invited to do the same.\n\nSeveral members of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P. joined in. At 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon they tossed flowers into the water near Watson Bayou in Panama City to remember Bond\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all connected and shows unity.\u201d Matthew Shack, a member of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P. said. \u201cSo he was a man about everything and he was everywhere.\u201d\n\nA handful of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P. members gathered at the water\u2019s edge of Watson Bayou and tossed flowers into the water as they mediated on Bond\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in college at Florida A&M, this was back during the 60s and you had the civil rights marches and Julian Bond came on campus and that was a big thing because we had seen him on TV and heard a lot of about him,\u201d Shack said. \u201cWhen he came on campus, he kind of related to us and we could talk the same language and he was just a dynamic person.\"\n\nThe Moorhouse College graduate was best known for his work as a Georgia lawmaker, N.A.A.C.P. leader and the first president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also helped to found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\n\"He had a unique way of connecting with young people,\u201d Dr. Rufus Wood, President of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P. said. \u201cEven a lot of the young civil rights activists, he taught them a lot of things and encouraged them, he inspired them and I think that's a great model. Again and that's why I think I\u2019m so inspired when I look at his life and the things he was able to do.\"\n\nBond\u2019s family said he had a great love for the water and wished his memory and legacy to be carried out with the tide.\n\n\"This was a way of connecting, especially in this area, all along from Panama City all the way to Pensacola all that water and inner waterways connect,\u201d Shack said. \"So even in his death, he's going to be everywhere.\"\n\nBond\u2019s family said in a statement that while they wanted to lay him to rest privately, they do have plans for a larger celebration of his life very soon.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several members of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P. joined  at 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon to toss flowers into the water near Watson Bayou in Panama City to remember Bond\u2019s legacy.", "language": "english", "author": "Leanna Scachetti", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Locals-gather-remember-Julian-Bond--322606642.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_04311.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Several members of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P. joined  at 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon to toss flowers into the water near Watson Bayou in Panama City to remember Bond\u2019s legacy.", "title": "Locals gather, remember Julian Bond"}, "twitter": {"description": "Several members of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P. joined  at 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon to toss flowers into the water near Watson Bayou in Panama City to remember Bond\u2019s legacy.", "title": "Locals gather, remember Julian Bond", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Locals-gather-remember-Julian-Bond--322606642.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_04311.JPG", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Locals gather, remember Julian Bond", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Locals gather"}, "article_summary": "Julian Bond, an iconic civil rights leader and lawmaker, passed away last week at his home in Walton County.\n\u201cSo he was a man about everything and he was everywhere.\u201dA handful of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P.\nSeveral members of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P.\n\"He had a unique way of connecting with young people,\u201d Dr. Rufus Wood, President of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all connected and shows unity.\u201d Matthew Shack, a member of Bay County\u2019s N.A.A.C.P."}
