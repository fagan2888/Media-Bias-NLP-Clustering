'They were seriously worried that the calf was freezing and dying.' \"Rob Heusevelet, a father of a student, told the men to remove the bison from their car and warned they could be in trouble for having the animal. \" 'They didn't care,' Heusevelet says. 'They sincerely thought they were doing a service and helping that calf by trying to save it from the cold.' \"\n\nThe tourists were ticketed, but today the Park Service said that following the incident, the baby bison was rejected by its family.\n\n\"Interference by people can cause mothers to reject their offspring,\" the Park Service wrote in a statement. \"In this case, park rangers tried repeatedly to reunite the newborn bison calf with the herd. These efforts failed. The bison calf was later euthanized because it was abandoned and causing a dangerous situation by continually approaching people and cars along the roadway.\"\n\nThe bison, by the way, just became the U.S. national mammal.\n\nCopyright 2016 NPR.
