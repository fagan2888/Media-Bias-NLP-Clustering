As if having the right to say \u201cI do\u201d in all 50 states will solve everything. It won\u2019t. Tomorrow night, Sir Elton John and his longtime partner, David Furnish, will remind everyone at the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s annual national dinner that the HIV/AIDS epidemic still demands our attention. And they will challenge the LGBT community to act.\n\n\u201cThis is the critical moment in our fight, and so many of us don\u2019t seem to care. Even in our own community. Especially in our own community,\u201d John will say, according to prepared remarks he shared with me Friday. This comes after he rattles off some startling statistics from the Kaiser Family Foundation, including how \u201conly 30 percent of gay and bisexual men have had an HIV test in the past year. A majority of gay men don\u2019t even talk about HIV with their friends or partners. More than 60 percent don\u2019t even talk about HIV with their doctor.\u201d\n\nMusician and AIDS activist Sir Elton John said on Friday that his new partnership with PEPFAR, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, will work to create an \"AIDS-free society.\" (Reuters)\n\nJohn and Furnish will announce at the dinner a $300,000 grant to the HRC to assist in its HIV/AIDS prevention and advocacy around the root causes of the epidemic\u2019s spread. \u201cOur grant . . . is the beginning of a new initiative to refocus and reenergize the LGBT fight against AIDS,\u201d Furnish told me in an email. And in his prepared remarks he will decry the lack of compassion for those who contract HIV/AIDS, which only serves to help spread the disease.\n\nIf a young gay man won\u2019t get tested because he\u2019s afraid of the stigma attached to HIV, that\u2019s how the virus spreads. If a former prisoner can\u2019t get the medicine she needs to bring her viral levels down, because no one cares about prisoners, that\u2019s how HIV spreads. If a drug user won\u2019t bother with rehabilitation or HIV prevention because he has been told time and again that his life is worthless, that is how HIV spreads.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 50,000 people become HIV positive every year. Most of them are young African American men who have sex with men. Most of them live in the South. Compounding the impact of the silence in the gay community is the opposition to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. As I wrote last month, HIV/AIDS continues to rage in the South.\n\n\n\n(Courtesy AIDSVu)\n\nThis devastating map and others like it were brought to my attention by Lauren Banks of AIDS Alabama. It turns out that her organization and many like it are supported by the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF). According to Funders for LGBTQ Issues, not only is EJAF the largest funder of gay organizations in the South, it is also the No. 1 funder of black LGBT organizations.\n\n\u201cWe now know that AIDS thrives where it\u2019s ignored. So it\u2019s no surprise that the South, for example, is the new American epicenter for AIDS. Or that African Americans are eight times more likely to contract HIV than whites. Many Southern states don\u2019t provide proper treatment options for AIDS, or have LGBT-friendly health care policies. And the African American community has been neglected for too long,\u201d John told me. \u201cThese failures have nothing to do with science, and everything to do with getting health care and information to the marginalized groups that need it most. That\u2019s why we support organizations that help the people and communities that are being ignored. The real fight against AIDS is taking place in low-income communities, in the rural south, and in the inner-city. That\u2019s where we need to get to work.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the grant to the HRC, John and Furnish will soon announce another $1.1 million in grants to organizations battling HIV/AIDS. In D.C., where HIV/AIDS is an epidemic on par with West Africa, EJAF funding has gone to AIDS United, HIPS and the National Black Justice Coalition.\n\n\u201cThanks to advancements in science and hard advocacy work, HIV is no longer a death sentence. Unfortunately, some members of the LGBT community have taken that to mean they can ignore the AIDS epidemic,\u201d Furnish told me. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to save us but ourselves. It\u2019s on us to put an end to HIV.\u201d\n\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter: @Capehartj", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThis is the critical moment in our fight, and so many of us don\u2019t seem to care.\"", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\u201cThis is the critical moment in our fight, and so many of us don\u2019t seem to care.\"", "title": "Elton John and David Furnish put LGBT community on notice in fight against HIV/AIDS", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/10/24/elton-john-and-david-furnish-put-lgbt-community-on-notice-in-fight-against-hivaids/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/files/2014/10/JohnFurnish.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@capehartj"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/10/24/elton-john-and-david-furnish-put-lgbt-community-on-notice-in-fight-against-hivaids/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "elton john, david furnish, elton john hrc, david furnish hrc, human rights campaign, human rights campaign dinner, hiv/aids, hiv/aids elton john, elton john aids foundation, AIDS United, HIPS, National Black Justice Coalition, gay marriage, same sex marriage, same-sex marriage, lauren banks, aids alabama, Centers for Disease Control, medicaid, social security benefits, social security lgbt, social security gay marriage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/capehart"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "elton john, david furnish, elton john hrc, david furnish hrc, human rights campaign, human rights campaign dinner, hiv/aids, hiv/aids elton john, elton john aids foundation, AIDS United, HIPS, National Black Justice Coalition, gay marriage, same sex marriage, same-sex marriage, lauren banks, aids alabama, Centers for Disease Control, medicaid, social security benefits, social security lgbt, social security gay marriage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7640\"", "article_summary": "Unfortunately, some members of the LGBT community have taken that to mean they can ignore the AIDS epidemic,\u201d Furnish told me.\nEspecially in our own community,\u201d John will say, according to prepared remarks he shared with me Friday.\nis the beginning of a new initiative to refocus and reenergize the LGBT fight against AIDS,\u201d Furnish told me in an email.\nIt turns out that her organization and many like it are supported by the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF).\nCompounding the impact of the silence in the gay community is the opposition to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act."}
