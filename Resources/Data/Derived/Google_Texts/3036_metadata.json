John Kerry whether he \u201chanded Syria and Iran at least a temporary victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe so at all,\u201d Kerry responded. \u201cAnd that is in the hands of the Congress of the United States. The president has made his decision. The president wants to stand up and make certain that we uphold the international norm, that we do not grant impunity to a ruthless dictator to gas his own people. Anybody who saw those images, anybody who know focuses on the evidence that I just gave you about signatures of sarin in the hair and blood samples of the first responders -- I mean, first responders died. People who went to help the people who were hurt, died in this case.\u201d\n\nKerry, who is making the rounds on all five Sunday shows, is pressing the administration\u2019s case for military action, especially given evidence that the Assad regime used sarin gas. \u201cThis case is building and this case will build,\u201d Kerry said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nBut Obama\u2019s decision to seek congressional authorization is not necessarily the problem here\u2014it\u2019s that he did not call Congress back for a special session at the earliest date possible.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave the region hanging,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cIt looks absolutely as if the United States has chickened out.\u201d \u201cEven though I think a limited attack is not the right thing to do, at this point he has to do something, or we will have reached the lowest ebb of American influence in the region since 1970,\u201d he said. Krauthammer strongly disapproved of Obama\u2019s timetable, which allows for Congress to debate military interaction, presumably when the chambers get back in session on September 9th. The analyst said Syrians being attacked by their own government have no such lack of urgency. \u201cThey hear a president who has no idea what he is doing and speaks about this in a leisurely way,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cWhat the president ought to do\u2014I can\u2019t believe that he actually decided otherwise\u2014was to bring in Congress tomorrow. We have Reagan Airport, National Airport, Dulles, BWI. You can use the Air Force. You bring in the members of Congress, you have a debate for two days and you have a resolution.\u201d\n\nAnd the optics of going golfing with Biden just minutes after his major announcement on Syria are terrible, to say the least.\n\nSo, what kind of message is this sending to the world? Via The Blaze:\n\nHousing Minister Uri Ariel of Israel\u2019s right-wing Jewish Home party said, \u201cIn Tehran, they\u2019re opening the champagne, and switching into a higher gear en route to nuclear weapons.\u201d \u201cFacing real dangers, no one in the world will stand with us,\u201d Ariel said according to the Times of Israel, voicing a widely held opinion that Obama\u2019s wavering on Syria will only embolden Iran in its march toward nuclear weapons. \u201cPresident Obama blinked, and this is bad. It is bad for the US\u2019 interests, it\u2019s bad for its allies\u2019 interests and it sends an encouraging message to cruel, unrestrained regimes that possess or don\u2019t possess weapons of mass destruction,\u201dwrote prominent military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai of the Israeli paper Yedioth Aharonot. That\u2019s a sentiment the Associated Press appeared to echo, writing: \u201cThe stunning reversal also raises questions about the president\u2019s decisiveness and could embolden leaders in Syria, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere, leaving them with the impression of a US president unwilling to back up his words with actions.\u201d \u201cThe international stammering and vacillation over Syria proves, yet again, that Israel can trust in none but itself,\u201d Economy Minister Naftali Bennett said, according to Reuters Jerusalem Correspondent Dan Williams.\n\nObama said on Saturday that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs indicated to him that \u201cour capacity to execute this mission is not time-sensitive; it will be effective tomorrow, or next week, or one month from now.\u201d There are many who beg to differ, however.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Syrian newspapers are saying that Obama\u2019s decision to seek congressional approval is the \u201cstart of the historic American retreat,\u201d and on Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace noted that officials in Damascus are saying the president \u201cflinched\u201d and had \u201cmade a joke of the American administration.\u201d Given these types of reactions, Wallace asked his guest, Sec.
