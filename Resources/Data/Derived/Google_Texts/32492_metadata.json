She calls it \u201ca factor of sixteen\u201d: we moderns consume at least 16 times the food, clothing, housing, and education that our ancestors did in London in the 18th century. Two new books help us to understand what that means.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s Washington Post, Jonathan Yardley reviews Flyover Lives, a family memoir by Diane Johnson. She found diaries from some of her Midwestern ancestors, and Yardley notes what they tell us:\n\nIt must be just about impossible for a denizen of middle-class 21st-century America to imagine the toil and suffering that Catharine Martin [born 1800] and her counterparts underwent every day: living in crude houses \u2014 mere huts when they first settled in Illinois and elsewhere \u2014 slaving at open fires to prepare food for their families, and worst of all watching children fall ill and having nothing in their powers to help them: \u201cWithin a year of her marriage, with the fated fertility of women then, Catharine had her first baby, and named her Catharine Anne, after herself. They called her Sissie. This baby was followed by Charlotte Augusta in 1830 and Martha Olivia in 1831. When they were one, three, and five years old, all three little girls died in the space of a week or two.\u201d Catharine herself was ill but survived to write many years later: \u201cWhen I got up, my house was empty, three little prattlers all gone, not one left.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t so long ago. Catharine Martin was the great-great-grandmother of Diane Johnson. Go back another century, and read about 18th-century life in another new book, Three Squares by Abigail Carroll:\n\nInvited to dine with a ferryman and his family, [a 1744 traveler from Maryland to Maine] declined. He described the meal: \u201cThey had no cloth upon the table, and their mess was in a dirty, deep, wooden dish which they evacuated with their hands, cramming down skins, scales, and all. They used neither knife, fork, spoon, plate, or napkin because, I suppose, they had none to use.\u201d By the standards of the age, the ferryman\u2019s repast was ordered: \u201cOnly about a third of the families in seventeenth-century Virginia had chairs or benches, and only one in seven had both,\u201d writes Ms. Carroll. Only about a quarter of the early Virginian houses had tables.\n\nAnd finally, I note an older book on my own Scottish ancestors, The Scotch-Irish: A Social History by James G. Leyburn:\n\nThe squalor and meanness of [lowland Scottish] life around 1600 [or 1700] can hardly be conceived by a person of the twentieth century. A cluster of hovels housed the tenants and their helpers\u2026.A home was likely to be little more than a shanty, constructed of stones, banked with turf, without mortar, and with straw, heather, or moss stuffed in the holes to keep out the blasts\u2026.The fire, usually in the middle of the house floor, often filled the whole hut with malodorous clouds, since the smoke-clotted roof gradually stopped the vent-hole. Cattle were tethered at night at one end of the room, while the family lay at the other end on heather piled upon the floor\u2026.Vermin abounded\u2026skin diseases\u2026Infectious diseases were propagated readily.\n\nAccording to scholars such as Angus Maddison and Brad DeLong, GDP per capita hardly rose for thousands, or tens of thousands, of years before the emergence of capitalism. And then after 100,000 years of stagnation (by DeLong\u2019s estimates), around 1750 capitalism and growth began, first in Northern Europe and the American seaboard, and spreading ever since to more parts of the world. That is, the existence of relatively free markets is the reason we don\u2019t live like my Scottish ancestors. This is indeed the Great Fact of the modern world. We should celebrate it, even as we work to extend the benefits of markets to people and nations who don\u2019t yet enjoy as much capitalism as they should.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The world was unimaginably poorer before the emergence of capitalism around 1700.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The world was unimaginably poorer before the emergence of capitalism around 1700.", "title": "The Great Fact of Economic Growth, in Three Glimpses", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/great-fact-economic-growth-three-images", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/great-fact-economic-growth-three-images", "title": "The Great Fact of Economic Growth, in Three Glimpses", "description": "The world was unimaginably poorer before the emergence of capitalism around 1700.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2014/1/20", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "publication_date": "2014/1/20", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-20T13:39:02-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidboaz"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbba0\"", "article_summary": "That is, the existence of relatively free markets is the reason we don\u2019t live like my Scottish ancestors.\nIn Bourgeois Dignity: Why Economics Can\u2019t Explain the Modern World, economic historian Deirdre McCloskey writes about the \u201cGreat Fact\u201d \u2013 the enormous and unprecedented growth in living standards that began in the western world around 1700.\nThis is indeed the Great Fact of the modern world.\nIn Sunday\u2019s Washington Post, Jonathan Yardley reviews Flyover Lives, a family memoir by Diane Johnson.\nWe should celebrate it, even as we work to extend the benefits of markets to people and nations who don\u2019t yet enjoy as much capitalism as they should."}
