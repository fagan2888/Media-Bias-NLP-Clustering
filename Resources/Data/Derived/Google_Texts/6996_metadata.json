The KBA design asks the user to correctly answer at least one question, a \u201csecret\u201d only the user would know.\n\nThere are two types of KBA: 1) Answering a question that the user has pre-selected (static scheme), and 2) Answering a question that\u2019s determined by garnering data in public records (dynamic scheme).\n\nThe idea is that if a question is correctly answered, the person\u2019s ID has been verified.\n\nKBA Flaws\n\nFraudsters can answer \u201csecret\u201d questions\u2014even those that the user must think hard to answer. But how?\n\nSpear-phishing: gaining access to the public data aggregators by tricking their employees and getting into their accounts, getting the \u201ckeys\u201d to the data. Knowledge-based authentication is definitely flawed. Additionally, with all our personal information floating out there in social sites, it is becoming much easier to research anyone enough to pass these questions.\n\nKBA is especially unreliable when it applies to people new to the U.S. or who are young, as they don\u2019t have much public data built up.\n\nThough KBA is flawed, it\u2019s also the heavily preferred method for ID because it\u2019s so technically easy. This is why Obamacare will be using it for the new healthcare insurance exchanges.\n\nAttempts at Regulation\n\nA regulation attempt was made by the U.S. banking regulators that involved costliness. That didn\u2019t go over well. Another instance was that in 2006, ChoicePoint was fined by the FTC for a 2004 breach; they were ordered to conduct intense security audits for possibly 20 years.\n\nSolutions\n\nAuthentication should be multifactorial. A multidimensional security system might include:\n\nCustomer history and behavior is considered.\n\nDual customer authorization via varying access devices\n\nTransactions verified via out-of-band\n\nDebit blocks, positive pay and other methods that appropriately curtail an account\u2019s transactional use\n\nMore refined controls over account activities, such as number of daily transactions, payment recipients, transaction value thresholds and allowable payment windows\n\nBlockage of connection attempts to banking servers from suspicious IP addresses\n\nPolicies for addressing potentially compromised customer devices\n\nImproved control over any changes done by customers to their account\n\nBetter customer education to increase awareness of security risks, including how customers can mitigate risks\n\nA layered security program should include, at a minimum, the following:\n\nDetection of suspicious activity followed by a response. Suspicious activity may be related to logins and verification of customers wanting access to the bank\u2019s electronic system, and also to initiation of electronic transactions that pertain to fund transfer to other parties.\n\nInstitutions should do away with using simple device ID as the primary control.\n\nThey should also do away with using basic \u201csecret\u201d questions as a primary control.\n\nAn Alternative to KBA\n\nThere is now a software-only biometric that can authenticate the user\u2019s identity in a way that\u2019s so unique that no imposter can beat it.\n\nThis patented software is referred to as the \u201cMissing Link,\u201d created by Biometric Signature ID (BSI). It\u2019s the strongest form of ID confirmation on the market today, and it doesn\u2019t even require any additional hardware.\n\nHow does this biometric work?\n\nIt measures how a person moves their mouse, finger or stylus when they log in using a password created with BioSig-ID\u2122.\n\nBiometrics measured include elements like height, length, speed and direction, angle of each stroke. These all define the user\u2019s unique pattern\u2014that a fraudster cannot replicate. Positive IDs can be done when someone logs in on any device.\n\nIn order to access the device, or whatever else (bank account, medical information, online college exam, etc.), the user must be previously authenticated against their original profile. . In seconds and with only 3-4 characters BioSig-ID\u2122 software will establish whether the person who registered for the account is the same person who is attempting access. This SaaS based software is now used in over 60 countries and was recently awarded a grant by the White House to use their solution to validate user identity before online they can access a digital asset.\n\nRobert Siciliano, personal security and identity theft expert and BioSig-ID advisory board member.
