Faced with a flurry of new ideas for Howelsen Hill that range from zip lines to an expansion of the ice arena, the city of Steamboat Springs is reaching out to the community to help shape the future of its most unique park.

The last comprehensive master plan this city adopted for the entire Howelsen Hill park talked about amenities ranging from a swimming pool in the summer to a bobsled and luge track.

That was in the early 1990s, and much has changed since then.

“We’d like to get together with some of the users of Howelsen and talk about existing uses and just what the people here in the city want to see happen at Howelsen Hill,” Parks, Open Space and Recreational Services Department Director John Overstreet told the Steamboat Springs City Council on Tuesday night.

The new master plan will come at a time when much is in flux at Howelsen. And it has the potential to impact almost every type of recreational user in the city in some way.
