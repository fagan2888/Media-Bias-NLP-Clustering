While application and enrollment tools weren\u2019t available for website users, other parts of the website worked, said Julie Bataille, director of the Office of Communications at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cThis is frustrating,\u201d Bataille said during a press conference. \u201cWe are on an aggressive path to make improvements, and we will do just that.\u201d\n\nHealthCare.gov, a way for uninsured U.S. residents to shop for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, has been plagued with problems since its launch Oct. 1. One of the centerpieces of the so-called Obamacare insurance reform legislation, the website has experienced sluggish page load times\u2014at some points pages taking eight seconds to load\u2014and in many cases, users haven\u2019t been able to complete insurance applications.\n\nThe team working on fixing the malfunctioning website was able to bring the system back up quickly after seeing an overload of a small number of servers and a load balancing problem, said Andy Slavitt, group executive vice president at Optum, one of the contractors working to fix HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe HealthCare.gov team was still investigating the exact cause of the outage as of 4 p.m. ET., he said. The website had significant traffic numbers Monday, he said.\n\nWebsite users should expect more service interruptions in the coming days as the HealthCare.gov team works to fix the site\u2019s continuing problems, Slavitt said. Officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have set a Nov. 30 deadline for having the site functioning for the majority of users.\n\n\u201cThis is a natural part of the process, and [outages] are not unusual when enhancements of this scope are being made to the system,\u201d he said.\n\nBataille said CMS was not considering a suggestion from some lawmakers and other critics to take down the site and fix it before relaunching. \u201cHealthCare.gov is fixable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to be on a path to make improvements week by week.\u201d\n\nOver the past weekend, the HealthCare.gov team made \u201cmore than a dozen important fixes\u201d to the site, Bataille said. The team has improved an issue with inaccurate information being sent to insurance providers and the team has upgraded hardware to improve redundancy at the site, she said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://core5.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-small.jpg", "description": "The troubled website was down for 90 minutes Monday, and more service interruptions are likely, officials say.", "og": {"site_name": "PCWorld", "description": "The troubled website was down for 90 minutes Monday, and more service interruptions are likely, officials say.", "title": "HealthCare.gov's enrollment system crashes Monday", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060760/healthcaregovs-enrollment-system-crashes-monday.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The troubled website was down for 90 minutes Monday, and more service interruptions are likely, officials say.", "title": "HealthCare.gov's enrollment system crashes Monday | PCWorld", "url": "www.pcworld.com/article/2060760/healthcaregovs-enrollment-system-crashes-monday.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-orig.jpg", "site": "@pcworld", "card": "summary", "account_id": 6070762}, "parsely-tags": "type: news,source: idg news service,imported", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-04", "parsely-image-url": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-large.jpg", "parsely-title": "HealthCare.gov's enrollment system crashes Monday", "fb": {"app_id": 1542125639335283, "pages": 7352931005}, "sailthru.tags": "government,websites,grant-gross,news,short", "parsely-author": "Grant Gross", "parsely-section": "Government", "date": "2013-11-04", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-11-04T22:15:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "http://core3.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/10/healthcare_dot_gov-100067042-orig.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2060760/healthcaregovs-enrollment-system-crashes-monday.html"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb649\"", "article_summary": "The enrollment and insurance application system at the troubled HealthCare.gov website was down for about 90 minutes Monday, officials said.\nThe HealthCare.gov team was still investigating the exact cause of the outage as of 4 p.m.\nWebsite users should expect more service interruptions in the coming days as the HealthCare.gov team works to fix the site\u2019s continuing problems, Slavitt said.\nWhile application and enrollment tools weren\u2019t available for website users, other parts of the website worked, said Julie Bataille, director of the Office of Communications at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\u201cWe continue to be on a path to make improvements week by week.\u201dOver the past weekend, the HealthCare.gov team made \u201cmore than a dozen important fixes\u201d to the site, Bataille said."}
