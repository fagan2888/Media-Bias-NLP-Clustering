Authorities have identified the two people injured when their small plane crashed near tailgaters gathered for the Florida-Arkansas football game.

Witnesses and University of Florida Police Chief Linda Stump say pilot Graham Hill's attempt to make an emergency landing on Flavet Field averted disaster. No one on the ground was injured when Hill's plane lost power Saturday as it towed a banner over the campus.

Witnesses say the plane flew low over Pressly Stadium and passed over a residence hall before hitting the ground.

Authorities identified the passenger as Ian Conrad. Hill and Conrad were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.

Stump said the Alachua County Sheriff's Office is investigating instead of the National Transportation Safety Board or the Federal Aviation Administration because of the federal government shutdown.
