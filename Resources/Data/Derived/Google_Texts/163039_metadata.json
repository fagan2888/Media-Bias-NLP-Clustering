With the 2014 election of Joni Ernst (R-IA) in the Senate and Elise Stefanik (R-NY), Mia Love (R-UT), Barbara Comstock (R-VA), and Mimi Walters (R-CA) in the House, an additional five women will join their 16 colleagues in the hopeful passage of federal pro-life legislation.\n\nHere\u2019s a little biographical information on the five new pro-life women.\n\nJoni Ernst\n\nFamous for her much-discussed campaign commercial on hog farming, Ernst \u2013 the first woman elected to the Senate from Iowa \u2013 soared to victory even while affirming her support for pro-life personhood legislation. She grew up in small-town America, and still lives there today:\n\nMy mom made all of my clothes. We went to church every week, helped our neighbors when they needed it, and they did the same for us. \u2026 Today I teach Sunday school in the same church I was baptized and married in. I live in the very house where one of my best friends grew up.\n\nErnst is married to a retired Army Ranger and, as a member of the Iowa Army National Guard, she personally served in Iraq and Kuwait.\n\nOn the life issue, Ernst couldn\u2019t make herself clearer:\n\n[She] believes life begins at conception, that all innocent life is precious, and that we must cherish and protect the unborn.\n\nElise Stefanik\n\nStefanik made history \u2013 not only in helping bring a record number of pro-life women to Congress \u2013 but also in becoming the youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. House. At the age of 30, she routed the New York Democrat incumbent to win her seat.\n\n\n\n\n\nStefanik is enjoying a rising career in politics that began in sixth grade, where she campaigned on a promise to bring a snack machine to her school. She was the first in her family to finish college.\n\nAlready, she\u2019s been elected to a leadership position in the House: \u201cto serve as a liaison between the new freshmen class of representatives and the House Policy Committee.\u201d\n\nSBA List\u2019s Dannenfelser said, of Stefanik:\n\nHer energy, experience, and passion for promoting the dignity of each human life will make Elise an excellent addition to the House Pro-life Women\u2019s Caucus.\n\nMia Love\n\nLove adds her own unique piece of history to the 114th Congress as the first Black Republican woman ever elected to Congress. Born to Haitian parents, Love\u2019s American birth helped her parents immigrate here. She shares:\n\n\u201cMy parents have always told me I was a miracle and our family\u2019s ticket to America.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, despite Love\u2019s unique life circumstances, an image put out by her campaign gave the true reason she was elected:\n\nI wasn\u2019t elected because of the color of my skin. I wasn\u2019t elected because of my gender. I was elected because of the solutions I put on the table.\n\nOn her campaign site, Love declared (with an exclamation mark): \u201cI AM PRO-LIFE!\u201d She continued:\n\nI am proud to say that I am pro-life. My commitment to pro-life policies is unwavering, and I look forward to working with others in Congress to protect the right to life. I have received endorsements from multiple pro-life organizations, including the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), the nation\u2019s oldest and largest pro-life organization.\n\nBarbara Comstock\n\nAn attorney and a mother, Comstock had her two sons while attending law school, and she gave birth to her daughter not long after graduation.\n\nOver a decade before her election to the House, Comstock served as Chief Counsel on a House committee, and then, in the U.S. Department of Justice:\n\nShe then was recruited to serve on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the largest House committee where she became Chief Counsel and led hearings and oversight of investigations into waste, fraud and abuse. Barbara also served as Director of the Office of Public Affairs for the U.S. Department of Justice from 2002 through 2003. \u2026 In 2001 the Washington Post noted: \u201cRepublicans rave about her effectiveness, but what is striking is that in this time of bitter political partisanship, even some Democrats privately acknowledge the even-keeled Comstock does her work with care.\u201d\n\nComstock takes her pro-life values seriously, serving on boards to help children suffering from abuse as well as disabled children. In addition, she founded a new leadership program for young women in 2013.\n\nHowever, Comstock may need some encouragement from her constituents to keep a solidly pro-life stance in office. Her actions have been mixed: while she\u2019s voted in favor of a personhood bill, she\u2019s also voted against a pro-life amendment to Virginia\u2019s implementation of ObamaCare and come out in support of over-the-counter birth control.\n\n\n\n\n\nMimi Walters\n\nWalters has a background in finance and business, and is a mother of four. She has also actively worked to reduce gang violence in California, as she \u201ccurrently serves as a Board Member of the Orange County Gang Reduction Intervention Program (G.R.I.P.) which partners with local law enforcement agencies to implement targeted gang prevention strategies to at risk youth, families and communities.\u201d Walters is also \u201ca founder of the California Women\u2019s Leadership Association.\u201d\n\nSBA List\u2019s Dannenfelser commends Walters\u2019 hard work on behalf of women and unborn children:\n\nMimi has worked tirelessly at the state level to defend women and the unborn. Her experience and passion for protecting life will make her a strong addition to the House Pro-life Women\u2019s Caucus. As a wife, mother, business owner, and longtime public servant, Mimi has spent years building up women in leadership roles. She is a trailblazer in the mold of Susan B. Anthony herself and exactly the type of candidate we exist to support.\n\nWalters proves, through her dedicated work and experience, that women can stand for women and their children at the same time.\n\nLifeNews Note: Kristi Burton Brown is a pro-life activist in her home state of Colorado, a pro-bono attorney for Life Legal Defense Fund, and a stay-at-home mom.
