Instead, interviews with residents in this heavily Republican corner of the state, whether in the town square a mile from Walmart\u2019s headquarters or in nearby blue-collar or middle-class towns like Decatur, Gravette or Siloam Springs, indicated that people feel as if they\u2019ve seen this movie before, they didn\u2019t like it last time and aren\u2019t tuning in, at least not yet, this time around.\n\n\u201cWolf\u2019s been called so much,\u201d Johnny Alfrey, 67, said with a shrug as he stood next to his motorcycle in Decatur, just west of here. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll shut it down. But they won\u2019t get anything solved, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPeople do have strong feelings about some of the issues, most significantly an almost universal suspicion of the Affordable Care Act. But in a conservative district that has sent Republicans to Congress every year since 1967, people seem to see the current turmoil as the new normal of Washington rather than a seminal political moment likely to affect their own lives. And if Republican legislators could be overplaying their hand by pushing their case against Obamacare to the outer limits, there is not much sign of that in the reactions here.\n\nTheir second-term congressman, Steve Womack, voted with House Republicans to defund Obamacare, and no one can imagine anything so dire that voters could elect a Democrat here. Still, that does not mean people are happy about what they see.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Republicans and Democrats just hate each other,\u201d said Debbie Casto, 53, a junior high school teacher and coach who lives near Bentonville in Rogers. \u201cThey\u2019ve quit trying to decide what\u2019s best for the people in general. It\u2019s all about power. So I\u2019m not happy with any of them.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSteve Cook, 46, a conservative who is not necessarily a Republican but not necessarily a Democrat, watches Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News but talks, on the issue of a government shutdown, like President Obama.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re holding the country hostage,\u201d Mr. Cook said of the Republican tactic of tying the House spending bill to financing for the health care law. \u201cI mean, Obamacare has passed. I don\u2019t like it personally. A lot of other people don\u2019t like it. But what\u2019s law is law and you abide by the law of the land. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s a smart political move, to hold the country hostage so you can jab back at Obama.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Cook relaxed on a bench in the Bentonville town square, before him was a fountain topped by a statue of a Confederate soldier, James H. Berry, a former governor of the state. Behind him was the first Walton\u2019s five-and-dime, which Walmart preserved in its 1950s form and turned into the Walmart Visitor Center. Nearby was the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, founded by Alice Walton, Sam Walton\u2019s daughter.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe opening of the museum in 2011 has lent Bentonville a kind of cosmopolitan and hipster feel. Near the square sits the boutique, pop-art-inspired 21c Museum Hotel, with a giant tree sculpture made of basketball hoops and rims out front and a bar that serves $11 cocktails inside.\n\nMr. Cook, a car salesman who moved here recently from Little Rock, said he was not sure what effect a government shutdown would have on his life, and whether, for example, any national parks would close (they would). Mr. Cook\u2019s friend sitting next to him on the bench interrupted. \u201cSo they\u2019re doing that?\u201d his friend asked him. \u201cThey\u2019re shutting parks?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet, not yet,\u201d Mr. Cook assured him.\n\nMr. Cook\u2019s friend was misinformed or uninformed about the possible shutdown, as were several others. Mr. Cook himself thought the shutdown might affect state employees (it would not). Many fretted over the president\u2019s health care law.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to census figures, 17.9 percent of Arkansas residents are uninsured, well above the national average of 15.6 percent and 10th from the bottom among all states. But some residents interviewed seemed to think there was no end to the damage the new law could do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think the older people, when it comes right down to it, when you go to the hospital, with Obamacare you won\u2019t get the service like you would if it wasn\u2019t in,\u201d said Jerry Hunnicutt, 67, a retired supervisor at a snack-food plant who lives near Bentonville in Bella Vista with his wife, Carolyn, 71. \u201cIf somebody goes in and they need a surgery or something, if you\u2019re older you may be put on the back burner.\u201d\n\nIn Decatur, Mr. Alfrey and his friend Robert Walker, 66, had spent a few minutes in a parking lot, browsing through farm equipment and trucks that a bank had taken possession of and was preparing to sell at auction.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s too worried about putting food on their table and gas in their tank,\u201d Mr. Walker said of why people had not been concerned about a possible shutdown. Both men worked at the same factory before retiring. Mr. Alfrey considers himself a Republican and Mr. Walker an independent.\n\n\u201cI was a die-hard Republican up to about 12 years ago, and now I\u2019m for neither one of them,\u201d said Mr. Walker, who lives in Siloam Springs. \u201cNeither one of them agree on anything. It\u2019s not Republicans against Democrats. It\u2019s the government against the people.\u201d\n\nSitting on the grass on the Bentonville square, her shoes off and her book open, Donna Carrell, 47, had trouble remembering when the federal government last shut down (it was in late 1995 and early 1996), but knew one thing for certain: She survived it just fine. She believed any shutdown in the coming weeks would have the same result.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like gas prices,\u201d said Ms. Carrell, an emergency services dispatcher. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about it, so I just don\u2019t get worked up about it.\u201d\n\nAt the edge of the square, a gray-haired man sitting at a restaurant\u2019s sidewalk table, asked for his thoughts about a government shutdown, mentioned his television set. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned it on in a week,\u201d the man said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good week.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130924215817, "twitter": {"description": "Residents of northwestern Arkansas see the turmoil over a possible debt default as the new normal of Washington rather than a seminal political moment likely to affect their lives.", "title": "In Corner of Arkansas, Frustration but No Panic Over Possible Shutdown", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/us/in-corner-of-arkansas-frustration-but-no-panic-over-possible-shutdown.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002462862"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/25/us/ARKANSAS2/ARKANSAS2-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/us/in-corner-of-arkansas-frustration-but-no-panic-over-possible-shutdown.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002462862", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/us/in-corner-of-arkansas-frustration-but-no-panic-over-possible-shutdown.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Weighing a Government Shutdown: Panic, No;
