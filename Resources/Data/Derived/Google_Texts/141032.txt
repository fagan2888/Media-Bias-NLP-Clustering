This stage determined the overall winner of the Vuelta a Espana 2014 .

In the last 5 km of the race it was a battle between the big boys of the Vuelta— likely for the overall title Rodriguez, Froome, Contador, and Valverde . It was such a grueling uphill climb Rodriguez was dropped likely sacrificing his podium chance.

Froome and Contador alone out front battled each each in the final km uphill. Valverde behind but unable to catch the two leaders.

Spain’s hero Alberto Contador soars away from Chris Froome to win the Vuelta a Espana 2014. Froome crossed the line 16 seconds later. What a finish by El Pistolero .

Only a 10 km ITT tomorrow. With the time gap Contador has over Froome, unless he crashed out will be the overall winner.
