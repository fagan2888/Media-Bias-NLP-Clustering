The company plans a limited product release in the coming months with a wide-scale product release later this year.\n\nNow what: The big news here is that we have another FDA approval that Hansen can log on its belt in an effort to improve sales and reduce its cash burn rate. Recent growth in Hansen's top line has been practically nonexistent, so the hope from shareholders is that this new product approval will help jump-start Hansen Medical back in the right direction again. As for me, while I appreciate the technology, I'm still lost as to how Hansen gets anywhere near profitability with its current lineup of products. In fact, with only $42 million in cash as of last quarter and a cash burn rate of $40 million annually, I'd be concerned about the potential for share dilution here. It's a company I'd suggest safely monitoring from the sidelines.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "14:00", "date": "2014-02-11T19:00:00Z", "description": "Hansen Medical shares soar after getting the A-OK from the FDA on a new product.
