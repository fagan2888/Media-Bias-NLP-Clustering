Paul Ryan (R-WI)\u2014the chief proponent of Obamatrade\u2014says about the votes being there to pass it in the House, House Republicans are building a firewall against Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that would fast-track President Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Pacific Rim trade deal.\n\nThe news of an organized\u2014and fairly impressive\u2014House Republican backstop against Obamatrade comes as U.S. Senate Republicans are rushing the TPA fast-track through their chamber of Congress as fast they can.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the whole Obamatrade process is shaping up as almost identical to the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty fight two years ago: The same open borders supporting elites are pushing it, it\u2019s going to pass the Senate but not with as much support as proponents originally claimed, Ryan is going to try to force House Republicans to support it, and House Republicans are organizing a quiet but numbers-heavy resistance against it.\n\nThe only question is: Can House Republicans opposed to Obamatrade get enough members together to stop Ryan\u2019s elitist agenda? At this time, it sure looks like the cavalry has arrived. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) confirmed he is strongly opposed to the Obamatrade deal as it stands now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no\u201d as the deal stands now, Jordan, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m for trade, trade means opportunity. We have a lot of business, a lot of industry in Ohio who benefit from selling their product to as many markets as they can, in as many markets as they can.\u201d\n\nJordan said that voters elected Republicans because they ran on issues such as excessive regulation, a broken tax code, and Obamacare, not pushing the trade deal.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t elect us to give the president of the United States more authority to go negotiate a trade deal, particularly the same president we\u2019ve all criticized for the terrible deal he did with Iran\u2013 is working on with Iran,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cSo I think that combination is the problem.\u201d\n\nJordan previously expressed skepticism of the deal, but now he\u2019s going even further in opposition.\n\n\u201cIf the Republican Party doesn\u2019t start showing regular American families, in a populist tone, what we are doing to fight for them, we are going to be in big trouble,\u201d Jordan said in a radio interview a couple weeks ago.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get done what we told the voters we said we were going to do on the President\u2019s executive amnesty issue, which I think was unconstitutional; we pull a pro-life bill on the most pro-life day of the year, the March for Life day in January, we pull a pro-life bill on that day; and now some people are talking about not repealing Obamacare; and yet we\u2019re going to move heaven and earth to pass a trade bill, and give this President the authority to negotiate a trade deal after the last seven weeks when we\u2019ve criticized him for the pathetic deal he got with Iran. How does that make sense politically? Forget about the policy for a second\u2013 just think about raw politics\u2013 how does that make sense? \u2026I\u2019m not opposed to free trade, I think there are some opportunities, but the timing of this\u2026 and how we\u2019re getting it done, as you talked about, not being able to see the TPP agreement, that\u2019s all problematic.\n\nAt the Conversations With Conservatives press availability on Wednesday morning, Jordan echoed what he told Breitbart News on Tuesday.\n\nThe opportunity to sell your product in foreign markets, that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI think all up here are for that. We\u2019ve said already we have concerns with the process. I\u2019ve said I lean no. The other new thing being talked about and being done in the Senate is I think they\u2019re adding Trade Adjustment to the actual Trade Promotion Authority. That is a problem as well. We\u2019re hearing rumors they may have a rule to split them up and put them back together when it comes to the House. I think that is a problem.\n\nJordan\u2019s spokesman Darin Miller emailed Breitbart News as well to be crystal clear on Jordan\u2019s position: \u201cRep. Jordan does not like the bill as is. But he wants to see the final Senate version, and whether things change during House debate.\u201d\n\nJordan\u2019s position is important because so many members on the Republican side of the aisle will follow him instead of following GOP leadership. Jordan\u2019s Freedom Caucus has at least 19 publicly known members. One other, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) is a supporter of TPA\u2014and was at one point one of the key salesmen for the deal\u2014but then got caught on national radio admitting he hasn\u2019t read the TPP deal text that TPA would fast-track.\n\n\u201cNo, I have not read the TPP yet, no,\u201d McClintock said on a national radio program, hurting the cause more than he helped it because it allowed comparisons of this process to Obamacare\u2014where former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi infamously said \u201cwe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d Since no trade deal has ever been stopped while Fast Track, now renamed euphemistically TPA, was in process\u2014a concept started under President Richard Nixon\u2014a vote for TPA is essentially a vote for TPP.\n\nMost other Freedom Caucus members, however, are opposed to the deal.\n\n\u201cI am going to look at it,\u201d Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), who voted for Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) for Speaker of the House at the beginning of this Congress, told Breitbart News. \u201cRight now, I am not inclined to give the President any more authority because of his abuse of executive power. I am as pro free trade as anybody but this is a different environment.\u201d\n\nFellow Freedom Caucus members Reps. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) and Dave Brat (R-VA), among others, are opposed as well. Duncan wrote a piece for Breitbart News laying out why he\u2019s opposed to fast-track, and Brat has been vocal in his opposition to Obamatrade.\n\nAppearing on the John Fredericks show\u2014a local radio program in Virginia\u2014Brat laid out how fast-track TPA \u201cmirrors the logic I was talking about in terms of the amnesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the key reasons I\u2019m leaning a solid no on TPA and TPP,\u201d Brat said.\n\nBecause if we\u2019re arguing in the best interest of the average American, we should be able to make these arguments in the light of day and debate. Debate is a very healthy thing\u2026 The best thing you can do is this representative democracy idea our founders thought of where you put an idea before the people and you air it out on TV\u2026 And we need to debate and show where the pressure points are on these arguments, [but] we can\u2019t do that. I have to go down to a security bunker\u2013 and I have been in there to read the bill\u2013 and it\u2019s 400 pages. What am I going to do? Memorize that and then arrange the key points in my head? And then part of it\u2019s classified and you don\u2019t know what you can even mention to your fellow members or not that haven\u2019t read it yet because it\u2019s under security. And so, major issues. I\u2019m a total free trader. It hurts my brain. I have constituents who I know need trade to take place, and so it hurts me, but the issue does come down to\u2013 do you trust the president and this process? And the only out is they say, \u2018Well you get a final up or down vote.\u2019 Well, even there, look at the doc fix, etc. If both sides of leadership do an end run and they agree ahead of time to find to find 300 votes for, ya know, $140 billion unpaid for on the doc fix, they can do the same kind of thing in the TPA and TPP. And then my vote is nullified. And up here you know how it works\u2013 there\u2019s sort of a 90-10 proposition: if there\u2019s 90% good stuff that both sides of leadership want and 10 percent is unconstitutional\u2013 \u2018Well, that\u2019s an unfortunate detail,\u2019 but it passes. And that\u2019s not the way I operate. I operate on the fundamentals: the rule of law matters, the constitution matters, the free market matters, telling the truth matters, and if any of those get violated, I\u2019m a no.\u201d\n\nThe Freedom Caucus members are hardly the only ones against it. Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC) told Breitbart News that he\u2019s against Obamatrade as well.\n\n\u201cI strongly oppose giving fast-track authority to President Obama,\u201d Jones said.\n\nFor the past six years the president has ignored Congress, repeatedly abused his executive authority, and flaunted the law on Obamacare, amnesty for illegal aliens, and many other things. Given his record, I am astonished that some of my colleagues are so eager to fork over even more of their constitutional authority to the president for him to abuse. It would be incredibly na\u00efve to think that the president has changed his tune and will now dutifully follow whatever statutory trade negotiating instructions Congress might seek to require of him in a fast-track bill.\n\nRep. Ken Buck (R-CO) echoed concerns from Jones and Jordan, adding that he\u2019s pretty much a no but hasn\u2019t officially decided he\u2019s against the TPA deal.\n\n\u201cThis president has done so many unconstitutional and unlawful things, that it is impossible to trust that he\u2019ll act appropriately on this issue,\u201d Buck said. \u201cI am in favor of free trade, but I am still weighing the facts on this issue, because President Obama has given Congress and the American people no reason to trust him.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael Burgess (R-TX) expressed that he views a habitual abuse of authority as a driving force in their positions against Obamatrade.\n\n\u201cWhy would we give President Obama more power when he\u2019s already taken more authority than he\u2019s constitutionally allowed in almost every area?\u201d Burgess said in an email. \u201cThis would be an enormous grant of power and, between my distrust for this administration and the secretive nature by which it\u2019s being brokered, I simply cannot lend my support to the TPA agreement.\u201d\n\nRep. David McKinley (R-WV) is also a no on Obamatrade fast track, writing back in February in his local newspaper the Wheeling News-Register that it would be a \u201cmistake\u201d to grant Obama fast-track authority.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has consistently broken his trust with the American people on immigration, health care, and foreign policy yet he is now asking for expanded power to negotiate trade deals, but without input from Congress,\u201d McKinley wrote.\n\nThis authority is called \u201cfast-track\u201d and would allow the President to negotiate wide-ranging deals behind closed doors with nations in Asia and South America as well as the European Union. Any deal he makes would receive a rushed vote on the House floor with no amendments and limited debate. In fact, the Obama Administration is already negotiating these deals in secret. The draft agreements are treated like state secrets, meaning lawmakers may only review them under strict rules \u2013 no notes, no copies, no staff. Given his track record of broken promises and circumventing Congress, why should the American people trust that any agreement President Obama negotiates will be in their best interest? There is concern in Congress on both sides of the aisle that he will not cut a fair deal.\n\nLast weekend, Ryan appeared on national television to claim\u2014prematurely, it seems\u2014that the votes are there in the House to pass this. He\u2019s claimed the same thing on other matters before, like last Congress he said there were the votes to pass amnesty when there weren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe will have the votes,\u201d Ryan said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union this weekend.\n\nBut with the widespread House Republican opposition emerging quickly\u2014more and more members are speaking out\u2014it\u2019s going to be a brutal bean-counting battle as the days go on. The House won\u2019t take up fast-track Obamatrade until next week, and as House members face their constituents over the Memorial Day weekend, the GOP opposition is likely to keep growing. Since only maybe 20 or so Democrats will vote for Obamatrade, Ryan\u2014who\u2019s guiding this fight for Speaker John Boehner\u2014would need to deliver at least 200 Republican votes out of 245 GOP members in the House. But with the scores of Republicans coming out against it, he just may fail yet.\n\nPolitico seems to get the joke, too, and wrote a big story on Wednesday detailing how this fight is the battle of Paul Ryan\u2019s career. If he fails yet again\u2014like he\u2019s failed so many times before\u2014Ryan\u2019s credibility will forever be shot, Politico wrote.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s successful, it will be a legacy-burnishing accomplishment. If Ryan fails, it matters little whether Democrats and Republicans are to blame,\u201d Politico\u2019s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer wrote. \u201cRyan\u2019s detractors are sure to relish in an I-told-you-so moment months in the making. While he\u2019s universally known as a policy wonk, some Republicans privately wonder whether Ryan has the vote-counting acumen to get complex legislation through the House.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chance Of Obamatrade Doom Improving: House Republicans Build Firewall Against Secret Trade Package", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Chance Of Obamatrade Doom Improving: House Republicans Build Firewall Against Secret Trade Package", "title": "Chance Of Obamatrade Doom Improving: House Republicans Build Firewall Against Secret Trade Package - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Ryan-425-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/20/chance-of-obamatrade-doom-improving-house-republicans-build-firewall-against-secret-trade-package/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chance Of Obamatrade Doom Improving: House Republicans Build Firewall Against Secret Trade Package", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Ryan-425-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Chance Of Obamatrade Doom Improving: House Republicans Build Firewall Against Secret Trade Package - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "House Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan, Obamatrade, Paul Ryan, Trade Promotion Authority, Trans Pacific Partnership,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Trans Pacific Partnership", "published_time": "2015-05-20T10:15:23-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb639\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m for trade, trade means opportunity.\nThe only question is: Can House Republicans opposed to Obamatrade get enough members together to stop Ryan\u2019s elitist agenda?\nThe House won\u2019t take up fast-track Obamatrade until next week, and as House members face their constituents over the Memorial Day weekend, the GOP opposition is likely to keep growing.\n\u201cSo I think that combination is the problem.\u201dJordan previously expressed skepticism of the deal, but now he\u2019s going even further in opposition.\nThe other new thing being talked about and being done in the Senate is I think they\u2019re adding Trade Adjustment to the actual Trade Promotion Authority."}
