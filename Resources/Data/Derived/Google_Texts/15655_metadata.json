Now the college is celebrating 30 years of accreditation. A celebration was held on December 10 at the Beaver Painted Lodge Student Commons.\n\nSome of the current staff were around in 1985, and remember the laborious task of compiling data for the accreditation application.\n\n\u201cNearly framed like a historical piece of art, the thick binder remains in the business office today, reminding the college of a job well done,\u201d reads a press release about the anniversary.\n\nBCC is one of 34 nationally accredited tribal colleges and universities. It is located on the Blackfeet Reservation in northwestern Montana.\n\n\u201cLike any college, BCC had its share of growing pains, working hard to increase student enrollment, meet campus facility needs, stabilize funding gaps, and promote vitality through higher education,\u201d says the release. \u201cAt this point, BCC can look back and see the growth. The college has grown from scattered classrooms across the reservation to a permanent campus.\u201d\n\nThat campus features the first LEED Platinum certified building in Montana, which boasts a state-of-the-art research lab. The college also recently established its first 2+2 baccalaureate program with hybrid/online courses that allow students to take the majority of upper-division classwork at BCC.\n\n\u201cThis exciting step sets the stage for campus-wide academic growth, with plans for several baccalaureate degree programs at BCC in the near future,\u201d says the release.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On December 11, 1985, Blackfeet Community College received some great news: Accreditation\u2014now the school is celebrating 30 years of being accredited.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/20/blackfeet-community-college-celebrates-30-years-accreditation-162744", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2011/08/blackfeet-community-college.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Blackfeet Community College Celebrates 30 Years of Accreditation"}, "abstract": "On December 11, 1985, Blackfeet Community College received some great news: Accreditation\u2014now the school is celebrating 30 years of being accredited.", "keywords": "Blackfeet Community College, Native American Education, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Native American students", "dc": {"title": "Blackfeet Community College Celebrates 30 Years of Accreditation"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/12/20/blackfeet-community-college-celebrates-30-years-accreditation-162744", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-12-20T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Blackfeet Community College Celebrates 30 Years of Accreditation"}, "article_summary": "On December 11, 1985, Blackfeet Community College received some great news: Accreditation by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges.\nIt is located on the Blackfeet Reservation in northwestern Montana.\nNow the college is celebrating 30 years of accreditation.\nSome of the current staff were around in 1985, and remember the laborious task of compiling data for the accreditation application.\nThe college also recently established its first 2+2 baccalaureate program with hybrid/online courses that allow students to take the majority of upper-division classwork at BCC."}
