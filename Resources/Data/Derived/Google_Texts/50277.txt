SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. â€” Colorado Rockies right fielder Carlos Gonzalez felt pain in his surgically repaired left knee and panicked.

"I was really scared because all of the things I went through in the offseason," he said Sunday. "And then you start feeling weak again."

"I'm not going to go against him because it's spring training," Gonzalez said. "I'm going to do the same routine, getting ready for the game even though I'm not playing. But tomorrow, I'll probably be in there."

Gonzalez has played in only 180 of a possible 324 games the past two seasons because of a sprained right middle finger, a tumor on his left index finger and a torn patella tendon that ended his season last August.

"I checked with the doctor and he said, of course, there are going to be some days when I don't feel great," Gonzalez said. "It's normal."

Gonzalez said he had "fatigue" in his knee during a workout prior to Friday night's game. The situation got worse when he had stop quickly and throw home after catching Will Middlebrooks' fly in the third. Gonzalez left after striking out a half-inning later.

Gonzalez, who hit just .238 in a career-low 70 games last year, did not have a wrap on the knee Sunday as he headed to the batting cage.
