But not quite. There\u2019s still plenty of time left to be outside \u2013 and plenty of opportunities to get sunburned if you\u2019re not careful. Sun-damaged skin increases your risk of skin cancer down the road.\n\nRates of melanoma have been climbing for the last 30 years. KQED Forum recently called together three experts on sun damage and skin cancer, and we\u2019ve distilled their recommendations here so you can protect yourself.\n\n1. When Buying Sunscreen, The Right SPF is Everything\n\nYou\u2019ve seen all those SPF number: 15, 50, 100. The takeaway here is that you should buy a product with an SPF between 15 and 50.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control says SPF 15 is a minimum. SPF or \u201csun protection factor\u201d refers to protection from UVB rays. Those are the ones that burn your skin. The Environmental Working Group advises that anything over 50 is not only worthless. (50 blocks 98 percent of the UV rays; 100 blocks 100 percent) but could also be dangerous. That\u2019s because products may do little to protect you from UVA rays, which are the ones that damage skin. A high SPF may well prevent you from burning \u2014 but then you\u2019re out in the sun longer and cause other damage to your skin.\n\nSave your money and skip the \u201cwaterproof\u201d types. Sonya Lunder with the Environmental Working Group told Forum\u2019s audience that those claims are overblown. Lunder also recommended cream products over sprays because with sprays \u201cthe risk is too great (you\u2019ll) be missing patches of your skin.\u201d\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got the right type, make sure you reapply frequently and all day long. Lunder recommends applying two layers before leaving the house to give the sunscreen time to soak in. Then, re-apply every 90 minutes to two hours, more often if you\u2019re sweating or swimming.\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about the chemicals in the sunscreen, Stanford dermatologist Susan Swetter says not to worry. \u201cThe FDA is not questioning the safety of any of the ingredients in marketed sunscreens,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of the safety concerns that have been raised are actually based on laboratory investigations \u2026 and really don\u2019t have a real-life application in humans.\u201d But if you\u2019re still concerned, she recommended products with bemotrizinol or bisoctrizole.\n\n2. Wear Protective Clothing\n\nAll three experts agreed that you shouldn\u2019t rely just on sunscreen. \u201cSunscreen is one tool, but only one tool, in preventing sunburn,\u201d Lunder said. Long sleeves and long pants will help protect your skin, although you should still wear sunscreen underneath the clothes.\n\nUV-blocking clothing can be expensive, but Swetter thinks it is worth it. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear sunscreen underneath sun protective clothing,\u201d she says. (It) does a very good job.\u201d\n\nIf you have small children, consider long sleeve swim shirts if you\u2019re going to the beach or a pool.\n\n3. Avoid the Midday Sun \u2014 and Its Manmade Cousins\n\nTina Clarke with the Cancer Prevention Institute of California said her top recommendation is to stay out of the harsh sun altogether. The sun\u2019s rays are strongest between 10 am and 4 pm, so she suggests you limit the time spent in the sun during these hours.\n\nAnd skip the tanning salon, too. The World Health Organization has classified tanning beds as a Class 1 carcinogen, the highest cancer risk category.\n\nClarke also explained that studies show \u201cintermittent intense exposure seems to be most associated with risk [for melanoma].\u201d\n\n4. Use UV-Blocking Glass \u2013 eyewear, car windows\n\nIf you drive a lot, make sure you have tinted glass in your car. Even better, says Swetter, is laminated glass. Either type limits the amount of UV rays that hit your skin. And if you live at altitude, these considerations are even more important, because UVB rays increase 4-10 percent for every 1000 feet of elevation.\n\nFor eyeglasses, the guests all said most will stop some UV rays, but tinted glasses are always better. They recommend wearing sunglasses while outside as often as possible.\n\n5. Get Checked\n\nMelanoma can be a fast-growing cancer, so don\u2019t delay if you see something unusual. \u201cIt you notice something on your skin that is changing differently than the rest,\u201d Swetter says, \u201cit is important to get that looked at early.\u201d She says melanoma is also prevalent in people of color. \u201cIt should not be labeled as a disease of only fair-skinned individuals,\u201d she said. There has been a 20 percent increase in melanoma among Hispanics over the last 20 years. Get your doctor to check for melanomas, regardless of your skin color or your primary reason for visiting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For starters, when you buy sunscreen, stick to SPF between 15 and 50.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"5 Things You Should Know About Sun Protection\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/08\\/08\\/5-things-you-should-know-about-sun-protection\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-08 11:45:18\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-08-08 15:49:19\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20613,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/08\\/hotsun-e1407519125473.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "For starters, when you buy sunscreen, stick to SPF between 15 and 50.", "title": "5 Things You Should Know About Sun Protection", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/08/08/5-things-you-should-know-about-sun-protection/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/08/hotsun-640x442.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe12\"", "article_summary": "KQED Forum recently called together three experts on sun damage and skin cancer, and we\u2019ve distilled their recommendations here so you can protect yourself.\nThe World Health Organization has classified tanning beds as a Class 1 carcinogen, the highest cancer risk category.\nSPF or \u201csun protection factor\u201d refers to protection from UVB rays.\nSun-damaged skin increases your risk of skin cancer down the road.\nWhen Buying Sunscreen, The Right SPF is EverythingYou\u2019ve seen all those SPF number: 15, 50, 100."}
