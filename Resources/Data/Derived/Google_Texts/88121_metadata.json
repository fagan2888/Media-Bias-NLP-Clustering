(Published Monday, June 8, 2015)\n\nA national upswing of health insurance rates is coming to Pennsylvania, and that could mean bigger-than-expected cost increases next year for at least a couple hundred thousand Pennsylvanians who bought insurance in the marketplace created by the 2010 federal health care law.\n\nLast week's deadline to file paperwork with the state Department of Insurance showed that some insurers selling plans on the marketplace want rate increases of almost 10 percent \u2014 or well above that \u2014 in one or more of their plans.\n\nPhotos Princess Charlotte Makes Her Social Media Debut\n\nAt one end of the spectrum is an individual health plan offered by a subsidiary of Milwaukee-based Assurant Health that is seeking an average 61 percent rate increase. About 3,300 people are covered by it now, according to the company's filing.\n\nAt the other end is a group of plans for both individuals and small groups offered primarily by Harrisburg-based Capital Blue Cross. Rates in those plans would remain basically unchanged, according to company filings.\n\nThe Department of Insurance emphasized that it must approve any rate increase and that nothing is final.\n\n\"A key thing we want to stress is these are proposed rates only, so they may not be what the rates are come the fall,\" said department spokesman Ron Ruman. \"We have the authority to review them and we are going to do that very carefully and our top priority is consumer impact. That's important for folks to know.\"\n\nAntoinette Kraus, executive director of the Pennsylvania Healthcare Access Network, which works to help people get insured, said proposed rate increases last year also came down before they were finalized for 2015. One thing to consider, she said, is that if the rates go up, so will the size of the tax credits.\n\nAccording to federal figures, about 473,000 Pennsylvanians enrolled in insurance plans for 2015 sold through the marketplace. Of those, about four in five people \u2014 382,000 \u2014 qualified for a tax credit to help cover the cost of monthly premiums, according to the figures.\n\nAnalysts say that it is difficult to make across-the-board generalizations about the proposed rate increases.\n\nSome insurers may have underestimated actual claims \u2014 Assurant says its prior year rates did not fully account for the claims it experienced \u2014 or are seeking a significant increase on a relatively low rate. Some plans may be attracting an unusually high proportion of people who are heavier users of health care.\n\nIn any case, the marketplace is a new experience for insurers, and they will be basing their 2016 premiums on a full year's worth of data, the first time that's happened on the 17-month-old exchanges.\n\n\"There's a lot they have to learn: What the markets are and the profile of the people who are enrolling,\" said Robert Town, a professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania. \"They really went into it pretty blind, so it's not surprising that they have to make adjustments.\"\n\nIn some cases, insurers know that state regulators will pare down their requested rate increases, and insurers account for that in their original request, Town said.\n\nRates for 2016 should be final by early October. Enrollment for 2016 begins Nov. 1, giving people weeks to shop for a plan.\n\nSome of the bigger increases are being requested by Pittsburgh-based Highmark, including a 25 percent increase for an individual plan that covers about 118,000 enrollees in western Pennsylvania.\n\nHighmark spokesman Aaron Billger attributed the increases to heavy use of services, including expensive prescription drugs, by people who had not had insurance before they enrolled.\n\nNearly 50 percent of its marketplace enrollees were new to Highmark, and the insurer knew little about their insurance history, Billger said. That includes enrollees who rack up huge insurance bills, and then stop paying their premiums, Billger said.\n\n\"That's an example of sort of what's driving costs for everyone,\" he said.\n\nCopyright Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "A national upswing of health insurance rates is coming to Pennsylvania, and that could mean bigger-than-expected cost increases next year for at least a couple hundred thousand Pennsylvanians who bought...", "title": "Health Insurers Ask Pennsylvania Regulators for Big Rate Increases", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 10 Philadelphia", "description": "A national upswing of health insurance rates is coming to Pennsylvania, and that could mean bigger-than-expected cost increases next year for at least a couple hundred thousand Pennsylvanians who bought...", "title": "Will Health Insurance Rates Go Up in Pa.?", "url": "http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/health/Pennsylvania-Insurance-Rates-306416021.html", "image": "http://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/images/1200*675/generic+insurance+policy+generic+shutterstock_55614910+Gunnar+Pippel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A national upswing of health insurance rates is coming to Pennsylvania, and that could mean bigger-than-expected cost increases next year for at least a couple hundred thousand Pennsylvanians who bought...", "title": "Will Health Insurance Rates Go Up in Pa.?", "url": "http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/health/Pennsylvania-Insurance-Rates-306416021.html", "image": "http://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/images/1200*675/generic+insurance+policy+generic+shutterstock_55614910+Gunnar+Pippel.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcphiladelphia", "site": "@nbcphiladelphia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 196375740321}, "keywords": "obamacare, obama care, insurer, insurance, health insurance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nbcphiladelphia"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "obamacare, obama care, insurer, insurance, health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb02\"", "article_summary": "In some cases, insurers know that state regulators will pare down their requested rate increases, and insurers account for that in their original request, Town said.\nAnalysts say that it is difficult to make across-the-board generalizations about the proposed rate increases.\nPeople in Pennsylvania who signed up for health insurance through Obamacare may see an increase in their rates.\nThe Department of Insurance emphasized that it must approve any rate increase and that nothing is final.\nPhotos Princess Charlotte Makes Her Social Media DebutAt one end of the spectrum is an individual health plan offered by a subsidiary of Milwaukee-based Assurant Health that is seeking an average 61 percent rate increase."}
