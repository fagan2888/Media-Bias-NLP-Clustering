No, not Donald Trump. John Kasich.\n\nWith Trump acceding Thursday to the Republican National Committee\u2019s demand for a pledge not to run as an independent, Ohio\u2019s governor has positioned himself as another unconventional candidate, albeit one without bluster and anger. After waiting until the end of July to announce, he\u2019s shot near the top of New Hampshire polls behind Trump.\n\nWhile Trump has ascended with assertions that Mexican immigrants are rapists, insults to rival Jeb Bush and the slogan \u201cmake America great again,\u201d Kasich has avoided criticizing opponents. He\u2019s touting himself as a candidate with a record of accomplishment who is willing to work with Democrats, buck orthodoxy to help the disadvantaged and be a force of \u201cpositiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be angry in order to win an election.\u201d Governor John Kasich\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be angry in order to win an election,\u201d Kasich told reporters Wednesday after a town-hall meeting at Robie\u2019s Country Store in Hooksett, New Hampshire.\n\nJust as Trump committed a Republican apostasy by proposing higher taxes on the wealthy, Kasich has angered conservatives by expanding Medicaid under President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul. Nor will he rule out a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe rest of the field largely toes the party line. Almost all oppose anything to do with Obamacare, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has even criticized Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\u2019s plan to replace it as \u201cObamacare lite.\u201d Most have signed no-new-tax pledges and Texas Senator Ted Cruz wants to abolish the Internal Revenue Service altogether.\n\nAngry Competence\n\nThis has been the summer of Trump, as the New York real-estate mogul surged, disconcerting Republican elites. His aggression strikes voters as a solution to their problems, said David Winston, who is president of the Washington strategy firm Winston Group.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for someone who\u2019s going get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just simply someone coming in and blaming someone else.\u201d\n\nKasich is trying to capitalize on that desire by promising to pursue pragmatic and bipartisan solutions to immigration and other issues and to help the poor, regardless of opposition within the party. Unlike Trump, he\u2019s also emphasizing his record in government as an 18-year congressman who helped balance the federal budget and as a two-term governor as his state recovered from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cSome people say, \u2018You\u2019ve been in the system a long time, and all the voters like these outsiders,\u2019\u201d Kasich said during a town-hall meeting Wednesday in West Lebanon. \u201cI acknowledge their problems, but I think we all want somebody who knows how to land the plane.\u201d\n\nGetting Misty\n\nDuring five standing-room only events in New Hampshire this week, his 12th trip to the state with the nation\u2019s first primary and where about 40 percent of the voters are independent, Kasich sounded tones of both confidence and humility.\n\nIn New London, he said he has \u201ca really good chance to win.\u201d He became emotional at his appearance in Hooksett after he was introduced and endorsed by state Senator David Boutin, who called him \u201csteadfast\u201d and \u201cauthentic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes it just strikes your nerve, it strikes you in a way that you just say, \u2018I\u2019m just doing my best,\u2019\u201d Kasich told reporters afterward.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a refreshing Republican,\u201d a man at the Hooksett event told Kasich after he said he would fix Social Security and a gridlocked Washington by seeking measures that both parties could accept.\n\nAt each stop in New Hampshire, Kasich told voters to count their blessings that they lived in the U.S.\n\n\u201cYou will be best if you live a life that\u2019s bigger than yourself,\u201d Kasich told students at New England College in Henniker. \u201cBe a center of justice and healing.\u201d\n\nKasich, who has focused on New Hampshire as his path to the nomination as Bush and other top contenders have underperformed, now must demonstrate that he can compete elsewhere. While he\u2019s touted endorsements by Alabama Governor Robert Bentley and others, he was at 2 percent in the latest Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa Poll released Aug. 29 and tied for seventh in a national Quinnipiac University Poll on Aug. 27.\n\nKasich\u2019s rise in New Hampshire is mostly the result of committees backing him spending a \u201cmassive\u201d $5 million for television ads starting in July, said Mike Murphy of Right to Rise USA, the super-PAC supporting Bush. Right to Rise starts advertising in New Hampshire soon, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are confident Jeb will work hard and earn strong support,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nKasich hasn\u2019t come close to the $114.6 million that committees backing Bush reported raising during the first six months of the year, yet his $11.7 million through June 30 has been competitive with other candidates.\n\nWhat\u2019s important at this point is that Kasich seems comfortable and isn\u2019t retreating from unpopular positions, said Stuart Stevens, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee.\n\n\u201cHe seems to be enjoying it, which is a very healthy sign,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cMy experience is that candidates who are enjoying a race are usually doing well in that race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mark Niquette", "description": "He jumped into the presidential race late, says what\u2019s on his mind and tramples party articles of faith.
