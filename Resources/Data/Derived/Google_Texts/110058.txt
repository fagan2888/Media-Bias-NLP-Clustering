Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone, fighting for the seventh time in 14 months and just 15 days after a victory in Las Vegas, earned a unanimous but close decision victory over Benson Henderson at the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s Fight Night card in Boston on Sunday night.

Cerrone (27-7) won a seventh consecutive fight. The Denver-native mixed-martial arts fighter entered ranked No. 3 in the UFC’s lightweight division.

In a measured, tactical bout, Cerrone earned two takedowns of Henderson (21-5). Cerrone also caught the Colorado Springs native with a high kick to the chin in the first round.

Henderson kept Cerrone at a distance with repeated kicks to the thighs. “I couldn’t unload like I wanted to,” Cerrone said in his in-ring interview.

But Cerrone eked out a 29-28 advantage on all three judge’s cards.

In a post-fight interview, Cerrone said:

“This is a hard victory for me to celebrate. This is tough. I could tell he was timid in there. I love the dude. We grew up together.”

Henderson seemed displeased in the ring with the judge’s decisions giving Cerrone the win.

“The first round was close, second round I took him down, but I don’t know, I’m not a judge,” Cerrone said. “They say don’t leave it to the judges because you don’t know what fight they’re watching. I went in there wild and crazy like I am. Five rounds with Ben is what we always need. We’ll do it again.”
