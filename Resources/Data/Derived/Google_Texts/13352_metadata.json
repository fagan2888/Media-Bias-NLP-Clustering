Joe Heck (R-Nev.), chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel, told The Hill.\n\nHeck said his subcommittee would take it back up \u201cthrough the summer and the fall,\u201d a prediction echoed by Thornberry.\n\nThe Tricare overhaul, combined with other healthcare changes suggested by the commission, could save the Defense Department about $26.5 billion from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020 and generate $6.7 billion per year in savings by 2053, according to the panel\u2019s estimates.\n\nWhile the House NDAA, which passed through the chamber Friday, gave lawmakers their best opportunity to overhaul the medical network, Heck argued that they will have another chance to incorporate the commission\u2019s recommendations when Tricare solicits new contracts later this year.\n\nIn the Senate, the Armed Services Committee rolled out a draft bill last week that contained tweaks to Tricare pharmacy fees and preauthorizations. It also called on the Pentagon to issue information about access to care and give numerous reports on the status of its health facilities.\n\nBut it avoided more massive reforms.\n\n\u201cThe big healthcare nut has not been cracked yet,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on personnel, conceded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move [Tricare] in a new direction slowly, but eventually reform has to occur because the current system is unsustainable,\u201d he added.\n\nGraham said there might be some pilot programs over the next year, but any major revamp would have to wait until next year\u2019s defense policy road map.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) also urged caution for now \u201cbecause of the opposition to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do the possible,\u201d McCain said.\n\nHe also disagreed with House members who say reforms could come later this year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be this year. I really don\u2019t. I wish it were, but you\u2019ve got to have consensus, and we don\u2019t have consensus,\u201d he said.\n\nHeck, a former physician and an Iraq War veteran who has been on both sides of the Tricare program, said waiting another year might not be the worst plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree that it\u2019s in as bad a shape as people say it is. It certainly needs improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to do something in the short term while we look at a more comprehensive solution to the defense health issues.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lawmakers are ducking major reforms to Tricare, the military\u2019s healthcare program.", "description": "Lawmakers are ducking major reforms to Tricare, the military\u2019s healthcare program.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Martin Matishak", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lawmakers are ducking major reforms to Tricare, the military\u2019s healthcare program.", "title": "House, Senate duck reforms on military healthcare", "url": "http://thehill.com/special-reports/tommorrows-troops-may-21-2015/242770-house-senate-duck-reforms-on-military", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/getty-2011-12-26-pentagon-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-25T06:19:04-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-05-25T06:19-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/special-reports/tommorrows-troops-may-21-2015/242770-house-senate-duck-reforms-on-military", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-20T20:21-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-20T20:21:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-25T06:19:04-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/special-reports/tommorrows-troops-may-21-2015/242770-house-senate-duck-reforms-on-military", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lawmakers are ducking major reforms to Tricare, the military\u2019s healthcare program.", "card": "summary", "title": "House, Senate duck reforms on military healthcare"}, "dcterms.title": "House, Senate duck reforms on military healthcare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8766\"", "article_summary": "House and Senate lawmakers are ducking major reforms to Tricare, the military\u2019s healthcare program.\nHouse members say their bill does not include the recommendation because it came too late.\nHe also disagreed with House members who say reforms could come later this year.\n\u201cThe big healthcare nut has not been cracked yet,\u201d Sen.
