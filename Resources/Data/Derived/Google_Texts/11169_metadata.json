Just over 116,000 people signed up for private insurance through Access Health CT, the state\u2019s exchange, during the open enrollment period that ended Jan. 31. \u201cThe fact that all these customers have not made their first payment was kind of a shock to even us.\u201d\n\nPeople generally must make their first payment within 30 days of getting the bill.\n\nWadleigh said it\u2019s possible that a similar number of people failed to make their first payment last year, but the exchange didn\u2019t have the data to know.\n\nThe consequences could be steeper this year: While the exchange last year allowed people to sign up for coverage outside the open enrollment period without checking whether they had a reason that would have qualified them to do so, Access Health is following tighter rules for off-season signups this year. That means that people who didn\u2019t pay their first bill won\u2019t be eligible to sign up again, unless they go through a change in circumstances that affects their coverage, such as getting divorced or losing a job.\n\nStill, Wadleigh said some people could potentially gain coverage if they didn\u2019t pay because of problems with their bill, such as if it didn\u2019t include financial assistance they were entitled to receive, or if they didn\u2019t receive a bill.\n\nSeparately, about 17,000 customers must still verify information reported on their applications to maintain their coverage or federal financial assistance. Customers have 90 days to provide information on their income, citizenship or other qualifications in cases in which the information they reported did not match information available through federal sources. It\u2019s not clear how much overlap there is between the approximately 8,000 who didn\u2019t make their first payment and the 17,000 who haven\u2019t yet verified needed information.\n\nBecause the deadline for signing up for coverage was Jan. 31, some customers are still within the window to pay their first bill.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to quickly course-correct and make sure everybody understands that there\u2019s a little bit more to do to finish the enrollment,\u201d Wadleigh said.\n\nWhile people have 30 days to make their first payment, those who do get a longer grace period \u2013 90 days \u2013 to make subsequent monthly payments before their coverage can be cut off.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/02/22/about-8000-ct-exchange-customers-didnt-pay-first-bill/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, insurance", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/02/22/about-8000-ct-exchange-customers-didnt-pay-first-bill/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "About 8,000 people who signed up for coverage through Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange missed the deadline for their first payment and lost coverage, exchange CEO Jim Wadleigh said Monday.", "title": "About 8,000 CT exchange customers didn\u2019t pay first bill", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/02/22/about-8000-ct-exchange-customers-didnt-pay-first-bill/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/12/access-health-store-1170x878.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/02/22/about-8000-ct-exchange-customers-didnt-pay-first-bill/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "About 8,000 people who signed up for coverage through the Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange missed the deadline for their first payment and lost coverage, exchange CEO Jim Wadleigh said Monday.\nStill, Wadleigh said some people could potentially gain coverage if they didn\u2019t pay because of problems with their bill, such as if it didn\u2019t include financial assistance they were entitled to receive, or if they didn\u2019t receive a bill.\nBecause the deadline for signing up for coverage was Jan. 31, some customers are still within the window to pay their first bill.\nWadleigh said it\u2019s possible that a similar number of people failed to make their first payment last year, but the exchange didn\u2019t have the data to know.\nSeparately, about 17,000 customers must still verify information reported on their applications to maintain their coverage or federal financial assistance."}
