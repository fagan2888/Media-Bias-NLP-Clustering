Caffrey\n\nThere was no Christmas Eve miracle for a hospital that hoped to join the preferred tier in New Jersey\u2019s largest health insurer network before coverage begins this weekend.But today\u2019s preliminary hearing revealed more details about how Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield built its controversial OMNIA network. Apparently being the only preferred hospital in a market was important.Judge Frank Ciuffani denied St. Peter University Hospital\u2019s request to be placed in Horizon\u2019s preferred tier, because it would be \u201cextraordinary\u201d to take this step without a full hearing. St. Peter\u2019s, located in New Brunswick, argued that it will suffer irreparable harm, including lost revenue and damaged relationships with patients, once the OMNIA plan takes effect.The judge told both sides to return January 4, 2016, to schedule depositions and a full hearing, Ciuffani told the parties he wants the matter resolved quickly.Benefits under OMNIA start Saturday for some public employees covered by the plan, and on January 1, 2016 for everyone else. Horizon attorney Michael Kassak said today OMNIA will cover 3% of the market.\u201cHorizon is pleased that the court has refused this effort by St. Peter\u2019s to change the implementation of Horizon\u2019s OMNIA health plans. This is good news for the thousands of individuals who have purchased OMNIA health plans to date,\u201d said Horizon spokesman Thomas Vincz.Since it was unveiled September 10, 2015, Horizon\u2019s OMNIA plan has drawn fire from mayors, legislators, and hospitals that were not included in the preferred network, known as Tier 1. OMNIA is both a tiered network, which was approved by state regulators, and a population health alliance, which is designed to move away from traditional fee-for-service healthcare delivery as called for under the Affordable Care Act.Around the country, population health contracts are becoming more common in managed care, as providers work with patients to stay on their medication, get health screenings, and take other steps to avoid major health crises that result in multi-day hospital stays. Providers then share in the savings that result from such activity.In the case of OMNIA, these agreements came with another element: those in the preferred network would also charge lower rates in exchange for having more patients routed their way. St. Peter\u2019s attorney Jeffrey Greenbaum argued that depositions revealed that giving Tier 1 exclusivity to St. Peter\u2019s competitor in New Brunswick, Robert Wood Johnson, was key to getting the RWJ agreement. Like most of the other OMNIA partners, RWJ is a large, multi-hospital system, while St. Peter\u2019s is a standalone hospital.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "NJ Judge Won't Grant Hospital Injunction in Horizon Dispute", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "site_name": "AJMC", "description": "St. Peter's University Hospital of New Brunswick argued that it will suffer irreparable harm if Horizon's OMNIA plan takes effect in the new year and it is not included in the preferred hospital tier."}, "twitter": {"image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "site": "@AJMC_Journal", "card": "summary", "description": "St. Peter's University Hospital of New Brunswick argued that it will suffer irreparable harm if Horizon's OMNIA plan takes effect in the new year and it is not included in the preferred hospital tier."}}, "article_summary": "Like most of the other OMNIA partners, RWJ is a large, multi-hospital system, while St. Peter\u2019s is a standalone hospital.\nSt. Peter\u2019s attorney Jeffrey Greenbaum argued that depositions revealed that giving Tier 1 exclusivity to St. Peter\u2019s competitor in New Brunswick, Robert Wood Johnson, was key to getting the RWJ agreement.\nSt. Peter's University Hospital of New Brunswick argued that it will suffer irreparable harm if Horizon's OMNIA plan takes effect in the new year and it is not included in the preferred hospital tier.\nHorizon attorney Michael Kassak said today OMNIA will cover 3% of the market.\u201cHorizon is pleased that the court has refused this effort by St. Peter\u2019s to change the implementation of Horizon\u2019s OMNIA health plans.\nApparently being the only preferred hospital in a market was important.Judge Frank Ciuffani denied St. Peter University Hospital\u2019s request to be placed in Horizon\u2019s preferred tier, because it would be \u201cextraordinary\u201d to take this step without a full hearing."}
