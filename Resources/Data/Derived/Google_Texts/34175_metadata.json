I think that June 17 was not just the city\u2019s test, but my test,\u201d he said, adding that he felt a personal responsibility to ensure the city didn\u2019t descend into violence and rioting.\n\n\u201cAny person who wants to be the mayor of any city, if they cannot stand up in crisis and protect the people and reputation of the city, they\u2019re not worth a grain of salt. So I think that it forced me into statesmanship, which is an important characteristic for anybody who wants to be mayor of a city.\u201d\n\nGregorie spoke while seated on a shaded Hampton Park bench next to the city\u2019s new Denmark Vesey statue.\n\nVesey, a former slave who won a lottery and bought his freedom, also was a member of Emanuel AME, and his foiled plans for a slave revolt in 1820 led to the church\u2019s first major crisis, when it was burned to the ground.\n\nAs Gregorie talked, a young black couple walked around the statue and read its inscription on the base, possibly unaware that the man talking quietly on the bench nearby was angling to become the first black mayor in the city\u2019s 232-year history.\n\nSome may consider erecting a statue to a person behind a plot to kill every white man, woman and child in the city a divisive idea, but Gregorie said that many people in the black community consider Vesey a freedom fighter.\n\nHe glanced back at the bronze statue as he spoke about it as a sign of the city\u2019s racial progress \u2014 proof the city is open to remembering historic figures both white and black.\n\n\u201cAnytime the city of the Confederacy builds a statue to Denmark Vesey, that kind of lets you know we\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d he said. \u201cI kind of use this as the barometer as how far we\u2019ve come as a city and as a state. That kind of calmed them (in the national media) down because they were trying to raise some dissension, and under no circumstances was I going to allow that to happen, especially as a city councilman.\u201d\n\nMulti-racial supporters\n\nWhile Gregorie\u2019s base would appear to be the city\u2019s black voters, there are two other black candidates in the race, as well \u2014 former City Councilman Maurice Washington and nonprofit consultant Toby Smith.\n\nGregorie\u2019s donors include dozens of Charleston\u2019s black professionals, but he said they aren\u2019t necessarily his base but rather many of the people he knows best.\n\nHis public service began in 1974 when he worked pushing carts for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. He worked his way all the way up to an executive level, then retired and was first elected to City Council in 2009.\n\nDistrict 6 had a black majority at the time, but it was redrawn after the 2010 Census and now has more white than black voters. Some expected he would have trouble in his 2013 re-election bid, where he faced four opponents.\n\n\u201cEverybody predicted a runoff, but I won every single white precinct and walked away with 62 percent of the vote,\u201d he said.\n\nHe credited the big win to his attention to constituent service work. He may be the only City Council member ever to hire a part-time employee \u2014 Mona Lisa Simms \u2014 to help with this service. \u201cEveryone in our district knows her as a no-nonsense, get-the-job-done person,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd he noted he got white support during his 2011 mayoral bid, particularly from residents upset over cruise ships.\n\nBut that support also proved controversial, as an anonymous political group \u2014 one exempted from public disclosure under state ethics laws \u2014 funded ads on Gregorie\u2019s behalf. Gregorie distanced himself from that effort at the time, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re running our race.\u201d\n\nGregorie, whose other interests include listening to jazz and gospel as well as renovating houses, has planned to become mayor of Charleston for almost two decades \u2014 he mentioned his goal to some Housing and Urban Development colleagues years before he even moved back to his home state in 1999 to direct HUD\u2019s statewide office in Columbia.\n\nGregorie was unable to unseat Mayor Joe Riley in 2007 and 2011, but with Riley retiring when his term is done in January, Gregorie hopes to triumph on his third try.\n\nAsked about his accomplishments as a councilman, he pointed to his successful push to have City Council meetings televised and to have \u201cThe Crosstown\u201d street signs along U.S. Highway 17 removed and replaced with \u201cSeptima P. Clark Parkway\u201d signs. He currently is pushing for a way to honor his Mother Emanuel church along eastern Calhoun Street.\n\nBut he said his accomplishments also include support of the city\u2019s current multi-million dollar drainage work along Septima Clark Parkway as well as the WestEdge development emerging off Lockwood Boulevard.\n\nAn affordability agenda\n\nGregorie\u2019s main mayoral message is that he would work to ensure Charlestonians can continue to call it home.\n\n\u201cI think we have an affordability crisis in our city. I think that is something that I think hasn\u2019t been out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need more affordable opportunities in this city.\u201d\n\nGregorie said his \u201caffordability agenda\u201d calls for more than creating affordable places to live \u2014 and ensuring those places remain affordable for decades, not just for 10 or 15 years.\n\nIt also extends to raising wages. Gregorie said, adding that he is proud to have helped the city recently raise its lowest wage for full- and part-time employees to about $10.30 an hour earlier this year, well above the minimum wage.\n\nBut Gregorie would not necessarily kowtow to developers who want to build new apartments. He said he would like to reconsider the city\u2019s \u201cGathering Place\u201d zoning \u2014 a category meant to allow more density in certain areas. \u201cI will be looking at those to make determinations as to whether we should continue some of those,\u201d he said.\n\nGregorie said he has another advantage, as the only current City Council member in the race.\n\n\u201cI have an ongoing working relationship with City Council,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think someone who is elected that does not have that relationship, there\u2019s a potential for chaos in terms of transition. A lot of people don\u2019t realize that all powers lie in council. It\u2019s not the mayor. The mayor just runs the city.\u201d\n\nHis colleague, Councilman Robert Mitchell, has pledged his support to Gregorie, whom Mitchell has known since Gregorie\u2019s work with HUD.\n\n\u201cHe dealt with a budget that was more than the city of Charleston has,\u201d Mitchell said, adding that the HUD job showed that Gregorie has experience handling finance, budgeting, community issues and management.\n\n\u201cWorking with council for the last couple of years would give him some insight as far as how council is thinking,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe has been working with them already.\u201d\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "A \u2018tested\u2019 Gregorie hopes third time is the charm, News, \r\nNewsPolitics, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Charleston,Charleston mayoral race,church shootings,HUD,Joe Riley,Mother Emanuel,Robert Mitchell,Septima P.
