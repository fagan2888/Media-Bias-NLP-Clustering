Instead of walking around and looking at other artists’ work at the Cherry Creek Arts Festival, several classes of 100 people took painting into their own hands.

Janus, a sponsor of the festival, partnered with Canvas and Cocktails to provide an outdoor painting class, Painting on the Plaza.

Music was played for the class while they worked, and many danced and sang along.

“It’s delightful, I got to come with my granddaughter, daughters and husband,” said Barbra Rubin, a beginner painter. “I am learning as we go, we’ll see what happens.”

The art festival, which runs through Sunday in Cherry Creek North, offers other activities for all ages, ranging from a children’s area with games and crafts to many booths showcasing all forms of art.
