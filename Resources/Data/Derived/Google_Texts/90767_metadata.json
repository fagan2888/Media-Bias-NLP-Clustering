Marco Rubio said Sunday that Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s refusal to agree that the United States is at war with radical Islam would be \u201clike saying we were not at war with the Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d referring to the former secretary of state\u2019s remarks during Saturday\u2019s Democratic presidential candidates debate.\n\n\u201cThat would be like saying we were not at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren\u2019t violent themselves,\u201d said Mr. Rubio, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nThe Florida Republican said Middle East terrorist groups like Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks on Paris that left at least 129 dead, are motivated by their religious beliefs, not geopolitics.\n\n\u201cWe are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world who they believe now justifies them in killing those who don\u2019t agree with their ideology,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs. Clinton said during the debate that \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims. I think we\u2019re at war with jihadists. We are at war with violent extremism. We are at war with people who use their religion for purposes of power and oppression.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio responded that, \u201cOf course all Muslims are not members of violent jihadist groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there is a global jihadist movement in the world motivated by their interpretation of Islam, in this case Sunni Islam, in the case of ISIS, and it needs to be confronted for what it is,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nMrs. Clinton said she did not want to \u201cpaint with too broad a brush,\u201d but Mr. Rubio insisted, \u201cThis is a clash of civilizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as I said at the [Republican] debate earlier this week, there is no middle ground on this. Either they win or they win,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to begin to take this seriously.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio said Sunday that Hillary Rodham Clinton's refusal to agree that the United States is at war with radical Islam would be \"like saying we were not at war with the Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Marco Rubio said Sunday that Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s refusal to agree that the United States is at war with radical Islam would be \u201clike saying we were not at war with the Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans.\u201d", "title": "Marco Rubio: Hillary Clinton\u2019s refusal to blame \u2018radical Islam\u2019 like refusing to blame Nazis in WWII", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/15/marco-rubio-hillary-clintons-refusal-to-blame-radi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/14/GOP_2016_Rubio.JPEG-06fb4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/14/GOP_2016_Rubio.JPEG-06fb4.jpg", "description": "Marco Rubio said Sunday that Hillary Rodham Clinton's refusal to agree that the United States is at war with radical Islam would be \"like saying we were not at war with the Nazis because we were afrai", "card": "summary", "title": "Marco Rubio: Hillary Clinton\u2019s refusal to blame \u2018radical I"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Religion Belief, Politics, Marco Rubio, Hillary Rodham Clinton"}, "article_summary": "Mrs. Clinton said during the debate that \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with Islam.\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at war with all Muslims.\nEither they win or they win,\u201d he said.\nWe are at war with violent extremism.\nI think we\u2019re at war with jihadists."}
