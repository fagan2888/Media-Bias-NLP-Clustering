She says her mom's urn was stolen over summer. The family was heartbroken to go months without a part of their family, but then they heard some good news.\n\n\"My heart just dropped.

It's too bad he can't be here to watch them grow up in person you know,\" Hall said.\n\nThe father of four is gone after he was killed in a fight with his friend Burton Eagle Hawk Junior.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking. It was like a nightmare that I was waiting to wake up from,\" Hall said.\n\nBoth were drinking the night Hall was killed, and his sister says she blames alcohol for what happened, not the person who committed the crime.\n\n\"My brother came to me in a dream a week after I lost him and he told me that it wasn't my spot to hold that grudge. If he forgave him then I had to forgive him too,\" Hall said.\n\nNow after that tragic event, Hall says she's been going to AA meetings.
