MINOT, N.D. (AP) - The owner of a Minot clothing store is putting together what she refers to as a multi-million dollar clothing line that will free women from a daily battle between their wardrobe and their bodies.

Chappy Windsor, 36, has had several pieces made exclusively for her to sell at her store called Dakota Chappy, the Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/1L28gpb ) reported. Windsor has gotten offers to dress celebrities in her garb, but would rather focus on everyday women, she said.

Windsor is aiming to help women of all ages who struggle with their clothing and self-image in a world with impossible beauty standards.

“I’m a Dakota girl, and my total vibe is with the women here: They have genuine taste, and they know quality and function. The brand name doesn’t matter,” she said.

One creation called the “Total Tight” is a one-piece, full-body tight that gives women more support and allows them to forgo wearing a bra or panties, according to Windsor.

“This is both inner and outwear. Why should you suffer?” she asks. “But the bra support situation is very, very personal. The push-up bra pushes tissue into the décolletage and takes the dance out of the collarbone. With too much push, most tops don’t drape right.”

Windsor has sold 4,000 individual Total Tights, and not dozens at wholesale, she said.

Other pieces include the “Total Jean” and “Total Jegging.” Her trademark “Sleeve Solution” attempts to address what she called the “bat wing,” loose skin on the back of an arm, which Windsor thinks is mainly a body issue in the upper Midwest.

“Other women don’t even think about that. Here, we’re so modest and so covered for 10 months out of the year, that uncovering induces anxiety,” she said.

Windsor believes that women shouldn’t be tortured by their clothing. She hopes her clothing line will someday be sold everywhere.
