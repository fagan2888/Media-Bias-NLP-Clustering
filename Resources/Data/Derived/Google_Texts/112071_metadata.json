The convention featured appearances by past and present stars of the Drag Race show, as well as panels and a key note speech from Mama Ru herself.\n\n\"When people ask me what does drag mean to me I say it's total liberation and freedom of expression,\" says Kennedy Davenport, a contestant on this season's Drag Race competition.\n\nThe once marginalized art form is a great example of a self-reliant community that has its own language, leaders, and support network. And now thanks to the efforts of RuPaul and the hit show, drag is pushing into the mainstream.\n\n\"I attribute so much of this to RuPaul's singular genius,\" says Bailey. \"The very first time Randy [Barbato] and I saw RuPaul we said, 'This motherfucker is going to be a star.' And then it was really just waiting for the rest of the world to catch up.\"\n\nApproximately 4 minutes.\n\nProduced by Alexis Garcia and Paul Detrick. Camera by Detrick.
