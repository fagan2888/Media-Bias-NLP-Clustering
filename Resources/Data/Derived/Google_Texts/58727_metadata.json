Called the Prevention and Public Health Fund, it aims at not only getting Americans healthier, but also quelling healthcare and hospital costs through preventative measures.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that up to 40 percent of deaths each year from the five leading causes \u2014 heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke and unintentional injuries \u2014 are preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMORE: These Pharmacists Are Making Affordable Medication for All a Reality\n\nIn Maryland, preventative care exploration has been underway since the 1970s, but thanks to the new funding from Obamacare, state officials have revitalized a plan to get its residents healthy.\n\nThe western Maryland city of Cumberland has one of the greatest needs for preventative care. The area, with a population of about 20,000, has notched an obesity rate of nearly 29 percent. The surrounding area of Allegany County carries a poverty rate of 16 percent, leading to poor nutrition practices, food insecurity, and often, costly hospital visits.\n\nBut Western Maryland Health Systems (WMHS) is tapping into federal funds to transition medical practices out of a traditional fee-for-service model that reimburses doctors and hospitals for each test, treatment, and medication. As critics of fee-for-service have noted, this model can lead to unnecessary treatments or substandard care which prompts further treatment. Instead, WMHS will help doctors cap and stabilize reimbursements through Medicare and Medicaid, encouraging hospitals to use more preventative care methods to keep their patients healthy, according to the American Prospect.\n\nPerhaps the more interesting part of the state\u2019s initiative is the community outreach teams that will visit the homes of patients with conditions like asthma or diabetes to ensure they\u2019re taking medicine and heeding a doctor\u2019s advice.\n\n\u201cIf you begin to work on controlling the healthcare spending in an area, you have to be able to confront and understand some of those social determinants of health,\u201d said John M. Colmers, chairman of the state\u2019s Health Services Cost Review Commission and a vice president at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nA variety of organizations across the state are pitching in to help low-income families find better sources of nutrition and increase exercise. The University of Maryland\u2019s extension office for Allegany County has implemented educational programs for families while passing out healthy recipes and helping out at local food banks. Two of its staff, Katheryn Kinsman and Eileen Morgan, have been working with local families for 26 years.\n\nTheir biggest challenge, according to Morgan, is getting inside the home.\n\n\u201cThere is an extreme amount of pride here, and just forming any kind of rapport here is hard,\u201d Morgan told American Prospect. \u201cJust getting in the door is hard.\u201d\n\nApart from pride, the poverty rate has directly contributed to the area\u2019s poor health \u2014 common afflictions include obesity, asthma, and untreated mental illness. To combat obesity, Morgan and Kinsman use simple methods like teaching how to prepare nutritious meals, learning to chop and stir, and finding sources of fresh fruit and vegetables. The two recalled buying clients a pot and wooden spoon before teaching a class.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a mom with very little resources and several kids, and you go into the market and you can get a box of 12 cupcakes for a dollar, while apples are a dollar apiece, which are you going to buy?\u201d Kinsman said.\n\nEven finding an area to exercise poses a problem for Cumberland, which is why the local extension office offers an exercise class at the community center.\n\nBut with renewed attention and funds to promote healthy living, state officials are hopeful to turn the tide in Cumberland and Allegany County.\n\nSource: The American Prospect", "article_metadata": {"description": "New funding from Obamacare revitalizes the state's attempt at preventative care.", "og": {"site_name": "NationSwell", "description": "New funding from Obamacare revitalizes the state's attempt at preventative care.", "title": "Maryland's Public Experiment to Combat Poverty and End Obesity", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://nationswell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Obesity.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-10T02:31:44+00:00", "url": "http://nationswell.com/maryland-preventative-care-poor-funding-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://bit.ly/1odQPsc"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NationSwell", "description": "New funding from Obamacare revitalizes the state's attempt at preventative care.", "title": "Maryland Takes Aim at Making Its Poor More Healthy", "image": {"src": "http://nationswell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Obesity.jpg"}, "creator": "@cmsub", "site": "@nationswell", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 1374360735}, "newsletter_img": "http://nationswell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Obesity-500x500-c-default.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nationswell", "published_time": "2014-06-10T11:30:58+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/C.Subramanian", "section": "Moving America Forward", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T02:31:44+00:00", "tag": "preventative healthcare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3a3\"", "article_summary": "The western Maryland city of Cumberland has one of the greatest needs for preventative care.\nMORE: These Pharmacists Are Making Affordable Medication for All a RealityIn Maryland, preventative care exploration has been underway since the 1970s, but thanks to the new funding from Obamacare, state officials have revitalized a plan to get its residents healthy.\nThe area, with a population of about 20,000, has notched an obesity rate of nearly 29 percent.\nInstead, WMHS will help doctors cap and stabilize reimbursements through Medicare and Medicaid, encouraging hospitals to use more preventative care methods to keep their patients healthy, according to the American Prospect.\nBut Western Maryland Health Systems (WMHS) is tapping into federal funds to transition medical practices out of a traditional fee-for-service model that reimburses doctors and hospitals for each test, treatment, and medication."}
