Reuters\n\nThe Ebola outbreak plaguing West Africa has caused widespread unrest as health care workers struggle to treat patients and outpace the rate of infections, while looters and other armed men attack clinics. And on Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it had to close a lab in Sierra Leone after a health worker became infected.\n\nThe testing laboratory, one of only two in Sierra Leone, was located in the two of Kailahun, which is close to the border of Guinea. It was closed after a Senegalese epidemiologist became ill with the virus, Reuters reported. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary measure to take care of our remaining workers,\u201d WHO spokesman Christy Feig said. \u201cAfter our assessment, they will return.\u201d\n\nBut pulling health workers is becoming an increasing problem, which will likely result in a worsening outbreak. Just on Monday, WHO said in an update that a \u201chigh proportion of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers\u201d had been infected. In all, 240 health workers had contracted the infection throughout the four afflicted countries \u2014 Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria \u2014 and 120 had died.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, medical staff are at risk because no protective equipment is available \u2014 not even gloves and face masks,\u201d the organization said. \u201cEven in dedicated Ebola wards, personal protective equipment is often scarce or not being properly used.\u201d In addition to that, doctors are working overtime, compromising their immune systems through exhaustion, while also working in protective gear that gets especially hot in the tropical climate.\n\nAs of Monday, Kailahun was ground zero for Ebola in Sierra Leone, where there were 440 cases of Ebola, or nearly half of the country\u2019s total. The epidemiologist, who is the first worker deployed by WHO to be infected, was sent to the clinic through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, a collaboration between institutions like WHO, UNICEF, the Red Cross, and Doctors Without Borders. He\u2019s currently being treated in Sierra Leone\u2019s other clinic in Kenema, as WHO determines how to get him out of the country.\n\nSince the virus first broke out in March, an estimated 2,615 cases have been reported, with 1,427 deaths. However, WHO warned that there could be \u201cshadow zones\u201d where infected patients are hiding among families. \u201cAs Ebola has no cure, some believe infected loved ones will be more comfortable dying at home,\u201d WHO said in a statement, according to Al Jazeera. \u201cOthers deny that a patient has Ebola and believe that care in an isolation ward \u2014 viewed as an incubator of the disease \u2014 will lead to infection and certain death.\u201d\n\nBesides the four countries in West Africa, a separate outbreak was recently announced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 13 people have died so far.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "who, closes, ebola, testing, lab, sierra, leone, after, health, worker, gets, infected", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A health worker in Sierra Leone became infected this week, forcing the lab he worked in to shut down, at least temporarily, as officials try to get a hold of the situation.", "title": "Sierra Leone Ebola Lab Closes After Health Worker Gets Infected", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-closes-ebola-testing-lab-sierra-leone-after-health-worker-gets-infected-300030", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/health-workers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A health worker in Sierra Leone became infected this week, forcing the lab he worked in to shut down, at least temporarily, as officials try to get a hold of the situation.", "title": "Sierra Leone Ebola Lab Closes After Health Worker Gets Infected", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/who-closes-ebola-testing-lab-sierra-leone-after-health-worker-gets-infected-300030", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/health-workers.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/health-workers.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-27T12:09:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T12:09:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A health worker in Sierra Leone became infected this week, forcing the lab he worked in to shut down, at least temporarily, as officials try to get a hold of the situation."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe150e\"", "article_summary": "And on Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it had to close a lab in Sierra Leone after a health worker became infected.\nThe testing laboratory, one of only two in Sierra Leone, was located in the two of Kailahun, which is close to the border of Guinea.\nAs of Monday, Kailahun was ground zero for Ebola in Sierra Leone, where there were 440 cases of Ebola, or nearly half of the country\u2019s total.\nIn all, 240 health workers had contracted the infection throughout the four afflicted countries \u2014 Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria \u2014 and 120 had died.\nJust on Monday, WHO said in an update that a \u201chigh proportion of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers\u201d had been infected."}
