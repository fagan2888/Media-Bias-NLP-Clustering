Lincoln Chafee \u201975 P\u201914 P\u201917 has been preparing for an imminent move out of his office in the Statehouse when his sole term as governor comes to an end this January.\n\nChafee\u2019s governorship is the most recent installment of a political career that has taken him from the city hall of Warwick to the U.S. Capitol, then back to the Ocean State as its chief executive.\n\nThough he faces low approval ratings today and largely stayed on the sidelines during the 2014 campaign to elect his successor, Chafee leaves the governor\u2019s office having served as a key player on Rhode Island\u2019s political stage over the past couple decades.\n\nSuccesses and setbacks\n\nChafee said he has some ideas of what he\u2019ll do after leaving office, though he did not elaborate. \u201cI want to make sure I don\u2019t get distracted with thoughts other than finishing my term well,\u201d he said, adding that this will entail \u201chanding off the administration in the best possible shape that (he) can,\u201d and addressing the outstanding costs in some state departments\u2019 budgets. He and Gov.-elect Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, have \u201cpledged to be cooperative in every way,\u201d to ease the transition to her new administration.\n\nWhile he has no intention of interfering with the next administration, Chafee said he hopes to see policies, including the gateway beautification initiative \u2014 a project to make the points of entry into the state more aesthetically appealing \u2014 and the implementation of the state\u2019s health care exchange, HealthSource R.I., continued.\n\nWendy Schiller, associate professor of political science and public policy, praised Chafee\u2019s handling of health exchange implementation under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cRhode Island\u2019s health care exchange under Obamacare \u2026 is actually one of the best functioning in the country,\u201d Schiller said, pointing to Christine Ferguson, Chafee\u2019s appointee to be director of HealthSource RI, as a strong choice.\n\nChafee said he was particularly pleased with the revitalization of the state\u2019s economy that took place under his administration, adding that when he took office, the economy was in \u201cshambles.\u201d He recalled an environment of \u201cdeep cuts to cities and towns, deep cuts to higher education (and) labor unrest,\u201d and said addressing these issues involved steady, methodical work and \u201creprioritization from the previous administration.\u201d\n\nChafee emphasized his commitment to invest in what he called \u201cthe building blocks of a good economy: education, infrastructure and workforce development.\u201d He added that he was pleased to see his successor emphasizing the importance of investing in the same sectors throughout her campaign.\n\nChafee dealt with a budget deficit for several consecutive years and managed to work with the General Assembly to make cuts that minimized harm to the poorest residents, Schiller said. \u201cI think that the governor was sensitive to the needs of a lot of people in Rhode Island who were hurting, and he did the very best that he could under those circumstances in terms of budget politics,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore Chafee took office, there was a failed attempt to merge Lifespan and Care New England, the state\u2019s two major health care providers. \u201cIt makes a lot of sense, in this small state, for them not to be competing,\u201d he said. He oversaw another attempt to execute the merger, which proved unsuccessful in large part due to \u201cfatigue\u201d within the bureaucracy that would have to approve it, Chafee said. The parties involved were afraid the merger would be costly and difficult, which Chafee said he insisted would not be the case. He said he saw this as one of his greatest frustrations while in office, adding that he would not characterize it as a regret because he could not see another way to make it happen.\n\nCompetition from out-of-state hospitals increased pressure on Rhode Island-based health care providers, Schiller said, calling this a complicated problem that Raimondo will likely need to address.\n\nParty switching\n\nThe evolution of Chafee\u2019s party affiliation over the years has been another issue of scrutiny for the Republican-turned-Independent-turned-Democrat. He succeeded his father, the late U.S. Sen. John Chafee P\u201975 GP\u201914 GP\u201917, R-R.I., in the Senate as a Republican, but he said he decided to become an Independent after growing increasingly frustrated with the Republican Party. George W. Bush\u2019s administration began in a period of peace and economic prosperity, he said, and following the Sept. 11 attacks, he saw the president and a \u201ccompliant Congress\u201d make a series of decisions with which he disagreed. \u201cWe were looked at to provide leadership, and we squandered it,\u201d Chafee said, adding that the congressional leadership \u201cknew better \u2026 but they just went along with the program.\u201d Chafee was the only Republican senator to vote against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was one of only two to vote against the Bush tax cuts. He made the decision to switch his party affiliation after leaving Congress.\n\nOver the course of his term as governor, Chafee joined the Democratic Party in May 2013 but then announced he would not seek reelection the following September. Chafee said this decision was due to several factors that he had always considered, including a long-standing plan to only serve one term \u2014 though he said he had not publicly announced this before. He cited an environment of frustration among the public when he took office, which contributed to an \u201cabsence of intellectual discussion\u201d surrounding several hotly contested issues during his term. Debates about in-state tuition for undocumented students, capital punishment and his decision to label the Statehouse Christmas tree a holiday tree \u2014 which garnered national media attention \u2014 were more intense than he believed they merited, he said.\n\nSchiller said she suspected Chafee\u2019s decision to not seek reelection was motivated more by a belief that he could not win. \u201cI think switching to the Democratic Party was a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cHe should have remained an Independent, because I think people respected Gov. Chafee\u2019s independence.\u201d Schiller said it was understandable for Chafee to leave a Republican Party that was becoming \u201ctoo conservative for his liking,\u201d but \u201conce he went Independent to Democrat, Rhode Islanders were less understanding.\u201d The move caused voters to suspect Chafee was simply seeking the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination, Schiller said, which upset many voters because he did not appear motivated by a genuine shift in political ideology.\n\nFrom Capitol Hill to College Hill\n\nChafee, who began his time in elected office as mayor of Warwick from 1992 to 1999, served as a Republican in the U.S. Senate from 1999 until 2007. He sat on the Foreign Relations Committee, a position he said he loved. Following his departure from the Senate, Chafee returned to College Hill as a distinguished visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies from 2007 to 2009, according to the Watson Institute website.\n\nIn his time as a fellow at the Watson Institute, Chafee taught what he described as a not-for-credit \u201cstudy group\u201d seminar for students to share his political background and observations. \u201cI had a class that combined politics with international issues, and students like both of those,\u201d said Chafee, adding that in teaching the class, he was able to draw upon travel experiences with other senators from his time on the Foreign Relations Committee and engage in political discussions with students.\n\nChafee, who said he was able to design the curriculum of the course himself, smiled when asked about working with the University to construct the course. \u201cThey were terrific,\u201d he said. \u201cI had guest speakers come in from all over the country, and even the world.\u201d Speakers included prominent international politicians such as Bolivian President Evo Morales. Chafee added he still maintains contact with many former students.\n\nChafee remained politically active while at Brown. After losing his 2006 race to U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., he \u201cthought for a long time\u201d about his party affiliation and became an Independent, co-chairing a committee of Republicans and Independents in support of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\nReflecting on his time in office, Chafee said, \u201cI knew it was a hard job and I just wanted to give it a 100 percent, and I knew four years is a long time,\u201d adding that he intended to \u201cput every bit of energy I could into turning the state around, and hand it off\u201d to the next person to reside in the executive office.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "Gov.
