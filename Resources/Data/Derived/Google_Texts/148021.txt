Occupations that contribute to a sedentary lifestyle and a poor diet are often associated with higher obesity rates. A report published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine has ranked a sample of popular U.S. jobs by their prevalence of obesity. It seems that being a civil servant is not the ideal occupation for your waistline.

Researchers from Duke University recently found that several businesses have launched subtle policies that encourage employees to lose weight. For example, Jawbone and Fitbit have started offering employees wearable fitness trackers while L.L. Bean has recruited 24 employees to take part in a program that offers exercise classes, nutrition coaching, and emotional counseling that will take place during company hours, the Wall Street Journal reported.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over one-third of the U.S. adult population is considered obese. While obesity-related factors cost companies over $73 billion each year, Americans spent upward of $60.5 billion on weight loss efforts in 2013 that were largely ineffective. Some of the jobs featured on the list of Obesity by Occupation, defined as body mass index of 30 or more, may or may not surprise you.
