Officials say a soldier tried to come on base Friday dressed as a suicide bomber.

That caused Fort Bragg to post a message on social media Saturday of appropriate and safe costumes for soldiers and their families.

WNCN quoted Fort Bragg officials saying, "The incident resulted in an emergency response, Explosive Ordnance Disposal clearing the entire scene and an extended closure of a gate."

The soldier was dressed with simulated explosive vest, but officials say initial reports indicate it was a Halloween costume. Those kinds of costumes are banned.

“All costumes should be appropriate in dress and tasteful. The Senior Commander of Fort Bragg further directs that Soldiers not wear costumes of this sort off post and strongly encourages Soldiers, DA Civilians, and Family members to follow the same guidance to prevent similar issues within our neighboring communities,” officials said.
