The investigation will be conducted under the Protection for Persons in Care Act,\n\n\u201cThey will find out how this happened and more importantly how to prevent this from happening again,\u201d Horne said. \u201cIt's completely unacceptable in this province and I will not tolerate it.\u201d\n\nThe Alberta Union of Provincial Employees also sent a letter to officials with Covenant Health, which operates the facility, asking them to resolve the reported infestation issue.\n\n\u201cWe have formally complained about the issue of a mouse infestation at St. Therese Villa in the past, and understood the situation to be resolved,\u201d AUPE health and safety representative Dennis Malayko said in a statement released Monday. \u201cI am very concerned that the issue has either re-emerged, or has been allowed to persist.\u201d\n\nMalayko said the reports of a bed bug infestation are new and are being taken very seriously.\n\nCovenant Health said Monday that officials are reviewing the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe allegations have not been verified; however they are concerning, and we are taking immediate action. Our first thoughts are with the resident and family,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\n\nCovenant House said it\u2019s been audited three times since last November, and no major issues were identified.\n\nThe organization noted that mice, \u201cdo sometimes get into buildings, especially during this season.\u201d\n\nWith files from CTV Calgary", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alberta's health minister has ordered an investigation into a complaint that a dementia patient was at a long-term care home was found with mice nibbling on her face.", "og": {"site_name": "CTVNews", "description": "Alberta's health minister has ordered an investigation into a complaint that a dementia patient was at a long-term care home was found with mice nibbling on her face.", "title": "Alberta's health minister orders reviews after mice found biting patient's face", "url": "http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/alberta-s-health-minister-orders-reviews-after-mice-found-biting-patient-s-face-1.1448033", "image": "http://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1447456.1378772109!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alberta's health minister has ordered an investigation into a complaint that a dementia patient was at a long-term care home was found with mice nibbling on her face.", "creator": "@CTVNews", "url": "http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/alberta-s-health-minister-orders-reviews-after-mice-found-biting-patient-s-face-1.1448033", "image": {"src": "http://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1447456.1378772109!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg"}, "title": "Alberta's health minister orders reviews after mice found biting patient's face", "site": "@CTVNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "CTV News \u2013 Canada and World News, Breaking News, Headlines, Business, Entertainment, Sports, Health, Politics and more", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "viewport": "width=1024", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.ctvnews.ca/?cid=ie9_taskbar_ctvnews", "google-site-verification": "fz6xMejqOO3K6yM8GQfLJoU0gq5jZXGtVP9g15XCSOs", "dc.date.modified": "2013-09-10", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#0183fd", "msapplication-task": "name=Health;action-uri=http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/health-headlines;icon-uri=http://ctvnews.cookieless.ca/bellmedia/common/img/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Canada, Alberta, Friends of Medicare, mice, dementia, St. Therese Villa, Convenant Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ec0\"", "article_summary": "The health advocacy group Friends of Medicare says staff at St. Therese Villa in Lethbridge, Alta.\nAlberta's health minister has ordered an investigation into a complaint that a dementia patient was at a long-term care home was found with mice nibbling on her face.\nAlberta\u2019s Health Minister Fred Horne called the reports \u201cdisturbing\u201d and said Monday that provincial inspectors have been dispatched to the facility.\nOn Monday, the group revealed that, on Sept. 1, a staff member found an elderly dementia patient with mice nibbling on her face.\nThe organization noted that mice, \u201cdo sometimes get into buildings, especially during this season.\u201dWith files from CTV Calgary"}
