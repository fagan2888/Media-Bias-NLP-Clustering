They argued that because some faith traditions have yet to fully embrace LGBT equality, they should be able to opt out of the executive order while still using federal funds. But the 100 religious signers of Tuesday\u2019s letter rebuked this position, insisting that the government is called to a higher standard of inclusiveness \u2014 especially when taxpayer money is involved.\n\n\u201cAs faith and civic leaders dedicated to affirming the sacred dignity and equal worth of every person, we are grateful for your upcoming executive order ending discrimination against LGBT people in hiring by federal contractors,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe urge you not to include a religious exemption in the executive order. In keeping with the principle that our government must adhere to the highest standards of ethics and fairness in its own operations, we believe that public dollars should not be used to sanction discrimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, if selective exemptions to the executive order were permitted, the people who would suffer most would be the people who always suffer most when discrimination is allowed: the individuals and communities that are already marginalized.\u201d\n\nThe letter\u2019s signers included several prominent Christian voices and clergy such as the Very Rev. Gary Hall, Dean of the Washington National Cathedral, Bishop Melvin Talbert of the United Methodist Church, and Serene Jones, president of Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Organizers of the letter also noted that among the signers were four former members of the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and five members of a presidential taskforce to reform the office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.\n\n\u201cIt is not right for any person or any corporation to use their religious beliefs, no matter how sincerely held, to trample the rights and beliefs of others,\u201d Bishop Gene Robinson, the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church and a signer of the letter, said in a press release. \u201cNothing could be more contrary to the Golden Rule, articulated in every world religion.\u201d\n\nThe letter also listed the names of many non-Christian leaders who oppose an exemption, such as Rabbi Rick Jacobs, President of the Union for Reform Judaism, Peter Morales, President of the Unitarian Universalist Association, and Imam Daayiee Abdullah of the Light of Reform Mosque in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe move is a counterpoint to several other letters penned by faith leaders who favor a religious exemption. On June 25, a group of 140 conservative religious leaders asked the president to include an exemption to assist groups who \u201csimply desire to utilize staffing practices consistent with their deep religious convictions.\u201d The following Tuesday \u2014 the day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that closely held for profit corporations could ignore the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate on religious grounds \u2014 another group of 14 Christian leaders relatively close to the administration sent a letter to the White House favoring a way for faith groups to ignore the executive order. Then, last Thursday, Buzzfeed reported the existence of a private letter to the president penned by Jim Wallis, head of Christian activist group Sojourners, that was circulated among many prominent clergy and also endorsed an exemption.\n\nDespite these efforts, progressive people of faith remain firmly opposed to a religious exemption. An online petition blasting the proposed exemption posted last week by Faithful America, a progressive Christian online advocacy group, has already garnered more than 30,000 signatures by people of faith. Many prominent religious voices \u2014 including several that signed today\u2019s letter \u2014 have also publicly opposed any religious exemption that would allow for the discrimination of LGBT people. In addition, a February 2014 poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that solid majorities of both political parties and every major religious group support workplace nondiscrimination laws for gay and lesbian people.\n\nAnd while many religious and secular groups endorsed similar religious exemptions written into the Employee Nondiscrimination Act, LGBT groups such as the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund are now opposing those as well. This mirrors the increasingly pro-LGBT perspective of the general public: a June poll conducted by the First Amendment Center found that a majority of Americans do not see an inherent conflict between recognizing the marriages of same-sex couples and \u201creligious freedom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"If selective exemptions to the executive order were permitted, the people who would suffer most would be the people who always suffer most when discrimination is allowed: the individuals and communities that are already marginalized,\" the letter read.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"If selective exemptions to the executive order were permitted, the people who would suffer most would be the people who always suffer most when discrimination is allowed: the individuals and communities that are already marginalized,\" the letter read.", "title": "100 Faith Leaders To Obama: Religious Liberty Shouldn\u2019t Be Used To Discriminate Against LGBT People", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2014/07/08/3457658/religion-letter-executive-order-exemption/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gay-pride.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"If selective exemptions to the executive order were permitted, the people who would suffer most would be the people who always suffer most when discrimination is allowed: the individuals and communities that are already marginalized,\" the letter read.", "title": "100 Faith Leaders To Obama: Religious Liberty Shouldn\u2019t Be Used To Discriminate Against LGBT People", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gay-pride-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@jackmjenkins", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gay-pride.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gay-pride.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T14:06:52+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jackiswriting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9a8\"", "article_summary": "LGBT 100 Faith Leaders To Obama: Religious Liberty Shouldn\u2019t Be Used To Discriminate Against LGBT People CREDIT: ShutterstockA group of more than 100 religious clergy, theologians, and faith leaders sent a letter to President Barack Obama on Tuesday urging him not to include religious exemptions in a forthcoming executive order prohibiting federal contractors from using hiring polices that discriminate against LGBT people.\nThe move is a counterpoint to several other letters penned by faith leaders who favor a religious exemption.\n\u201cWe urge you not to include a religious exemption in the executive order.\nDespite these efforts, progressive people of faith remain firmly opposed to a religious exemption.\nMany prominent religious voices \u2014 including several that signed today\u2019s letter \u2014 have also publicly opposed any religious exemption that would allow for the discrimination of LGBT people."}
