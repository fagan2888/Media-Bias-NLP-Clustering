Assured SKCG, the risk management and insurance adviser to many of the world’s largest alternative investment firms, has launched a new professional employer organization (PEO) platform for the hedge fund industry.

Assured SKCG, along with CIGNA Health Plans, is now offering a tailored PEO solution that enables small and emerging hedge fund firms to outsource human resources, payroll and employee benefits management, while addressing the compliance requirements resulting from complex Affordable Care Act regulations.



“Our new PEO platform offers a truly cost-effective solution to hedge funds that delivers attractive benefits to their employees without watered down plan provisions. One of our main objectives was to create a very competitive pricing model, from both a product and administrative prospective, that would lower our client’s cost even if they were currently using a PEO platform,” said David Parker, partner and president of employee benefits at Assured SKCG.



Assured SKCG is an insurance advisory firm serving commercial and private clients who require sophisticated advice addressing multiple risk factors. In November of 2011 the firm became a founding platform for AssuredPartners, the thirteenth largest insurance brokerage in the United States.
