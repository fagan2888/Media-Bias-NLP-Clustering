In states that opt to expand Medicaid under the ACA, those people would be eligible for coverage that includes mental health treatment.\n\nBut 25 states have not expanded Medicaid yet, meaning those residents with mental illness won\u2019t be eligible for coverage. The problem is most acute in Florida and Texas, both home to more than half a million uninsured adults with serious mental health and substance use conditions.\n\nThe 11 southern states that are not moving toward Medicaid expansion are home to 2.7 million people with mental illness. Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Missouri and Mississippi each have between 100,000 and 200,000 such uninsured adults. Georgia has 233,000 residents who suffer from mental illness, according to data compiled through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nSeveral Mountain West states have yet to move toward expanding Medicaid. Republican-dominated legislatures in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho have not taken up Medicaid expansion legislation. Utah, where Republicans control both legislative chambers and the governor\u2019s mansion, will take up one of several proposals; Gov. Gary Herbert (R) has said doing nothing on Medicaid expansion is the only option he will rule out.\n\nAbout 40 percent of all uninsured Americans with a mental illness are eligible for health insurance coverage under Medicaid as it stands now; under Medicaid expansion in states that have opted to accept federal money; or under state health insurance marketplaces.\n\nMental health care is included under what the ACA dubs the \u201cEssential Health Benefits\u201d package.\n\nNationwide, about 18 million Americans are eligible for coverage through Medicaid expansion. About 10 million live in states that have opted not to expand Medicaid. Nearly 800,000 of those residents have serious mental illness, while 1.5 million experience serious psychological distress and almost 1.4 million suffer from substance abuse disorders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid expansion would mean millions more would get mental health care coverage.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Medicaid expansion would mean millions more would get mental health care coverage.", "title": "Report: Almost 4 million with mental illness won\u2019t be covered in states that don\u2019t expand Medicaid", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/02/27/report-almost-4-million-with-mental-illness-wont-be-covered-in-states-that-dont-expand-medicaid/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2014/02/DashedHopes_Map.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/02/27/report-almost-4-million-with-mental-illness-wont-be-covered-in-states-that-dont-expand-medicaid/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health care, newsletter,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health care, newsletter,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde346\"", "article_summary": "Georgia has 233,000 residents who suffer from mental illness, according to data compiled through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nNearly 800,000 of those residents have serious mental illness, while 1.5 million experience serious psychological distress and almost 1.4 million suffer from substance abuse disorders.\nThe 11 southern states that are not moving toward Medicaid expansion are home to 2.7 million people with mental illness.\nBut 25 states have not expanded Medicaid yet, meaning those residents with mental illness won\u2019t be eligible for coverage.\nIn states that opt to expand Medicaid under the ACA, those people would be eligible for coverage that includes mental health treatment."}
