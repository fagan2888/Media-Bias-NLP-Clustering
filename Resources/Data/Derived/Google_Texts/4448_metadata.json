However, things appear to be changing with the claim Tuesday by Russian authorities that a Russian charter airliner that disintegrated over Egypt with more than 200 passengers aboard last month was destroyed by a terrorist\u2019s bomb, most likely planted by ISIS, which has claimed credit.\n\nRussia claims to be stepping up assaults on ISIS. Reports Tuesday indicated that Putin has directed Russian naval assets in the Mediterranean to cooperate with French forces and that a Russian guided missile attack struck the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa.\n\nIf Hollande appreciates Russia\u2019s response, it\u2019s likely he would think twice about trying to bring NATO into the fight. An organization largely seen as antagonistic to Russia and to the former Soviet Union before it, NATO has been the subject of many angry speeches from Putin, who claims the organization is trying to put Russia in a \u201ccage.\u201d\n\nRelated: Christians Only? Debate Over Syrian Refugees Quickly Turns Toxic\n\nAnother reason, according to Hofstra University Law Professor Julian Ku, is that the facts on the ground in Syria make the invocation of the treaty superfluous.\n\n\u201cThe main legal purpose of Article V was (is) to allow NATO countries to act consistently with the U.N. Charter\u2019s limitations on the use of force (such as they are),\u201d he writes. \u201cInvoking Article V should allow the U.S. to use armed force to assist France consistently with the U.N. Charter.\n\n\u201cThat might have mattered if the U.S. and France weren\u2019t already using military force against ISIS in Syria in ways somewhat inconsistently with the U.N. Charter. But they have been bombing for months already, so I am not sure it is even worth invoking Article V at this point.\u201d\n\nA third, though somewhat unlikely, possibility is that the U.S. might not support a NATO resolution. That\u2019s not to say that the Obama administration would oppose a request put before NATO to invoke Article 5, but rather that it might try to dissuade France from taking that step in the first place, preferring to keep the Syrian conflict somewhere in the gray area between peace and all-out war.\n\n\u201cThe United States in particular also needs to be very careful about any formal declaration of war,\u201d writes Anthony H. Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. \u201cSuch action raises serious issues about the rights of combatants, how you legally define ISIS as an opponent, and other problems in international law. Political rhetoric about \u2018war\u2019 is inevitable, but we should back away from it as much as we can. A formal declaration of war against a claimed state with international networks is a potential legal nightmare.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it would be virtually impossible for the U.S. to refuse a request for aid from its oldest ally, but such a request might wind up changing little on the ground in terms of military action and opening up a political can of worms.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "France has declared that it is in a state of war with ISIS following last week\u2019s terror attacks on Paris, but President Francois Hollande has so far avoided pulling out his biggest gun: invoking Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which obliges all members of NATO to regard an attack on one as an attack on all.", "title": "3 Reasons France Hasn't Asked NATO to Fight ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/17/3-Reasons-France-Hasnt-Asked-NATO-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-09-14T111426Z_1_LYNXMPEA8D05M_RTROPTP_2_IRAQ-CRISIS-HOLLANDE.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/17/3-Reasons-France-Hasnt-Asked-NATO-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-09-14T111426Z_1_LYNXMPEA8D05M_RTROPTP_2_IRAQ-CRISIS-HOLLANDE.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "France has declared that it is in a state of war with ISIS following last week\u2019s terror attacks on Paris, but President Francois Hollande has so far avoided pulling out his biggest gun: invoking Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which obliges all members of NATO to regard an attack on one as an attack on all.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: Will France Call on NATO to Join the Fight Against ISIS?\n\u201cInvoking Article V should allow the U.S. to use armed force to assist France consistently with the U.N.
