The bit was set up with Fallon claiming that he thought he pulled a muscle on his last joke and needed some help, reports Fox News Insider.\n\nHis \u2018intro\u2018 for Leno:\n\n\u201cOf course, here at \u2018The Tonight Show,\u2019 the monologue must go on. I think I\u2019m gonna sub out. Can someone tag in for me please?\u201d\n\nFrom what appears to be the audience, Jay Leno approaches Fallon and \u201ctags in.\u201d Leno was greeted with a swell of applause, cheering and whistling.\n\nFor his part of the monologue, Leno took shots at 2016 presidential candidates, Obamacare and the economy, with the last topic including some input from Fallon.\n\nA few highlights:\n\n2016 Presidential Candidates\n\n\u201cRalph Nader called Hillary Clinton a corporatist and a militarist. Isn\u2019t that unbelievable? Ralph Nader is still alive? He [Marco Rubio] is not the only Hispanic running. No, no. Sen\u00f5r Jeb Bush is also running. But as Jimmy mentioned, Bernie Sanders is getting a lot of traction. In fact, if Bernie Sanders wins, he\u2019ll be the first socialist elected president since 2008. Just something to think about.\u201d\n\nObamacare\n\n\u201cI like Obamacare. The problem with Obamacare is there are too many government agencies under the Obamacare umbrella. Like, I got a prostate exam the other day, but it was done by a drone and that made me feel a little uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nThe Economy\n\n\u201cThe economy is so bad, in California parents in Beverly Hills are being forced to raise their own children. That never happens! It is so bad even the Kardashians are losing their a**. (Fallon) The economy is so bad 50 Cent just changed his name to Nickelback. (Fallon) The economy is so bad Hillary Clinton wants people to look through her deleted emails to see if there\u2019s any from that Nigerian prince.\u201d\n\nThe L.A. Times reports that Leno has praised his successor, Jimmy Fallon\u2019s, skills on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d:\n\n\u201cJimmy\u2019s doing a great job, and he brings elements to the show I never did, [like] the viral videos,\u201d he said.\n\nLuckily for his fans, Leno isn\u2019t done with the small screen. He\u2019s doing \u201cJay Leno\u2019s Garage\u201d for CNBC, which is an extension of Leno\u2019s YouTube series of the same name, according to the L.A. Times.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"Hillary Clinton wants people to look through her deleted emails to...\"", "published_at": "2015-10-07T11:01:59+00:00", "tags": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"Hillary Clinton wants people to look through her deleted emails to...\"", "title": "Leno Whips Out His Funny Hammer and Nails Obamacare Below the Belt With Triumphant Late Night Return", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 684, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/leno.jpg", "height": 391}, "updated_time": "2015-10-07T14:00:56-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/10/439472-jay-leno-returns-late-night-stage-%e2%80%8bpolitical%e2%80%8b-monologue-hes-not-letting-anyone-slide/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"Hillary Clinton wants people to look through her deleted emails to...\"", "creator": "@KPendletonBooks", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/leno.jpg", "title": "Jay Leno Returns to \"The Tonight Show\" with Monologue That Hits Presidential Candidates & Economy", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kara Pendleton", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-07T11:01:59-04:00", "wp-categories": "27 2692 482 1471", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/10/439472-jay-leno-returns-late-night-stage-%e2%80%8bpolitical%e2%80%8b-monologue-hes-not-letting-anyone-slide/", "wp-category-slugs": "elections, entertainment, nation, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Elections", "published_time": "2015-10-07T11:01:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-07T14:00:56-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/mskarapendleton"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/leno.jpg", "post_id": 439472, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd57d8\"", "article_summary": "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Jay Leno made a surprise return to \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d stage with a little help from Jimmy Fallon.\nFor his part of the monologue, Leno took shots at 2016 presidential candidates, Obamacare and the economy, with the last topic including some input from Fallon.\nThe problem with Obamacare is there are too many government agencies under the Obamacare umbrella.\nCan someone tag in for me please?\u201dFrom what appears to be the audience, Jay Leno approaches Fallon and \u201ctags in.\u201d Leno was greeted with a swell of applause, cheering and whistling.\n(Fallon) The economy is so bad 50 Cent just changed his name to Nickelback."}
