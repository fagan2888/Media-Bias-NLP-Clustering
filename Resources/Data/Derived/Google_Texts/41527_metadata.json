People keep saying, Oh, the problem is you're going to have a selective network--\"\n\n(Full Interview)\n\nJoining us again, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an architect of the Affordable Care Act and vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDr. Emanuel, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: Good.\n\nWALLACE: Since the relaunch a week ago of the Web site, enrollment numbers are up sharply. That's the good news. But the administration says that the Web site is still sending erroneous messages or incomplete information to insurers about one in 10 people who think they have signed up.\n\nIsn't a 10 percent error rate still a serious problem?\n\nEMANUEL: Well, as I understand it, they're working very hard on those so-called 834 forms. And, second of all, they're working with the insurers to clean up that information. And they did push that a little further down, which they have time to do because they don't need to get the information to them for another few weeks. And they're both working really hard to solve that problem. In addition, they identified one bug that seemed to be causing a large portion --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: It's still a problem, would you agree, a 10 percent error rate? EMANUEL: Look, they're solving problems. In October, you said they couldn't solve the problem of signing up. They have gone a long way - -\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: I never said that. You're making that up, Dr. Emanuel.\n\nEMANUEL: And now, they put -- they decidedly put this second and they're addressing it.\n\nWALLACE: OK. Let me that I can the point. I never said they couldn't fix it. I'm just simply pointing out it isn't fixed and there's still a 10 percent error rate.\n\nLet's get into that, because you talked about the fact that the government sends nightly 834 forms, enrollment forms, to the insurers, which tell them how many people have signed up, who they are, all the information. But it turns out that somebody -- that some people are just left off entirely. That's called an \"orphan report\".\n\nIsn't it the fact, isn't it certainly a real possibility, that thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of people who think they've signed up, these so-called orphans, may end up on January 1st not having coverage?\n\nEMANUEL: Well, it's an interesting issue. When we did the Medicare Part \"D\" under President Bush, that was the drug benefit for seniors, there were a lot of seniors who were left out and actually did get their drug refills, and there were millions of people at that -- that had problems during that switchover.\n\nThese are large prob -- these are large switchovers. And the government has said, and I believe Medicare has said, it's very important to call the insurance company you have to make -- to verify that you have. In addition, in this case, they're sending out information with cards so people know whether they're covered or not.\n\nI think they're working diligently, but the insurers and the government to make sure people don't find themselves on January 1st or January 2nd without coverage.\n\nLook, that's an important thing. Everyone is trying to work together to solve the problem. We're trying to make this thing work. If there's going to be no glitches, I don't think anyone has that unrealistic expectation.\n\nI know when I got my iPhone, there were lots of glitches. They sent updates for that. This happens with large scale enrollment of millions of people. But I think there's a diligent effort now on everyone's part to reduce the chance of people being left off.\n\nWALLACE: All right. One of the keys to Obamacare, everybody says, is you've got to get young, healthy people to sign up. Let's put this up on the screen. A new poll by the Harvard Institute of Politics finds only 20 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds say they will definitely or probably enroll, 47 percent say they will definitely or probably not sign up.\n\nNow, you have acknowledged the fact that if you don't get young people to sign up, there's the danger of what's called a death spiral. That not enough people -- young people sign up, there are too many older, sicker people. Premiums go up. More young, healthy people get off. And you end up eventually with a pool of just older, sicker people with sky high premiums.\n\nEMANUEL: Right.\n\nWALLACE: That is a real possibility, is it not?\n\nEMANUEL: No, I don't think it's a real possibility. Let me identify several points why I think that poll is not a very useful piece of information. In California --\n\nWALLACE: It's from the Harvard Institute of Politics.\n\nEMANUEL: In California, when they looked actually at the number of enrollees and broke them down by age, the number of enrollees of young adults, I think it was 18 to 34, matched the population in California that you would expect. That's exactly what you want to be seeing. That's not a poll. That's actual signing up.\n\nSecond of all, if you actually look at --\n\nWALLACE: Can I just -- I don't mean to interrupt.\n\nEMANUEL: And also --\n\nWALLACE: No, let me just -- I want to put up some numbers, because I want to speak directly to that point before you move on. Then I'll let you move on. Put up this number. Obamacare needs 7 million people to sign up. That's what the president said over and over.\n\nEMANUEL: No, no, no. That's what the Congressional Budget Office projected would sign up.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nEMANUEL: That's not what anyone said you need. There's a difference between need and projected.\n\nWALLACE: I've heard the White House spokesman talk repeatedly about 7 million. If I may, sir, please. You don't want me to interrupt you.\n\nEMANUEL: All right.\n\nWALLACE: You need 2.7 million of those people to be between the ages of 18 and 34. That is a percentage, 2.7 million, of the 7 million of 39 percent, in California, of the pool, 39 percent. In California, the pool so far is only 23 percent. So, it's barely half of the 39 percent you need to have the right mix of young people.\n\nSo, your California example is completely wrong, sir.\n\nEMANUEL: No, it's not completely wrong. It matches the population that's --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: -- whether it matches the population. It doesn't matter. What Obamacare has said that you need in the pool to keep a sustain -- fiscally sustainable number.\n\nEMANUEL: No, I think there is going to be a fiscally sustainable number. And the other thing that I think you need to keep in mind is that the 18 to 34, a large number of those people are going to be on their parents' plan and not going to be buying insurance all on their own, up to age 26.\n\nAnd so, you're concentrated in a group of 26 to 34-year-olds. And that, I think, is where you need to get them to purchase with their own money.\n\nAnd that, I do, think is a group that you're going to be able to get. Let me just say one other thing. Here are three reasons I think people in that age group are going to sign up.\n\nFirst, you do have a penalty. Now, everyone talks about $95. But the fact is it's 1 percent of income which for most people is going to be more than $95.\n\nSecond of all, you do have subsidies for almost -- for many of these people that is going to make the price look very low and be very low. So, for example, if you're a 30-year-old in California, you can get a silver plan. And you make about 150 percent of the poverty line. You get a silver plan for $50 a month.\n\nThird, given the preventative services and other things, that premium actually is something you can easily cover by using -- by using the preventative services, where all society benefits because people are getting preventative care. So, I think actually there's many reasons for people to sign up that they will sign up. And --\n\nWALLACE: I just want to --\n\nEMANUEL: Let me finish.\n\nWALLACE: I have to move on.\n\nEMANUEL: One more thing I'd like to point out. No one has launched a big PR campaign to get these people signed up because of the problems with the federal Web site. We are about to launch a big pr campaign. And that, I think, is going to persuade a lot of people to sign up. WALLACE: I would simply point out the Harvard poll says only 20 percent say they're going to sign up.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: And in California -- no, definitely, probably -- and so far in California, it's only 20 percent. So, your 39 percent figure -- I understand the Obama campaign slogan was hope. At this point, that's all you seem to have that 39 percent are signing up.\n\nEMANUEL: We haven't had a campaign. And we have four more months to go to the end of March.\n\nWALLACE: President Obama famously promised, if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. Doesn't that turn out to be just as false, just as misleading, as his promise about if you like your plan, you can keep your plan? Isn't it a fact, sir, that a number, most, in fact, of the Obama care health plans that are being offered on the exchanges exclude a number of doctors and hospitals to lower costs?\n\nEMANUEL: The president never said you were going to have unlimited choice of any doctor in the country you want to go to.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Wait, no. He asked a question. \"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\" Did he not say that, sir?\n\nEMANUEL: He didn't say you could have unlimited choice.\n\nWALLACE: It's a simple yes or no question. Didn't he say, \"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\"?\n\nEMANUEL: Yes. If you want to pay more for an insurance company that covers your doctor, you can do that. This is a matter of choice.\n\nWe know in all sorts of places, you pay more for certain -- for a wider range of choices or wider range of benefits.\n\nThe issue isn't the selective networks. People keep saying, oh, the problem is you're going to have a selective network.\n\nWALLACE: Well, if you lose your doctor or lose your hospital.\n\nEMANUEL: Let me just say something. People are going to have a choice as to whether they want to pay a certain amount for a selective network or pay more for a broader network.\n\nWALLACE: Which means your premiums would probably go up.\n\nEMANUEL: They get that choice. That's a choice --\n\nWALLACE: Which means your premium may go up over what you were paying so that, in other words --\n\nEMANUEL: No one guaranteed you that your premium wouldn't increase. Premiums have been going up.\n\nWALLACE: The president guaranteed me I could keep my doctor.\n\nEMANUEL: Under president -- and if you want to, you can pay for it.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nEMANUEL: Under President Bush, premiums went up 80 percent after inflation. We have actually seen a leveling off of health care costs and premiums in the last few years because of changes that have been made.\n\nWALLACE: Finally --\n\nEMANUEL: As a matter of fact, choice is something we all understand and we all understand that for more choice, more benefits, you have to pay more.\n\nWALLACE: Final question. Last week, you had this to say about the Web site. Let's put it up on the screen.\n\n\"For the first time and most importantly, we actually have effective management overseeing. We have an integrator that's independent and that seems to be effective as opposed to having CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, run it.\"\n\nWhich seems to be saying -- if I can interpret what you're saying -- you're saying, finally, we've got somebody who knows what he's doing, in charge of CMS has screwed this up.\n\nQuestion, should the president fire either HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius or CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner?\n\nEMANUEL: I think not having an independent integrator who has that expertise and not having a CEO was something that was a mistake. I think the president recognized it. They put Jeff Zients in place. They promise to put a permanent --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: He came in place in October, after the disaster. My question --\n\nEMANUEL: That was a mistake.\n\nWALLACE: -- should someone be held accountable?\n\nEMANUEL: Look, the president is running his ship. He's going to decide how he's going to do it. Most companies when they decide, get right the ship and then decide what has to happen. He'll make a decision. He'll make a decision if he's going to find someone else to run -- he's already committed to have someone -- a new CEO to run the Web site, and the federal exchanges.\n\nAnd I think that is an excellent decision to replace Jeff Zients when he goes to the National Economic Council. And I think it's quite clear you need someone who can manage that and really run it.\n\nWALLACE: Dr. Emanuel, thank you. Thank you again for coming in, sir.\n\nEMANUEL: No problem.\n\nWALLACE: It's always interesting.\n\nEMANUEL: Good.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "12-08-13", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/4221.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"ObamaCare Architect: If You Like Your Doctor, You Can Pay More\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2013\\/12\\/08\\/obamacare-architect-if-you-your-doctor-you-can-pay-more\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/4221.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-08T15:26:29-05:00\",\"identifier\":\"59539\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Chris Wallace sat down with one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act Ezekiel Emanuel to discuss the effects the law has had on Americans and the broken promise", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.subject": "Chris Wallace sat down with one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act Ezekiel Emanuel to discuss the effects the law has had on Americans and the broken promise", "description": "Chris Wallace sat down with one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act Ezekiel Emanuel to discuss the effects the law has had on Americans and the broken promise", "prism.section": "nation", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "ObamaCare Architect: If You Like Your Doctor, You Can Pay More", "dcterms.created": "12-08-13", "og": {"site_name": "FoxNation.com", "description": "Chris Wallace sat down with one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act Ezekiel Emanuel to discuss the effects the law has had on Americans and the broken promise", "title": "ObamaCare Architect: If You Like Your Doctor, You Can Pay More", "url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2013/12/08/obamacare-architect-if-you-your-doctor-you-can-pay-more", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/4221.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "Chris Wallace sat down with one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act Ezekiel Emanuel to discuss the effects the law has had on Americans and the broken promise", "dc.date": "2016-05-24", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"ObamaCare Architect: If You Like Your Doctor, You Can Pay More\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2013\\/12\\/08\\/obamacare-architect-if-you-your-doctor-you-can-pay-more\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/4221.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-08T15:26:29-05:00\",\"post_id\":\"59539\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1d2\"", "article_summary": "But look, if you want to pay more for an insurance company that covers your doctor, you can do that.\nWALLACE: I would simply point out the Harvard poll says only 20 percent say they're going to sign up.\nDr. Emanuel said that folks can keep their doctor if they are willing to pay more.\nWallace: \"President Obama famously promised, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\nDid he say if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor?\""}
