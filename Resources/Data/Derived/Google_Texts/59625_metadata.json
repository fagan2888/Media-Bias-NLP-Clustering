The data shows that enrollment through the Marketplace increased more than two-fold and more than 89 percent of enrollees reported being uninsured at the time of application.\u201d\n\nNew York State of Health Director Donna Frescatore said in the release, \u201cYear two of NY State of Health was nothing short of an overwhelming success. We built upon our first year\u2019s solid foundation with significant increases in enrollment and high satisfaction rates across the board. As we move closer to the third open enrollment period slated to begin on Nov. 1, this data will inform our efforts to reach more New Yorkers. \u201d\n\nNYSOH reports that 86 percent of those enrolled plan to re-enroll in the coming period in the late fall. They also reported \u201cnearly three-quarters of individuals and families enrolled in a Quality Health Plan received financial assistance to reduce the cost of their insurance. The average tax credit was $220 per month, up slightly from 2014.\u201d\n\nThey also noted that 60 percent of those enrolled in the marketplace were under the age of 30, 18 percent between 18 and 35, 23 percent are between ages 45 and 54, and 25 percent are between ages 55 and 64.\n\nAccording to the website that 2.1 million New Yorkers are 10 percent of the state\u2019s entire population, which is a significant increase over the 970, 762 that signed up in the first open enrollment at the end of 2014.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Health and Human Services website, \u201cOn March 31, 2015 about 10.2 million Americans had paid their premiums and had active coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.\u201d\n\nThe Health and Human Services website also boasts, \u201cSince the passage of the Affordable Care Act five years ago, about 16.4 million uninsured people have gained health coverage.\u201d They state that those improvements come from the marketplace created by the ACA, Medicaid expansions and the stipulation that young adults can continue to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until 26.\n\nReach Reporter Jon Cronin at (718) 357-7400 x125, jcronin@queenstribune.com or @JonathanSCronin", "article_metadata": {"description": "(Chart Courtesy New York State of Health)The most popular health plans for Queens residents who signed up through New York State of Health.
