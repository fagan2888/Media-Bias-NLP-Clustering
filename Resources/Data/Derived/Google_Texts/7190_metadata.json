They've reinstated Tom Brady's suspension. You read the decision here from these appellate judges, they really think the lower court just blew this sky-high. There's no way, these judges, these appellate judges, say that Brady didn't cheat, Brady had to know. It's diametrically opposed to the lower court ruling. Anyway, it's not the big news of the day, but it's still somewhat surprising coming off nowhere, the four-game suspension for Brady reinstated. Be interesting to see what the NFL does with this now.\n\nCharles Koch Praises Hillary, Hillary Rejects Praise\n\nRUSH: Charles Koch is upset he can't find a Republican worth supporting who believes in what he believes: Lower taxes, smaller government; standard, run-of-the-mill conservative/libertarian philosophy. He can't find anybody. He said Trump's not the guy, and interestingly, he says he's not hearing enough things from Cruz to make him the guy.\n\nSo Charles Koch is saying, \"I may have to vote for Hillary. I... I... I... I... I don't know.\" Hillary's saying, \"I don't want this guy's vote.\" This guy doesn't believe in climate change. I don't want Charles Koch's support.\n\nMrs. Clinton Maxes Out Support with Democrat Women\n\nRUSH: The Hillary and Bernie race isn't over, and there's an interesting piece at TheHill.com as to why it isn't over, and it's not just to do with this FBI investigation of Mrs. Clinton. There's polling data out there that shows Democrat women have reached their limit with Hillary.\n\nMcAuliffe Gives Felons Voting Rights, Tells GOP to Go Win Their Votes\n\nRUSH: I mean, she's just boring them left and right. The Punk (that's our affectionate nickname for Terry McAuliffe, governor of Virginia) has just, via executive order, given 200,000 felons the right to vote Democrat. He's just lifted the prohibition against felons voting and has said to Republicans upset about it, \"Well, if you don't like it, start competing for their votes like we've done. If you want the felon vote, go get it, like we've done.\" So there's that. And we've got a really, really good audio sound bite roster coming.\n\nThe Green War Against the Working Class\n\nRUSH: Let me give you the headline: \"The Green War Against the Working Class.\" This is from the Heritage Foundation. It's a great, great Stephen Moore piece. It's about green energy and the havoc it's causing just throughout the mainstream of our culture.\n\nPope Francis: Happiness Is Not an App\n\nRUSH: \"Pope Francis Tells Teenagers 'Happiness is Not an App That You Can Download.'\" I wonder how many people were shocked when they heard that.\n\nMiddle-Aged White People Killing Themselves at Alarming Rate\n\nRUSH: We've talked about this before. This story is not going away. The number of middle-aged white people committing suicide in this country is soaring. White middle class Americans are committing suicide at an alarming rate.\n\nIntel Hires Immigrants, Lays Off Americans\n\nRUSH: Intel has hired 15,000 immigrants and then laid off 12,000 American workers. This is this B-1B visa story. You know what this really is? I know a lot of you people like Facebook, and some of you might think Mark Zuckerberg's a great guy, and Zuckerberg is leading this supposed pro-immigration, open borders based on compassion movement. But what Zuckerberg actually wants is what all of Silicon Valley wants, is cheaper labor. And it's the old story you've heard about Disney.\n\nThey hired a bunch of people who were from foreign countries and they fired existing workers, Americans, and hired their replacements cheaper, and then made the current employees train them. That story came up during the campaign earlier. The thing with Intel and all the other companies doing this, the real issue behind all this, there's a reason for all of these things happening.\n\nI mean, why do companies want cheap labor? Well, it's in the book, it's in the manual. You want the cheapest labor you can to maximize profits, but there's more than that. There are reasons why you want cheap labor just beyond what's in the book. There are extenuating circumstances, and one of the biggest unspoken extenuating circumstances is Obamacare and the never-ending list of demanded and required benefits that American companies must pay their employees. Now, in the case of Intel here, they hire 15,000 immigrants who will not be immediately qualified for Obamacare, nor will they immediately qualify for benefits. The 12,000 people they fire, they are off-loading Obamacare responsibilities, they are off-loading a lot of benefit demands that come from federal policy.\n\nSo Intel is basically shedding a large portion of its American workforce while it goes to every length possible to import more immigrants to the US because it's cheaper. But not just because it's cheaper because they're immigrants and they don't have standing and so forth. It's because they are not subject to all the Obamacare requirements and other benefits packages.\n\nAll of these things get pooled together, and they matter. And the left comes up with all these brilliant, great programs, and they just assume that businesses are gonna sit there and pay and pay and pay whatever new tax, fulfill whatever benefit, they look at these things, and they do not score the results of these pieces of legislation in a dynamic way at all; they do it very static.\n\nAnd all of these good intentions -- health care, affordable health care for all Americans -- ends up with nobody having better health care, nobody has cheaper health care, and in fact people are getting fired because they're required to have health care provided. It's tragic what is happening to this country emanating from liberal, left-wing, do-gooder, well-intentioned policies. And the real irony here is that all these CEOs are donating and contributing to the Democrat Party and so forth. That's why the Democrats are helping them on immigration and all that.\n\nBut the people getting caught in the middle, white working-class Americans being aced out of jobs here and there for one reason or another, and the very flavor and shape and form of the culture, our society, is being made over each and every day, gradually in ways that people don't even notice it. And in some people even applaud it. It's under the guise of diversity or openness or what have you. But the basic foundation that was this country is being undermined each and every day, primarily from Washington, DC, and policies that emanate from the Democrat Party. And, by the way, the Republicans don't get a pass because they haven't stopped it in seven and a half years. I can never leave that out of the equation.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "rush limbaugh, eib network", "og": {"site_name": "Rush Limbaugh", "description": "Tom Brady Suspension Reinstated...
