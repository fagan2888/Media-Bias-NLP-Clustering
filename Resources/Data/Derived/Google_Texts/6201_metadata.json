For any given customer, the rate will vary based on the person\u2019s age, county and plan.\n\nNote: Some companies are listed multiple times because they sell plans under various names or because they file separately for plans sold on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT, and those sold outside the exchange.\n\nAll these rate changes are proposed; the Connecticut Insurance Department\u2019s actuaries will now analyze them and determine whether they can proceed as proposed or must be adjusted.\n\nMembers of the public can weigh in on the proposals during the next 30 days.
