Prevention doesn't work that way. It's slow, so its powerful and positive consequences are often not felt for many years.\u201d\n\nPrevention is also incredibly effective. Case in point, the CDC on Thursday released new statistics that showed the percentage of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes declined from 20.9 percent in 2005 to 16.8 percent in 2014.\n\nIn other words, the number of smokers in the past 10 years took a 20 percent nose dive. Why?\n\nThe number one reason cited by the CDC for the drop was anti-smoking campaigns, i.e., prevention.\n\n\u2018More lip service than support\u2019\n\n\u201cThe saddest part of this story is that prevention is actually inexpensive and far more cost-effective than clinical treatment when you consider the millions of lives it can save or prolong,\u201d Bricker said.\n\n\u201cAnd the increased spending on prevention would have negligible impact on clinical spending. Both are needed and both have an important place in our national healthcare system. It's time our culture starts to see the benefit and start to demand the needed, yet so modest investment.\"\n\nAnderson also stressed the importance of prevention and said she would love to see a similar analysis of government funding allocations for research just on that.\n\n\u201cPrevention research fuels the pipeline for new strategies to prevent disease and improve health and we sorely need efficacious approaches to stem the obesity epidemic and better approaches to decrease tobacco use,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAdvances in either of these areas would have broad impact on public health but these topics often seem to get more lip service than actual support.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study has determined that public health funding, which drives efforts like disease prevention and immunization services, has steadily declined since 2002.
