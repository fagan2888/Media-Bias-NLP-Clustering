He didn\u2019t miss much considering steady rain put a slight damper on the post-race party.\n\n\u201cThe amount of effort that\u2019s gone into this race team this year with everybody at Richard Petty Motorsports trying to build this race team back to a winning race team, the way it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d Almirola said in a rain-soaked Victory Lane.\n\n\u201cThirty years to the weekend that Richard Petty got his 200th win is really, really special.\u201d\n\nThe Coke Zero 400 was originally scheduled to go off Saturday night, but steady rain forced it to be postponed a day. When it did finally get started Sunday, it was interrupted several more times.\n\nThere were three red flags, two of them because of huge accidents that took out most of the 43-car field and several top contenders. Jimmie Johnson, Tony Stewart, Kevin Harvick, Jamie McMurray, Carl Edwards, Kasey Kahne, Greg Biffle and Kyle Busch were among those knocked out of contention.\n\nBiffle and Kahne started the second massive wreck, a 25-car fiasco that ended with Busch getting flipped upside-down in his No. 18 Toyota.\n\n\u201cIt just felt like a slow carnival ride,\u201d Busch said.\n\nThe same could be said for the entire weekend at Daytona. Sprint Cup qualifying was a debacle, and then rain affected the entire, four-day event at NASCAR\u2019s most famous track.\n\nSunday\u2019s race topped it all, with just seven cars avoiding both crashes.\n\nNot surprisingly, Almirola was among them.\n\nHe became the first Cup driver other than Petty to win in the legendary No. 43 at Daytona. The previous time the 43 won was with John Andretti behind the wheel at Martinsville in 1999. So Petty\u2019s renowned car went 543 races without a victory.\n\nBrian Vickers was second, followed by Kurt Busch, Casey Mears and rookie Austin Dillon. Danica Patrick was eighth despite a late pit-road mistake, and reigning Daytona 500 champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. was 14th.\n\nAlmirola became the 11th different winner this season as drivers jockey for one of the 16 spots in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the Chase! This team deserves to be in the Chase,\u201d Almirola said. \u201cMan, I just took the 43 car to Victory Lane at Daytona!\u201d\n\nIn his third full season driving for The King, Almirola went into Daytona with just four career top-five finishes and had never finished higher than 18th in the standings.\n\nBut he and teammate Marcos Ambrose have slowly been inching RPM back toward the front, and Almirola had grabbed his previous career-best finish of third earlier this season at Bristol.\n\nThe decision to call the race drew mixed reactions from fans and drivers who waited through three soggy days to race.\n\n\u201cDang miss all those wrecks for nothin. Waited 3 days to race and didn\u2019t get to finish,\u201d Denny Hamlin tweeted moments after the race was called.\n\nHow FRR\u2019s Truex fared\n\n\u2022 Furniture Row Racing driver Martin Truex Jr. finished 15th in Sunday\u2019s weather-shortened Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway.\n\n\u2022 \u201cIt was a roller-coaster day,\u201d said Truex, who qualified 19th. \u201cWe never could get going. I didn\u2019t like what I was seeing early in the race, and I hung back.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aric Almirola wins rain-shortened Coke Zero 400 at Daytona", "title": "Aric Almirola wins rain-shortened Coke Zero 400 at Daytona", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/06/aric-almirola-wins-rain-shortened-coke-zero-400-at-daytona/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__aric-arimolap1.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__aric-arimolap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T13:44:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:10:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99d6\"", "article_summary": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Aric Almirola has won the rain-delayed and rain-shortened NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Daytona International Speedway, putting Richard Petty\u2019s famed No.\nAlmirola\u2019s unexpected win came on the same weekend Petty celebrated the 30th anniversary of his 200th win.\nHow FRR\u2019s Truex fared\u2022 Furniture Row Racing driver Martin Truex Jr. finished 15th in Sunday\u2019s weather-shortened Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway.\n\u201cThe amount of effort that\u2019s gone into this race team this year with everybody at Richard Petty Motorsports trying to build this race team back to a winning race team, the way it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d Almirola said in a rain-soaked Victory Lane.\nPetty wasn\u2019t around for the festivities, having already left Daytona during one of the many delays."}
