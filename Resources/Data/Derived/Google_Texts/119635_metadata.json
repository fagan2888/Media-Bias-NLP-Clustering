And no one knows how it will be resolved.\n\nNew York\u2019s Department of Financial Services announced on Sept. 25 it had ordered Health Republic, which it deemed insolvent, to cease writing new policies as of Dec. 31 and begin an orderly wind-down of its business affairs. A month later, state regulators said the shutdown had been moved up to Nov. 30 because the insurance company\u2019s financial condition was worse than originally thought. Health Republic, established in 2013 under the Affordable Care Act, insures 215,000 New Yorkers \u2014 44,000 in Suffolk County.\n\nThe \u201chold\u201d on claims processing was reported by Newsday Thursday. Department of Financial Services spokesperson Matt Anderson told the newspaper the agency had ordered Magnacare \u2014 which processes all Health Republic claims \u2014 to put a \u201chold\u201d on processing \u201cmost\u201d claims for Health Republic \u201cto conserve assets.\u201d It was not clear which claims would still be processed. Anderson did not return multiple phone calls or an email on Friday.\n\nNevertheless, Health Republic\u2019s customer service representatives and staffers at the DFS consumer \u201chotline\u201d insisted Friday that Health Republic subscribers are fully insured through Nov. 30.\n\nAsked whether processing claims has been put on hold, a Health Republic customer service representative named Samantha said Friday, \u201cAbsolutely not. That\u2019s not true at all.\u201d The state Department of Financial Services, which is \u201coverseeing things,\u201d she said, \u201chas put a limit of $2 million per day [on the payment of claims] and that has created a backlog,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou are still fully insured and these claims are going to be processed,\u201d she said.\n\nA call to the Department of Financial Services consumer \u201chotline\u201d Friday elicited the same answers from the customer service rep who answered.\n\n\u201cProviders are required to provide covered services to subscribers of Health Republic. They are running normally until the 30th and should be paying claims,\u201d said DFS customer representative Michael.\n\nBut Melissa Mansfield, a spokesperson for the Healthcare Association of New York, which represents more than 500 not-for-profit and public hospitals, nursing homes, home care agencies, and other healthcare organizations across the state, said Friday that Magnacare was informed by the state on Friday, Nov. 6 to stop processing Health Republic claims.\n\nNew York\u2019s hospitals stand to lose more than $100 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re out a lot of money,\u201d Peconic Bay Medical Center president and CEO Andrew Mitchell said. \u201cIt is an utter mess.\u201d Mitchell said he was not yet able to quantify the local hospital\u2019s potential losses for unpaid claims.\n\nThere have been local reports of health care providers asking patients to postpone non-emergency, nonessential care. Some have even told patients they are considered uninsured and would have to pay for services out-of-pocket.\n\nHealth Republic and state regulators say providers are not allowed to do that.\n\nIn a letter to subscribers, the insurance company cited \u201cexisting protections\u201d should a Health Republic participating provider seek to collect amounts owed to the provider by Health Republic for services provided to a subscriber. The insurer asks subscribers to report the incident to the DFS consumer assistance unit at 1-800-342-3736.\n\nBut an insured patient\u2019s legal rights in the event of a denial of care remain unclear.\n\nMitchell said PBMC is waiting for additional guidance from HANYS on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe situation is very, very fluid,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nState Sen. Ken LaValle, a member of the senate\u2019s insurance committee, predicts that whole \u201cHealth Republic mess\u201d \u2014 a mess created by Obamacare, he says \u2014 is going to be \u201ca very protracted affair\u201d and will be \u201cthe first of many.\u201d\n\nHealth Republic is \u201cjust the beginning,\u201d LaValle said in an interview Friday. \u201cOthers in coming weeks and months are going to announce the same thing.\u201d\n\nLaValle said the health insurance co-ops \u201ccommitted themselves to something that they couldn\u2019t sustain.\u201d\n\nNow, the senator said, \u201cwhat you have going on is, basically, a bankruptcy proceeding. You have people who, under contract, should be providing you care. They should be saying, \u2018Whatever your copay is, that\u2019s what it is and I will get reimbursed from the company.\u2019 But the question in a bankruptcy is how much are you going to receive on a dollar,\u201d LaValle said.\n\nLaValle blasted Obamacare \u2014 and Gov. Andrew Cuomo for creating the state health exchange by executive order after the State Senate refused to legislate it.\n\n\u201cIn New York we sacrificed a wonderful system, built over a number of years. We had a community rating system. We had a system where parents could keep their adult children on their policies up to age 25. We also protected patients with pre-existing conditions. We had well beyond what the feds and Obamacare required,\u201d LaValle said.\n\n\u201cTo jettison something that was working for something that was unproven \u2014 that\u2019s why our house was not willing to set up an exchange,\u201d he said.\n\nThe senate will conduct hearings to investigate what happened, LaValle said.\n\n\u201cThis is, quite honestly, a bowl of spaghetti that\u2019s congealed and you just have to unwind it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, patients are caught in the crossfire. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s lives. I pray that no one gets caught and loses their life because of this silliness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\nIf you are a Health Republic subscriber, we\u2019d like to hear from you. Have you sought medical care since Nov. 9? Have you had a health care provider inform you that you\u2019re no longer covered or asked you to postpone your visit until after you have new insurance?
