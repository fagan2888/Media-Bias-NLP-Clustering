"Syrian regime forces targeted a patrol of the Kurdish Asayish forces in Qamishli and two Asayish members died," a YPG official told Reuters.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the Syrian conflict through a network of sources, said two Asayish members died and three others wounded. The fighting came after Kurdish security forces stopped a car containing an officer of the Syrian national defense forces at some point in the past 24 hours.

The Observatory said the situation in Qamishli was tense and shops had closed their doors.

The Syrian army could not be reached for comment.
