In the survey, McAuliffe drew support from 44 percent of Virginians versus 35 percent for Cuccinelli and 12 percent for Sarvis.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFour weeks from Election Day, McAuliffe also leads Cuccinelli in a one-on-one contest, 52 percent to 42 percent.\n\nThe POLITICO poll, conducted by Democratic firm Public Policy Polling and Republican firm Harper Polling using automated survey methodology, is the first snapshot of the Virginia race to take into account the impact of the closure of the federal government. The survey tested 1,150 likely voters Oct. 5- 6 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.\n\n( WATCH: Virginia governor race poll analysis)\n\nFor much of the year, the Virginia race has been an exercise in mutual annihilation between two unpopular candidates, a dynamic that held up in this poll: Nearly half of likely Virginia voters \u2014 49 percent \u2014 have an unfavorable opinion of McAuliffe while 39 percent said they have a favorable opinion.\n\nMirroring a trend in other recent public polls, Cuccinelli\u2019s favorability numbers are worse: Only 34 percent of voters viewed him favorably, and a 56 percent majority viewed him unfavorably.\n\nSarvis is largely unknown, and his support could fade from the 12 percent mark before Election Day. Only 43 percent of respondents had an opinion of the third-party candidate with slightly more viewing him unfavorably, at 23 percent, than favorably, 20 percent.\n\n( PHOTOS: Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s career)\n\nThe major curve ball in the Virginia race, however, is the government shutdown, which is now entering its second week and could be expected to have an outsize impact in a state with such a large population of both civilian and military government employees. McAuliffe has led Cuccinelli in the mid-single digits in both public and private polling; his margin is wider in the POLITICO poll, and the shutdown is the most obvious explanation for that.\n\nBoth McAuliffe and Cuccinelli have spoken out against the shutdown. The Democrat has run ads tying Cuccinelli to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the so-called defund Obamacare champion, while Cuccinelli has accused McAuliffe of risking a shutdown in Richmond with his give-no-quarter support for Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThey have good reason to run in that direction: A full 62 percent of poll respondents said they oppose the government \u201cshutting down over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\u201d Thirty-one percent said they support the shutdown.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Virginia governor race 2013: Shutdown roils contest)\n\nOf the Virginia voters who oppose the shutdown, nearly two-thirds \u2014 64 percent \u2014 support McAuliffe while 16 percent support Cuccinelli, and 12 percent back Sarvis. Shutdown supporters prefer Cuccinelli over McAuliffe, 73 percent to 10 percent with 11 percent for Sarvis.\n\nNational Republicans take the greater share of blame from Virginians for the lights-out moment in Washington: Fifty percent of respondents said they blame Republicans in Congress most for the shutdown while 35 percent said they primarily blame President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats. Fifteen percent of likely voters in the poll said they blame both sides equally.\n\nDemocratic and Republican voters largely pin the blame on the other party, but independent voters blame congressional Republicans over Obama and Senate Democrats, 48 percent to 33 percent.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Shutdown puts Virginia\u2019s GOP in a vise)\n\nCruz, who boosted Cuccinelli at a conservative event in Richmond last weekend, is an unpopular figure in Virginia. He was viewed unfavorably by 45 percent of poll respondents while 26 percent had a favorable opinion of the Texas Republican.\n\nThe Cuccinelli campaign, which has regularly criticized PPP during the 2013 race, said in a statement that it flatly discounts the results of the poll and asserted that the race is closing. \u201cWe reject the findings within this poll. One of the polling outfits that conducted this survey has been exposed by a number of neutral news outlets for withholding poll numbers that were unhelpful to its Democratic friends,\u201d spokesman Richard Cullen said. \u201cKen is the only serious candidate in this race who will fight for Virginia and has a plan to create 58,000 new jobs.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe press secretary Josh Schwerin cited Cuccinelli\u2019s event with Cruz over the weekend to argue that the race is moving in the Democrats\u2019 direction: \u201cThe more voters learn, the more they side with Terry\u2019s bipartisan focus on jobs and against Cuccinelli\u2019s divisive focus on tea party priorities.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nFor national Republicans already anxious about the shutdown, the poll underscores the extent to which the clash between Obama and House Republicans has hobbled the GOP\u2019s ability to communicate with voters about anything else, including the Affordable Care Act, which prompted the Republicans\u2019 \u201cdefund\u201d push to begin with.\n\nIn recent weeks, Cuccinelli has blasted Obamacare in speeches and TV ads, and Virginians seem to share at least some of his skepticism about the national health care law. Asked how they would rate the implementation of the ACA based on what they have heard so far, 60 percent of respondents gave a rating of \u201cfair\u201d (18 percent) or \u201cpoor\u201d (42 percent) while only 36 percent said either \u201cgood\u201d (25 percent) or \u201cexcellent\u201d (11 percent).\n\nAnd Obama\u2019s personal job approval in the state is tepid at just 45 percent positive and 49 percent negative.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He is now 9 points ahead of Ken Cuccinelli.", "title": "POLITICO poll: Shutdown backlash boosts McAuliffe", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/politico-poll-government-shutdown-backlash-terry-mcauliffe-ken-cuccinelli-virginia-governor-election-97953.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/07/vapollswebteam.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Virginia (573),Polls (1207),Terry McAuliffe (120),Ken Cuccinelli (138),Elections (1519),2013 Elections (168)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He is now 9 points ahead of Ken Cuccinelli.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb533\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO poll: Shutdown backlash boosts McAuliffeDemocrat Terry McAuliffe has opened up a significant lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli in the Virginia governor\u2019s race amid broad public disapproval of the federal government shutdown, according to a POLITICO poll of the 2013 gubernatorial election.\n( Also on POLITICO: Virginia governor race 2013: Shutdown roils contest)Of the Virginia voters who oppose the shutdown, nearly two-thirds \u2014 64 percent \u2014 support McAuliffe while 16 percent support Cuccinelli, and 12 percent back Sarvis.\nMcAuliffe has led Cuccinelli in the mid-single digits in both public and private polling; his margin is wider in the POLITICO poll, and the shutdown is the most obvious explanation for that.\nShutdown supporters prefer Cuccinelli over McAuliffe, 73 percent to 10 percent with 11 percent for Sarvis.\nIn the survey, McAuliffe drew support from 44 percent of Virginians versus 35 percent for Cuccinelli and 12 percent for Sarvis."}
