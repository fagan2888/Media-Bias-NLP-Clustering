HARRISON, N.J. — As goal-scoring celebrations go, the Red Bulls’ captain, Thierry Henry, has a distinct flair for the dramatic with a flash of cinéma vérité.

Last season, after scoring a goal against Toronto, Henry struck a pose, leaning against the goal post. It was a celebration that spread quickly on the Internet, spawning a new meme: “Henrying.”

On Saturday night at Red Bull Arena in the team’s 2014 home opener, Henry perhaps provided a clue of his life after soccer (he is in the final year of his contract with Major League Soccer and the Red Bulls) when he did his best Jean-Luc Godard imitation, taking a page from the French New Wave film director.

Henry had just scored the 42nd goal of his Red Bulls career to move past Giovanni Savarese (the current coach of the Cosmos of the North American Soccer League) and into second place on the team’s career list.

In the 57th minute of the 1-1 draw against visiting Colorado, Lloyd Sam lofted a soft cross from the right side into the Rapids’ penalty area. As two defenders converged on the leaping Tim Cahill, one of the best headers of the ball in M.L.S. or any league, Henry was left alone by the near post. He dove for the ball and headed it past goalkeeper John Berner.

What followed was a bit on the bizarre side, but perhaps not for Henry.

As the video below shows, Henry jumped over the advertising boards behind the end line and shooed away a cameraman from his equipment, taking up residence behind the lens.

The goal is being called the “Director’s Cut.”

After the game, Sam said of the play: “I knew that if I put it towards the back post there would be a couple of guys there. In my head I would have thought Tim before Thierry, but I was happy that he converted it.”
