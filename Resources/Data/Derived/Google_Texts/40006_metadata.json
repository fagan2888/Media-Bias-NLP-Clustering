Justin Amash and Democratic challenger Bob Goodrich clashed on several issues during a debate today in Grand Rapids.\n\nAmash and Goodrich face off in next month\u2019s Third Congressional District election.\n\nThe wide ranging hour long debate touched on a variety of issues, from Obamacare to terrorism.\n\nOn the issue of illegal immigration, Republican Amash talked about the \u201cheartbreak\u201d he feels when he meets with families being divided. But the Republican incumbent says the nation\u2019s borders need to be secured and the immigration system reformed to control the flow of legal immigrants into the U.S.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately many people are coming into this country claiming asylum when they are not actually seeking real asylum,\u201d says Amash.\n\nDemocrat Bob Goodrich says the nation\u2019s immigration system should be more \u201chumane.\" He lamented that many Americans vow to take up arms to repel immigrants.\n\n\u201cWhy are we treating refugees as enemies? It\u2019s a mistake,\u201d says Goodrich.\n\nBoth men agreed the nation\u2019s guest worker program needs to be improved to better serve west Michigan\u2019s agriculture industry.\n\nAnd they agreed that one unwelcome visitor to the United States must be kept out: Ebola.\n\nThe first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States died today in Dallas. He recently flew to the U.S. from Liberia.\n\nStarting next week, people flying to the U.S. from countries where the Ebola outbreak is centered will have to undergo some medical screening.\n\nAmash says Ebola could pose a serious long term threat, if steps aren\u2019t taken now.\n\n\u201cWe need to do a better job securing our country from flights that are coming from those parts of the world,\u201d says Amash, who says the Obama administration has not acted swiftly enough to deal with the Ebola crisis.\n\nBut Goodrich suggests the biggest danger now is panic.\n\n\u201cUntil it\u2019s really proven to be a threat, let\u2019s not create one in our minds,\u201d says Goodrich.\n\nWhile the two men expressed very different views, the debate itself was extremely cordial", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "Michigan U.S. Rep.
