Much of his speech focused on their own struggles to achieve the American dream.\n\nThe senator spoke of his mom working in a factory assembling metal chairs and his father working as a bartender. He said his parents achieved the American dream through hard work and encouraging their kids to get an education.\n\nBut, Rubio said the system is broken, hampering students with debt and no jobs.\n\n\u201cWhen I'm president, before a student takes out a student loan, they are going to be told how much they make when people graduate from that school with that degree,\" he said.\n\nThe speech hit the mark for some.\n\n\"He has a great plan for America and I'm looking forward to voting for him in March,\u201d said Kraig Thorne after the rally. \"Marco's message rings really very wonderful and true to what my values are,\" said Lisa Bingham.\n\nFor at least one undecided voter, it seemed to be enough.\n\n\"I think he has my support at this point,\u201dGricius said after the rally. \u201cHe really connected with the average American\u2026and in order to make things better you have to start coming from a place of understanding and I think he's got that covered.\"\n\nGricius snapped a selfie with the candidate before he left the park.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Hoping to sway voters in the crowded Republican primary for President, Marco Rubio, the junior Senator from Florida made a stop in Salt Lake City.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "a9bc8fabb9f6cda780dcd354edb426e8"}, "og": {"site_name": "fox13now.com", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Hoping to sway voters in the crowded Republican primary for President, Marco Rubio, the junior Senator from Florida made a stop in Salt Lake City. \u201cI\u2019m conservati\u2026", "title": "Presidential candidate Marco Rubio speaks at first rally in Utah", "url": "http://fox13now.com/2015/10/19/presidential-candidate-marco-rubio-speaks-at-first-rally-in-utah/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/promo269580901.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/promo269580901.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox13now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox13now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News for Salt Lake City, Ogden, Provo and beyond", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324152525", "fb": {"pages": 75831650585}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox13now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/98a0a4875aa0281a51f538da86df31aa?s=16", "application-name": "fox13now.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/", "published_time": "2015-10-20T03:56:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T03:56:07+00:00", "author": "http://fox13now.com/facebook/"}, "keywords": "news, marco rubio, presidential candidate", "google-site-verification": "avVLxvtHokA_r9gaDC1cvuQNhoxzcJHtFAJItW79fPI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Gricius is one of many undecided voters Rubio is hoping to reach in Utah.\n\"I'm conservative, I'm undecided on who my candidate is,\u201d said Stephanie Gricius while waiting for Rubio to take the stage at the Utah Fairgrounds State Park.\nThe senator spoke of his mom working in a factory assembling metal chairs and his father working as a bartender.\n\"Our government is not just out of touch it\u2019s outdated and we need policies that make us globally competitive now, in this new century,\u201d Rubio said.\n\"He has a great plan for America and I'm looking forward to voting for him in March,\u201d said Kraig Thorne after the rally."}
