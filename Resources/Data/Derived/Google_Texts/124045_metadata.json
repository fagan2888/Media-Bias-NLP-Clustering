Even the researchers got into the act.\n\nBut essay author Dr. Paul Marantz, the director of the Center for Public Health Sciences at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, melts the connection: the finding is not a breakthrough, the research was going on long before the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge existed, and funding for this research came from seven funding sources.\n\nMarantz, who originally published this post back in August, is not a fan of marketing-driven research (he concludes his post with the red herring that we shouldn\u2019t \u201cpromulgate the notion that \u2018crowdsourcing\u2019 scientific discovery will get us where we need to go\u201d).\n\nBut he\u2019s right on this point: if healthcare social media tries too hard it tarnishes the credit it will eventually deserve (and, likely, the science itself). The money raised by the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge will take years to deliver anything of value. Such is the nature of scientific research.\n\nEven then, any findings driven largely by that money will take even more years to make it to the market.\n\nMarketers should keep the volume down on results, until the point they can name the nickname new breakthrough drug The Ice Bucket Legacy.\n\nThat\u2019s the win \u2013 and it will help other marketing-driven fund-raising campaign succeed for years to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Too much hype will make it hard to take the real credit later on.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Too much hype will make it hard to take the real credit later on.", "title": "Remember, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has done absolutely nothing (so far)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Toby-Cosgrove-ice-bucket-challenge.png", "updated_time": "2016-01-04T07:58:11-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/09/als-ice-bucket-challenge-has-done-absolutely-nothing/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Toby-Cosgrove-ice-bucket-challenge.png", "description": "Too much hype will make it hard to take the real credit later on.", "card": "summary", "title": "Remember, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has done absolutely nothing (so far) - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, Healthcare Social Media, Lou Gehrig's disease, OB, Paul Marantz, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Biotech", "tag": "Paul Marantz", "published_time": "2015-09-07T14:48:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-04T07:58:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29f1\"", "article_summary": "The money raised by the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge will take years to deliver anything of value.\nKevinMD today refreshed an essay worth refreshing: a reminder that everyone who is trying to link immediate, direct benefits to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is basically full of it.\nMarketers should keep the volume down on results, until the point they can name the nickname new breakthrough drug The Ice Bucket Legacy.\nMedia throughout August credited the work of the Ice Bucket Challenge to a Johns Hopkins research finding that could explain why a certain protein clumps together in the brain of ALS patients.\nSuch is the nature of scientific research."}
