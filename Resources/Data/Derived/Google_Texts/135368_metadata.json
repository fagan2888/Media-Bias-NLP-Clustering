Kennedy in 1962, surely her voice sent his skin tingling. The sound of a woman\u2019s voice as she sings has that power \u2014 it\u2019s sensuous, sultry, powerful, and soft. But a woman doesn\u2019t need to be singing to have that effect on men, according to a new study. All they have to do is speak to a guy at the right time of the month.\n\nThe hormonal changes that accompany a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle also alter the sound of her voice, just enough so that both men and women are unconsciously able to pick up on the differences, which signal when she\u2019s most fertile, thus sending an abundance of electrical activity through the men and women\u2019s skin and increasing their heart rate, too. In other words, a woman at the peak of her fertility can make a man\u2019s skin (and woman\u2019s) tingle just by talking to him or her.\n\nThe study shows that our own physiology has these longstanding, built-in mechanisms that assist in reproduction \u2014 even if our society isn\u2019t in that mode anymore. Not only were there more electrical currents running through men and women\u2019s skin, but they also found the fertile women\u2019s voices more attractive.\n\n\u201cA man\u2019s ability to identify and respond to a fertile woman confers him a potential reproductive advantage when choosing between potential mates,\u201d study author Dr. Melanie Shoup-Knox, of James Madison University in Virginia, told The Telegraph. \u201cWomen, on the other hand, may get a competitive advantage from detecting the fertility status of other females.\u201d\n\nShoup-Knox and her colleague Dr. R. Nathan Pipitone enlisted a group of men and women, as well as some gay men, to listen to recordings of women\u2019s voices from different times of their menstrual cycle \u2014 some of the women were taking hormonal contraception as well. They found that when a woman was at the peak of her fertility, the electrical activity in participants\u2019 skin increased by about 20 percent while their heart rates sped up by about five percent. These effects occurred as soon as five seconds of hearing the woman\u2019s voice, long before the person consciously knew what was happening.\n\nThe findings are the latest in a body of research seeking to understand the underlying physiological processes that lead to attraction and reproduction. Other studies have found that with being highly fertile comes a higher pitched voice and a more attractive smell. And one study from 2012 also found that men rated women\u2019s faces as more attractive when they were most fertile. Many of the researchers from these studies suggest that if someone is able to pick up on these cues, they\u2019ll have more reproductive success. But really, even if they could, it\u2019s only one piece of the mating puzzle.\n\nSource: Shoup-Knox M, Pipitone R.
