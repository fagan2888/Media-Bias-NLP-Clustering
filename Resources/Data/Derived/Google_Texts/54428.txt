CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) â€” New information is coming in the case of the man linked to two Virginia college students who disappeared and were later found dead.

The police chief and the prosecutor in Albemarle County have scheduled a late-morning news conference Tuesday to provide an update in the investigation of Jesse Matthew Jr. They said in their announcement that the will not answer questions before the briefing.

Matthew is charged with abduction with intent to defile in the case of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. The 18-year-old Graham disappeared in September and was found dead in Albemarle County a few weeks later.

Police have said forensic evidence also links Matthew to the 2009 disappearance and death of 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, whose body also was found in the county.
