The second and third place finishers didn\u2019t break 20 percent. Since then, Rep. Garcia and Curbelo have been trying to capitalize on controversies that could negatively impact their campaigns.\n\nCurbelo has attacked Rep. Garcia by focusing on the criminal investigations against the congressman\u2019s former chief of staff and ex-campaign manager, Jeff Garcia (no relation). Last year, Jeff Garcia pleaded guilty to ballot fraud and served 65 days in jail stemming from a local police investigation that uncovered he had broken a law prohibiting individuals from requesting absentee ballot forms on behalf of voters.\n\nThe Miami Herald recently reported that the FBI is investigating allegations Jeff Garcia recruited a straw candidate in 2010 to run against David Rivera, the Republican who held the seat until losing to Joe Garcia two years later. Ironically, the FBI has been investigating Rivera\u2019s role in a similar scheme involving a straw candidate that ran against Rep. Garcia in 2012. (Rivera finished a distant fourth in the August primary).\n\nRep. Garcia maintains he had no knowledge of Jeff Garcia\u2019s actions. After his chief of staff resigned, the congressman has distanced himself from Jeff Garcia.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I found out about what was going on, I took swift action to address the problem,\u201d Rep. Garcia tells Fox News Latino.\n\nNevertheless, Curbelo has used Jeff Garcia\u2019s troubles to assail his Democratic opponent. \u201cUnlike Rep. Garcia, who is surrounded by a federal investigation on the illegal financing and recruiting of a straw candidate, Carlos can focus on the issues facing the community of South Florida,\u201d says Curbelo campaign communications director Wadi Gaitan.\n\nHowever, Rep. Garcia and Democratic Party operatives have countered that his Republican adversary is not so squeaky clean. In 2009, Curbelo - who earns a living as a political consultant and lobbyist - transferred ownership of his company Capitol Gains to his wife. At the time, Curbelo was working with then-U.S. Sen George LeMieux and he changed the company\u2019s ownership on the advice of senate lawyers.\n\nSince his wife is the listed owner of Capitol Gains, Curbelo is not required to disclose whom his clients are on his public financial statement of interests, filed with the Florida division of elections and the federal election commission. Rep. Garcia claims Curbelo is hiding his client list so voters won\u2019t know if the private sector firms he represents have benefitted from his votes on the school board.\n\n\u201cWe already know he approved millions of tax dollars in school board contracts for his political donors,\u201d Rep. Garcia says. \u201cAnd the one lobbying client that Curbelo has disclosed was a Malaysian Casino company who was trying to buy land from the School Board.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party recently filed a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department asking for a civil investigation into Curbelo. It accuses him of having \u201cknowingly and willfully falsified and failed to report information required under the Ethics in Government Act.\u201d\n\nRep. Garcia\u2019s campaign, which has raised more than $2 million in political donations, is also running television ads about Curbelo\u2019s secret client list.\n\nCurbelo campaign\u2019s Gaitan says the congressman is making a desperate attempt to deflect attention from \u201cthe chronic corruption that Garcia has perpetuated on our community.\u201d Curbelo has always followed the law and played by the rules, Gaitan adds.\n\n\u201cHe is the one running for Congress because he believes South Florida deserves representation that is honest, ethical, and focused on the constituents\u2019 priorities,\u201d Gaitan says.\n\nThe sniping between both candidates is turning off voters, who are fed up with the scandals, says Ed MacDougall, the mayor of southwest Miami-Dade town Palmetto Bay. He finished third in the August Republican primary.\n\n\u201cBoth Garcia and Curbelo have a lot of bad baggage,\u201d MacDougall says. \u201cNo matter who wins, the people living in the 26th district will get another two years of ongoing investigations.\u201d\n\nFrancisco Alvarado is a freelance journalist in South Florida.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2014-09-22 09:09:14 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "The ongoing back-and-forth volleys between Democratic Congressman Joe Garcia and his Republican opponent, Carlos Curbelo, over which one is more corrupt strongly suggests they will be in a nasty dogfight until Election Day.", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/news/0/0/joe%20garcia%20new.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Cuban-Americans Joe Garcia and Carlos Curbelo in bitter race for Florida Congressional seat\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/09/22/cuban-americans-joe-garcia-and-carlos-curbelo-in-bitter-race-for-florida/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/news/0/0/joe%20garcia%20new.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"ba8bfaa23fd88410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-22T13:09:14Z\",\"author\":\"Francisco Alvarado\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "Jeb Bush,FBI,Fox News,Justice Department,federal election commission,Mitt Romney,Jeff Garcia,George LeMieux,election commission", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "The ongoing back-and-forth volleys between Democratic Congressman Joe Garcia and his Republican opponent, Carlos Curbelo, over which one is more corrupt strongly suggests they will be in a nasty dogfight until Election Day.", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:ba8bfaa23fd88410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "Jeb Bush,FBI,Fox News,Justice Department,federal election commission,Mitt Romney,Jeff Garcia,George LeMieux,election commission", "description": "Las pantallas flexibles est\u00e1n de moda.
