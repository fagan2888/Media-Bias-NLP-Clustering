SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Funeral services for Mormon leader Boyd K. Packer, president of the faith’s highest governing body, will be held next week.

Church officials say services are scheduled for Friday at the Tabernacle on Temple Square in Salt Lake City.

The 11 a.m. service will be open to the public ages 8 and older. A private burial will follow at the Brigham City Cemetery.

Packer died July 3 at his Salt Lake City home of natural causes. He was 90.

Packer was next in line to become president of the Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He had been a member of the church’s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles since 1970.

He was known as a staunch advocate for a conservative form of Mormonism.
