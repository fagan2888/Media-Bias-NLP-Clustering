And to ensure there's no gap in coverage, Blue Cross Blue Shield Oklahoma automatically will transition impacted members to a comparable plan, she said. Members will have the option of choosing a different plan, or choosing another carrier, during the open enrollment period, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, United CEO Stephen J. Hemsley said in a news release Thursday, \u201cGrowth expectations for individual exchange participation have tempered industrywide, cooperatives have failed, and market data has signaled higher risks and more difficulties while our own claims experience has deteriorated.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about enrollment in United plans thus far on the Oklahoma exchange, spokesman Tyler Mason said, \u201cIt's early days and historically we do not break out our state enrollment data for exchange offerings.\u201d\n\nUnited currently has some 550,000 members in 23 states, Mason said. By 2016, the insurer will be in 34 states, he said.\n\nInsurers have had trouble signing up young and healthy individuals on the Obamacare exchanges, which is necessary to offset the costs of covering older and sicker enrollees. This has forced premium hikes, deductible increases, and fewer doctors and hospitals on its plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UnitedHealth Group, one of two insurers in Oklahoma\u2019s healthcare.gov marketplace for 2016, said Thursday it may exit the program's exchanges in 2017.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
