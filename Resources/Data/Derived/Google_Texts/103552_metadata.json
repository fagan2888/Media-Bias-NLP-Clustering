Three house fires near the tornado may have been caused by downed power lines, Balanciere said.\n\nBy midnight, about two dozen displaced Garland residents had landed at the shelter set up at the city\u2019s Gale Fields Recreation Center. Blankets, food and water were there for them and cots were en route.\n\nIt was much the same at Steadham Elementary in Rowlett, where the Red Cross and Salvation Army were helping displaced residents.\n\n\u201cThe outpouring is unbelievable,\u201d Mayor Todd Gottel said as the city\u2019s emergency responders worked an evolving plan at Fire Station No. 1. \u201cWe have CERT (Community Emergency Response Teams) from all over the area \u2013 Garland, Sachse, Wylie, Rockwall and Hunt County \u2013 offering service.\u201d\n\nAbout 300 of those volunteers will go door-to-door at daybreak to assess damage and needs.\n\n\u201cTonight, it\u2019s taking care of any injuries, making sure there\u2019s not any fatalities,\u201d Gottel said. \u201cMore of a search-and-rescue.\n\nAbout half of Rowlett homes lost power, Gottel said, but much of the service in neighborhoods not directly hit was restored by midnight. A gas leak had forced a neighborhood evacuation on the eastern edge of town.\n\nStephan Casteneda, an assistant manager, was keeping doors open all night at Rowlett\u2019s Home Depot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a steady trickle,\u201d he said. \u201cA few generators, some tarps and buckets. And shop vacs for the water damage.\u201d\n\nBut once residents leave their storm-damaged neighborhoods, they\u2019re having trouble getting back in.\n\nInterstate 30 remained closed near Lake Ray Hubbard and traffic that detoured to cross the lake in Rowlett was at a standstill on State Highway 66.\n\nA man walked up to Garland firefighters at the command center at I-30 and Belt Line Road, desperate to check on his disabled parents within the blocked perimeter. Firefighters checked the address, told him they knew the street to have only minor damage and that they would check personally on the parents. But they also assured him that retrieving his wallet was not sufficient cause to be getting in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making sure people are alive,\u201d he was told before being offered directions to the Fields Center.\n\nSix hours into the crisis, local officials were getting a hold on the situation. Fire crews from farthest outlying areas like Cedar Hill, Hutchins and DeKalb were heading home.\n\nEmergency partnerships where Dallas and Richardson help man stations in parts of Garland near those cities will continue \u2013 allowing Garland to give full attention to its farthest southeast section.\n\nRowlett City Manager Brian Funderburk will give an update on damages and share information on curfews and volunteer mobilization at a 7 a.m. press conference at City Hall.\n\nComplete coverage of the storm\u2019s devastation\n\n\u2018Total devastation\u2019: Residents, emergency crews work frantically after tornadoes\n\nTornado in Rowlett classified as EF3; 11 confirmed dead in storms in Garland, Collin County\n\nOfficials identify six of eight tornado victims who died in Garland\n\nStorm damages over 100 buildings in Glenn Heights\n\nFloyd: Weather\u2019s tragic capriciousness is still beyond our control\n\nNBC5: Staff shortage left NWS scrambling to cover tornado outbreak\n\nColliding weather systems caused tornado outbreak\n\nGov.
