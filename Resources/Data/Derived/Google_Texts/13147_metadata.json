Now, after Obama finally sided with the greens and rejected the pipeline, TransCanada has reacted in a way that threatens his most cherished remaining policy achievement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\n\nThis week, TransCanada filed suit against the United States over what it claims was a wrongful permit denial for Keystone XL. In a separate filing seeking $15 billion in damages, TransCanada alleged that denying the pipeline approval violates the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). TransCanada argues that it has been \u201cunjustly deprived of the value of its multibillion-dollar investment by the U.S. administration's action.\u201d\n\nRelated: TransCanada Legal Challenges Over Keystone Face Long Odds\n\nIn the trade challenge, TransCanada is using the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provision embedded in NAFTA Chapter 11 and thousands of trade deals over the past few decades. ISDS allows companies to sue governments over trade agreement violations for monetary damages equivalent to expected future profits. Non-governmental tribunals composed of three corporate lawyers adjudicate the claims. Nations can reverse their policies to the benefit of the corporation rather than pay out the monetary damages.\n\nTrade specialists believe TransCanada has a chance in an ISDS tribunal. \u201cIn a case like these facts and those claims,\u201d said Lori Wallach of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch to Bloomberg, \u201cI have seen repeatedly, enormous amounts of money extracted from governments\u2019 treasuries and taxpayers and doled out to corporations.\u201d\n\nThe problem for the Obama administration is that ISDS provisions also appear in the TPP, negotiated among 12 nations last year and awaiting a vote in Congress. ISDS has already proven controversial, with anti-TPP lawmakers warning that the process could undermine national sovereignty. The White House has rejected this, saying that the U.S. has never lost an ISDS claim. But past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nTPP opponents have already jumped on TransCanada\u2019s action. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement that ISDS provisions \u201cthat wrongly empower corporations to attack our safeguards show exactly why NAFTA was wrong and why the dangerous and far-reaching Trans-Pacific Partnership is worse and must be stopped in its tracks.\u201d\n\nThe high-profile nature of Keystone XL assures that this claim will hang over the TPP debate, particularly among Democrats, who widely supported the president\u2019s rejection of the pipeline. There\u2019s also a built-in network of millions of anti-Keystone activists who may now be empowered to go after TPP, increasing the firepower of the deal\u2019s opponents.\n\nRelated: How the TPP Trade Deal Could Blow Up the Primaries\n\nDisputes of this type typically go on for several years, meaning it will likely be active at the time of the TPP vote, whenever that may occur. The White House cannot say there\u2019s nothing to fear from ISDS when TransCanada has an open claim. And House Democrats, who likely hold the margin of victory for TPP, will have to face the potential damage to democracy accompanying their vote.\n\nWe already have a model for how trade deals can lead to alterations in U.S. law. In the end-of-year omnibus spending deal, Republicans added a provision repealing country-of-origin labeling (COOL) laws for meat and poultry. The reason was that the World Trade Organization ruled for Canada and Mexico that the COOL law violated prior trade agreements, awarding them $1 billion in trade sanctions. Instead of paying the fine, Congress took the other option and repealed the law, and President Obama signed it.\n\nSimilarly, the World Trade Organization ruled in November that \u201cdolphin-safe\u201d tuna labels required by the U.S. violated the rights of Mexican fishers. Mexico filed that challenge on behalf of its fishing industry, and a subsequent award of trade sanctions could again cause the U.S. to repeal its consumer information law.\n\nFood labels aside, while TransCanada\u2019s claim involves a corporation suing a country directly rather than a country making a claim on an industry\u2019s behalf, the inherent danger associated with these third-party tribunals is the same. Once a country assents to ISDS, it opens up its laws to scrutiny for trade violations, effectively creating an extra branch of government with judicial review, outside of the sovereign structure. \u201cWith a single press release, TransCanada has proven what concerned citizens have argued for decades \u2014 that the primary purpose of ISDS is to subvert democratic processes and the public interest, in the name of private profit,\u201d said Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law.\n\nRelated: Cheap Oil and Pricey Unicorns \u2014 20 Biggest Business Stories of 2015\n\n\n\nISDS claims can attack state and local governments, too. Billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens has an active ISDS claim against Ontario, Canada over that province\u2019s wind power auctions. He\u2019s seeking $700 million. As ISDS grows with additional trade agreements, the smallest town\u2019s decisions all the way up to the business of Congress could get scrutinized.\n\nPrior to the TransCanada announcement, it was actually a pretty good week for the TPP. All the business trade groups endorsed the pact, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the National Association of Manufacturers to the Business Roundtable. They joined the high-tech lobby, which endorsed it last month. A World Bank study of the agreement released this week found that all participants in the deal, particularly Vietnam, Japan and Malaysia, would benefit economically. The study is incredibly flawed \u2014 it doesn\u2019t count the net economic harm from increased imports, looking only at exports \u2014 and the alleged U.S. benefit under that one-sided review is tiny, just 0.4 percent of GDP by 2030, the lowest of any party to the agreement. But any proof of economic aid from TPP, no matter how distorted, is helpful to the White House\u2019s argument.\n\nDespite this, Republicans are skeptical of TPP and have told the president not to send the agreement for approval to Congress until after the 2016 elections. That\u2019s largely seen as a negotiating tactic \u2014 Mitch McConnell in particular wants better terms for the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries \u2014 but the implication is that vulnerable politicians either don\u2019t want to have to take a controversial vote before their re-election or that the deal currently doesn\u2019t have the required support.\n\nTransCanada\u2019s maneuver only raises the pressure, providing a model for the worst-case scenario of approving TPP. Politicians have even more reasons to duck the debate, or to line up against the deal, as everyone from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump has done.
