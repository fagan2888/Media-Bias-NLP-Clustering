The Labor Department says it can\u2019t get reliable data on changes in quality, so it uses the indirect method of looking at changes in the prices of medical-care items covered by health-insurance policies as well as the cost of administering policies.\n\nBut the CPI data seems to be reflective of reality.\n\nA number of state regulators had approved big premium increases. In Tennessee, for instance, BlueCross BlueShield hiked average premiums by 36%, and Humana increased rates by 5.8%.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the weighted percentage change in the cost of silver plans offered under the Affordable Care Act this year is 3.6%.\n\nMost people don\u2019t actually get their coverage using the ACA, or Obamacare as it\u2019s commonly known, but the trends appear to be similar for employer-based plans.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office says premiums on employment-based coverage will grow by about 5% each year over the next decade, or roughly 2 percentage points faster than income.\n\nUnitedHealth Group UNH, -0.33% and other insurers have complained that people are gaming Obamacare by using special enrollment periods to get coverage when they need medical care.\n\nThe CBO report also points out the lack of competition, not just from insurers but also in the hospitals and physicians they reimburse.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"parsely-author": "Steve Goldstein", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Health insurance costs are on the rise, according to the latest inflation data released Friday, evidence insurers were able to pass along big premium hikes.", "creator": "@MKTWgoldstein", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT400_afford_ZG_20140904110821.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/health-insurance-costs-rise-by-nearly-5-latest-cpi-data-shows-2016-02-19", "author": "Steve Goldstein", "parsely-title": "Health-insurance costs rise by nearly 5%, latest CPI data shows", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-02-19T11:35:00-05:00", "description": "Health insurance costs are on the rise, according to the latest inflation data released Friday, evidence insurers were able to pass along big premium hikes.", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Health insurance costs are on the rise, according to the latest inflation data released Friday, evidence insurers were able to pass along big premium hikes.", "title": "Health-insurance costs rise by nearly 5%, latest CPI data shows", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/health-insurance-costs-rise-by-nearly-5-latest-cpi-data-shows-2016-02-19", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT400_afford_ZG_20140904110821.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT400_afford_ZG_20140904110821.jpg"}, "article.id": "9741979E-D70F-11E5-B356-4EB3252335B0", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Health-insurance costs climbed sharply, according to the latest inflation data released Friday, evidence insurers were able to pass along big premium hikes.\nBut the CPI data seems to be reflective of reality.\nMost people don\u2019t actually get their coverage using the ACA, or Obamacare as it\u2019s commonly known, but the trends appear to be similar for employer-based plans.\nAccording to the Labor Department, health-insurance costs rose 4.8% in the 12 months ending in January, the fastest rise since April 2013 and much faster than the broader rate of inflation.\nThe CBO report also points out the lack of competition, not just from insurers but also in the hospitals and physicians they reimburse."}
