Via the panel\u2019s Twitter feed, @IPCC_ch, a spokesperson said this morning that the YouTube channel will stream the press conference afterward.\n\nThat is not too dissimilar to the white smoke rising from a Vatican chimney.\n\nPhoto\n\nI don\u2019t see the communication issues as the fault of the panel\u2019s underfunded communications office. It\u2019s the fault of the governments that created the panel back in 1988 and provide the money to make it work. It\u2019s almost as if they don\u2019t want a full and open process.\n\nImagine that.\n\nThere have been some interesting machinations, with a late nomination from Sierra Leone adding uncertainty. (Click here to see how back-room pressures shaped the last change in panel leadership.)\n\nIn his statement opening the meeting on Monday, thankfully posted on the panel\u2019s Facebook page, the I.P.C.C. acting chairman, Ismail El Gizouli of Sudan, expressed gratitude for some new financial support:\n\n[I]n the last few years, the IPCC has conducted an unprecedented program of outreach, helped by the generous support of some of our members. It is not enough to produce excellent assessments; we must also communicate them in an accessible and effective manner, to policymakers, key stakeholders and the general public at large.\n\nAfter a round of missteps and reviews, a new communication strategy was adopted in 2012, including this bullet point:\n\nTimely and audience-appropriate. In order to be effective, the IPCC communications approach and activities should be aimed at ensuring that timely and appropriate information enters the public domain \u2013 both proactively to communicate reports, and reactively in response to questions or criticism.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that this remains an aspiration more than an achievable plan.\n\nSeveral of the candidates for the chairmanship acknowledged the need for a new approach to communication in interviews in recent months. Explore this post and video collection from Carbon Brief: \u201cIPCC chair election: how the views of the candidates compare.\u201d\n\nI hope that a campaign to reboot and adequately support the panel\u2019s communication efforts is high on the to-do list of the incoming leadership. As an outside observer of the I.P.C.C. since its inception, I offered some ideas in \u201cThe New Communications Climate,\u201d an article I wrote for the World Meteorological Organization Bulletin in 2011.\n\nThis passage is even more relevant now than when I wrote it:\n\nOne reason to pursue such steps is that the capacity of traditional journalism outlets to be the intermediary is declining. Overall resources are strained and the number of experienced professional science and environment reporters is shrinking. This doesn\u2019t mean science journalism is dying. It is evolving. But it is doing so in ways that won\u2019t benefit an agency, say, that sticks with the 20th century model of distributing a press release and waiting for journalists to call back to fill in the gaps. In some ways, in fact, science communication is expanding rapidly. The number of science blogs has grown tremendously, for example. But the number of such outlets that can be relied upon to provide accurate, or un-spun, information is tougher to track. As Nadia El-Wady, the president of the World Federation of Science Journalists, put it last year, there are \u201conly a few pockets of excellence in an ocean of mediocrity.\u201d Diving into this arena requires time, some level of culture change and even courage, particularly given how the Web can be an amplifier for unfounded attacks and disinformation as much as knowledge. But hunkering down, as some institutions \u2013 including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2013 tried to do after recent controversies, is probably not a sustainable approach in the long haul. As the IPCC prepares its Fifth Assessment Report, it does so with what, to my eye, appears to be an utterly inadequate budget for communicating its findings and responding in an agile way to nonstop public scrutiny facilitated by the Internet. I would love to think that the countries that created the climate panel could also contribute to boosting the panel\u2019s capacity for transparency, responsiveness and outreach\u2026. \u2026The alternative is to hunker down, as if waiting for a storm to pass. But the explosive changes afoot in how people share information and shape ideas are no stray storm. Interpreting them that way would be like mixing up weather and climate.\n\n______\n\n* The candidates are all men.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151006102746, "BN": "dotearth", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/dotearth", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/dotearth/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 6, 2015", "org": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change;United Nations;World Meteorological Organization", "keywords": "Global Warming,Social Media,United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,United Nations,World Meteorological Organization,Dubrovnik (Croatia),Climate Change,communication,diplomacy,social media", "GBLC": "Climate Change;communication;diplomacy;social media", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/dotearth/A Top Task for the New Chair of the U.N.
