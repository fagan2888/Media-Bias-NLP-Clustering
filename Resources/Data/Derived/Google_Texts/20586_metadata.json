The growth of jobs in this sector is a long-term trend, driven in no small part by our aging demographics. Even when we were hemorrhaging jobs in the depths of the last recession, health care was an outlier, never experiencing even one negative month of job growth during the downturn.\n\nA few months ago, one of us (Bernstein) noted that the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act in reducing the number of uninsured was an inconvenient truth for Obamacare\u2019s opponents. Well, here\u2019s another such truth: Anyone who wants to call the ACA a \u201cjob killer\u201d is either ignorant of or not interested in the facts.\n\nThe figure above shows that since the subsidized premium exchanges and Medicaid expansions in 24 states (plus D.C.) came online last year (five other states later followed suit), monthly job growth in the health-care sector has risen sharply. (The monthly changes are jumpy, so we plotted the trend through the data.)\n\nStrong health-care employment growth shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone. Demand for labor is derived from the demand for the goods and services that people want and need. Thus, we\u2019d expect the expansion of health coverage to boost jobs in that sector \u2014 in addition to driving historically large reductions in the number of Americans without health coverage, saving states money and slowing growth in health-care costs.\n\nYet House Republicans are still trying to repeal parts of the law, claiming that \u201cmany of the key elements of Obamacare [are] harming individuals and families [and] hurting job creation.\u201d Fox News commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly maintains that, \u201cWhile some of the poor benefit, other Americans are punished because the job market is smaller.\u201d Some presidential candidates agree: Jeb Bush calls the ACA \u201cthe president\u2019s job-destroying health-care law\u201d and Ted Cruz\u2019s Senate Web site asserts that \u201cObamacare is causing millions to lose their jobs.\u201d Cruz and Marco Rubio aren\u2019t even content to repeal parts of the law \u2014 they want to repeal the entire thing.\n\nEven if we\u2019re generous here and assume that those shouting \u201cjob killer\u201d mean that the gains in the health-care sector are coming at the expense of the rest of the job market, there\u2019s no evidence to support that claim, either.\n\nA good state-level measure of Obamacare\u2019s penetration \u2014 capturing the effect of both the Medicaid expansion and the exchanges \u2014 is the increase in the rates of those with health coverage in the state. In the graph below, we plot employment growth by state (in 2014) against this change. The job-killers would predict a negative correlation \u2014 if they\u2019re correct, states with the biggest gains in insured rates should have seen slower job growth. Instead, the opposite is true. The positive slope in the \u201cbest-fit\u201d line through the dots in the scatterplot means that states with bigger health-coverage gains had stronger job growth. (The correlation is still positive, though barely so, if we remove gains in employer-sponsored insurance from the health-care side of the equation.)\n\nSources: BLS, Census Bureau (American Community Survey)\n\nFor example, the red dot near the upper right-hand part of the figure represents California. The insured rate there grew by 4.8 percentage points between 2013 and 2014 while employment growth during the same period was just over 3 percent (the national average for job growth in 2014 was 1.9 percent). The other red dot in the bottom left-hand section of the graph represents Maine, where the insured rate grew by just over 1 percentage point and employment grew by less than half a percent.\n\nTo be clear, we do not put much weight on that positive slope \u2014 we\u2019re not saying the ACA is a job creator economy-wide (though the first figure suggests that it may be creating jobs in the health sector). Job creation in a large, global economy such as ours involves many moving parts, and, as we\u2019ve argued before, the ACA is unlikely to have a significant effect on employment. But the data are telling us something important here: There\u2019s no case that the ACA is a job killer.\n\nNor is there any evidence that Obamacare is causing a shift from full-time to part-time jobs \u2014 the number of involuntary part-time workers is actually down since 2013 (and as Dean Baker notes, the evidence that the ACA\u2019s premium subsidies may be encouraging voluntary part-time work is a good thing), while full-time employment has been steadily rising. Again, steady job growth is surely a function of the broad employment recovery, not health reform, but it is yet another trend going the wrong way for the critics.\n\nThe ACA isn\u2019t perfect, but it is, as intended, covering more of the uninsured and slowing cost growth. And it is doing so without hurting the job market.\n\nThat\u2019s a tough reality for those who have argued otherwise for years now, but reality it is. We can\u2019t stop the ACA\u2019s opponents \u2014 including those running for president \u2014 from denying it, but we (and, more importantly, the press that covers them) must confront them with the facts every time they get those facts wrong.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We don't like to call people liars.
