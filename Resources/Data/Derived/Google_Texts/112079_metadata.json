The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) supported regulations providing that a wellness program conditioning a financial incentive on the participant meeting a standard related to a health factor is acceptable so long as it met certain criteria. However, the EEOC has filed several lawsuits accusing employers of violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and/or the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) by failing to provide incentives to employees who would not complete a wellness program assessment or screening.\n\n\u201cThis legislation ensures what Congress has already decided\u2014private companies are free to promote health and wellness among their employees through voluntary incentives like premium discounts,\u201d says Isakson.\n\nThe Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act (S. 620) would reaffirm existing law that allows for employee wellness programs tied to a financial reward. It also clarifies that an employee\u2019s spouse may participate in the employee\u2019s workplace wellness program. The legislation would also provide employees up to 180 days to request and complete an alternative wellness program if it is medically inadvisable or unreasonably difficult for an employee to participate in the original employee wellness program.\n\nThe legislation does not limit the EEOC\u2019s authority to investigate and litigate complaints of employment discrimination.\n\nAt a hearing in January, witnesses told members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee more guidance is needed for workplace wellness programs, noting that the EEOC rescinded previous guidance and has yet to clarify its stance. \u201cThis bill will force the EEOC to simply clarify its rules instead of pursuing litigation against employers because it has refused to give guidance,\u201d U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), a co-sponsor of the Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act, said in a statement on his website.\n\nText of S. 620 has not yet been sent to the U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO).", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "HR New Legislation, Healthcare", "Description": "In response to lawsuits filed by the EEOC regarding employer wellness programs, lawmakers have introduced legislation to clarify rules.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe158b\"", "article_summary": "The Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act (S. 620) would reaffirm existing law that allows for employee wellness programs tied to a financial reward.\nSenator Tim Scott (R-South Carolina), a co-sponsor of the Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act, said in a statement on his website.\nIt also clarifies that an employee\u2019s spouse may participate in the employee\u2019s workplace wellness program.\nThe legislation would also provide employees up to 180 days to request and complete an alternative wellness program if it is medically inadvisable or unreasonably difficult for an employee to participate in the original employee wellness program.\n\u201cThis bill will force the EEOC to simply clarify its rules instead of pursuing litigation against employers because it has refused to give guidance,\u201d U.S."}
