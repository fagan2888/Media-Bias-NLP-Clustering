She was convicted in 2010 for the same violations,\n\nOn June 27, a man whom police have not identified showed up at Natividad Medical Center with a broken molar and lacerated gums. He later told police Diaz tried to extract his tooth for more than 90 minutes and broke it, and that the procedure was done in the living room of Diaz\u2019s home on the 700 block of Leese Drive in Salinas.\n\nThe 32-year-old said he was in the country illegally and delayed treatment for three days for fear of being prosecuted or deported. He also told police Diaz was selling prescription medication to her patients in the form of antibiotics from Mexico.\n\nOn Tuesday, officers arrived at Diaz\u2019s home and upon entering they said they found a makeshift surgical room with a dental chair, table and numerous dental tools.\n\nThe dental tools were taken into evidence, and Diaz was booked into Monterey County Jail.\n\nHealth care for undocumented immigrants is an ongoing debate among policymakers in Sacramento. While the Affordable Care Act expanded health coverage to many Americans \u2014 including providing free or very low-cost Medi-Cal coverage to more low-income Californians \u2014 undocumented immigrants are not covered by the law.\n\nThat left an estimated 1 million state residents without coverage. In June, the state Senate passed a bill to allow undocumented immigrants to buy coverage on the state\u2019s health exchange \u2014 provided the federal government agrees \u2014 and extend Medi-Cal to residents under 19 years old regardless of immigration status.\n\nIf funds allow, the bill would also extend Medi-Cal to some low-income undocumented adults. The bill awaits a hearing in the Assembly.\n\nPolice suspect Diaz has performed illegal dental procedures on other people, and are urging the public to report additional information at 758-7250.\n\nJason Hoppin contributed to this report.
