Their mission: learning how best to protect their church from an armed threat.\n\nThe three men take aim outside of Oakwood Baptist Church, where the Rev. Brian Evans and a handful of his church members trained in active shooter scenarios and situational awareness.\n\n\u201cThe Scripture says \u2018The prudent man seeth evil afar off\u2019\u2014 in other words you see it coming and you try to prepare yourself,\u201d Evans said.\n\nThe decision to create a church response team came after the passage of the \u201cSafe Carry Protection Act,\u201d which expanded the areas of firearms carry in Georgia including churches, bars and schools. Evans chose to allow firearms in his church, and a few months ago decided to have some members trained how to respond to a threat.\n\n\u201cI picked men that I knew were either already licensed to carry and going to be carrying anyway, and then a few guys who were not licensed to carry yet but were in the process, and I felt like they were level-headed enough to not react badly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 15 members in the reaction force training gathered Tuesday for the final night of certification, where each took a written test as well as a shooting target.\n\n\u201cWe try to train them to where they look to see the trouble before it materializes,\u201d said instructor Rodney Smith of Georgia Firearms and Security Training Academy.\n\nFrom 15 yards out, Smith shouted over the protective earmuffs to fire into center mass.\n\n\u201cGet back in the fight,\u201d Smith said, as the men dropped empty magazines and pulled a new set from their pockets.\n\nAt the 3-yard line, the men practice shooting from the draw.\n\nEven at 75, Linwood \u201cChief\u201d Jeffries said there\u2019s still much to be learned about firearms. A retired Navy man with 22 years of service, the nine-year member of Oakwood Baptist Church wheeled up to the firing range on a power scooter, saying he\u2019d recommend the training to anyone who wanted to shoot proficiently.\n\n\u201cThere are four things I defend in my life: my home, my church, my state and my country,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cI defended my country for 22 years. State, I pay my taxes and I\u2019ll defend it. My home, that\u2019s mine. My church, that\u2019s my family also.\u201d\n\nIn defending his church, Evans said the decision for training came around May, a month before the shooting in Charleston, S.C.\n\n\u201cCharleston ... if I had any doubt, it would have sealed it,\u201d he said of the shooting where nine people were killed by a gunman.\n\nWanting \u201ctrained guns over untrained guns\u201d on his side in case of emergency, Evans said he plans to divide the certified men from last week\u2019s meeting into teams.\n\nThough not as mobile as in his younger years, Jeffries said he hopes to still be used outside of the more physical tasks like clearing a room.\n\n\u201cBecause of my back and knees, I can\u2019t do that. But I can still stand outside and protect outside or the inside,\u201d he said.\n\nWith 6\u00ab years in the Army and an upbringing around hunting, Tim Autry said he can\u2019t \u201cremember a time not having a gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things I got was training to shoot and move at the same time,\u201d Autry said. \u201cAs a hunter, you\u2019re always shooting standing still. In the military, they taught us to shoot in different positions but always still.\u201d\n\nLike many others receiving training, Autry said the four weeks and 22 hours of training working with Smith\u2019s team gave him more confidence in a dangerous situation protecting his family and church.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate but I think our society has reached that point where in order for me and my family to feel safe, I have to be armed,\u201d Autry said.\n\nAlmost anytime but on Sunday, Evans keeps his sidearm holstered on the hip. Carrying during the service still makes Evans uncomfortable, he said, when he can have a dozen or so trained team members.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little distracting to me have to think about it being there,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI want to focus on what I\u2019m doing and not have to think about if someone\u2019s seeing this or what they would think.\u201d\n\nFollowing certification, Smith brought the team back for one last Powerpoint presentation and last tips. Of major importance was keeping control of entry points and looking for anyone and anything that looks suspicious, even when the prayer begins.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s going to love you for looking around,\u201d Smith said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/111334/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/08/08/0809CHURCH_0010.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A pastor, a 75-year-old Navy chief and a hunter line up at the firing range.
