Hospitals in Show-Me State Play the Shame Card

In an attempt to illustrate the impact of losing federal Medicaid funding, the Missouri Hospital Association is using data linking the effects of poverty, poor health, and life expectancy in the state and making comparisons to rates in Third World countries.

When elected officials in Missouri decided last year against expanding their Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, the Missouri Hospital Association commissioned a report detailing the economic impact of losing the estimated $1 billion each year in federal funding.

Unfortunately, using common sense to explain an obvious point didn't work.

Now the MHA is trying a new tactic: Shame.

Of course, MHA won't call it a shame campaign. They're much too smart to openly embarrass the state and federal lawmakers they're trying to win over. However, shame is clearly the theme that rings through in MHA's report linking the effects of poverty, poor health and life expectancy in Missouri and comparing them with those of Third World countries such as El Salvador, Vietnam, and Angola.
