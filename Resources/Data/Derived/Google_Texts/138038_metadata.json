He wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\nAfter a pair of entertaining, exhausting, drama-filled overtime games at Golden State, everyone - players, fans, even the refs - needed a day to take a breather and recover before the Cavaliers and Warriors resume a series getting stellar TV ratings and shifting to Quicken Loans Arena for Game 3 on Tuesday night.\n\nAs midnight approached in California following Cleveland\u2019s stunning 95-93 OT win on Sunday night, James, who scored 39 points with 16 rebounds and 11 assists, grimaced as he lifted himself from a chair on the postgame interview dais. He was hurting after playing 50 methodical minutes, one game after going 46.\n\nJames, incredibly, believes he can give more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maximum of five games left in the NBA season,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m ready for whatever.\u201d\n\nHe has been all season.\n\nWith James leading the way, the Cavaliers, who were already a heavy underdog before losing All-Star guard Kyrie Irving to a broken left kneecap in the opener, dragged down the Warriors and Stephen Curry, the league\u2019s MVP.\n\nHounded by Cavs guard Matthew Dellavedova, who seemed to be inside his jersey, Curry missed 18 of 23 shots and ended his night with an uncharacteristic 3-point air-ball with four seconds left in overtime.\n\nBut while Dellavedova\u2019s contributions starting in place of Irving were huge, James was again the difference and the reason why the Cavs can\u2019t be dismissed.\n\nThe best all-around player of his generation, James has pushed a team missing two All-Stars - Irving and Kevin Love - and a franchise that has its first finals win, within three victories of an improbable title that would end Cleveland\u2019s 51-year major sports championship drought.\n\nJames hasn\u2019t been flawless, far from it. He\u2019s twice missed potential game-winning shots in the final seconds, and has made only 40 percent of his field-goal attempts.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s dictating the pace of the game, controlling the clock and slowing the run-and-gun Warriors, who are accustomed to doing things their way. He\u2019s also motivated his teammates - James dubbed them \u201cThe Grit Squad\u201d - by telling them that they not only belong in this series, but they can win it.\n\nThe Cavs may be underdogs, but James is reminding them that this is their moment. And as he chases his third title, one that would crown his brilliant career and help him make good on a promise to his home area, James has the Cavs savoring every step.\n\n\u201cWe have a chance to be a part of history,\u201d he said.\n\nCavs coach David Blatt has watched James with awe.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find a guy anywhere, anytime, I can think of a name or two, but that\u2019s the whole history of basketball, that can give you the kind of all-around performance and all-around leadership that LeBron does for his group,\u201d he said. \u201cHe really willed his guys to win that game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a champion does.\u201d\n\nJames is averaging 41.5 points, 12 rebounds and 8.5 assists in his fifth straight finals. He\u2019s drawn inspiration from doing it without Love and Irving, proving his doubters wrong and the 30-year-old suggested that there is \u201cother motivation\u201d driving him.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a chance to outperform Curry, tagged by some as his heir apparent as the league\u2019s biggest star.\n\nCurry was off the mark from the start in Game 2, and afterward he didn\u2019t have an explanation for going 2 of 15 on 3-pointers. Warriors coach Steve Kerr isn\u2019t worried about his superstar.\n\n\u201cIt happens to everybody, whether you\u2019re the MVP or a role player,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSometimes the shots don\u2019t go in. Sometimes things don\u2019t go your way. Steph will bounce back. He\u2019s a great player. We\u2019ll help him. We\u2019ll try to see if we can get him into a better groove. But he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nThe workload on James has been overwhelming, maybe even too much for him. He\u2019s as mentally focused as he\u2019s ever been, and heading into the finals, James acknowledged his game is at its pinnacle.\n\nHe\u2019s dug deep to make it through two games, and he may be forced to play 40-plus minutes per game from here on out.\n\n\u201cAm I built for it?\u201d said, repeating a reporter\u2019s question. \u201cWell, of course I\u2019m built for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once LeBron James tied up the NBA Finals with another one of his virtuoso postseason performances, his legs were in knots.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Once LeBron James tied up the NBA Finals with another one of his virtuoso postseason performances, his legs were in knots.", "title": "LeBron, Cavs recover after beating Warriors, tying Finals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/8/lebron-cavs-recover-after-beating-warriors-tying-f/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/f28c509f9756c319780f6a7067004561.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/f28c509f9756c319780f6a7067004561.jpg", "description": "Once LeBron James tied up the NBA Finals with another one of his virtuoso postseason performances, his legs were in knots.", "card": "summary", "title": "LeBron, Cavs recover after beating Warriors, tying Finals"}, "Author": "TOM WITHERS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Lebron James, Cleveland, Golden State Warriors, Kyrie Irving"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s as mentally focused as he\u2019s ever been, and heading into the finals, James acknowledged his game is at its pinnacle.\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Once LeBron James tied up the NBA Finals with another one of his virtuoso postseason performances, his legs were in knots.\nBut while Dellavedova\u2019s contributions starting in place of Irving were huge, James was again the difference and the reason why the Cavs can\u2019t be dismissed.\nHowever, he\u2019s dictating the pace of the game, controlling the clock and slowing the run-and-gun Warriors, who are accustomed to doing things their way.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a champion does.\u201dJames is averaging 41.5 points, 12 rebounds and 8.5 assists in his fifth straight finals."}
