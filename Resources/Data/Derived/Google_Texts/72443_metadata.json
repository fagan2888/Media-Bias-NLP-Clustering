The incumbent party's average loss of Senate seats since World War II? Six seats. Or exactly what the GOP needs.\n\nOn top of that, Democrats face a very difficult set of Senate races with far more vulnerable seats than Republicans.\n\nRead MoreYellen's 'gaffe' that wasn't\n\n\n\nThe GOP faces potential losses only in Kentucky and Georgia, and both are long shots for Democrats. Republicans are heavy favorites to pick up Democratic seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. The GOP is also favored to defeat Sens. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Mark Pryor in Arkansas.\n\nThat would leave Republicans in need of winning just one of the tossup races in Michigan, Alaska and North Carolina. The GOP also has outside shots in Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSo the odds seem to favor the GOP hitting the number its needs to make Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority Leader.\n\nRead MoreYellen's debut with the media: Plenty at stake politically\n\n\n\nSome Democrats complained that Silver and FiveThirtyEight.com used partisan or out-of-date public polling to craft his forecast. That sounds disturbingly like complaints from Republicans in 2012 that forecasts of a big re-election win for President Barack Obama were based on \"skewed\" poll results.\n\nSome Democrats also noted that Silver got predictions of some Senate Democratic races wrong in 2012. That's true, but the electorate in 2014\u2014far less young and diverse\u2014should favor the GOP much more than the 2012 race in which the president and his get-out-the-vote machine helped drive up numbers and improve demographics for Democrats up and down the ticket.\n\nAnd beyond the individual states, the national mood heading into Election Day matters a great deal. While much can change, the problems for Democrats are stacking up.\n\nThe most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Obama with a record low approval rating of just 41 percent and 54 percent disapproving of the job he is doing. The Affordable Care Act, which Republicans plan to hammer all year, was viewed as a \"bad idea\" by 49 percent and a \"good idea\" by just 35 percent.\n\nDemocrats do have a slight edge in most \"generic ballot\" surveys. But as Silver pointed out, these polls tend to oversample Democrats not likely to show up in the midterms.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Democrats face a tough historical trend in which the party controlling the White House generally loses seats in the sixth year, POLITICO's Ben White says.", "news_keywords": "Nate Silver, midterm elections", "author": "Ben White", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Democrats face a tough trend in which the party controlling the White House generally loses seats in the sixth year, POLITICO's Ben White says.", "title": "Nate Silver's GOP Senate prediction: Dead-on", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/25/shocked-by-nate-silvers-gop-senate-prediction-dont-be.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/03/25/101523305-176451138.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats face a tough trend in which the party controlling the White House generally loses seats in the sixth year, POLITICO's Ben White says.", "creator": "@morningmoneyben", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/25/shocked-by-nate-silvers-gop-senate-prediction-dont-be.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/03/25/101523305-176451138.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Shocked by Nate Silver's GOP Senate prediction?
