Banner Health will build a full-fledged hospital in Fort Collins to open in 2015, deepening the nonprofit system’s competition with University of Colorado Health’s Poudre Valley branch.

Banner has been planning a medical campus on the southern end of Fort Collins and dangled the idea of a full acute-care hospital. The board of the Arizona-based nonprofit said over the weekend it would launch hospital construction on the site Monday.

The 24-bed facility will be much smaller than UCH Poudre Valley’s 270-bed hospital. But it deepens the building competition between the two systems. Banner also controls McKee Medical Center in Loveland, and hospitals in Greeley, Sterling and Brush.

UCHealth spokesman Dan Weaver said there’s “overwhelming data showing that northern Colorado currently has an oversupply of hospital beds.”

Banner spokesman Paul Matthews said there is growing demand in northern Colorado.

“Patients who use our facilities are very pleased with the results,” Matthews said.
