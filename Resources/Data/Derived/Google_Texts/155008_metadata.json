But the doctrine that bears his name \u2013 the Powell Doctrine \u2013 is a disaster. That idea of American power has contributed to U.S. passivity leading to (among other things) the brutal execution of American journalist James Foley. That is why it is \u2013 finally \u2013 on the way out.\n\nThe Powell Doctrine is somewhat of a misnomer: It\u2019s actually mostly the Weinberger Doctrine, articulated by President Reagan\u2019s former Secretary of Defense and refined by Powell afterwards. It says that American military power should not be used except overwhelmingly and as a last resort, with a clear political objective and exit strategy in mind. It evolved conceptually as a reaction to some of the perceived failures of the Vietnam War, such as shifting, vague political goals and artificial constraints on the use of force.\n\nRelated: James Foley Did Not Die in Vain\n\nFor a while, it seemed to make sense. The Gulf War illustrated how overwhelming airpower and ground forces could achieve a decisive strategic victory cleanly and quickly. \u2026 Then, GET OUT. No endless death-by-a-thousand Kalashnikovs this time - we had a new normal of how to fight wars, and it worked.\n\nThat Saddam had configured his army to be uniquely vulnerable to just this sort of warfare was, of course, beside the point. As was the fact that the \u201cclear objective\u201d got muddy very quickly: the Shia in Iraq\u2019s south, egged on by the White House, rose up against Saddam\u2019s rule and were massacred. Or that the Kurds required immediate, somewhat vague American assistance, to go with their vague political status, and that the U.S. would spend the next decade in low-level aerial warfare over Iraq\u2019s no-fly zone for somewhat vague reasons. Vague, but necessary \u2013 the sort of support the Shia expected but didn\u2019t get.\n\nThe Powell doctrine was already junk. But it was most damned by the subsequent post-Iraq crises: Bosnia and Rwanda. How the U.S. should interfere in complex, escalating genocides, rooted in decades or centuries old ethnic feuds was not nearly as clean-cut as in the Gulf War. So we didn\u2019t interfere, which seemed hard-nosed and Powell-esque at the time but didn\u2019t really reflect that well on America in hindsight.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s 3 Options for Bringing Foley\u2019s Killer to Justice\n\nThe Powell doctrine survived the \u201890\u2019s genocides, though. It recused itself somewhat after the initially successful invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, but came back with a vengeance when they went south in 2004 and 2005. The Iraq disaster \u2013 or at least the (currently) first \u201cdisaster\u201d phase from 2004-2007 \u2013 resurrected some of the haunting questions about Vietnam: What, specifically, are we supposed to be doing? What nebulous outcome are we trying to achieve? And why don\u2019t we have more men?\n\nMany of these criticisms formed the backbone of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d is essentially a distillation of the Powell Doctrine, a reaction to the ambitious, vague, nation-building in hate-soaked conflicts that had so soured the country on Bush\u2019s plans for a democratic Middle East. More elegant was the administration\u2019s catchphrase \u201cSmart Power,\u201d which suggested a more thoughtful, discriminating blend of diplomacy, trade, and occasionally force, in many fewer locations. It matched a public that was weary of war, and strongly opposed to more conflicts abroad.\n\nHowever, the public also now views this policy as a disaster. A significant majority disapproves of Obama\u2019s handling of foreign affairs, prompted by the cavalcade of disasters in Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Libya, Gaza, Egypt, whatever\u2019s happening in Mali at the moment, and China\u2019s ongoing Mexican standoff with virtually all of its maritime neighbors. Each fresh disaster reinforces the view that Obama is passive in the face of action, and that passivity is feeding the chaos.\n\nRelated: Failure to Rescue Foley Shows Special Ops Limitations\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely his fault. The Obama administration would argue, rightfully, that these conflicts are complicated and not easy to solve. It didn\u2019t intervene forcefully in Syria to arm the moderates because it was complicated. It didn\u2019t follow-up in Libya because it was complicated. Ukraine is REALLY complicated, and Putin\u2019s intimidating in person.\n\nThat\u2019s been the entire problem with Obama\u2019s foreign policy and with the Powell Doctrine from the beginning -- most problems are complicated. That\u2019s why they\u2019re problems. Unless you have an enemy who\u2019s read the script, like Saddam in 1990, the result of your doctrine is going to be doing a lot of nothing. When you\u2019re the superpower, nothing feeds disaster. Nothing in Syria fed the Islamic State (ISIS), which grew and metastasized until it massacred Yazidis and beheaded the American journalist James Foley, and thus couldn\u2019t be ignored any more.\n\nThe White House finally understands this, and has, however post-iceberg, begun to change course. President Obama\u2019s announcement that the Iraq operations were going to be a \u201clong-term project\u201d to ensure that Islamic State militants could not \u201ccripple a country\u201d was a welcome dose of reality. Not because anybody wants a war, especially a long war; but simply because some problems are complicated. In crises like Rwanda and Darfur and now Iraq, the Powell Doctrine doesn\u2019t help us much. America can be hurt anyway. That\u2019s why Obama has \u2013 rightfully \u2013 moved on.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Colin Powell is an American hero.He served two combat tours in Vietnam, and rose to be", "title": "How James Foley\u2019s Death Changed the Course of Obama\u2019s Foreign Policy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/24/How-James-Foley-s-Death-Changed-Course-Obama-s-Foreign-Policy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08202014_James_Foley_Execution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/24/How-James-Foley-s-Death-Changed-Course-Obama-s-Foreign-Policy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08202014_James_Foley_Execution.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@AndrewLPeek"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Colin Powell is an American hero.He served two combat tours in Vietnam, and rose to be", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c58\"", "article_summary": "Related: Obama\u2019s 3 Options for Bringing Foley\u2019s Killer to JusticeThe Powell doctrine survived the \u201890\u2019s genocides, though.\nThat\u2019s been the entire problem with Obama\u2019s foreign policy and with the Powell Doctrine from the beginning -- most problems are complicated.\nOr that the Kurds required immediate, somewhat vague American assistance, to go with their vague political status, and that the U.S. would spend the next decade in low-level aerial warfare over Iraq\u2019s no-fly zone for somewhat vague reasons.\nIn crises like Rwanda and Darfur and now Iraq, the Powell Doctrine doesn\u2019t help us much.\nThe Powell Doctrine is somewhat of a misnomer: It\u2019s actually mostly the Weinberger Doctrine, articulated by President Reagan\u2019s former Secretary of Defense and refined by Powell afterwards."}
