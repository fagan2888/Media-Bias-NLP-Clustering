Zombies are coming, according to the Fox News website Tuesday morning.

The news outlet's homepage accidentally displayed numerous fake but funny headlines Tuesday morning after accidentally turning live a homepage prototype. Initially, many believed Fox News' website had been hacked.

For about half an hour, FoxNews.com featured the headline "World Zombie Day to Bring Out the Living Dead" as well another saying Apple unveiled a "Maverick Sea Lion" at its developers conference. The main story, meanwhile, featured "Weeeeeeee" for its headline and "Stuff yo" for the story description.

“During routine website maintenance, a homepage prototype was accidentally moved to the actual site," Fox News Chief Digital Officer Jeff Misenti said in a statement. "As with any mistake in testing, engineers noticed the error and quickly brought the site back to its normal function."

And as expected, the mistake sent the Twittersphere into a craze. Here are some of the best tweets:

@rossneumann Between the "Stuff Yo" and zombies, it's pretty clear that AMC is behind the Fox News hack. All that's missing is Don Draper. — Bart (@bart_smith) November 5, 2013

The trouble is, I can't tell if it's a hack, or just business as usual at Fox News http://t.co/6Td0WwepdE — Texanus Giganticus (@couchsecurity) November 5, 2013

Fox News website hacked + not working? Does that mean that they're a bad idea? Because that's how they approach the Obamacare site #ACA — Cristela Alonzo (@cristela9) November 5, 2013

The sad reality is that there is definitely some Fox News reader out there who believes the zombie apocalypse is upon us. 'WEEEEEEEEEEEE' — Alyssa Farah (@Alyssafarah) November 5, 2013
