CLEVELAND, Ohio — One of the three women who survived a decade held captive inside the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro debuted her new song on Tuesday.

Michelle Knight's song is called “Survivor.” It is now available on iTunes, Google Play, and Amazon.

Knight says she’s always had a song in her heart, and earlier this year, she met a producer who decided to help her make her song a reality.

Producer Aaron "D-Boyy" Dissell took Michelle’s words and turned them into the song, which talks not only about her suffering but also about her triumphs. Michelle hopes that “Survivor” will be an inspiration; a message of hope. Just singing the song brings out the emotional turmoil she’s had to endure. hey guys I finally get to share my song with u all love u God bless http://t.co/jMYVnYWlTb http://t.co/Slo1cqBw9n — Michelle Knight (@iMichelleKnight) May 19, 2015 Please enable Javascript to watch this video
