At Gilchrist Metal Fabricating\u2019s grimy factory in Hudson the day before the primary, during what the Granite State for some reason calls a \u201ctown hall meeting,\u201d Chris Christie tells an illustrative story. One of these indigenous Granite State prima donnas buttonholed him, he says, to answer questions on his position on every issue from A to Z. After something like a half hour, convinced he\u2019s found a satisfied customer, Christie finally moved in to close the sale:\n\n\u201cSo are you going to vote for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo? Why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t ask for my vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m asking for your vote now!\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late.\u201d\n\nThe tale may well be apocryphal, I reflect. And then another, even better one unfolds right before my eyes. New Jersey\u2019s Jabba-the-Hutt-sized governor sinks down to one knee on the factory\u2019s oil-stained floor. \u201cI hope I got your vote! I got my pants all dirty and everything!\u201d The woman before whom he kneels assures him that he has.\n\nIn response to similar one-on-one supplications that same morning from the overstuffed executive from Jersey, so do several others. Each time, the former undecided voter earns an appreciative ovation from the many Christie fans in the crowd. Milks an ovation from the crowd, I\u2019d say. A New Hampshire voter will do just about anything for attention. Even lie\u2014which I\u2019m pretty well convinced most of these newly minted Christie supporters must have been doing. For Christie has repeated this ritual over a hundred times already, at town hall after town hall, on each of his over 70 days in New Hampshire, sometimes several times a day, sometimes lasting as long as two hours. He claims his wife has spent more days here than any of the other candidates themselves. And, if what I saw at Gilchrist Metals is any indication, he lassoed scads of self-proclaimed Christie converts at each event.\n\nMost of whom must have voted for someone else, considering that Christie got only 7.4 percent of the vote, and promptly dropped out. In the last poll before election day, 20 percent of the New Hampshire voters were not just undecided on a candidate\u2014they hadn\u2019t picked which party\u2019s primary they intended to vote in. These were the people to whom we were supposed to be devoting our reverent attention in the first week of February 2016.\n\nThe first New Hampshire presidential primary was in 1916. It was supposed to be in May. Then, officials decided to schedule it in March to coincide with the annual late winter town meetings. This year the unhappy accident celebrates its 100th anniversary. It\u2019s become a spectacle\u2014an invading army of journalists, elbowing past an invading army of campaigns, all for access to an electorate elbowing their way into the invaders\u2019 angle of vision in order to deliver a fetishized show of the very sort of authenticity their collective presence renders obviously impossible.\n\nAt a John Kasich vote-returns watch party I attended, triple-tiered rostrums covered a quarter of the floor space and groaned under the weight of 31 news camera tripods\u2014one for every four or five Kasich supporters in the room. New Hampshire, how do the media and political establishment love thee? Let us count the ways. From December to the primary the Republican electorate in this state of 1.3 million people was polled 39 separate times. The site of the subsequent primary, South Carolina, population 4.8 million, had been polled only four times, though that state is a much sturdier indicator of the direction of the GOP by any conceivable measure. The bias is structural: the GOP gives New Hampshire 23 delegates. South Carolina, with almost four times the population, gets 50.\n\nHamish, New Hampshire\n\nMy first stop from the airport on Saturday evening is the campaign headquarters of Ohio Governor John Kasich. It turns out to be an unprepossessing white clapboard house on a frontage road off the freeway: authenticity! A billboard towers above it, quoting Jeb Bush: \u201cDonald Trump is unhinged.\u201d It\u2019s paid for by Bush\u2019s hyper-capitalized Right to Rise super PAC, but its presence is fortuitous because that is Kasich\u2019s message, too, though he would never put anything so rudely. Kasich is the Republican field\u2019s 1950s sitcom dad, confident, competent, and above all, polite. In November, his campaign put up a web ad paraphrasing Pastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller\u2019s famous warning about Hitler: \u201cFirst they came for the socialists, and I said nothing, because I am not socialist\u2026\u201d Although, naturally, Kasich was too polite to say it himself: the message, which was aimed at Donald Trump, was voiced by Vietnam War POW Colonel Tom Moe.\n\nOf Trump\u2019s signature campaign pledge that he will summarily kick all undocumented immigrants out of the country, Kasich responded, \u201cIt is completely ridiculous to think we are going to go into neighborhoods, grab people out of their homes, and ship people back to Mexico. That\u2019s not where the party is. The party is not for deportment of 11.5 million people.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, this is exactly where the Republican Party is, and Trump\u2019s call was immediately echoed by almost all the other candidates. I\u2019m fascinated by the question of how you run for president as the candidate of bipartisan civility, experience, and competence in the Republican Party of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. This is why I came to Kasich\u2019s house first.\n\nThe parking lot is full, spilling out to the gas station next door where reposes a classic silver Airstream trailer with a big Kasich placard on the side; the pickup truck pulling it sports a gay-rights bumper sticker and Illinois license plates. On the front porch, bundled campaign volunteers are spilling in and out, bearing clipboards and yard signs. I make my way inside, and am made to feel utterly welcome. The best word I can think of to describe the feeling is Yiddish: hamish, which means, basically, homey and familiar. I make the acquaintance of Keith, an excitable recently retired air traffic controller in a too-thin leather jacket who drove all the way from Newt Gingrich\u2019s former congressional district in Georgia.\n\n\u201cKasich territory!\u201d I volunteer. \u201cYeah. Oh, yeah. Big time,\u201d he laughs in return.\n\nWhy would this man drive 18 hours, following the worst New England snowstorm in years all the way up the Eastern Seaboard, to devote the first weeks of his golden years to Plain Jane candidate John Kasich?\n\nBecause, he says earnestly, \u201cback in the nineties, the last time the budget was balanced, Governor Kasich was the Budget Committee chairman. I remember him being onstage, talking about the balanced budget\u201d\u2014and willingly sharing the credit with President Clinton. \u201cBack home, I have relatives who live in South Carolina. They think these problems can\u2019t be fixed. But he\u2019s a math guy. He knows these budgets. He did it in Ohio, too.\u201d\n\nI ask how things are going out there at the front doors. \u201cGot a lot of good vibes today,\u201d he insists. \u201cThey really like him. And those who are indecisive are really thinking about him hard. When all is said and done, the late deciders are going to break for Kasich.\u201d\n\nAnd not just in flinty New England, he insists. \u201cMy friends, my relatives in South Carolina, I tell them, \u2018I\u2019m driving up to New Hampshire to help Governor Kasich,\u2019 and they say, \u2018He\u2019s the guy down on the end!\u2019\u201d The end of the debate stage, that is, the guy the moderators never call on because he doesn\u2019t start the cat fights that boost ratings. \u201cBut you know what? He\u2019s the only one that sounds like an adult.\u201d I meet the young New Hampshire campaign director, who reminds me that \u201cKasich\u201d rhymes with \u201cBasic.\u201d\n\nIs Basic Kasich the Republican sleeper? Are Kasich\u2019s Kindly Krusaders the Republican Deaniacs of 2016? Is this the big story everyone else is missing? Well, consider this. Later, back home in Chicago, I track down the phone number for Tom Volini, the owner of the Airstream. I reach him as he traverses some highway or byway in South Carolina, where he answers my question\u2014why Kasich?\u2014with about as un-right-wing an answer as you can imagine: \u201cWell, it\u2019s still an inquiry for me. You don\u2019t learn things instantly.\u201d\n\nYet he loves John Kasich enough that\u2014for only the second time in his life\u2014he\u2019s working on a national campaign. He supported John F. Kennedy in 1960 (and his sister-in-law for alderman in Chicago in 1979 as a crusader against the Daley machine). Volini is retired from an accomplished career as CEO of several large industrial concerns. He started voting for Republicans after the soaring interest rates of the Carter years killed his real estate development business. Then he was impressed with how well Ronald Reagan worked with Tip O\u2019Neill. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t agree about anything except bourbon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they worked, as they should have worked, for the American cause. And I think that\u2019s an appropriate analogy for what is possible, and what is necessary here.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what he saw in John Kasich when he met him last fall at Chicago\u2019s legendary Billy Goat Tavern; he was impressed by \u201cthe simple, common humanity of the man,\u201d and by his plans for his presidential campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s face to face. It\u2019s not grabbing headlines. It\u2019s not display. It\u2019s not energized by someone for whom politics is show business.\u201d\n\nHaving by now done his homework, he recites a Kasich liturgy. How, following his heroism balancing the federal budget alongside Bill Clinton, he left Congress and had settled into a perfectly satisfying career in investment banking, traveling the country helping businesses grow, until duty called. Then, like the Roman warrior Cincinnatus, \u201cwho because of his experience, and because of his humanity, was called to Rome, to leave his farm\u2014O.K.?\u2014which he was given as compensation for his military service, and lead his country. And I think that is the situation here. He wasn\u2019t looking for a job! He wasn\u2019t looking for a career! He was not looking for the cameras!\u201d He just came to the Statehouse in Columbus and \u201cinherited an $8 billion\u2014with a B\u2014deficit. There is now a $2 billion with a B surplus!\u201d\n\nVolini agreed to become a Kasich delegate to the Illinois Republican convention. \u201cAnd when I saw his message wasn\u2019t getting the kind of recognition I thought it deserved, I decided to hitch up my vintage Airstream and drive up to New Hampshire and freeze my ass!\u201d\n\nWhy the Airstream?\n\n\u201cOne, it\u2019s a free-rolling billboard,\u201d just the thing his new friend requires, because \u201che\u2019s reasonably\u2014no, not reasonably,terribly\u2014modest. Second, what does the Airstream represent?\u201d American ingenuity, American quality, American jobs: \u201cAirstreams have been built in Ohio since the 1930s.\u201d\n\nA dreamy sort of ex-CEO, Tom Volini then tells me this:\n\n\u201cThe third theme it represents is that the Airstream is an American icon in another sense: it is a sense that we\u2019re all searching for our souls. And we used to search for them on the highway. Now I guess we search for them on television and the Internet. But it represents a journey. And John is on a journey. And it\u2019s a journey in which there is a great divide in the direction it could go.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m reflecting on how his emotional intensity is a strange fit for the bland object of its attentions, and wondering if the man to whom I\u2019m speaking isn\u2019t just a little bit off. Until he unfurls a story of what this adventure has become. A story so astonishing that by the time he is finished, I tell him that if John Kasich manages to become president, I want the rights to the screenplay.\n\nVolini met a homeless Air Force veteran named John, who made his way to New Hampshire from Minneapolis, where he had learned about the Kasich campaign from the discarded newspapers he read at a Starbucks. One of the smartest people Volini has ever met, John first became attracted to Kasich some years ago \u201cbecause he opposed the B-1 bomber project in spite of the influence of the defense contractors, in order to have that money for benefits for veterans and men and women in the service. He didn\u2019t want to take that money away. He didn\u2019t want to waste it.\u201d\n\nVolini also met a former FBI agent who worked on the 9/11 investigation.\n\nThey joined forces, ribboning the state in the Airstream, blaring John Philip Sousa marches on their approach to every town \u201cat a volume which would probably make people deaf.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was so cool! \u201cVolini said. \u201cBecause the veteran could talk to the veteran groups, go into the VFW halls, talking to the people at the bars, to the people smoking their way into the grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then Bob\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the name of the ex-FBI agent\u2014\u201cwas so wonderful with the ethnic groups and the senior citizen groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then we would pick up the thing and go to the next groups! We traveled thousands of miles.\u201d\n\nThe story, Volini insists, is the purest possible expression of the essence of John Kasich\u2019s universe. The homeless vet \u201cwas a man in the shadows! And he was brought out of the shadows by this guy we\u2019re talking about with his talent to draw upon the talents of people in the shadows.\u201d\n\nMaybe these devoted supporters are the secret weapon. Back in the clapboard house, when I mention I\u2019ve heard Kasich has pulled even with Cruz at third place in the polls, Keith claims the campaign\u2019s internal polls have him comfortably alone at second. That part of the conversation is notable, in that such lowly volunteers would ordinarily not have access to such privileged information; and in a more tightly wound presidential campaign, the volunteers would not be blurting it out to reporters within minutes of meeting them.\n\nButtoned down and hyper-spun\n\nMy next stop reveals just such a tightly wound campaign. In a forbidding gray office tower in Manchester, I pass a threshold marked by a \u201cNew Hampshire Is Marco Rubio Country\u201d sign\u2014right beneath the sign marking the state headquarters for the Ricoh office supply corporation. I make my way past the leaning tower of pizza (for hungry volunteers), past room after room after room, each with a sign on the door indicating its dedicated function, and past two intricate, expertly designed charts printed in the campaign\u2019s colors and explaining the divisions of the New Hampshire Republican electorate. I walk past walls bedecked with \u201cmarcorubio A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY\u201d placards. Finally, I arrive at the office of the campaign\u2019s fashionably bearded young press secretary\u2014who, after introductions, promptly leads me back exactly the way I came to sign me in at the front desk and roundly chew out the poor sap who\u2019d temporarily abandoned his post at the moment I\u2019d arrived and neglected to do so himself. Not Hamish; not at all.\n\nHyper-branded, hyper-spun. That\u2019s Rubioland. I meet my first volunteer, from Massachusetts, and ask what brought him over the border to support Marco Rubio. What he hears in the question is a cue to wax strategic about delegate blocs. \u201cThis is a very important state . . . he\u2019s doing very well in the polls, especially after Iowa . . . much better than we thought.\u201d I interject, No, what is it you like about Rubio? But it\u2019s as if I toggled a separate switch in the computer code. \u201cHe wants to rebuild our military . . . we have to work with our allies . . . he wants to cut taxes and invest in the economy . . . he also has good values as a conservative . . . he\u2019s electable against Hillary Clinton. . . .\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s only 16 years old.\n\nThe next fellow I speak to is supremely thoughtful, and not robotic at all. He\u2019s a courtly University of Chicago\u2013trained adjunct law and political philosophy professor specializing in the thought of Plato and Aristotle. Why is he volunteering for Rubio? Because, he explains, \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that the voice of reasonable, civil people be heard. I would like to be considered one of those people, and I believe that Marco Rubio is one of the candidates in this election who represents, shall we say, the better side of America.\u201d\n\nAnd who might those candidates be who do not represent the better side of America?\n\n\u201cI think from my comments you could tell very clearly.\u201d\n\nThe guy with the orange hair?\n\n\u201cWell, not just the man you mention.\u201d But also \u201cthe other leading candidate, with natural-colored hair, [with] his personal behavior toward the other leaders of America, and the members of the Senate.\u201d\n\nThis brings me to what has become my central question here in New Hampshire: Why not Kasich?\n\n\u201cI think that in terms of his policy, I\u2019m largely with him. I\u2019m very impressed with his service both in Congress and as a governor,\u201d the professor responds. Then he turns to what many conservatives consider the deal breaker. Governor Kasich accepted free federal money provided through the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid coverage in Ohio: \u201cObamacare is one of the disasters of his presidency. And I think that Kasich\u2019s full-armed embrace of it was not wise.\u201d\n\nI ask why it should be a problem that Kasich was able to cover hundreds of thousands of people who were too poor for insurance, too rich for Medicaid, too young for Medicare, and would have otherwise had to receive their medical care via the emergency room\u2014as in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott created a $5 billion deficit in the hospital system providing medical care for the same class of people, but through emergency units.\n\nThe law professor\u2019s not buying it. \u201cThis is an unwarranted and perhaps unconstitutional expansion of the federal power,\u201d he says. \u201cI refuse to be complicit in this.\u201d\n\nComplicit. Like it is Vichy France or something.\n\nI haven\u2019t mentioned that the professor is accompanied by his profoundly disabled adult son, in a wheelchair. Cerebral palsy, I would guess. And that his adjunct teaching position is ending soon and he doesn\u2019t know what his next job will be. Conservatives call this \u201cprinciple.\u201d Kasich, by their lights, has not nearly enough.\n\nI moved on to a debate-watching party organized by the Kasich campaign and met some folks I\u2019d read about in history books: solid, civic-minded, Main Street moderate Republicans. There at my table, in the flesh, munching Swedish meatballs and crudit\u00e9s. I hear a middle-aged man describing the food incubator he\u2019d helped open in his Ohio town where people learn how to package and market their pasta sauce or pickle line, for which they\u2019ve received $4 million in state funding. Turns out he\u2019s the mayor of the town: Somerset, population 1,481. Next to him is a shopping mall developer who tells me he spends 75 percent of his time on local philanthropy. He\u2019s talking about the grant-making process for the local museum where he serves on the board, and the problem of making such cultural funding equitable in the Appalachian regions of the state.\n\nThe two fiftysomethings chat amiably with J.B., a 19-year-old student at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania. A 24-year-old Ohio state representative sits down and introduces himself\u2014Niraj Antani, and no one blinks at the \u201cstrange\u201d name. The bills he\u2019s filed include one to create a system to notify private database companies that they are to remove court records when they are sealed or expunged, another to help train auto technicians, and a third to abolish the death penalty. He complains that Ohio community colleges receive 22 percent of the state\u2019s higher education funding but educate 41 percent of the students.\n\nNiraj waves over a young friend, Sara Jantau, who works in the state department of education on a pilot program for \u201ccompetency-based education,\u201d for working adults, where progress is measured in specific skills learned, not time in the classroom. This parallels a 2013 initiative from President Obama\u2019s Department of Education. I ask her if there is room in the Republican Party for idealistic young people dedicated to innovative public policy. \u201cI\u2019d like to think so,\u201d she says wistfully. I ask J.B. how a candidate running on competency, compassion, and experience makes it in today\u2019s Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right question,\u201d he says. He has no answers.\n\nI\u2019m definitely beginning to sympathize with Kasich and his competent, kind supporters. Could I live with this guy aspresident? Best to conduct some due diligence. I contact a no-nonsense Democratic political consultant from Cincinnati, Cliff Schecter of Majority Ohio. \u201cJohn Kasich is as right wing as any other of the major contenders for the GOP nomination, no matter how many times he smiles and offers New-Agey platitudes,\u201d he tells me.\n\nSchecter points to Kasich\u2019s laws that allow guns in bars and that legalize silencers; the $57 million he threw into a no-accountability charter school system; and his replacement of the state\u2019s development department with an \u201cindependent non-profit corporation\u201d\u2014an opaque slush fund so stuffed with donors and cronies that even an appalled Republican state auditor ordered an investigation. Then there is abortion. Kasich has signed 17 restrictions, leaving nine clinics standing in a state of 11.5 million. Then, on Feb. 21, the celebrated crusader for equal access to healthcare signed a bill axing $1.3 million in grants to Planned Parenthood that funded programs addressing HIV/AIDS, domestic violence, and infant mortality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's something in the air in New Hampshire.
