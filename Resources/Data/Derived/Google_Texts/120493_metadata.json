Mark R. Warner, giving the GOP a high-profile challenger to the popular Democrat.\n\nGillespie\u2019s pronouncements to GOP leaders suggest the official launch could come soon; he is required by Virginia law to decide before Feb. 1.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve made clear, I am talking to a lot of my fellow Republicans in Virginia about running against Mark Warner,\u201d Gillespie said in an e-mail Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve been encouraged by people all across our party and our commonwealth. The filing deadline is February 1st, so I will be announcing my intentions in the near future.\u201d\n\nGillespie, who is also a former lobbyist, quietly began discussions with senior Virginia Republicans about the race in the summer. He accelerated his plans after November\u2019s elections, when Democrats won the races for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. That sweep left the GOP with a thin bench for upcoming contests \u2014 including the 2017 governor\u2019s race, which many Republicans previously thought would be Gillespie\u2019s first campaign.\n\nRepublicans say Gillespie is well aware that Warner, with a campaign war chest of $7.1 million and the personal wealth to spend far more, will be a formidable opponent. The former governor frequently rates as the most popular statewide official in public opinion polls. But GOP strategists hope that the flawed rollout of the Affordable Care Act will drag down all Democrats who supported it, including Warner.\n\nWhile Warner declined to comment, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee issued a statement after the New York Times posted a story on Gillespie\u2019s intentions Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cVirginians don\u2019t want to elect a DC shadow lobbyist like Ed Gillespie who epitomizes the reckless and irresponsible Republican economic agenda,\u201d Guy Cecil, DSCC executive director, said. \u201cGillespie won\u2019t work to strengthen Virginia\u2019s economy, cut the nation\u2019s debt or work to find common ground in Washington the way Mark Warner has done, and Virginians know that.\u201d\n\nBefore he can face Warner, Gillespie must win the Republican nomination at a state party convention \u2014 a method that can result in unpredictable results and often favors the most conservative candidates.\n\nTwo other Republicans \u2014 Shak Hill, a Centreville financial planner, and Howie Lind, a former Pentagon official and lobbyist from McLean \u2014 have already announced plans to run, although neither has Gillespie\u2019s party connections or fundraising background.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vapolitics, mark warner, ed gillespie, virginia republicans, virginia democrats, virginia senate, 2014, congressional elections, midterm elections", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The ex-chairman of the Republican National Committee plans to run against Sen.
