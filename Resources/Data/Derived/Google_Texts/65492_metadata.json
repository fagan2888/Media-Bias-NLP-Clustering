Those two, plus Pierre Gar\u00e7on, will give quarterback Robert Griffin III a trio of highly skilled wide receivers in the first year in new coach Jay Gruden\u2019s offense.\n\nSo far, the process of getting every player together as a cohesive offense has been an adjustment. In the team\u2019s initial training camp practice on Thursday, Griffin underestimated Jackson\u2019s speed on one deep ball before Jackson dropped another attempt because of the wet conditions. Then, on Friday morning, Griffin attempted to connect with Jackson during a passing drill, only for the ball to end up near the receiver\u2019s ankles.\n\n\u201cHonestly, that\u2019s what practice is for: Going out there every day and working and taking rep after rep after rep after rep \u2014 really trying to get on the same page and get on the same accord as an offense,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBeing a new offense \u2014 Jay Gruden\u2019s first year, my first year here, [Griffin] being in his third year \u2014 really, it\u2019s just kind of new for everybody.\u201d\n\nGruden\u2019s offense is vastly different from the one Jackson worked in last season, when he had 82 catches for 1,332 yards and nine touchdowns. That production was partly due to coach Chip Kelly\u2019s \u201cfast, speedy offense,\u201d as Jackson called it; now, he\u2019s settling into a scheme that\u2019s more similar to what he had under coach Andy Reid and offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg for his first five seasons.\n\nThat means Jackson will be tasked with a variety of responsibilities, both outside and in the slot, and be used in a variety of ways. Gruden\u2019s modified West Coast offense won\u2019t look vastly different from what the Redskins ran last year, but he does want to slightly quicken the tempo \u2014 which, as demonstrated last year, could be advantageous for Jackson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s continued to get more comfortable with the verbiage that we\u2019re using,\u201d said offensive coordinator Sean McVay. \u201cThere are some similarities to what he did with Coach Reid and what Coach Gruden\u2019s offense is doing, but he\u2019s done a great job picking it up in the meeting rooms and being detailed with that and challenging himself to be better in that aspect.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s hands and speed make him a valuable downfield target, but it also allows the Redskins to be flexible on short and intermediate routes. By stretching the field vertically, Gar\u00e7on, Roberts and tight end Jordan Reed should, in theory, have greater flexibility underneath to make catches and pick up yards.\n\nThat is, once Jackson and Griffin get their timing down.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t always just drop back and heave it long with a guy like DeSean,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cDefenses are gonna be ready for that type of stuff, so really, we\u2019re working on making sure our timing is down on all the underneath routes. The deep routes will come, and I\u2019ll be able to throw the deep ball, he\u2019ll be able to catch the deep ball. But I feel like we\u2019re really far into the process of [getting] that chemistry.\u201d\n\nJackson ended up in Washington only after an acrimonious departure from Philadelphia, and though there were allegations that the Eagles were concerned about his character, the team insisted Jackson\u2019s release was merely a football decision.\n\nIf that was, Jackson said he wants to prove to the Eagles that he can still play football \u2014 and thriving in the Redskins\u2018 offense will be a way for him to do so.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, the defenses are going to have to be accountable for multiple guys \u2014 not just one guy, not just two guys, but four and five guys every play,\u201d Jackson said. \u201c[Griffin] is going to have a lot on his hands, because there\u2019s going to be a lot of guys open. That\u2019s the plan \u2014 just make it easier for him. As long as guys are open and he knows where to dish it to, it\u2019ll be fun for us to go run and score touchdowns and make good plays for him. I think that\u2019s what we look forward to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DeSean Jackson and Andre Roberts were discussing their roles in the Washington Redskins' offense one morning last week when they realized that not all of the team's receivers will end up pleased with the number of passes they'll be thrown.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "DeSean Jackson and Andre Roberts were discussing their roles in the Washington Redskins\u2019 offense one morning last week when they realized that not all of the team\u2019s receivers will end up pleased with the number of passes they\u2019ll be thrown.", "title": "DeSean Jackson working on offensive cohesiveness with Redskins teammates", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/27/desean-jackson-working-offensive-cohesiveness-reds/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/24/redskins_20140724_034.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/24/redskins_20140724_034.jpg", "description": "DeSean Jackson and Andre Roberts were discussing their roles in the Washington Redskins' offense one morning last week when they realized that not all of the team's receivers will end up pleased with", "card": "summary", "title": "DeSean Jackson working on offensive cohesiveness with Redskins teammat"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Desean Jackson, Robert Griffin Iii, Washington Redskins, Andre Roberts"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSomebody has to be open.\u201dThe Redskins upgraded their passing game during the offseason, perhaps more than any other team, when they signed Jackson and Roberts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous and very scary, so I\u2019d rather be on the team that has all the weapons,\u201d Jackson said.\nIf that was, Jackson said he wants to prove to the Eagles that he can still play football \u2014 and thriving in the Redskins\u2018 offense will be a way for him to do so.\nThose two, plus Pierre Gar\u00e7on, will give quarterback Robert Griffin III a trio of highly skilled wide receivers in the first year in new coach Jay Gruden\u2019s offense.\nRICHMOND \u2014 DeSean Jackson and Andre Roberts were discussing their roles in the Washington Redskins\u2018 offense one morning last week when they realized that not all of the team\u2019s receivers will end up pleased with the number of passes they\u2019ll be thrown."}
