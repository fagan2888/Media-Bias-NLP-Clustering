Marijuana is illegal in Arizona, except for the treatment of certain medical conditions.\n\nLake Havasu City officials heard about the story in The Sun after a local resident from a London suburb showed them a copy of the tabloid. They say it was a slap in the face, particularly when more than $600,000 in bridge improvements is planned for this summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most preposterous and inflammatory articles ever written about our city, and we will respond in kind,\u201d Traub said at the time before demanding a retraction and an apology from the newspaper.\n\nThe online edition of the article has since been retracted.\n\nThe bridge, which spans a channel between the shoreline and an island in Lake Havasu City, was sold by the British government in 1968 to Robert P. McCullouch, the city\u2019s founder. The bridge was dismantled in London, transported to Lake Havasu and reassembled during a three-year period.\n\nIt is the only bridge leading to the island where boats launch on Lake Havasu and one of the state\u2019s major tourist attractions. Some 12,000 vehicles cross it daily.\n\nThe improvements planned this summer \u2014 to drain water from one of the support piers and to create an entryway into the bridge to ensure workers\u2019 safety \u2014 would extend the life of the bridge by at least another 40 years, city officials said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAKE HAVASU CITY \u2014 A British tabloid will issue a correction Monday for a story stating Arizona's own London Bridge could be bulldozed to make way for drug tourism, Lake Havasu City officials said.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "The Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "LAKE HAVASU CITY \u2014 A British tabloid will issue a correction Monday for a story stating Arizona's own London Bridge could be bulldozed to make way for drug tourism, Lake Havasu City officials said....", "title": "Paper to correct story on Arizona's London Bridge", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2014/07/21/paper-to-correct-story-on-arizonas-london-bridge/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2014/07/London-Bridge-Lake-Havasu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Paper to correct story on Arizona\u2019s London BridgeArizona Capitol Times", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "arizona, lake havasu city, london bridge, demolished, the sun, correction,correction,demolished,lake havasu city,london bridge,the sun", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LAKE HAVASU CITY \u2014 A British tabloid will issue a correction Monday for a story stating Arizona\u2019s own London Bridge could be bulldozed to make way for drug tourism, Lake Havasu City officials said.\nThe bridge was dismantled in London, transported to Lake Havasu and reassembled during a three-year period.\nIt is the only bridge leading to the island where boats launch on Lake Havasu and one of the state\u2019s major tourist attractions.\nLake Havasu City officials heard about the story in The Sun after a local resident from a London suburb showed them a copy of the tabloid.\nThe Sun had reported the bridge was cracking, and Lake Havasu City planned to demolish it and turn the area into a haven for marijuana users called Hemped in Havasu."}
