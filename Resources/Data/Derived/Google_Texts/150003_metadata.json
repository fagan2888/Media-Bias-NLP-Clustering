I am a charter member of NNALEA, having joined the organization in the early 1990\u2019s when I was an FBI special agent. Since then, I followed NNALEA activities and recognized the organization\u2019s value as I served as the Deputy Director of BIA\u2019s law enforcement program. Regarding the mascot and team name issue, there was a time I viewed the matter with a \u201cwe have bigger fish to fry,\u201d attitude. As I have closely followed the debate and engaged in my own analysis, I came to ask myself a simple question, how would I feel if someone called out to my Mother, \u201cHey Redskin!\u201d With that personal benchmark established, I better understand that the team name represents a marginalization of our identity. Generations and generations of disregard for who we are, has contributed to those more significant areas of concern our tribal communities face such as, crime, poverty, school dropout, sexual abuse, mortality rates, suicides, substance abuse and more.\n\nThere have been numerous warnings raised around the recently founded Washington Redskins charity, OAF. OAF, which was formed in March 2014 by Redskins\u2019 owner Dan Snyder to provide grants to tribes, is recognized by many as a flimsy public relations shill to rally support from members of Indian Country for Snyder\u2019s campaign to keep his team\u2019s name. As Native people we recognize the importance of generosity in a humble way, do it without saying it. Insisting that OAF gifts be \u201cbranded\u201d with colors and logos make them no longer gifts, but advertisements. At appearance, OAF\u2019s goal is to make it seem that Native opinion on the \u201cRedskins\u201d name is divided, and counter the rising tide of public and professional opinion to change the NFL franchise\u2019s name. His efforts have had mixed success, with some communities accepting the needed funding and others passing it up. As one tribal leader commented after refusing to take a grant for a youth skate park, \u201cWe know a bribe when we see one.\u201d\n\nWhat has been largely overlooked, however, is the connection between OAF and a degradation of Indian Country\u2019s internal mechanisms and capacity for public safety, trust and crucial inter-organizational cooperation. That mechanism is the National Native American Law Enforcement Association (NNALEA), and the troubling connection is Gary Edwards.\n\nGary Edwards, a self-described Cherokee, currently leads both the Redskins\u2019 OAF (as executive director) and the cross-jurisdictional, inter-agency cooperative, the NNALEA (as CEO). Edwards has effectively sold his legitimacy as CEO of NNALEA to the Redskins franchise, with disturbing consequences.\n\nThe naming of the sitting NNALEA CEO to the post in Snyder\u2019s OAF has given the impression that Native law enforcement, as a group, support the hotly debated team name. For folks in our tribal communities opposed to the team name, this association reinforces their decades-long distrust of law enforcement.\n\nIn addition, media focus on Edwards\u2019 participation with the Redskin\u2019s owner, Dan Snyder, has compelled a number of NNALEA\u2019s charter members to openly question the management and function of the NNALEA organization. In fact, Ted Quasula, past NNLEA President has called for a boycott of the upcoming annual conference to be held August 26 \u2013 28, 2014 in Las Vegas, NV, thus drawing a direct line between Edwards\u2019 leadership of the inter-agency organization and it\u2019s ability to provide important services to Indian Country at large.\n\nAnd then there is the large and lingering question of the Bureau of Indian Affairs Law Enforcement Recruiting contract, valued at nearly one million dollars.\n\nWhy the NNALEA is important to Indian Country\n\nIn the early 1990\u2019s, a group of Native men and women in law enforcement started talking about forming an organization to support and network Natives in law enforcement. Our vision was a fraternal organization that would offer a particular focus on those serving our tribal communities. We hoped for inter-agency cooperation and increased capacity to serve our communities. We also hoped to ease a generations-long mistrust and distrust of law enforcement, which we know stems from its origins in U.S. military rule. In 1993, NNALEA was officially created, and became a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.\n\nLike most fledgling organizations, it was important to generate enough revenue to support a variety of initiatives including a newsletter, conferences and student scholarships. Gary Edwards, then a Secret Service Agent, was NNALEA\u2019s first president. He proved to be an able and active leader and moved the organization quickly along in the important formative years.\n\nAt a point fairly early on, the board changed the bylaws to reduce the size of the governing board and create a CEO position \u2013 to which Edwards was appointed. Joseph Rosen (former FBI Special Agent and retired US Customs Special Agent) was then NNALEA\u2019s General Counsel. At the board meeting creating the full-time CEO position, Rosen argued against the change, stating it gave too much concentrated authority, translating into an unfettered ability to control the financial and business aspects of the organization. The change was made despite his concerns, and the organization started drifting toward a business enterprise focus.\n\nRosen\u2019s concerns have materialized, as Edwards has steered NNALEA from its original non-profit vision of service to one that emphasizes business enterprise. This shift left me to let my membership lapse and I moved on to find other ways to support Indian Country law enforcement. As time went on, many of the original NNALEA members left the organization for the same or similar reasons. Now it is clear that we should have stayed and fought for the organization and our vision.\n\nGuideStar, who publishes not-for profit organizational financial information (GuideStar.org), reveals that NNALEA is now a 501(c)(6) organization, which is defined as an association of persons having some common business interest, the purpose of which is to promote such common interest.\n\nGuideStar\u2019s records indicate that NNALEA is managed by volunteers and seems to have no employees. The records also showed that NNALEA\u2019s annual revenue was expended on subcontracted labor. GuideStar published IRS 990s listed revenue for NNALEA in the millions of dollars. Where did the revenues come from, and what did NNALEA do with the money?\n\nMisused Million demands closer look, and other NNALEA troubles\n\nWhen Gary Edwards was named executive director of OAF in March of 2014, the resultant media frenzy brought to light a 2009 Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General report that roundly criticized both the BIA and NNALEA for a mismanaged million-dollar contract. The outlined purpose of the contract was to recruit eligible Natives for service in law enforcement. According to the report, the contract failed to recruit even a single candidate.\n\nEdwards hired to folks to \u201crecruit\u201d candidates for the BIA law enforcement contract. As part of their effort, they travelled to powwows where they handed out trinkets to entice folks to \u201csign up.\u201d They were reportedly paid $10 per hour to gather names, and were not provided any kind of training or detailed orientation to carry out their task. Based on the OIG report, it is clear the candidates were not screened; one was an 80 year-old man and others were not even U.S. citizens.\n\nNNALEA provided the names of 748, apparently unscreened candidates, and was paid $967,100 or $1293 per candidate.\n\nTo put the funds in perspective, $1 million would equate to approximately 28 fully equipped police cars, or 967 bullet resistant vests, or 1934 semi-automatic pistols for Indian Country\u2019s chronically underfunded and ill-equipped police officers.\n\nNNALEA\u2019s officers and executives have (for the most part) exited stage left when questions about finances started to fly. In conversations they said it was \u201cGary\u2019s company\u201d with which NNALEA had a contract to carry out the work for the BIA recruiting contract. Internet record searches found a Tennessee company using the same telephone number and address as NNALEA. The company, Native American Consulting Group, LLC, lists the Registered Agent as an 83 year-old female with the last name of Edwards, who is listed by another Internet database as a relative of Gary Edwards. A business listing website names Gary Edwards the company owner.\n\nThough Native American Consulting Group, LLC has been in business since 2005, there does not appear to be a website marketing the company services, nor are there any company issued press releases touting the enterprise. As a matter of public trust, the NNALEA's board of directors should reveal if they executed a contract with a company owned by their CEO\u2014and if so, how much that company invoiced NNALEA. In the interest of their own fiscal health, the directors should closely examine their own financial records for assurances that hundreds of thousands of dollars did not just ooze between the cracks.\n\nEach year federal agencies have clamored to pay booth and registration fees to attend the NNALEA conference and have allowed their federal employee board members to attend. At one point, the Department of Justice was giving NNALEA funding to assist with conference costs. Based on the Guidestar 990s it appears the conference was generating hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Federal agencies should be asking how their funding was managed and accounted for by NNALEA.\n\nOver the past several weeks there have been a number of original NNALEA members and other Native law enforcement officers, including John Hensley (Retired Associate Commissioner US Customs and NNALEA Past President), Dorothy Summerfield (Retired FBI special agent and NNALEA Past President), Ted Quasula (Retired Director of BIA Law Enforcement and NNALEA Past President) who have been in routine communication and have unanimously expressed their disappointment that the NNALEA board of directors have not issued a statement distancing the organization and membership from the Redskins name issue. Their disappointment also extends to a real concern regarding the revenues generated in NNALEA\u2019s name. Also questioned is how the NNALEA board has allowed Gary Edwards to use NNALEA\u2019s name and credibility as he represents OAF.\n\nJoseph Rosen sums it up best: \u201cAs a founding member of NNALEA and a former director, it saddens me that the NNALEA CEO has chosen to head Dan Snyder's organization that is meant to legitimize the racial slur of a team name. It reflects poorly on NNALEA to have the NNALEA CEO associated with Snyder's efforts. If he is being paid to do so, it should even be more troublesome for NNALEA.\u201d\n\nAs a concerned group of founding NNALEA members we urge a formal investigation by the Internal Revenue Service regarding the NNALEA and Native American Consulting Group, LLC, business relationship to determine if there was a violation of IRS 501 (c) (6) regulation or statue; further we strongly encourage the NNALEA board of directors to take swift action to publically distance the organization from OAF and remove Gary Edwards as NNALEA CEO. It's time to get NNALEA back on track for Indian Country.\n\nWalter Lamar, Blackfeet/Wichita, is a former FBI special agent, deputy director of BIA law enforcement and is currently president of Lamar Associates.
