They\u2019re everywhere. After Sandy, this writer even had nightmares about them. That\u2019s what made New York State Assembly\u2019s Chair, Committee on Health, Richard Gottfried\u2019s \u201cSingle-Payer\u201d discussion with the Chelsea Reform Democratic Club (CRDC) so intriguing \u2014 a plan that will eliminate health care insurance companies, with their costs and profits, from the family budget.\n\nThe meeting, moderated by CRDC\u2019s Executive Board member, Joel Vatsky, was held at Chelsea\u2019s Elliott Center on the cold evening of February 19. It had passionate and sometimes heated exchanges on the pros and cons of Assemblymember Gottfried\u2019s \u201cSingle-Payer\u201d health care bill: New York Health, A7860. The bill would form a single public agency that would organize health care financing. It largely reflects the universal health care that Canada has used for the past 45 years. And, according to the World Bank, since then, the average Canadian\u2019s life span has expanded to 2.5 years longer than the average American life (Can: 81.24 yrs., USA: 78.74 yrs.).\n\n\u201cIf you want to find a country that rations care according to wealth, if you want to find a country where people have to go without health care in the midst of enormous wealth, if you want to find a country where people go bankrupt trying to keep themselves healthy, you\u2019re living in it. And I want to change that!\u201d declared Gottfried. \u201cLast year, due to high deductibles, one third of American households who had health care coverage had someone in their family go without it, for financial reasons. And for two thirds of them, it was for a serious condition,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cHealthcare is the leading cause of bankruptcy in America.\u201d\n\nGottfried detailed how his New York Health would be less expensive, while including more coverage. \u201cToday, whether you\u2019re the multi-million dollar CEO of the company, or the lowest paid receptionist or janitor, the insurance company wants the same health care premium. If you\u2019re at the top of the income range, instead of it being 25 percent of your household income (NYS medium households), it is more likely to be one or two percent.\u201d The New York Health plan, Gottfried continued, \u201cis to be funded by assessments, progressively graduated based on payroll and non-payroll taxable income.\u201d He also noted that the costs will be brought further down by the elimination of insurance company administration costs, the costs of providers that have to hire a lot of people to deal with insurance companies, and insurance company profit. Gottfried surmised, \u201cThe reason the plan will work pretty well, is the same reason suburban schools work pretty well. People with wealth and influence will be using the system and they will make sure that the system works well. The rest of us will benefit.\u201d\n\nAn audience member asked, \u201cWasn\u2019t the Affordable Health Care Act supposed to solve all this?\u201d \u2014 to which Gottfried responded, \u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, while the marketplace is inducing the insurance companies to lower their premiums, they are both jacking up the deductible, the amount that you have to pay before the insurance company pays a nickel, and cutting back on what they spend, by having very limited provider networks with providers who are willing to work, at the minimal amounts that the insurance company is offering.\u201d\n\nSeveral in the group wanted to know how the plan would impact those now covered by NYS employee unions and those that now qualify for Medicare, but will have to continue to pay, if they have taxable income. Gottfried responded: \u201cAnything that is now covered by Medicaid, Medicare, by state insurance mandates or any benefits available to state public employees, plus anything the plan chooses to add, would be available to every New Yorker.\u201d He went on to state, \u201cThose covered by Medicare are going to have better coverage and spend less out of pocket than they now do. They\u2019ll have more choice of doctors, no co-pays, no deductibles, no out of network charges, and no premiums for supplemental policies. Long term coverage won\u2019t kick in until we devise a plan for that, but for everything else, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nIn adding yet another government agency to New York, State Committeewoman Francine Hasselkorn asked Gottfried \u201cWhat are the start-up costs and which entity would be created to do this?\u201d Gottfried said that the Health Department would administer it, noting, \u201cThe administration costs would be in the three percent range, maybe lower based on what traditional Medicare spends on administration. For start up costs, an awful lot of machinery is already up and running in the state, as it pays bills under the Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nDistrict Leader Sylvia DiPietro was very concerned about the possible fleeing of wealth and doctors. She warned, \u201cUnder this system we will have a flight of quality doctors from the state and will have lines around the block just to see an average doctor.\u201d DiPietro continued, by asking, \u201cHow do you tell a quality doctor that they\u2019ll get the same amount of money as a much less experienced doctor, and how do you stop them and the people that can afford it now from fleeing the state, when it\u2019s mandatory?\u201d Gottfried countered, \u201cToday, insurance companies pay doctors whatever they please. If doctors flee New York they will find themselves in the hands of insurance companies that will pay them what the insurance company wants to pay. If the doctors are out of network that will be zero.\u201d\n\nGottfried was the first to admit that the Canadian plan had its flaws, that it needed tweaking, and is open to suggestions for his plan. CRDC Executive Board member Carol Demech reflected on her years of living in Vancouver. She recounted a story of how she was told that she might have kidney cancer and then informed that she would have to wait three months for a kidney exam. She also spoke of an injured teenager who would have to wait a year for an MRI, and chose instead to go to Seattle.\n\nAnother member cited the extremely high cost of malpractice insurance for US doctors. Due to tort laws, Canadian doctors pay one tenth of the malpractice insurance of their USA counterparts. Gottfried responded that there are no tort reforms included in his bill.\n\nMost heartfelt was CRDC\u2019s Executive VP Judy Richheimer\u2019s conversation with a Canadian doctor concerning a Stage 4 cancer that her partner died from, here in New York. The doctor told her that in Canada they never see patients presenting at Stage 4, because the patients have been in the system too long. Richheimer concluded, \u201cIt is definitely cheaper and with better outcomes to treat someone when they\u2019re precancerous, or a little bit cancerous.\u201d\n\nWell past the meeting\u2019s cut-off time, the CRDC voted to endorse and promote Richard Gottfried\u2019s New York Health Bill (New York Health, A7860), then bundled up so as to not catch pneumonia, and went home.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "chelseanow.com", "description": "BY DONATHAN SALKALN \u00a0| \u00a0Life seems to revolve around insurance companies.
