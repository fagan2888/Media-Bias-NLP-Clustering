The ad campaign is estimated to cost between $6 million and $7 million.\n\nBut the federal website for individual policies, www.healthcare.gov, has been unable to allow many in New Mexico to obtain information on what coverage options they have since the ACA rolled out Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my understanding,\u201d NMIX interim CEO Mike Nu\u00f1ez told New Mexico Watchdog earlier this week. \u201cI know we\u2019ve tried, but (customers) haven\u2019t been able to get through.\u201d\n\nA reporter from New Mexico Watchdog has tried six times since Oct. 1 to compare individual coverage prices on the federal government\u2019s site, to no avail.\n\nOther states directing consumers to www.healthcare.gov have reported similar problems in the last 18 days. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said President Obama has instructed his team to \u201cwork 24/7\u201d to address the website problems.\n\nNew Mexico is one of 36 states that sends customers interested in individual Obamacare policies to the federal site. Next year, NMIX will start handling enrollment for individual policies. NMIX consumer advocate Dr. Deane Waldman said earlier this month he\u2019s \u201cvery hopeful and confident that a year from now \u2014 at least for New Mexicans \u2014 when (the NMIX runs things) that problem will no longer exist.\u201d\n\nWhile the www.healthcare.gov site sputters, NMIX officials say they\u2019re very happy with the roll out of the Small Business Health Options Program. Hunn told the Albuquerque Journal that as of Thursday, 672 small businesses have set up accounts on the exchange.\n\nContact Rob Nikolewski at rnikolewski@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @robnikolewski", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "New Mexico is holding off part of its advertising campaign for Obamacare due to the federal health exchange website's snafus.", "title": "What else?
