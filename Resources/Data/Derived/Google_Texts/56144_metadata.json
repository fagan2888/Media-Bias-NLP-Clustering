Moylan III and pilot Matthew Dietz, Wind Gap. Moylan won the party nod, but lost in the General Election to incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-17.\n\n\u201cYou also have to look at how strong the incumbent Democrat is and one of Mr. Cartwright\u2019s biggest problems is his record,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cHe\u2019s not well liked by many people because his record shows he is not aligned with this district.\u201d\n\nConnolly, 50, of Bethlehem Township, Northampton County, is one of two Republican candidates seeking the party nomination in Tuesday\u2019s primary election for the 17th Congressional District, which includes all of Schuylkill County and parts of Carbon, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Monroe and Northampton counties.\n\nThe other candidate is Northampton County Councilman Glenn Geissinger. The winner will face Cartwright, a Moosic attorney serving his second term.\n\n\u201cI think it really comes down to why I\u2019m running,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cI\u2019m running to solve the problem and return this country back to where it came from.\u201d\n\nThe former professional race car driver said the federal government has become too powerful. He said the line between the role of government and a free society has disappeared due to overregulation and unfunded mandates, leading the country to debt, unemployment and businesses going overseas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the role of the federal government,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cThe reason I want to be in federal government is because that\u2019s where things need to change.\u201d\n\nConnolly, a real estate investor who still does freelance work in the automobile racing business, said he wants to roll back federal regulations that are slowing economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe cost of compliance is too high, so what do businesses do? They go overseas,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cOur own rules are causing businesses to go overseas.\u201d\n\nObamacare is the prime example of the federal government overstepping its bounds, he said. Connolly would continue efforts to repeal the legislation that he said has structurally changed America by forcing businesses to buy a product.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Obamacare is that it tried to solve a problem created by more government with more government and it is not working,\u201d he said.\n\nConnolly said rolling back on some federal regulations while expanding energy sources will drive down expenses and promote business growth.\n\n\u201cI think coal is a very important energy source,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an abundance of energy in this district and I think to ignore it would be foolish. I am more than happy with the natural competition between energy sources. I am a big supporter of nuclear. If France can get 80 percent of their electricity from nuclear, why can\u2019t we? It has zero carbon footprint, and is completely reliable and controllable and inexpensive.\u201d\n\nConnolly also said the economy will benefit from rebuilding the U.S. military, which he said is at a pre-World War I level.\n\n\u201cThere is trickle down effect of rebuilding our military and all the industry and jobs it creates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also get a lot of great technology that spills into the private sector.\u201d\n\nNational security is being threatened by weak leadership, he said, and radical Islam needs to be eliminated.\n\n\u201cWe have a real problem in the world based on weak leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cOur friends don\u2019t trust us and our enemies don\u2019t fear us.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Connolly pledged to stand up and be vocal for his constituents and not \u201cgo along to get along.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about me being a congressman,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about me not watching my country going down hill and sitting idly by. I\u2019m not a complainer. I\u2019m a doer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Connolly aims to bring leadership to 17th District", "author": "By Mark Gilger Jr.", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Mark Gilger Jr.", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.2034611"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "Connolly aims to bring leadership to 17th District"}, "article_summary": "Connolly said rolling back on some federal regulations while expanding energy sources will drive down expenses and promote business growth.\n\u201cI think it really comes down to why I\u2019m running,\u201d Connolly said.\nConnolly previously ran for the Republican nomination in 2014 against Schuylkill County Coroner Dr. David J.
