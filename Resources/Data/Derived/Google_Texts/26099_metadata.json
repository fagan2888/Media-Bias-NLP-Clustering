The only place to do it was right in the middle of the bathroom. She was mortified.\n\nIt's an experience that she and her colleague, brand strategist Sascha Mayer, repeated again and again as both mothers traveled for work, passing through public spaces like airports and trade shows. It\u2019s one that many new moms continue to know well. \"Even though there\u2019s so much pressure in society to breast pump and do the right thing for the baby, there\u2019s not a lot of accommodations for it,\" says Mayer.\n\nThat\u2019s what the two are trying to change with their company, Mamava, which they co-own with their employers at Solidarity Design. They\u2019ve created \"lactation suites,\" or free-standing mobile pods that offer mothers a private, clean, and calming space to pump or nurse when at work, running errands, or traveling. Already, they\u2019ve installed about 10 prototype units around the country in several airports, school campuses, and even one at a Simon Properties shopping mall in Missouri. Over time, their goals are much larger: namely \"transforming the culture of breastfeeding, making it more optimistic, realistic, accommodating, and inviting to all mamas.\"\n\nThey are going into business at the right moment. The Affordable Care Act recently set a mandate that employers with more than 50 hourly employees set aside dedicated lactation spaces as needed (these can\u2019t just be a bathroom), which isn\u2019t always easy depending on the space. Beyond that, employers of salaried staff in many fields are increasingly focused on attracting and retaining more women\u2014and as a result, are thinking about workplace accommodations for mothers with a renewed sense of energy. Even designers are realizing this is a market that has been ignored for too long (MIT held a \"breast pump hackathon\" in September).\n\n\"The advantage of this solution is that you can put it right in the middle of anything. It\u2019s a private space,\" says Mayer.\n\nMamava aims to not just provide a generic space for pumping, but one that carefully considers the psychology and ease of the experience. Created in conjunction with designer David Jacks, it avoids the feel of a bathroom and, instead, smartly uses wipeable food prep-grade materials, which makes sense since babies are feeding inside. Wheels pop out so the unit can be moved to where it is needed, and there\u2019s enough space and seating inside for a mom\u2019s luggage or stroller and child. A table folds out for a breast pump, and there is an electrical outlet. The logo is meant to evoke \"happy breasts\" rather than a stereotypically demure woman that implies lactating is something to hide. Even its shape and soft lighting is supposed to evoke a \"Zen quality\" feel.\n\n\"Lactation and letdown happen when you relax, when you feel calm,\" notes Mayer.\n\nA single unit costs about $11,000, but Mamava is exploring an advertising-supported business model that would reduce the cost for facilities that host them. For example, the child\u2019s clothing company Zatano is sponsoring the location suite at Vermont\u2019s Burlington International Airport.\n\nSo far, the company has produced only hand-built prototype units that take up to eight weeks to deliver, but the founders hopes to scale-up manufacturing over time. They also want to design a smaller version that's suitable for offices or workplaces where the traffic flow is slower than in a shopping mall or airport.\n\nOne barrier is that while the end users are moms, the direct customers tend to be 50-year-old male facilities managers and operations types. Using social media and an iPhone locater app, Mamava hopes to build a grassroots strategy of \"lactivist\" moms who advocate for feeding and pumping facilities.\n\nIndeed, more designers and architects are starting to become interested in the issue. But, according to Mayer and Dodson, no other company offers an easily portable standalone unit. What\u2019s more, designers who lack expertise might simply get it wrong. For example, Mayer says there\u2019s a nursing mothers lounge at the Minneapolis airport, but the plush seats are bad for spills and the lack of privacy and electrical outlets aren\u2019t going to help mothers who pump. Mamava\u2019s suites, on the other hand, were designed with breast pumps in mind, where a mother must be more exposed.\n\n\"This is conceived around pumping, but it\u2019s also a space that\u2019s comfortable to go nurse a baby,\" Dodson is careful to note. \"It wasn\u2019t about wanting to put nursing in a closet.\"", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "For Pumping And Nursing Mothers, A Room Of Their Own", "image": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2014/11/3038076-poster-p-1-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room-of-their-own.jpg", "description": "Mamava's mobile lactation suites for public spaces like airports, shopping malls, and offices mean that mothers don't have to breastfeed in the..."}, "description": "Mamava's mobile lactation suites for public spaces like airports, shopping malls, and offices mean that mothers don't have to breastfeed in the...", "og": {"site_name": "Co.Exist", "description": "Mamava's mobile lactation suites for public spaces like airports, shopping malls, and offices mean that mothers don't have to breastfeed in the...", "title": "For Pumping And Nursing Mothers, A Room Of Their Own", "url": "http://www.fastcoexist.com/3038076/for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room-of-their-own", "image": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2014/11/3038076-poster-p-1-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room-of-their-own.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "fastcoexist.com", "description": "Mamava's mobile lactation suites for public spaces like airports, shopping malls, and offices mean that mothers don't have to breastfeed in the...", "title": "For Pumping And Nursing Mothers, A Room Of Their Own", "url": "http://www.fastcoexist.com/3038076/for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room-of-their-own", "image": "http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2014/11/3038076-poster-p-1-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room-of-their-own.jpg", "creator": "@jessleber", "site": "@FastCoExist", "image8": "http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-11-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room.jpg", "image5": "http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-7-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room.jpg", "image3": "http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-5-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room.jpg", "image2": "http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-4-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room.jpg", "image1": "http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-3-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room.jpg", "image0": "http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-1-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room-of-their-own.jpg", "image7": "http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-9-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room.jpg", "image6": "http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-8-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room.jpg", "card": "gallery", "image4": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/slideshow_large/slideshow/2014/11/3038076-slide-s-6-for-pumping-and-nursing-mothers-a-room.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000062710915, "pages": 227383110655483, "app_id": 180431352040909}, "keywords": "christine dodson,sascha mayer,mamava,iphone,mit,advertising-supported business model,social media,wipeable food prep-grade materials,manufacturing,grassroots strategy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FastCoExist", "section": "Co.Exist", "published_time": "2014-11-10T13:15:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-11-10T16:25:35.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb201\"", "article_summary": "Even designers are realizing this is a market that has been ignored for too long (MIT held a \"breast pump hackathon\" in September).\nFor example, Mayer says there\u2019s a nursing mothers lounge at the Minneapolis airport, but the plush seats are bad for spills and the lack of privacy and electrical outlets aren\u2019t going to help mothers who pump.\nA table folds out for a breast pump, and there is an electrical outlet.\nMamava aims to not just provide a generic space for pumping, but one that carefully considers the psychology and ease of the experience.\n\"This is conceived around pumping, but it\u2019s also a space that\u2019s comfortable to go nurse a baby,\" Dodson is careful to note."}
