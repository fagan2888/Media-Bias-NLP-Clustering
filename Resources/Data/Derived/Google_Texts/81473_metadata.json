That, along with filibuster reform, was a top story on \"Face the Nation,\" \"Fox News Sunday\" and \"This Week.\"\n\nIn an interview with Congressman Kevin McCarthy, CBS News' Bob Schieffer asked if the White House strived to reach an accord in an attempt to distract attention from the botched Obamacare rollout.\n\n\"I was on airplanes this weekend, and more than one person I was talking to about this whole deal pending with Iran said, \u2018This might be a diversionary tactic by an administration desperately looking for good news,'\" Schieffer said. \u201cWould you put it in that category yet?\"\n\nSpeaking on \"This Week,\" Bill Kristol called the deal \"terrible,\" saying that it would only temporarily pause Iran's work on the country's nuclear program.\n\nOther commentators were more optimistic. ABC News global affairs anchor Christiane Amanpour said that Iranian journalists cheered the news. \"Intelligence people here and in Britain and others, who are very aware of what's going on, have told me this interim deal is a good deal,\" she added. \"It is significant freezes and suspension by Iran for very modest, temporary sanction relief.\"\n\nFox News' Juan Williams disagreed with his fellow panelists when he said just holding talks with Iran was a \"tremendous breakthrough\" for the U.S. and its allies nearby.\n\nWATCH: Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.\n\nMore: Iran Nuclear Deal", "article_metadata": {"description": "News of the United States reaching a nuclear deal with Iran dominated political talk shows on Sunday morning. \n\nThe", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-11-25 15:16:03 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "News of the United States reaching a nuclear deal with Iran dominated political talk shows on Sunday morning. \n\nThe", "title": "Sunday Morning Political Shows Break Down Iran Nuclear Deal", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/24/iran-nuclear-deal-sunday-morning-shows_n_4333918.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1480076/images/o-CHRISTIANE-AMANPOUR-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1480076/images/o-CHRISTIANE-AMANPOUR-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Sunday Morning Political Shows Break Down Iran Nuclear Deal", "description": "News of the United States reaching a nuclear deal with Iran dominated political talk shows on Sunday morning. \n\nThe", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostMedia"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-24 15:16:03 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4333918", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "iran nuclear deal,sunday shows iran nuclear deal,sunday shows iran,sunday iran nuclear deal", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "iran nuclear deal,sunday shows iran nuclear deal,sunday shows iran,sunday iran nuclear deal", "published_time": "2013-11-24 15:16:03 -0500", "modified_time": "2013-11-25 07:15:21 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde751\"", "article_summary": "More: Iran Nuclear Deal\nABC NewsNews of the United States reaching a nuclear deal with Iran dominated political talk shows on Sunday morning.\n\"Intelligence people here and in Britain and others, who are very aware of what's going on, have told me this interim deal is a good deal,\" she added.\nThat, along with filibuster reform, was a top story on \"Face the Nation,\" \"Fox News Sunday\" and \"This Week.\"\nSpeaking on \"This Week,\" Bill Kristol called the deal \"terrible,\" saying that it would only temporarily pause Iran's work on the country's nuclear program."}
