KNOXVILLE (WATE) – Tennessee’s annual report card has been released.

State Collaborative on Reforming Education, or SCORE, released its annual State of Education in Tennessee report on Friday.

The report states that Tennessee became the fastest improving state in the nation in fourth and eighth grade math and reading on the National Assessment for Educational Progress in 2013, coming in behind only the District of Columbia.

In 2013, 4th graders in Tennessee were ranked 37th for improvement in math, up from 46th in 2011. That was due to a ten percent increase in math proficiency, according to the report.

The average composite ACT score also improved to a 19.8 from a 19.5 in 2014, according to the report.

On a scale of 1-5, Knox County is ranked 1, or least effective, in gains in literacy achievement for the 2013-2014 school year.

While the gains were low in literature, that doesn’t mean Knox County is necessarily falling behind in language arts studies. In fact, the school system is actually testing above average in the subject.

Knox County received a 70 percentile score on the EOC English II section, which measures the percentage of 9-12th grade students within the district who scored proficient or advanced on the state’s test. The average score for the test in Tennessee is 63 percent proficiency.

When it comes to gains in math achievement, Knox County is on the polar opposite of the spectrum with a 5, or a most improved ranking.

For that test, Knox County scores a 61 percentile, one percent shy of the state average of 62 percent.

The report also finds that Knox County spends about $9,342 per student. Composite ACT scores were at 20.4 percent, more than half a point higher than the state average.
