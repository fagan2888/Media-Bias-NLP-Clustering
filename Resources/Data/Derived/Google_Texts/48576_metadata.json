He exudes happy energy. Everything from his near-full sleeves of tattoos to his 5 o\u2019clock shadow to his hipster-meets-preppy wardrobe quietly affirms a comfortable confidence.\n\nResponding to an interview request by saying he\u2019s \u201cexcited to hang out,\u201d and signing off on emails with \u201cYou Rock, Kurtis,\u201d Parks is digitally and interpersonally exactly as you would want and expect him\u2014as the worship director of the DC-based National Community Church, a seven campus, Christian interdenominational church with a median parishioner age of 28\u2014to be.\n\nParks\u2019 Outreach to Millennials\n\nHis dark undercut stays slicked to one side, a stray hair rarely breaking rank in the spring breeze, as we discuss things like National Community Church\u2019s \u201ccore tenets,\u201d whether or not the church is a metaphorical thermostat or thermometer (hint: they want to \u201cset the temperature\u201d instead of taking it), and why he hates the word \u201creligious\u201d (\u201cI automatically think of rules and regulations and stuff like that.\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s this ability to candidly share private experiences and beliefs without coming across as preachy or polarizing that stands out most when you meet him. It also explains his knack for connecting with D.C.\u2019s youth.\n\n\u201cThe environment and the message of the pastors at NCC is very easy to relate to,\u201d says Patrick Shaffer, a 22-year-old originally from Tampa, Fla. While Shaffer grew up Methodist, he began attending nondenominational services in college, and has been attending National Community Church for four months.\n\n\u201cI actually attended NCC my very first Sunday in D.C.,\u201d says Kate Farrar, a 23-year-old Nashville native raised by an Episcopalian mother and Methodist father. Asked what National Community Church does differently, she responds that they \u201ccapture contemporary church elements\u201d and \u201cstay grounded,\u201d adding that for her, music is the way she turns her heart and mind to God.\n\nTalk to religious experts and they\u2019ll acknowledge the often purported myth that America\u2019s youth aren\u2019t participating in religious life\u2014and offer another take.\n\n\u201cYoung people attend [service] less often in late teen years and through college,\u201d says Byron L. Johnson, director of the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University.\n\nBut \u201cthe vast majority will marry, have children, and return to church as young adults,\u201d he adds. \u201cVibrant and growing churches, almost always evangelical, tend to connect with all age groups.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from The Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2014 Index of Culture and Opportunity, across 40 years, weekly church attendance has declined from around 40 percent in 1972 to 30 percent in 2012.\n\nAccording to a recent Pew Research center survey, 71 percent of Americans identify as Christian today, a near eight-percentage-point drop since 2007. At the same time, there has been a seven-percentage-point increase in the number of Americans who do not identify with one religion.\n\nSitting with Parks over coffee, his messages of finding the purpose and worth in your life, being real, and working to change the world for the better don\u2019t ring religious, necessarily.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that his rock-star ambitions and natural charisma have been tamed into this relatable, curated, self-aware, and humble presentation of the self as worship director and virtual human extension of National Community Church. The one-time American Idol hopeful is a ways away from his reality TV days.\n\nParks\u2019 Spiritual Journey\n\nWhile Parks insists he never envisioned himself on staff at a church, he was arguably born for the job\u2014to parents who found themselves pregnant in high school and urged by peers to get an abortion. They decided, he says with a sizeable smile, against it.\n\nHe grew up both a military brat and a \u201cPK\u201d (\u201cPastor\u2019s Kid\u201d). As a child, he moved with his family from Pennsylvania to the U.K., living abroad for five years before returning to the States. The family settled in New Mexico and later Florida as they followed various Air Force assignments over the course of 10 years. His father eventually traded in military life for the ministry.\n\n\u201cMy dad knew he was going to plan a church, and he\u2019s like, \u2018I want you to lead music,\u2019\u201d Parks says. His father had heard him singing around the house and saw a gift. Parks was 11.\n\nHe began piano lessons and, by age 15, was leading weekly worship for his father\u2019s 20 or so parishioners. His father later left the ministry when they again relocated to Virginia, but Parks\u2019 time as a young worship leader left a mark.\n\n\u201cI developed this passion and love for music and I saw, for whatever reason, that music is a universal language,\u201d Parks says. \u201cA band like the Beatles can be number one in Japan, and they\u2019re not even singing Japanese \u2026 Taylor Swift can release an album and the whole world knows about it \u2026 music transcends everything.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d take that outlook throughout his childhood, to his time as a finance major at Virginia Tech (\u201cI heard that Mick Jagger was a finance major, so I was like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s not a bad choice\u2019\u201d), to his 2005 stint on American Idol alongside the likes of Carrie Underwood, to years spent touring with his band The Season, and ultimately, to National Community Church .\n\nComeback Kid\n\nAfter he was axed on Idol\u2014an opportunity he says he thought \u201cwas it\u201d\u2014he struggled to regain his footing. He got a job as a real estate broker in Roanoke, Va., and lived for the weekends he spent playing gigs with his band. In his spare time, he sent demo albums to producers.\n\nParks got a call from one based in Nashville and, with the support of his wife Sarah, packed up the little apartment they had signed a lease on only a week before. What was supposed to be a few months in Nashville turned into four years of recording, touring and, later, church work.\n\nIn 2007, the band released a song named \u201cForever Changed\u201d that Parks wrote about the tragic shooting at his alma mater. It reached the number one spot on radio stations nationwide, was played in the background of all CNN coverage of Virginia Tech, and led to calls from producers at \u201cOprah\u201d and \u201cFox News.\u201d\n\nStill, despite this small taste of industry success, Parks could feel life on the road, traveling in a 1997 Ford Econoline Van, eating PB&Js, and playing the same venues, growing tedious and \u201cold.\u201d Around that time, he got a call from his church in Nashville, asking him to fill in for their head of worship for the weekend. It led to a two-year-long relationship.\n\n\u201cThe pastor (of that church) is the legendary song writer in Christian music, Danny Chambers, and he just mentored me,\u201d Parks says. \u201cI just began to step back into the church that I kind of was doing as a teenager, and I fell back into it.\u201d\n\nThrough that connection, Parks came to know Steph Hasler, the former worship director at National Community Church. She\u2019d eventually recruit Parks to join her team before leaving the Washington area to manage National Community Church\u2019s coffee house in Berlin (the church believes they need to be \u201cin the marketplace\u201d and own tens of millions of dollars of D.C. real estate as well as another coffee house on Capitol Hill named Ebenezer\u2019s), leaving an opening for worship director.\n\nParks and National Community Church\n\nParks describes his appointment at National Community Church as the work of a slightly exasperated deity.\n\n\u201cDude, we call them divine appointments, right?\u201d he says. \u201cGod\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m setting this up, this up, this up,\u2019 so that you can just be like, \u2018Duh!\u2019 and the light bulb can finally come on.\u201d\n\nParks felt he had big shoes to fill\u2014perhaps because National Community Church, sometimes known as \u201cTheater Church,\u201d is a monster machine. At the same time, he was adjusting to life as a new father to daughter Norah, now two.\n\nFounded by 43-year-old celebrity pastor Mark Batterson in a rundown movie theater in D.C.\u2019s Union Station in 1996, National Community Church attracted almost 4,500 mostly young parishioners to its 2014 Easter services spread across its seven campuses, according to the 2015 Annual Ministry Report.\n\nBatterson, known for embracing technology ahead of his peers, has nearly 100,000 followers on Twitter, preaches in jeans, and manages a staff of over 50. The church\u2019s website, TheaterChurch.com, had over 47 million page views in 2014.\n\nThe church has come to be known as one that attracts not necessarily senators or business leaders, but hill staffers, law clerks, interns and recent transplants. Sixty-nine percent of parishioners have been attending for less than three years, and two-thirds are single.\n\nAlexas Legas, a 23-year-old originally from Virginia, appreciates the welcoming element of the church: \u201cNCC reaches out to those who are new to D.C. There\u2019s a feeling of \u2018you are in the right place.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor his part, Parks wrote 21 new songs last year for National Community Church, released an album with Christian record label Integrity, led a mission trip to Guatemala (the church does close to 30 missions a year), wrote a to-be-released book, produced albums from his in-house studio and licensed a song to music video game \u201cDance Dance Revolution.\u201d\n\nParks easily rattles off more work that needs to be done, such as ending Africa\u2019s clean water crisis and combating sex trafficking in Phoenix.\n\nSocial Media and Authenticity\n\nIn his music and worship, Parks focuses heavily on \u201cauthenticity,\u201d striving to lead an honest life on and off stage and encouraging National Community Church\u2019s members, many who have grown up with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to do the same.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had a time in the world where people have been more connected through social media, through Internet, through causes,\u201d he muses.\n\n\u201cBut through that, we\u2019ve lost authenticity. I can know everything about you through Facebook, but I don\u2019t know you. You can have 50,000 followers on Twitter and that\u2019s awesome \u2026 but at the end of the day, who do you know?\u201d\n\nParks also aims to remedy preconceived ideas about the church, perhaps set in parishioners\u2019 minds by negative experiences in their past, through his contribution to weekly service and conversation.\n\n\u201cWhen I just explain who Jesus is, and I talk to people about what He said and what He did and what He\u2019s done in my life \u2026 that\u2019s my conviction,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to reach people that have a bad bent towards church by doing what they\u2019ve always known the church to do.\u201d\n\nKurtis Parks is the Worship Director at the Washington, D.C.-based National Community Church, as well as a singer/songwriter, music producer, and author.
