Credit: John Arnold\n\nErin Stopani couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of a good thing when she finished the certified nurse midwifery program in the University of New Mexico College of Nursing last May.\n\n\u201cI graduated on Friday and started school again on Monday for the family nurse practitioner program,\u201d Stopani says matter-of-factly. When she graduates next spring she will have a master\u2019s of nursing as a nurse midwife and a post-master\u2019s certificate as a family nurse practitioner \u2013 and a job waiting for her at Presbyterian Healthcare.\n\nThe extensive clinical experience she has gained in her training has given her a first-rate preparation for the demands of the workplace, Stopani believes. \u201cThat was one of the main reasons I chose UNM,\u201d she says. \u201cThe amount of clinical experience was above what most other programs expected. I really think that is the best way to learn.\u201d\n\nStopani\u2019s experience is typical for many graduates from UNM\u2019s trio of advanced practice registered nurse programs. Soon, thanks to an infusion of new state funding, more students will have an opportunity to pursue this career track.\n\nIn a bid to boost the ranks of primary care providers in the state, Gov. Susana Martinez and the 2014 New Mexico Legislature included a nearly $1.7 million recurring appropriation to grow the total number enrolling in UNM\u2019s pediatric nurse practitioner, family nurse practitioner and certified nurse midwife programs from 24 to 40.\n\nWhile the enrollment deadline for the certified nurse midwife program has passed, prospective students have until Nov. 1 to apply for the pediatric and family nurse practitioner tracks. The first expanded classes will start in the Summer 2015 semester next spring and graduate in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying really hard to get the word out,\u201d says Carolyn Montoya, PhD, a certified pediatric nurse practitioner, associate professor and interim director of the College of Nursing practice team. \u201cThe Legislature is making a commitment. I am trying to be sure that we spend this money appropriately and we have sufficient students.\u201d\n\nThe three APRN programs each begin with online courses in pathophysiology, research, nursing theory and health policy, Montoya says. Then the training shifts to clinical courses on block schedules in which students alternate between the classroom and hands-on training in clinics.\n\n\u201cWe send students all over the state,\u201d Montoya says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you in a class on Monday and expect you to do a three-hour drive to Las Cruces to do your clinical. If you are from a rural community, we will try as much as possible to place you for your clinical experience in your hometown.\u201d\n\nThe trio of programs are a good fit for RNs looking to expand their skillset and greater autonomy in their practice, Montoya says, pointing out that New Mexico is one of 16 states in which nurse practitioners and certified midwives practice independently and with their own prescriptive authority.\n\n\u201cOne of our selling points is that we\u2019re not a massive program,\u201d Montoya says. \u201cThere are some that take a hundred or more students. We don\u2019t do that. Our students receive individualized faculty instruction.\u201d\n\nThe fact that 100 percent of the students who have graduated from the program in the past five years have passed their certification exams is another plus, she says. Students also benefit from close supervision from faculty and preceptors while getting their clinical training, she says.\n\nStopani, a Chapparal, N.M., native who started out as a licensed midwife before earning her BSN at Texas Tech University, had more than 800 patient interactions in the certified nurse midwifery program. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that we have preceptors who share their clientele with us,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re so invested in our learning that they\u2019re willing to share those experiences.\u201d\n\nKendall Brown, who earned his BSN at UNM, is enrolled in the family nurse practitioner program. A Gallup, N.M., native who is also a member of the Navajo Nation, Brown wants to make primary care available where it\u2019s most needed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not that many health care providers out there,\u201d says Brown, who hopes to work for the Indian Health Service after he graduates. The need is great: Many Native American patients cope with conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety, he says.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m learning in school is how to manage these illnesses,\u201d he says, adding that the extensive classroom and clinical training he\u2019s received so far has been \u201cworth it,\u201d because it has improved his skills as an RN.\n\nDiana Sanchez-Gallegos, who earned her undergraduate, master\u2019s in nursing and post-master\u2019s certificate from UNM, has worked at Presbyterian\u2019s family practice in Belen, N.M., for 21 years. Board-certified as both a family nurse practitioner and a pediatric nurse practitioner, she remembers well the bumpy transition between RN and nurse practitioner.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, you\u2019re in a role where you\u2019re making all the decisions and you\u2019re writing them down,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole different ballgame when you\u2019re signing your name to those orders. It\u2019s a real responsibility, a real role change.\u201d\n\nSanchez-Gallegos says that these days she learns a lot from serving as a preceptor to young APRN students from UNM. \u201cYou sometimes get stuck in your old ways,\u201d she says. \u201cThey get a student who says, \u2018Here\u2019s a new way to do it, and there\u2019s evidence for it.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s \u201cexcited\u201d to hear about the expanded APRN program, because it will help improve access to care. \u201cOverall, we can\u2019t meet the demands right now,\u201d Sanchez-Gallegos says, adding that the extension of health insurance and Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act means that increasing numbers of people will be seeking health care.\n\nCarolyn Montoya, who continues to treat pediatric patients in addition to meeting her busy administrative responsibilities in the College of Nursing, says becoming a nurse practitioner \u201cis the best decision I ever made.\u201d\n\nShe hopes that as more students graduate from the APRN program many of them will choose to remain in New Mexico to practice in rural and underserved communities, where the need is the greatest.\n\nIn small towns, she says, practitioners get to know their patients outside of the clinic. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unique relationship,\u201d she says, \u201cvery different from an urban setting.\u201d\n\nBut for Montoya and others, the work is its own reward. \u201cMy mind is engaged 110 percent when I\u2019m in clinical,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve had a tough day here, I go and see my little babies. You are totally engaged in that encounter, and it\u2019s challenging and satisfying.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "UNM Health Sciences Center", "description": "In a bid to boost the ranks of primary care providers in the state, Gov.
