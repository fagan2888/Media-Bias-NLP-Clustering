As part of the Affordable Care Act, most U.S. citizens were required to have health insurance beginning in 2014. Since the passage of the ACA five years ago, about 16.4 million uninsured people have gained health coverage. Yet, approximately 30 million Americans remain uninsured. \u201cAs a primary health provider in the Pee Dee Region, our goal is to help educate residents in an easy-to-understand way, as well as assist those who haven\u2019t yet signed up for health insurance or Medicaid, if qualified,\u201d said Darcy Craven, CEO of Carolinas Hospital System. \u201cDuring the next few months, we\u2019ll be out in the community and meeting one-on-one to help these individuals find affordable coverage.\u201d\n\nHealth Plans on Health Insurance Marketplaces\n\nThe Health Insurance Marketplace provides U.S. citizens access to affordable health insurance coverage. Depending on household income, some individuals may qualify for government financial assistance\u2013 or subsidies \u2013 towards the cost of the premium and other financial obligations like co-pays or deductibles. All health plans on the Marketplace must offer a comprehensive set of benefits, and coverage cannot be denied for individuals with a pre-existing health condition. Some of the health benefits include free preventive care and wellness services, doctor visits, prescription drugs, hospital and emergency department care, lab services, pediatric services \u2013 and more. The penalty fee for not having insurance has increased this year. If you can afford health insurance coverage in 2016, but don\u2019t sign up, you may have to pay a penalty ($695 per adult, $347.50 per child \u2013 up to $2,085/family or 2.5% of family income, whichever is higher). You will have to pay the fee on the federal income tax return you file. And, without insurance, you will be financially responsible for all of your medical costs.\u201cThis is where Carolinas Hospital System can assist,\u201d said Craven. \u201cWith many people not having access to a computer or having difficulty maneuvering on the government website, our application counselors can help individuals and their families evaluate the health plan options and determine if they are eligible for Medicaid or other financial assistance. We\u2019ll also help with re-enrollment.\n\nMedicaid\n\nMedicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. \u201cWhile South Carolina has not expanded Medicaid, government subsidies to help citizens obtain coverage are available, depending on income and other qualifications,\u201d explained Craven. \u201cWe can help screen these individuals and if they qualify, we can enroll them at any time, with health coverage beginning immediately.\u201d Though a major function of www.healthcare.gov is assessing whether individuals and families qualify for financial assistance to lower the cost of health insurance, Carolinas Hospital System\u2019s application counselors can perform the same analysis and help with enrollment and re-enrollment. To make an appointment to meet with an application counselor, call 843-674-4564. \u201cCarolinas Hospital System is committed to improving the health of the communities we serve by helping residents gain access to healthcare services,\u201d said Craven.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florence, SC - \u00a0Beginning November 1, Carolinas Hospital System will again help area residents learn about and enroll in health insurance options on the Health Insurance Marketplace.\u00a0As part of the Affordable Care Act, most U.S. citizens were required to have health insurance beginning in 2014.
