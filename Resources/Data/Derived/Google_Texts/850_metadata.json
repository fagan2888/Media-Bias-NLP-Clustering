Locally we have to continue the effort to rebuild from Sandy,\u201d said Pallone.\n\nWilkinson, a 49-year old attorney originally of Detroit now living in Old Bridge, believes government activism has created too large a national debt. He wants to reduce government spending by cutting back on subsidies for the energy, agricultural, and transportation industries.\n\nHe\u2019d liked to see the Affordable Care Act repealed and amended to eliminate all government requirements from health insurance packages.\n\nA point Pallone said would return the country back to the \u201cwild west days,\u201d when insurance companies were free to discriminate on who they sold their policies to or what coverage was provided.\n\n\u201cWhat we were trying to do with the Affordable Care Act was to make sure you not only got insurance but that you got insurance with a good benefit package,\u201d said Pallone.\n\nTo fix the troubled Social Security benefits, Wilkinson suggested raising the retirement age and having the private sector pick up more of the responsibility for the care of the seniors.\n\n\u201cMy idea for mitigating the effect of that would be [to] encourage businesses to to hire elderly people. That way the private sector is taking care of the elderly rather than the public sector. That will reduce the expenditures for social security and medicare,\u201d said Wilkinson.\n\nLocally Wilkinson, whose resume includes stints as a public school teacher, said education is a concern of his. He\u2019s a proponent of alternative education and smaller classroom pupil sizes as a resolution to problems he sees in some public schools.\n\n\u201cThe state of the schools in places like Asbury Park and New Brunswick is disconcerting,\u201d he said.\n\nDan Radel: 732-643-4072; dradel@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1vS976b", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Congressman Frank Pallone is a strong believer in activist government, his opponent is not", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Congressman Frank Pallone is a strong believer in activist government, his opponent is not", "title": "Pallone, Wilkinson differ on government role", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/2014/10/08/pallone-wilkinson-differ-government-role/16951275/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congressman Frank Pallone is a strong believer in activist government, his opponent is not", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/22a6b702a66a77d205bff1ad220d51dbf5b7453c/c=0-200-1000-1200&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/10/08/wilkinson.jpg", "title": "Pallone, Wilkinson differ on government role", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Anthony Wilkinson (Photo: Staff Photographer/James J.
