A third car was involved in the crash, though no one inside of it was injured.\n\nAfter the crash, Kirkland fled the scene on foot and was later arrested at his Lakewood apartment. He was then taken to a hospital where he was treated for minor injuries before being booked into jail.\n\n\u201cTo get this news was overwhelming beyond what you would expect as a parent,\u201d Jordan\u2019s father, Jamie Sprouse, told 7News at a May vigil for the teen that was attended by about 100 people.\n\nThe teen\u2019s mother posted on his Facebook page in November asking to keep Sprouse\u2019s memory alive and pleading with people to stop drinking and driving.\n\n\u201cIt is not uncommon for young adults to see themselves as invincible,\u201d she wrote. \u201cGuess what? You\u2019re NOT! Drinking and driving kills!\u201d\n\nTwo blue signs memorialize the spot where Sprouse\u2019s car was hit that say \u201cPLEASE DRIVE SAFELY\u201d and \u201cIN MEMORY OF JORDAN SPROUSE.\u201d\n\nKirkland, who had a prior criminal record, is set to be sentenced on Jan. 27. He faces possible prison sentences of 4-12 years on each of the most serious counts.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jeffco DA: Man pleads guilty in fatal Wheat Ridge hit-and-run", "title": "Jeffco DA: Man pleads guilty in fatal Wheat Ridge hit-and-run", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/02/jeffco-da-man-pleads-guilty-in-fatal-wheat-ridge-hit-and-run/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__jordan-sprouse-vigilp1.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__jordan-sprouse-vigilp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T11:54:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:21:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After the crash, Kirkland fled the scene on foot and was later arrested at his Lakewood apartment.\n\u201cHe was moving at a very, very high rate of speed,\u201d police told The Denver Post after the crash.\nThe teen\u2019s mother posted on his Facebook page in November asking to keep Sprouse\u2019s memory alive and pleading with people to stop drinking and driving.\nA man pleaded guilty in Jefferson County court on Tuesday to driving under the influence of alcohol in a May 2014 hit-and-run in Wheat Ridge that left an 18-year-old dead.\n\u201cTo get this news was overwhelming beyond what you would expect as a parent,\u201d Jordan\u2019s father, Jamie Sprouse, told 7News at a May vigil for the teen that was attended by about 100 people."}
