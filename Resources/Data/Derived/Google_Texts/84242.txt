Former Democratic pollster Pat Caddell blasted the Republican Party for not making the president’s planned executive amnesty a national issue on Friday’s “Your World with Neil Cavuto” on the Fox News Channel.

“The Republican Party, they’re not called the stupid party for nothing. These people are able to, are willing to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory given the opportunity,” he stated.

“It’s amazing to me. I’ve never seen a party that doesn’t grab opportunities thrown at it like this,” he declared. And “they [Republicans] should be taking this issue and making it a national referendum issue against every Democrat, and for every Republican in the country.”

He speculated that Republicans have not made executive amnesty an issue because “they have a lot of donors, and a lot of their lobbyists telling them they want this. The Chamber of Commerce wants open borders, the Wall Street Journal wants open borders.”

Caddell slammed Republicans for not making executive amnesty a main issue in 2014, arguing, “these Republicans don’t seem to understand that the country is in a massive shift. Huge majorities saying the president doesn’t have the authority to do this, he shouldn’t do it without the Congress, and they should challenge it, even in New York.” And “holding the ball is the worse strategy, it is a disaster. The Republicans lost the Senate that they should have won in 2000 and 2012, because they refused to quote ‘be controversial about anything.’”
