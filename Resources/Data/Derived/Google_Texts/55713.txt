A new poll has found that a majority of those who describe themselves as “solidly liberal” don’t care much for honor, duty, or America, and nearly half think of themselves as atypical citizens.

The Pew Research Center’s “Beyond Red vs. Blue” survey, released Thursday, sorted respondents into groups that were defined by “attitudes and values” as much as ideological labels. The poll included “Solid Liberals,” who were described as having “liberal attitudes across almost every realm.” And boy, are they not the Lee Greenwood type or what?

Only 40 percent of the group said they “often feel proud to be [an] American,” far less than any of the other six groups surveyed and 16 percentage points less than the average. Likewise, only 40 percent said honor and duty were their core values.

A shade over half, 51 percent, said they thought of themselves as typical Americans. What a cursed thing to be.

Between 66 and 75 percent of the other six groups, on the other hand — which were as disparate as the “Next Generation Left” and “Steadfast Conservatives” — said they viewed themselves as typical.

Other categories of respondents included an up-and-coming faction of the Right, “Young Outsiders,” defined as conservative on “government” issues, but not social ones. For the most part, they gave common Americanism the thumbs-up.

“Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political Typology” is the second part of a series from Pew studying political polarization. The results were based on a national survey of more than 10,000 adults nationwide, conducted between January 23 and March 16.

Pew’s previous typology study, released in May 2011, found that three of every four “Solid Liberals” believe the government is “often better than people give it credit for” — which if the IRS, the VA, the EPA, the NSA, the DOJ, the GSA, Obamacare, “Dude, this was like two years ago,” and the “bear with cabin fever” are any indication, is spot-on.
