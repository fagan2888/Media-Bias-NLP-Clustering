So to attack her, the liberal website Slate included only part of a quote and ignored the context, attempting to paint Fiorina as an anti-vaccine nut.\n\nThe Slate article begins with an inflammatory headline, \u201cCarly Fiorina Comes Out in Favor of Kids Getting Measles,\u201d something that Fiorina most certainly did not say.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThen, the first paragraph of the article begins by saying that at a town hall in Iowa, Fiorina \u201cstated that all Americans should have the right to contract diseases from unvaccinated children,\u201d again, something that Fiorina most certainly did not say.\n\nWhat actually happened was that a mother asked Fiorina about objecting to vaccines based on religious reasons. Fiorina\u2019s response:\n\nWhen in doubt, it is always the parent\u2019s choice. When you have highly communicable diseases where you have a vaccine that\u2019s proven, like measles or mumps, then I think a parent can make that choice, but then I think a school district is well within their rights to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, your child cannot then attend public school.\u201d So a parent has to make that trade-off.\n\nSlate only published the first sentence and part of the second, and added a comment that Fiorina\u2019s comment \u201cmean[t] that all parents should decide for themselves if their unvaccinated child should have the opportunity to transmit a disease to an infant, elderly person, or otherwise immunosuppressed person,\u201d which, again, Fiorina most certainly did not say.\n\nThe article includes several more references to Fiorina wanting children to be \u201cfree to spread diseases throughout their community\u201d (which, for the millionth time, Fiorina most certainly did not say). Near the end of the article, there is a begrudgingly added update, noting that \u201cFiorina\u2019s campaign has asked us to include the rest of the quotation,\u201d and then a few more sentences of accusations of things that Fiorina most certainly did not say.\n\nOur source in the Fiorina campaign said that Slate was originally resistant to updating the article and took some convincing. Heaven forbid a presidential candidate prefer to be quoted accurately and not have sentences chopped in half.\n\nFiorina has addressed the issue of vaccinations before, and is certainly not in the \u201canti-vaccine\u201d or \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d camp. Instead, she has pointed to the laws that have been on the books for years. All fifty states have some sort of immunization requirements for children to attend public schools. All of the states include exemptions for qualified medical reasons, almost all include exemptions for religious reasons, and eighteen allow certain philosophical or personal belief reasons.\n\nMediate noticed the controversy, and labeled Slate\u2019s article one example of the media\u2019s \u201cdishonest attack\u201d on Fiorina\u2019s vaccine position:\n\nTaken in context, Fiorina\u2019s statement ought to be uncontroversial. In fact, her stance pretty well sums up the state of vaccine law in all 50 states, where vaccines are not mandatory for all children, but mandatory before they are allowed to attend public school (and private schools and preschools, depending on the state).\n\nRecognizing what the law says, that it allows exemptions to immunization requirements in specific circumstances, is not the same thing as being an anti-vaxxer. Interpreting Fiorina\u2019s quote to support an anti-vaxxer position requires doing what Slate did, adding a lot of extra commentary that Fiorina most certainly did not say.\n\nOn Thursday, a Super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton attacked Fiorina with a photoshopped image of her with glowing red demon eyes. Then, on Friday, a number of liberal groups and media outlets were linking to the Slate story.\n\nSomeone clearly thinks Carly Fiorina is a threat.\n\nFollow Sarah Rumpf on Twitter: @rumpfshaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The article has an inflammatory headline, \"Carly Fiorina Comes Out in Favor of Kids Getting Measles,\" something that Fiorina did not say.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The article has an inflammatory headline, \"Carly Fiorina Comes Out in Favor of Kids Getting Measles,\" something that Fiorina did not say.", "title": "Slate Misrepresents Carly Fiorina's Words in Absurd Vaccine Story - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/carly1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/15/slate-misrepresents-carly-fiorinas-words-in-absurd-vaccine-story/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The article has an inflammatory headline, \"Carly Fiorina Comes Out in Favor of Kids Getting Measles,\" something that Fiorina did not say.", "creator": "@rumpfshaker", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/carly1.jpg", "title": "Slate Misrepresents Carly Fiorina's Words in Absurd Vaccine Story - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 elections, 2016 Republican Presidential Primary, anti-vaccine, anti-vaxxers, Carly Fiorina, Slate, Vaccine,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism,Fiorina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Vaccine", "published_time": "2015-08-15T06:29:17-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebd5\"", "article_summary": "Mediate noticed the controversy, and labeled Slate\u2019s article one example of the media\u2019s \u201cdishonest attack\u201d on Fiorina\u2019s vaccine position:Taken in context, Fiorina\u2019s statement ought to be uncontroversial.\nThe Slate article begins with an inflammatory headline, \u201cCarly Fiorina Comes Out in Favor of Kids Getting Measles,\u201d something that Fiorina most certainly did not say.\nOur source in the Fiorina campaign said that Slate was originally resistant to updating the article and took some convincing.\nInterpreting Fiorina\u2019s quote to support an anti-vaxxer position requires doing what Slate did, adding a lot of extra commentary that Fiorina most certainly did not say.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina has been winning over new fans with her no-nonsense, straightforward way of answering questions."}
