Bush, GOP, Jeb Bush, New York Times, Republicans, The Right, Media News, Politics News\n\nJeb Bush has a dirty little secret that he wants to tell, and he doesn\u2019t even care who knows: He\u2019s a \u201cgeek\u201d! A nerd. He\u2019s so silly like that, caring about policy all the time when all everyone else wants to do in life is have a good time.\n\nSuch is the message passed off in a weekend New York Times riff on the former Florida governor. It may be the most comically obvious attempt we\u2019ve seen yet in the 2016 proto-campaign from Jeb\u2019s handlers to show that he\u2019s not an idiot like his elder brother, the former President Bush. The piece is filled with effusive quotes about how bookish and wonky and smart Jeb Bush is. Rarely is an image-crafting piece so indiscreetly dropped by a politician\u2019s handlers. Hell, a reading list is even provided to run alongside the profile to offer even more proof that, yes, the rumors are true, Jeb Bush is literate. And the pace in which he devours middlebrow histories and libertarian at-length ranking and Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201cKilling ____\u201d books is breathtaking.\n\nThe profile is mainly a laundry list of quotes submitted by his supporters.\n\nFriends and former aides have variously described him as a \u201cpolicy wonk,\u201d an \u201cideas junkie\u201d and, as Arthur C. Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute, called him, \u201ca top-drawer intellect.\u201d\u2026 These days, the younger Mr. Bush peppers his speeches with statistics, academic-sounding references to \u201cquintiles\u201d and self-deprecating jokes about his own geekiness. A few weeks ago, he boasted to a crowd of Republican donors that he was \u201cnerdy enough\u201d to read City Journal, an obscure policy magazine published by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, then recited the names of his favorite writers at the publication. Aubrey Jewett, who has studied Jeb Bush as a professor of political science at the University of Central Florida, said he \u201cseems to go out of his way to make it clear that he\u2019s different from his brother, by the way he talks about himself, his goals and the details of public policy.\u201d\n\nWell, hot dog, the man knows what \u201cquintile\u201d means! He\u2019s \u201cnerdy enough\u201d to read a moderate conservative think tank\u2019s journal that aligns closely with his politics. He\u2019s the policy wonk, ideas junkie, top-drawer intellect, the Aristotle of the Everglades. No one in history has come even close to being as smart as Jeb Bush. If he has any health issues, it may be that his brain is so full of facts that it could explode somewhere around the fifth year of his presidency. Can he do math, too? Oh, he can do math with the best of them. Perhaps his people also should have provided the Times with raw footage of him doing some light algebra sets before bed, though, just for concrete proof.\n\nIs this really what Jeb\u2019s team feels is its biggest political liability? That Jeb is perceived to be stupid, like his brother? Because that\u2019s \u2026 misguided. Bush does need to distinguish himself from his brother, but in different ways and to different audiences.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb's pals are very eager to show the media he's not like George.
