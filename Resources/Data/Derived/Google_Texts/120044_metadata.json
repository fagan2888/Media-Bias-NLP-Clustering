Second, with the emphasis on preventing workplace violence and various incidents of workplace violence in the news, another design would be more fitting to announce \u2018awards\u2019 for employees \u2014 other than bullet holes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Managers at a Department of Veterans Affairs office in Florida are changing an employee-of-the-month \"wanted\" poster graphic, complete with bullet holes, after the employees' union complained about the image.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Managers at a Department of Veterans Affairs office in Florida are changing an employee-of-the-month \u201cwanted\u201d poster graphic, complete with bullet holes, after the employees\u2019 union complained about the image.", "title": "VA office agrees to change \u2018wanted\u2019 poster for workers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/24/va-office-agrees-change-wanted-poster-workers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/24/VA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/24/VA.jpg", "description": "Managers at a Department of Veterans Affairs office in Florida are changing an employee-of-the-month \"wanted\" poster graphic, complete with bullet holes, after the employees' union complained about th", "card": "summary", "title": "VA office agrees to change \u2018wanted\u2019 poster for workers"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Valorie Reilly"}, "article_summary": "Managers at a Department of Veterans Affairs office in Florida are changing an employee-of-the-month \u201cwanted\u201d poster graphic, complete with bullet holes, after the employees\u2019 union complained about the image.\nSecond, with the emphasis on preventing workplace violence and various incidents of workplace violence in the news, another design would be more fitting to announce \u2018awards\u2019 for employees \u2014 other than bullet holes.\u201d\n\u201cIt was never intended to relay a negative message, such as terrorism, threats, or violence.\n\u2026\u201dUnion officials said the image sent the wrong message to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and also violated collective bargaining agreements about workplace violence.\n\u201cMany consider the poster and announcement not just in bad faith, but puzzling in an environment where many veterans have seen combat."}
