There were pictures on the wall of cartoon characters and a rainbow,\u201d she said.\n\nThe immigrants were given medical examinations, which Heriot said likely provided them with greater medical access than they had in their home countries, and the women \u201chad no complaints\u201d about their experience aside from a rule barring mothers from watching each other\u2019s children.\n\nHeriot said that instead of using the evidence from these visits, the commissioners relied heavily on previous testimony against the detention centers to compile the report.\n\n\u201cAt that point, the report was mostly done and they weren\u2019t going to back off of the conclusions they had already drawn,\u201d she said.\n\nHeriot, along with Commissioner Peter Kirsanow, argued in their dissents that the centers should remain open.\n\n\u201cThe reason that we have detention for people who cross the border illegally is that there is concern about making sure they show up for their hearing,\u201d Heriot said.\n\nCommission Chairman Martin Castro cited a study finding a 91-percent appearance rate to hearings when immigrants participated in an \u201calternative to detention\u201d program. Heriot called the figure \u201coptimistic,\u201d citing a lower 69-percent appearance rate as reason to keep the centers open.\n\n\u201cI hope [the administration] looks at the report that we\u2019ve issued and see[s] its many shortcomings,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHad we gone and conducted our own in-depth investigation that might have been a worthy thing to do, but we didn\u2019t. All we did is amplify the investigations made by advocates\u2014there\u2019s no point in having the Civil Rights Commission if that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nDespite the accusations, Castro said he was \u201cconfident\u201d in the report\u2019s claims, calling it \u201cinstructive\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d to both government officials and public dialogue surrounding the civil and constitutional rights of immigrants.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The report portrayed immigration detention centers as \"inhumane.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The report portrayed immigration detention centers as \"inhumane.\"", "title": "Conservatives Dispute Civil Rights Commission Report", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150917_ImmigrantDetention_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-18T22:03:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KksnOb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The report portrayed immigration detention centers as \"inhumane.\"", "title": "Conservatives Dispute Civil Rights Commission Report", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150917_ImmigrantDetention_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-09-18T15:13:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T22:03:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Commission on Civil Rights, detention facilities, illegal immigration, Gail Heriot, Martin Castro, Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released an extensive report Thursday urging President Barack Obama to release undocumented immigrant women and children from detention facilities, citing \u201cabuse\u201d and \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions.\nIn the 250-page report, the commission demanded that the Department of Homeland Security immediately release detained families and advocated Congress to halt detention center funding.\nFollowing a January briefing from immigration experts revealing severe allegations against the detention centers, Heriot traveled along with the other commissioners in May to survey two of the centers in Texas.\nHeriot said that instead of using the evidence from these visits, the commissioners relied heavily on previous testimony against the detention centers to compile the report.\nWhile the majority of the commission voted to back the report, its two conservative members accused the group of cherry-picking evidence to support a fixed position."}
