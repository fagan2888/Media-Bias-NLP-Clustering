According to witnesses, the group of bar patrons shouted racist and trans-phobic slurs at McDonald and her group. McDonald tried to walk away, but the confrontation escalated and she was sliced in the face with a beer bottle by one of the female patrons. The two groups began to fight; McDonald walked away once again, but was pursued by Dean Schmitz. McDonald says she turned around to confront him while holding a pair of scissors she retrieved from her purse; he was stabbed in the chest and died from the injury. McDonald was charged with two counts of second degree murder, went on to accept a plea to manslaughter in the second degree, and was sentenced to 41 months in a men\u2019s prison.\n\nThe profile of the case has brought much needed attention to the violence faced by trans people, and other cases in which a trans person has been charged with a crime while acting in self-defense.\n\nA recent case in California provides yet another example of the kind of daily harassment and violence that trans men and women face at alarming rates, and what happens when they attempt self-defense.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After 19 months in a men's prison, McDonald finally walked free Monday morning  VIDEO", "title": "CeCe McDonald released from prison", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After 19 months in a men's prison, McDonald finally walked free Monday morning  VIDEO", "title": "CeCe McDonald released from prison", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/13/cece_mcdonald_released_from_prison/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/CeCe_060712-thumb-640xauto-6176.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After 19 months in a men's prison, McDonald finally walked free Monday morning  VIDEO", "title": "CeCe McDonald released from prison", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/CeCe_060712-thumb-640xauto-6176.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, CeCe McDonald, LGBT Rights, trans justice, transgender rights, Video, violence against trans people", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd184f\"", "article_summary": "Topics: CeCe McDonald, LGBT Rights, trans justice, transgender rights, Video, violence against trans people, Life News, NewsAfter 19 months in a men\u2019s prison, CeCe McDonald finally walked free Monday morning.\nThe two groups began to fight; McDonald walked away once again, but was pursued by Dean Schmitz.\nMcDonald, a transgender woman, was sentenced to 41 months in a St.\nAccording to witnesses, the group of bar patrons shouted racist and trans-phobic slurs at McDonald and her group.\nMcDonald was charged with two counts of second degree murder, went on to accept a plea to manslaughter in the second degree, and was sentenced to 41 months in a men\u2019s prison."}
