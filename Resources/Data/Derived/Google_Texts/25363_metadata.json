The panel was appointed by Republican House Speaker Beth Harwell to come up with proposals to expand access to health coverage after the defeat of Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee proposal last year.

Some states, including Tennessee, didn't expand Medicaid under the federal legislation, and that created a coverage gap.\n\n\"When the Supreme Court made it optional whether states would do that expansion, it created this coverage gap,\" she said.\n\nThose who are in the gap do not qualify for Medicaid coverage and don't make enough to qualify for tax credits to buy insurance from the federal government, Long said.\n\nShe said the group largely consists of employees in the food service, construction and transportation industry, as well as an estimated 24,000 veterans.\n\n\"We estimate that there's between 200,000 and 400,000 uninsured individuals,\" Long said, adding that not everyone would either be eligible or choose to become covered should the committee advance a Medicaid expansion plan.\n\nLawmakers raised questions about what has gone wrong in other states, such as Arkansas and Kentucky, which have seen problems with their roll out of health care expansion.\n\n\"You have a little bit more information than you did before,\" Gordon said, pointing out that today there are better tools to help determine what would occur in Tennessee.\n\nDuring his portion of the presentation, Gordon largely focused on what the state would need to incorporate in a plan in order to remain eligible for federal funding.\n\nSuch requirements include covering all childless adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level and anyone considered \"medically frail,\" Gordon said.\n\nAmong the lawmakers present were Reps. Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville; Matthew Hill, R-Jonesborough; Steve McManus, R-Cordova; Roger Kane, R-Knoxville; and Rep. Karen Camper, D-Memphis. The group was also joined by Sen. Richard Briggs, R-Knoxville.\n\nFinding ways to implement a measured approach \u2014 which is expected to include incentives and \"circuit breakers,\" or enrollment thresholds \u2014 was a central topic of discussion.\n\nHill said he favors a tiered rollout of a pilot program \"so we can keep the hand on the wheel\" as long as possible.\n\nBriggs said another idea is allowing the state to annually expand its coverage to individuals based on income levels and the federal poverty line.\n\n\"Year one we're going to go from 100 to 120 (percent),\" he said. \"That gives you a chance to learn about the program.\"\n\nMcManus questioned Gordon about the fact that Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas have threatened to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Trying to predict what will happen in the next administration \u2014 I don't dare go there,\" Gordon said.\n\nAlthough Tuesday's meeting was simply to set the task force's groundwork, Sexton said he plans on taking the discussions across the state to engage physicians, hospitals and insurance carriers before wrapping up efforts in June, when the state will engage in discussions with the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThe gathering comes two weeks after Harwell, R-Nashville, announced the task force's formation. The initiative seeks to generate proposals that will be given to federal health officials in an effort to implement pilot projects throughout Tennessee aimed at providing increased access to care for the working poor.\n\nSince Harwell's April 12 announcement, Camper has joined the group. Her addition came after Democrats, including Rep. Mike Stewart, D-Nashville, branded the task force a \u201cpolitical charade\u201d and a \u201cpathetic\u201d attempt to direct attention away from Insure Tennessee, Haslam\u2019s controversial health care plan that failed to gain traction in the legislature in 2015.\n\nAlthough Tuesday\u2019s discussion remained between lawmakers and TennCare officials, future talks will involve various stakeholders, including Vanderbilt University, which is expected to be a part of Wednesday's discussion.\n\nHarwell, who is not a member of the task force, said she has been engaged in discussions with Vanderbilt University's School of Medicine since last year.\n\nThe formation of the committee came after Harwell faced increased pressure to expand Medicaid coverage to the state\u2019s uninsured. Throughout the 2016 legislative session \u2014 beginning on the first day and continuing through the end \u2014 supporters of Insure Tennessee pressed lawmakers on the issue by launching a billboard campaign, which included involvement from Nashville philanthropist Martha Ingram, and regularly holding protests.\n\nBefore announcing the task force, Harwell and Haslam said the speaker did not unilaterally have the power to advance Insure Tennessee. In the early part of the session, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey said lawmakers should wait until after the fall presidential election to take action on health care.\n\nReach Joel Ebert at 615-772-1681 and on Twitter @joelebert29.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1SHPBE3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A panel of lawmakers tasked with finding ways to improve access to health care held its first meeting Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "A panel of lawmakers tasked with finding ways to improve access to health care held its first meeting Tuesday.", "title": "Health care task force begins discussions", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/26/health-care-task-force-begins-discussions/83541592/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A panel of lawmakers tasked with finding ways to improve access to health care held its first meeting Tuesday.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/43563f04ab11ac60a212f35f1cf366e01d2e9b50/c=0-30-614-644&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Nashville/Nashville/635972878060479486-healthcare.jpg", "title": "Health care task force begins discussions", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Health care costs", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Health care costs", "title": "Health care task force begins discussions", "author": "Joel Ebert", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1940a0c1d30d65de125af12faf863a941f70c67e/c=19-0-595-768/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Nashville/Nashville/635972878060479486-healthcare.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a125e9fbf371421fa338c491a6f2836a3d7373a/c=0-30-614-644/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Nashville/Nashville/635972878060479486-healthcare.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/59d3388708cc5886043ed3ea7be31e53feb12ed4/c=0-28-614-490/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Nashville/Nashville/635972878060479486-healthcare.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fcd6fc28978d5a84a55f3f5a3a8634ad35792e6d/c=0-33-614-380&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Nashville/Nashville/635972878060479486-healthcare.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-26T18:46:21.097000-05:00", "shorthed": "Health care task force begins talks", "articleid": 83541592, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee082fc155a11a2a595e8a7371ca8cc0c2a0f914/c=0-33-614-380/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Nashville/Nashville/635972878060479486-healthcare.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71071e78168eec02d9cf79614531a0cb1353c804/c=92-0-522-768/local/-/media/2016/04/26/Nashville/Nashville/635972878060479486-healthcare.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Tennessee General Assembly, Tennessee legislature, Tennessee lawmakers, Tennessee health care, Tennessee Medicaid expansion, Speaker Beth Harwell, Harwell task force, Harwell medicaid task force, Harwell health care task force, Insure Tennessee,"}, "article_summary": "Incoming TennCare Director Dr. Wendy Long and her predecessor, Darin Gordon, attend a health care task force meeting on Tuesday in Nashville.\nLong said the state of health care in Tennessee is a result of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe conversation came as part of the inaugural meeting of the \u201c3-Star Healthy Project\u201d \u2014 a newly formed task force established by House Speaker Beth Harwell to work on improving access to health care coverage.\nOutgoing TennCare Director Darin Gordon and his successor, Dr. Wendy Long, provided lawmakers with a crash course on the state\u2019s health care system.\nRon Ramsey said lawmakers should wait until after the fall presidential election to take action on health care."}
