It\u2019s the close of week one of the open enrollment period for Obamacare, aka, \u201cthe glitch\u201d that killed American\u2019s desire for affordable health insurance, according to your media and Republicans last year.\n\nIn week one (November 15 -November 21) of open enrollment on year two, 462,125 people selected plans for Marketplace coverage and 1 million plus people spoke with call center representatives, according to numbers released by Health and Human Services on Wednesday. The Obama administration says that of those who selected plans, 48% were new.\n\nConservatives will point and gloat because the administration released inaccurate information earlier this fall, but that is also why they are doing a weekly release. Neither the website glitch nor the enrollment number inaccuracy invalidate the need for affordable healthcare. And yet still, for all of the trolling, Republicans have yet to offer a viable, specific alternative.\n\nThe report also showed over 1.6 million reviewed prices for coverage, 1 million people surfed the site shopping for coverage with wait times of over three minutes to speak to someone on the phone.\n\nThings are going so well for Obamacare that the countdown clock to Republicans taking credit for it and renaming it has begun. Soon, they\u2019ll try to disappear \u201cObamacare\u201d, and they\u2019ll issue stern looks to anyone who uses the term, as if it is shameful to credit the President for his legacy policy.\n\nThe thing is, President Obama and the Democrats passed Obamacare because they knew people were dying from lack of access to affordable healthcare. They did something about it. Yeah, there were some glitches when it rolled out, and they were exacerbated by the Republican refusal to play along with how the law was written, forcing extra burden onto the system, but just like Social Security, people love their Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almost half a million people signed up for Obamacare in one week.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Almost half a million people signed up for Obamacare in one week.", "title": "GOP Fail: Almost Half a Million People Sign Up for Obamacare in First Week", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/11/26/million-people-sign-obamacare-week-open-enrollment.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/barack-obama-smiling-2012-485x363.jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-11-26T13:04:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,ACA,Barack Obama,health insurance,Healthcare reform in the United States,Obamacare,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,Presidency of Barack Obama,signups week one,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-11-26T12:41:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T13:04:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, Barack Obama, health insurance, Healthcare reform in the United States, Obamacare, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Presidency of Barack Obama, signups week one"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd091a\"", "article_summary": "Almost half a million people signed up in a week.\nIt\u2019s the close of week one of the open enrollment period for Obamacare, aka, \u201cthe glitch\u201d that killed American\u2019s desire for affordable health insurance, according to your media and Republicans last year.\nThings are going so well for Obamacare that the countdown clock to Republicans taking credit for it and renaming it has begun.\nThe report also showed over 1.6 million reviewed prices for coverage, 1 million people surfed the site shopping for coverage with wait times of over three minutes to speak to someone on the phone.\nThe thing is, President Obama and the Democrats passed Obamacare because they knew people were dying from lack of access to affordable healthcare."}
