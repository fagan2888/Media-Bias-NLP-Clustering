He was still digesting the \u201cexcellent\u201d barbecue chicken from a Dutch-oven the night before, when he rode a flatbed boat on the Colorado river in Canyonlands National Park. And he still wanted to talk about his weekend trip in the King Air twin-propeller plane used by Utah Governor Gary Herbert and his chance to meet a state county commissioner whose wife had been recently treated for cancer. \u201cThat was so significant to me,\u201d Cummings told TIME, who has called his vote for the Administration\u2019s signature healthcare law the most important of his 18-year career. \u201cCancer is a big factor in my family and in my district.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll along this voyage of discovery, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a 47-year-old Mormon who opposed Obamacare, was by Cummings side, and neither would have had it any other way. The two-night Chaffetz-Cummings trip was designed to deepen a bond first forged in June, when Chaffetz went to Baltimore to better understand the seniors, former convicts and AIDS patients in Cummings\u2019 district. Now Cummings, his black Under Armour t-shirt poking out underneath his polo, trekked west to learn about the consequences of putting the Gunnison Sage-Grouse on the endangered species list and economic impacts of designating 1.8 million acres around Canyonlands as a national park. Chaffetz, whose mother died from cancer, said their talk about the disease was \u201ca reminder to [Cummings] that we have a lot in common.\u201d\n\nCommonality matters because Chaffetz and Cummings may soon control one of the most bitterly partisan and dysfunctional bodies in the U.S. Congress, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The current chairman, Republican Darrell Issa of California, will be stepping down in January because of term limits, ending a tenure that has been marked by ceremonial shout fests, banging gavels and few measurable accomplishments. Democrats have attacked Issa for exploiting partisan outrage and forging few legislative responses to legitimate scandals, including the botched \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun-trafficking sting, the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack and the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s targeting of political groups. Some Republicans have also, more quietly, expressed dismay at the committee\u2019s lack of accomplishments. In March, committee decorum hit a new low-point when Issa shut off Cummings\u2019 microphone during an IRS hearing, which Issa quickly then adjourned before later apologizing.\n\nFew can imagine Cummings ever choosing to spend recreational time with Issa. But with Chaffetz, whose reputation is both conservative and cordial, the two men seem to have hit it off. Cummings says Chaffetz would not wield the gavel like Issa if chosen as the next chairman, even though the two Republicans are close on the political scale. \u201cAlthough we have disagreements, I have always found him to be non-disagreeable,\u201d says Cummings. Like a twin, or at least a congressman used to sharing the stage, Chaffetz agreed almost word-for-word with Cummings in a separate phone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re going to disagree on most issues,\u201d Chaffetz told TIME. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be disagreeable.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the two men showed up together on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to show a united front. \u201cI want a relationship which will allow us to get things done,\u201d said Cummings. \u201cI actually want to get some stuff done,\u201d said Chaffetz.\n\nIn interviews, the two men brought that same level of comity in their descriptions of each others districts, which lie on opposite ends of the political spectrum. \u201cThey wanted to preserve their environment but at the same time they wanted to be able to use their land,\u201d said Cummings, who noted that some ranchers he met were their families\u2019 seventh generation working the land. \u201cI thought I would hear from folks who were just one-sided. But I felt that they were trying to reach some kind of balance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some issues in Utah that are uniquely western,\u201d said Chaffetz, who wore jeans and brown leather cowboy boots around Canyonlands. \u201cYou can\u2019t truly appreciate that until you feel and see it. The same is true in Baltimore. They\u2019re dealing with a ton of issues such as food deserts [neighborhoods lacking in healthy food options] that I\u2019ve never heard before.\u201d\n\nChaffetz and Cummings may even start to dress alike. Waiting for Cummings in his Capitol Hill office is a gift, a brown, felt cowboy hat from Burns Saddlery, \u201ca real one,\u201d says Chaffetz, who owns a black version.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d recommend he wear his hat in his district, but if he comes out West again he\u2019ll look right at home,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not wearing a cowboy hat in Baltimore unless I want to get my butt kicked.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reps.
