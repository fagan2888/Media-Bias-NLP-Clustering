The Virginia man facing murder charges in the shooting deaths of a police officer and another person has been identified as an Army staff sergeant assigned to the Pentagon.

Ronald Hamilton is being held without bond in the Prince William County Adult Detention Center on charges that include murder of a law enforcement officer. He is accused of shooting and killing Officer Ashley Guindon after she answered a domestic violence call at the Hamilton home Saturday evening. Two other officers are undergoing treatment at a hospital.

Cindy Your, a Defense Information Systems Agency spokeswoman based at Fort Meade, Maryland, said Hamilton is an active duty Army staff sergeant assigned to the Joint Staff Support Center at the Pentagon.

Hamilton faces arraignment on Monday.

A Virginia police officer was killed while responding to a domestic-related shooting a day after she was sworn in, authorities said.

Prince William County police officer Ashley Guindon was killed Saturday night in Lake Ridge. She was sworn in Friday.

Two other officers were injured in the shooting, authorities said. One was in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds and another officer was stable, according to Corey Stewart, chairman of the board of county supervisors.

A day before the shooting, the department tweeted a photo of Guindon after her swearing in.

Guindon had been an officer before but took some time off, Stewart said.

Authorities did not release additional details on the domestic call. But when police arrived at the scene, they found a civilian woman killed in that incident, Stewart said.

Before Saturday, the department has had three officers killed in the line of duty since 1970, it said on its website.

Prince William County is about 25 miles south of Washington, D.C.
