It used unique pricing data from one million local businesses nationwide to create a Yuppie Price Index \u2013 an economic indicator tracking the annual cost of typical yuppie services in the top 30 U.S. cities.\n\nA yuppie, according to the website, is a young, urban professional.\n\nTypical yuppie services include haircuts, blowouts, manicures, massages, eyebrow waxing, dry cleaning, dog boarding, gym memberships and yoga classes.\n\n\u201cLaundry and dry cleaning, hair and even yoga prices are below the national average,\u201d the website said about Raleigh. \u201cHowever, pricey gyms and beauty services like massages, facials and manicures added up.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco, Denver, Washington D.C. and Phoenix ranked above Raleigh. Cities more commonly known as expensive places to live, such as Miami (9), Los Angeles (11), Chicago (12) and New York City (13), ranked lower.\n\nCharlotte was among the most affordable cities for yuppies, ranking 15th, according to the website.\n\nRaleigh\u2019s ranking came as a surprise to Edgar Haren, who has lived in San Francisco and Houston - ranked as the second most affordable yuppie city.\n\nHaren, who works for Lenovo, moved into The Hue, a luxury apartment complex on Hargett Street, in October.\n\nHe believes Raleigh is closer to Houston when it comes to yuppie expenses.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be closer to a lot of the nightlife,\u201d he said about moving to downtown Raleigh. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great restaurants around here as well as, of course, Fayetteville Street. That\u2019s what\u2019s really cool. The Flying Saucer is right there. It\u2019s a great pub and The Pit is right down the road as well so it\u2019s pretty convenient.\u201d\n\nThe ranking also came as a surprise for Bonnye Talbot, who lives and works in downtown Raleigh.\n\n\u201cReally? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cI have friends that live in Baltimore and San Francisco. We\u2019re cheap. We\u2019re exceptionally cheap living here. For services?
