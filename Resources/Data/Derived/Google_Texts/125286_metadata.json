The 19-year-old California State University, Los Angeles student suffers from Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare disorder of the skin and mucous membranes that causes a severe allergic reaction to a medication or an infection.\n\n\"Heartbreaking, just unreal. Just watching your daughter burn in front of you, literally burn in front of you,\" Laura Corona, Castanada\u2019s mother, told KABC. \"First of all, don't share medication, don't give someone else your medication, don't offer medication. Another thing also, go get yourself checked out and your kids checked out, because you don't know what you're allergic to. You don't.\"\n\nTeen \"burns from the inside out\" after taking friend's medication. GoFundMe\n\nLess than 24 hours after taking her friend\u2019s leftover antibiotics, Castanada started feeling a stinging sensation in her eyes, nose, and throat. She was rushed to the emergency room where blisters broke out all over her body resembling that of a burn victim. Doctors in the UC Irvine Medical Center\u2019s burn ward have placed the 19-year-old mother on a ventilator, where she remains sedated with bandages covering the majority of her body.\n\nDepending on the severity of the patient\u2019s condition, recovery for Stevens-Johnson syndrome can take anywhere from weeks to months. Castanada has undergone a series of surgeries in the past two weeks, including a scraping of her entire body. Her family explained that she has a long road to recovery in front of her, which will include optsmology care, dermatology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nutrition therapy, and burn treatments.\n\nPhoto courtesy of GoFundMe .\n\n\u201cPlease help us spread the [word] about the danger of taking someone [else's] medication,\u201d Castanada\u2019s family said on her GoFundMe account.
