Something like a libertarian. Dedicated to civil debate, which doesn't mean refusing to criticize ideas you disagree with or compromising on what you believe. It means arguing for your beliefs without resorting to name-calling, demonizing, or distorting your opponents. It's like fair play in sports: work hard to defeat the other team, but don't cheat. (For details, see The Civil Debate Page .) Studied philosophy and religion at VCU and NYU.\n\nActress Rose McGowan, on May 24, was caught passing along a fake quote attributed to GOP presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nThe fabrication portrayed Cruz as defending reality TV personality Josh Duggar against child molestation allegations, saying that \u201cDuggar\u2019s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do with each other.\u201d\n\nSnopes has exposed the bogus quote, and McGowan has apologized \u2013 sort of. Naturally, she doesn\u2019t want to admit that she was so eager to believe the worst about an opponent that she fell for an easy-to-uncover deception.\n\nUnfortunately, people fall for this sort of thing all the time. Here\u2019s a list of some prominent misrepresentations that have caught on over the years:\n\n1. May 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu goes on a racist rant against Israeli Arabs.\n\nNetanyahu was condemned by President Barack Obama and others for an election-day slur, but all he said was that many Arab voters \u2013 who tend to vote against Netanyahu\u2019s party \u2013 were showing up to vote, and that his own supporters would have to increase turnout in order to win the election. That\u2019s no more bigoted than saying that (given the gender gap) Democrats win when more women vote, and Republicans win when more men vote.\n\n2. February 2015, Obama wants to beat Islamic State with just a jobs program.\n\nState Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf said the Obama administration would attempt to address the \u201croot causes\u201d (such as joblessness) of why people join the militant Islamic State. Pundits such as Rush Limbaugh caricatured this as the only strategy Obama was offering \u2013 with no military component whatsoever \u2013 even while playing the clip of Harf saying, \u201cwe\u2019re killing a lot of them. And we\u2019re going to keep killing more of them.\u201d\n\n3. August 2014, \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d becomes a protest slogan.\n\nAfter the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, by police officer Darren Wilson, word spread that he\u2019d been killed while surrendering. The story caught on, and \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d became a staple of civil rights protests. But investigations didn\u2019t bear the story out \u2013 it was perhaps concocted by Dorian Johnson, Brown\u2019s companion \u2013 and Wilson was not charged.\n\n4. August 2012, Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign doesn\u2019t care about facts.\n\nDefending Romney\u2019s campaign against critical fact-checkers, pollster Neil Newhouse said: \u201cFact-checkers come to this with their own sets of thoughts and beliefs and you know what? We\u2019re not going let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.\u201d Former President Bill Clinton and pundit Steve Benen focused only on the latter sentence, accusing Romney\u2019s campaign of saying facts don\u2019t matter rather than simply questioning the fact-checkers\u2019, uh, factitude. In accusing the other side of not caring about facts, they got their facts wrong. Oops.\n\n5. July 2012, Obama says you didn\u2019t build your business.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a business \u2013 you didn\u2019t build that,\u201d became an unwelcome slogan for Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. Romney, Limbaugh, GOP chair Reince Priebus and others excoriated the president. But, looking at the full quote, it\u2019s clear the demonstrative pronoun \u201cthat\u201d \u2013 demonstrative pronouns and their ambiguous referents, am I right? Yeah, I\u2019m right \u2013 is referring to the roads, bridges, and teachers that helped people succeed. But critics chose the worse interpretation, and Obama\u2019s \u201cyou didn\u2019t make it on your own\u201d message was lost.\n\n6. June 2011, Obama says ATMs are bad.\n\nWhile discussing the economic recovery, Obama cited \u201cstructural issues\u201d, where jobs once performed by people are now being done by ATMs and kiosks. Condemnation followed, with pundit Michelle Malkin calling Obama a \u201cLuddite\u201d. Maybe Obama was dodging responsibility for the slow recovery, but he never said we shouldn\u2019t have ATMs, or that the unemployment caused by automation isn\u2019t outweighed by gains in other sectors of the economy. Technology sometimes puts people out of work; pointing that out doesn\u2019t make you a Luddite.\n\n7. March 2010, Rep. Nancy Pelosi says we have to pass Obamacare to find out what\u2019s in it.\n\nAs Speaker of the House during the debate on the Affordable Care Act, Pelosi lamented the \u201ccontroversies\u201d making the debate so contentious. \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy,\u201d she said. Critics left off the last seven words, as well as the parts where she pointed out things that were in the bill: investment in community health centers, funds for preventive care, etc. Whatever, critics turned it into her saying, \u201cpass the bill first, find out what\u2019s in it later.\u201d\n\n8. January 2009, Limbaugh hopes the country fails.\n\nWhen asked to write 400 words on his hope for the Obama presidency, Limbaugh offered just four: \u201cI hope he fails.\u201d Critics accused him of rooting for failure, and Texas state Rep. Mark Strama said Limbaugh \u201cwould rather see the country fail than this president succeed.\u201d But the full context shows Limbaugh hoping Obama will fail to implement liberal policies, which \u2013 as a conservative \u2013 he believes are bad for the country.\n\n9. September 2008, Sarah Palin says she can see Russia from her house.\n\nIn the 2008 election, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin noted that you can see Russia from some parts of Alaska (where she was governor). Saturday Night Live satirized the quote to mock her: \u201cI can see Russia from my house!\u201d The meme caught on, and even after the election people had trouble figuring out whether comedian Tina Fey was quoting Palin accurately, or just making stuff up.\n\n10. July 2008, Obama wants to create a Gestapo-style civilian national security force.\n\nLimbaugh even cited this one May 28, 2015. But, no, all Obama advocated was a list of civilian projects, like supporting veterans, mentoring children, and growing the Peace Corps. None of this turns us into Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.\n\n11. January 2008, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) wants 100 years of war in Iraq.\n\nIn the 2008 campaign, GOP candidate McCain made it clear he had no problem with U.S. troops being in Iraq for 100 years, \u201cas long as Americans are not being injured, or harmed, or wounded or killed.\u201d But Obama, Howard Dean, and Hillary Clinton changed this into \u201c100 more years of war.\u201d Defending himself from accusations that he\u2019d distorted McCain\u2019s remarks, Obama bizarrely directed people to the YouTube clip that proved Obama was wrong. Somehow this never became a meme to mock Obama, the way \u201cI can see Russia from my house\u201d was used to deride Palin.\n\n12. Nazis advocated telling big lies, which are more believable.\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of people and their willingness to believe fabrications, Adolf Hitler is frequently credited with adopting a \u201cbig lie\u201d theory of propaganda. But, while Hitler talks about how people fall for \u201ccolossal untruths,\u201d he doesn\u2019t suggest using the tactic. Rather, he blames others \u2013 Jews and Marxists, naturally \u2013 for resorting to this strategy. Joseph Goebbels later accused the English of doing the same. All the time the Nazis were telling big lies, they only thought other people were doing it. Crazy, right?\n\nFeature Image source: John Parra/WireImage\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
