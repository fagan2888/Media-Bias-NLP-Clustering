But there\u2019s one sport where I have a perfect streak: self-loathing voting.\n\nI have yet to check a ballot for a Republican presidential nominee who I was even remotely enthusiastic about.\n\nIn fairness, I\u2019m 29 years old, so I missed the conservative groundswell of the 1980s and the right\u2019s post-Clinton zeal for George W. Bush in 2000. But still, it\u2019s remarkable that I\u2019ve voted in two general presidential elections, and not once have I gone into a voting booth sans clothespin over my nose.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m being unreasonable. I\u2019m a fairly conservative guy, albeit with a sharp libertarian bent, and no Democratic candidate has ever come close to tempting me. I\u2019m also not some rigid ideological purist, dismissing perfectly good office-seekers at the first whiff of apostasy. Politics is a game of pragmatism, and I\u2019m more than willing to pull the lever for someone who\u2019s 85, 80, or even 75 percent in alignment with me, provided he (or she!) seems like a decent sort and doesn\u2019t, you know, taunt Vietnam POWs.\n\nSo my standards aren\u2019t that high, yet I still can\u2019t get no satisfaction. Is it me? Is it electoral dysfunction?\n\nIn 2008, Sen. John McCain was nominated by the Republican Party as part of an attempt to appear moderate after years of George W. Bush\u2019s disastrously ideological Iraq war. It didn\u2019t go well: the sole enthusiasm McCain seemed to muster was for continuing the Bush foreign policy, whether by speciously claiming that Iraq had been won or singing ditties about how Iran should be next.\n\nIn the end, I made an in-the-voting-booth decision to write in Ron Paul\u2014a satisfying choice, but not the official GOP nominee.\n\nIn 2012, Mitt Romney took the Republican conn after a bruising primary season that saw surges by unlikely electoral dwarves like Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Amidst an injection of fresh political juice from the tea party and its activism against Obamacare, the best GOP elites could do was the architect of proto-Obamacare who somehow now opposed Obamacare, and seemed to stand for little else other than his own electoral ambitions.\n\nI voted for Romney, but with extreme reluctance, and only because I was then registered in a swing state and not deep-blue Connecticut.\n\nThis year was supposed to be different. Finally, the tea party class of 2016 had come of age and was ready to shake up the typically staid GOP nominating process. The roll call of candidates was exhilarating \u2014 Paul, Cruz, Christie, Walker \u2014 and the freakout over the first two by the same gentry who hear-heared Romney seemed like a promising sign. There was that troubling intervention by Donald Trump to deal with, but he\u2019d also mounted a presidential run four years ago, and had dropped out as soon as Obama placated him by releasing a birth certificate. Surely, Trump would be just as shakeable in 2016.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t, he isn\u2019t, and today he\u2019s the presumptive Republican nominee, having vanquished Ted Cruz on the corn-strewn battlefield of Indiana. So my GOP champion this year won\u2019t be a mumbling moderate or a malfunctioning robot \u2014 he\u2019ll be a vulgar, bloviating, flappable boor with only the most cursory knowledge about the office he\u2019s seeking and the policies he\u2019ll be implementing.\n\nThe Republican gallery of presidential wannabes has come to resemble Odysseus\u2019 visit to Hades, with candidates grunting, torpidly shuffling about, pushing insurmountable electoral boulders up hills, and reaching for victory without ever being able to grasp it. We\u2019ve become the Democrats of the 1980s, flipping through various Mondales and Dukaki, unable to find that spark that inspires the electorate.\n\nOnly, while the Democratic selections of that time represented a victory of left-wing activists over party moderates, it\u2019s the elites who are in control of the Republican process. Even Donald Trump is a wheeler and dealer, likely to sell out his waifish patina of principle the moment it\u2019s opportune. There\u2019s a reason many in the Republican old guard prefer him to Cruz and Paul.\n\nTrump is not even eligible for a swallow-hard Mitt Romney vote, in my opinion. And so I\u2019ll be supporting a third party this year or perhaps writing in my second Paul. I understand the GOP doesn\u2019t cater exclusively to me, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being an entitled Millennial when I say they ought to do better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was never the guy who could hit .", "author": "By Matt Purple", "og": {"url": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/opinion/in-my-whole-adult-life-ive-never-seen-an-exciting-/nrHkj/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/2e/93/MY_DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "I was never the guy who could hit .", "title": "In my whole adult life, I\u2019ve never seen an exciting GOP candidate"}, "twitter": {"description": "I was never the guy who could hit .300 in baseball (or even .100, for that matter) and the various soccer teams I\u2019ve played on never went undefeated.", "card": "summary", "title": "In my whole adult life, I\u2019ve never seen an exciting GOP candidate"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/opinion/in-my-whole-adult-life-ive-never-seen-an-exciting-/nrHkj/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3334676/news/news/opinion/in-my-whole-adult-life-ive-never-seen-an-exciting-/nrHkj/", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I have yet to check a ballot for a Republican presidential nominee who I was even remotely enthusiastic about.\nIn 2008, Sen.
