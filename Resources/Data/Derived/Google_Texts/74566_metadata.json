This journey wouldn\u2019t normally be notable. But Gross is American, and he flew home from Havana, Cuba, where he had been in prison for five years \u2013 with a decade longer to go.\n\nThe saga of Gross\u2019 imprisonment and later, the efforts to free him, is principally a tale of the fraught relations between two nations: the United States and Cuba. The former USAID worker had been convicted for his role in an alleged plot to supposedly overthrow the Castro regime. Gross, who maintained his innocence, was freed as part of a deal to end a Cold War-era standoff between the two countries.\n\nBut there\u2019s a supporting actor who played a role in Gross\u2019 release: Pope Francis. According to the parties involved, the Holy See facilitated negotiations between the United States and Cuba and helped create a deal that would result in renewed diplomatic relations between the nations.\n\n\u201cHis Holiness Pope Francis issued a personal appeal to me and to Cuba\u2019s president, Ra\u00fal Castro, urging us to resolve Alan\u2019s case and to address Cuba\u2019s interests in the release of three Cuban agents, who\u2019ve been jailed in the United States for over 15 years,\u201d President Barack Obama announced in an official statement.\n\nThe deal Francis brokered included freedom for Gross, whose health had reportedly begun to deteriorate behind bars, and 53 other Cuban political prisoners. For its part, the United States released three Cuban agents and will allow restricted travel to the country; a bipartisan group of senators is also pushing for a total end to America\u2019s 55-year-old Cuban trade embargo.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable development, and one that has highlighted the pope\u2019s role as a diplomat. It\u2019s a role that Francis has indicated he intends to take up with greater frequency in the years to come. The results this time were positive, but not everyone is convinced that diplomacy tinged with religion is a good thing.\n\nThe New York Times credits Francis\u2019 Argentinian background as a contributing factor to the Vatican\u2019s emerg\u00ading status as an \u201cindependent actor in diplomacy.\u201d According to the Times, Francis is \u201cless tethered\u201d to the European political concerns that preoccupied previous occupants of the Holy See. Latin America is also a Catholic stronghold, a fact that significantly bolsters Francis\u2019 reach in the region \u2013 and likely motivates him to pursue diplomatic endeavors of interest to its inhabitants.\n\nBut in order to understand why Francis helped Gross go home, it\u2019s necessary to take a brief look at the Catholic church\u2019s political history. The Holy See is no stranger to diplomacy.\n\nAs the spiritual heart of Catholicism, the Vatican, which occupies just 109 acres in the center of Rome, doubled as a political entity long before the Italian Lateran Treaty created a micro-state, Vatican City, around it in 1929.\n\nAt the height of its power in the Middle Ages, the Holy See owned large amounts of land and commanded armies. It also boasts the oldest diplomatic corps in the world: Its foreign service dates back to the 11th century. For most of its history, the Vatican showed no reluctance to mix the divine with the profane in order to wield immense influence over European affairs, and it often did so via its diplomats.\n\nIts power is more restricted now; dynasties no longer rise and fall on the pope\u2019s authority. By its very nature as the ultimate spiritual authority for more than one billion people, it still has political influence, but that influence is now largely limited to spiritual matters and, more recently, to humanitarian issues.\n\nAccording to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Vatican didn\u2019t move to significantly influence U.S. foreign policy until the 20th century. But since then its diplomatic efforts haven\u2019t been particularly consistent. Both its approach to foreign affairs and its level of diplomatic activity have varied from pope to pope; Benedict XVI, pope emeritus, gained a reputation for being reluctant to pursue diplomacy. Francis, in character with his reputation as a reformer, seems poised to initiate a significant directional shift.\n\nA historical opponent of communism, the Vatican often finds its interests aligned with those of the United States, and this perhaps explains why President Ronald W. Reagan formalized diplomatic relations with the religious micro-state in 1984. (An earlier effort to establish formal U.S.-Vatican diplomatic ties by President Harry S. Truman in 1951 ran into such stiff resistance that it was dropped.)\n\nSince then, America has appointed an ambassador to the Holy See, a practice that troubles advocates of church-state separation since the Vatican is the headquarters of a church; there is also an informal policy that U.S. ambassadors to it be Catholic.\n\nThe United States\u2019 decision to have formal diplomatic relations with a church did emerge as a culture war flashpoint. Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a lawsuit to end the practice; at the time, its executive director, Robert L. Maddox, accused the Reagan administration of committing \u201ca callous act of disregard for American history.\u201d A number of religious groups joined the lawsuit, but a federal appeals court dismissed Americans United v. Reagan on technical issues.\n\nDecades later, America\u2019s ties to the Vatican are still controversial. Allegations have surfaced that the church has used diplomatic immunity to shield clerics accused of pedophilia or to place embarrassing documents beyond the reach of the law.\n\nIn 2013, erroneous reporting that the United States planned to shut its Vatican embassy unleashed a wave of outrage from the Religious Right. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush questioned if the move was \u201cretribution for Cath\u00ado\u00adlic organizations opposing Obamacare.\u201d The National Republican Sen\u00ada\u00adtorial Committee even briefly hosted a petition on its website demanding the reinstatement of the embassy. Vatican officials, for their part, told press they had no problem with what turned out to be merely a move to new quarters, and the controversy eventually spluttered to death.\n\nNow, news that the pope played a significant role in ending the U.S.-Cuba stalemate has reinvigorated debate over the church-state implications of American relations with the Vatican.\n\nDr. Gerald Fogarty, a professor of history at the University of Virginia, spoke to Church & State about Vatican diplomacy, and how it\u2019s likely to look under Francis.\n\n\u201cThis pope is certainly shaking things up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new age of the church and the world, so it\u2019s hard to tell what his role will be.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fogarty, the pope\u2019s decision to facilitate negotiations between the United States and Cuba was motivated by human-rights concerns. The Vatican maintains diplomat\u00adic relations with the communist state, and intervened in response to concerns raised by the Archbishop of Ha\u00advana, Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino.\n\nThat\u2019s typical for the Vatican. Fogarty explained that since the early 1960s, its major diplomatic interventions attempted to resolve international tensions. That includes the Cuban missile crisis: Pope John XXIII pled for peace on Vatican Radio, after being prompted by then-President John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe Vatican also attempted to intervene in Vietnam, at the Lyndon B. Johnson administration\u2019s behest, and during the Iran hostage crisis, again on behalf of the United States.\n\nBut papal interests don\u2019t always align with U.S. policy.\n\n\u201cThe Vatican opposed the invasion of Iraq,\u201d Fogarty noted, and added that the war had arguably contributed to the precarious status of the country\u2019s Christians. That opposition, of course, didn\u2019t deter the George W. Bush administration from pursuing its intended course of action, and Pope John Paul II lacked the political authority to levy sanctions or other diplomatic consequences for the deed.\n\nThe Vatican also often opposes American interests at the United Nations. During UN deliberations, the Vatican has worked to oppose greater access to contraceptives in the Third World and stood steadfastly against population-control measures.\n\nOn these shores, the church\u2019s threat to separation of church and state comes mainly from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), the church\u2019s lobbying arm. They\u2019ve diligently opposed the contraception mandate of the Affordable Care Act, de\u00ad\u00admanding significant religious ex\u00ad\u00ademp\u00adtions to the law that, critics say, undermine its attempt to provide contraception coverage to women. They also demand tax support for church schools, promote extreme anti-abortion laws and push to stop any expansion of gay rights.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s band of lobbyists, who, under U.S. law aren\u2019t required to report how much they spend attempting to influence legislation, are usually warmly welcomed on Capitol Hill. Church lobbyists also have a presence in many state legislatures as well.\n\nAs the church works to build a greater presence on the international stage, it may encounter some resistance. Not everyone is a fan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s archaic in the extreme for the Vatican to act as a peer in diplomacy between sovereign states,\u201d Tom Flynn, executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism, wrote recently. \u201cAnd it was inappropriate in the extreme for the U.S. to have treated the Roman Catholic Church as this sort of peer. Even if Pope Francis played an indispensable role in opening discussions between the U.S. and Cuba, the White House should have seen to it that once begun, the negotiations unfolded without an unqualified player continuing to be involved. That would have been the secular thing to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "756885656, 10150361922348092"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf532\"", "article_summary": "The United States\u2019 decision to have formal diplomatic relations with a church did emerge as a culture war flashpoint.\nIn 2013, erroneous reporting that the United States planned to shut its Vatican embassy unleashed a wave of outrage from the Religious Right.\nAccording to the parties involved, the Holy See facilitated negotiations between the United States and Cuba and helped create a deal that would result in renewed diplomatic relations between the nations.\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State filed a lawsuit to end the practice; at the time, its executive director, Robert L.
