Some institutions also recommend some flexibility training, Mendes and colleagues reported in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n\n\"The ultimate and most important variable for people is quality of life,\" Mendes said, noting that exercise particularly improves health-related quality of life.\n\nExercise has indisputable life-saving benefits, but there is limited research on the benefits of exercise among people with diabetes, said Huseyin Naci, a health policy researcher at the London School of Economics who was not part of the new review.\n\n\"According to our previous research, there is a bias against testing exercise,\" Naci told Reuters Health by email. \"Medical research increasingly favors drug interventions over strategies to modify lifestyle.\"\n\n\"The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes do not engage in regular exercise,\" Mendes said. \"This may be explained by insufficient awareness about the potential benefits of exercise and the lack of specific knowledge about current recommendations.\"\n\nAdvising patients to increase their exercise levels is not enough, he said. Prescriptions should include specific information on the type, mode, duration, intensity and weekly frequency, and the exercise strategies must be adapted for each individual, based on other health conditions, contraindications and realistic personal goals.\n\n\"According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly one third of doctors prescribe exercise in primary care,\" Naci said. \"This is promising, but more doctors should discuss and give brief advice to their patients about the benefits of exercise and refer patients with diabetes to structured exercise programs.\"\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1R7iECk British Journal of Sports Medicine, online December 30, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "exercise, prescriptions, important, type, 2, diabetes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors should provide diabetics with the specific type, duration, intensity, and frequency of workouts they need to better manage their condition.", "title": "Exercise Prescriptions Important For Type 2 Diabetes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/exercise-prescriptions-important-type-2-diabetes-368698", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/09/type-2-diabetes.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors should provide diabetics with the specific type, duration, intensity, and frequency of workouts they need to better manage their condition.", "title": "Exercise Prescriptions Important For Type 2 Diabetes", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/exercise-prescriptions-important-type-2-diabetes-368698", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/09/type-2-diabetes.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/09/type-2-diabetes.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2016-01-09T11:37:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-09T11:37:11-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors should provide diabetics with the specific type, duration, intensity, and frequency of workouts they need to better manage their condition."}, "article_summary": "\"The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes do not engage in regular exercise,\" Mendes said.\nPatients with type 2 diabetes should be given exercise \"prescriptions\" that specify the type, duration, intensity and frequency of workouts, adapted to the individual, according to a new review.\nAlthough exercise improves blood sugar control, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, most people with diabetes do not engage in regular exercise, the authors write.\n\"Regular exercise and a healthy nutritional pattern are the basis of the treatment.\"\nThey included 11 publications from institutions like the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, American Diabetes Association, Francophone Diabetes Society and Swedish National Institute of Health."}
