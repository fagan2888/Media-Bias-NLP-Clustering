Butch Otter said Monday he was \u201ca little disappointed\u201d state lawmakers took no action to close the state\u2019s health coverage gap for the working poor, but he said he won\u2019t call a special session or issue an executive order.\n\nInstead, he\u2019ll work with the Legislature\u2019s new task force between now and next year.\n\n\u201cA year ago, we weren\u2019t even talking about this sort of thing,\u201d Otter said at a Capitol news conference called to give his reaction to the just-concluded legislative session. Now, there are two ideas that have to be melded into an \u201cIdaho solution\u201d to the health coverage gap problem, he said.\n\nIn the final days of the session last week, the Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation directing the state to apply for a waiver from federal authorities to tap Medicaid expansion funds as a block grant. That money would be used to provide a new managed-care plan to the 78,000 Idahoans who make too little to qualify for subsidized insurance through Idaho\u2019s health insurance exchange, but too much to qualify for Medicaid. A day later, the House rejected the bill on a party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing it.\n\nInstead, House Speaker Scott Bedke announced he\u2019ll appoint a group of lawmakers to work to find a solution for next year\u2019s Legislature to consider.\n\nOtter, who over the last three years appointed two separate task forces that studied the issue at length before recommending accepting the federal funds, said he knows the coverage gap is a problem. \u201cThose who would suggest that the Republicans in the Legislature don\u2019t care about those 78,000 are dead wrong \u2013 we do care. We just are trying to get a solution and not make false promises,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, in response to questions from reporters, said he may have erred by only appointing a few state lawmakers to his two Medicaid Redesign Working Groups.\n\n\u201cMostly they were not made up of those people that could vote on what they had generated,\u201d Otter said, \u201cand that\u2019s a pretty important aspect.\u201d\n\nOtter said he\u2019s hoping Bedke\u2019s working group will call on the experts who contributed to his previous efforts to find a solution.\n\n\u201cI counted more on the experts than I counted votes,\u201d Otter said, \u201cbecause I thought, you know, once we can see a clear path, we\u2019ll just do the right thing. I think it\u2019s time that we included those votes on those working committees.\u201d\n\nAsked about testimony provided to the Legislature this year by a critical care doctor in Idaho Falls who estimated that 1,000 Idahoans have died prematurely in the past three years for lack of health coverage and predicted more than 300 more deaths in the next year if Idaho doesn\u2019t act, Otter said he wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cThe idea that people are dying because they don\u2019t have health care in Idaho, I don\u2019t totally agree with that,\u201d Otter said. \u201cI think the doctor was off-base. I see plenty of people that die every day in hospitals and they have insurance, and they\u2019re in the hospital, but they still die. If it were easy, I guess we would have accomplished it a long time ago.\u201d\n\nThe doctor, Kenneth Krell of the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, told legislators of a patient \u2013 Jenny Steinke of Idaho Falls \u2013 who died from complications from asthma. She lacked insurance to cover what would have been relatively simple treatment earlier, Krell said.\n\nBedke said the Idaho House has heard the \u201chyperbole and horror stories.\u201d What\u2019s needed now, and what the people of Idaho have, is \u201ca firm commitment from the House of Representatives that we want to do something on this issue,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is going to take four to tango here,\u201d including the state House and Senate, the governor\u2019s office and the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which would need to approve a waiver to use federal funds.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act originally envisioned all states expanding Medicaid to serve their lowest-income residents, while those with slightly higher incomes could use their state insurance exchanges.\n\nA U.S. Supreme Court decision made Medicaid expansion optional for states; 31 states, including Washington, have exercised the option, but Idaho hasn\u2019t.\n\nClose the Gap Idaho, a coalition of medical, civic and advocacy groups that has been pressing for action on the issue, posted on its website, \u201cNow we have to wait at least another year. We are grateful for the courage and compassion of many legislators, and for the many thousands of Idahoans who contacted their legislators to show their support for Idahoans in the gap. But we are heartbroken for the 78,000 Idahoans who still do not have access to health care.\u201d\n\nLauren Necochea, director of Idaho Voices for Children, a coalition member, saidmost of the Idahoans in the gap are working at least one job and have children at home.\n\n\u201cIt is urgent that Idaho closes the coverage gap,\u201d she said. \u201cThe lives of Idahoans and the economic stability of our families are under threat until we address this critical issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Idaho Gov.
