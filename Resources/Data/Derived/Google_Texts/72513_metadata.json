The women filed their motion for intervention anonymously in the appellate court Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThese women are the people principally affected by the outcome of the case, so their voice ought to be fully heard,\u201d said Ayesha N. Khan, legal director for the Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.\n\n\u201cThey contacted us because they were very concerned about this and very much in need of contraception and hopeful that they would finally be able to obtain access to it,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThey were very disheartened by the position that Notre Dame has taken.\u201d\n\nUniversity spokesman Paul Browne reserved comment on the new motion, referring to a past statement that its lawsuit \u201cis about the freedom of a religious organization to live its mission.\u201d\n\nTo date there are 91 lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the mandate. The three Notre Dame students are the first individuals seeking to voice objections in court over their institution\u2019s challenge of the contraception mandate, according to interest groups involved in the cases.\n\nArguing for anonymity, Khan said the litigation potentially could force the women to publicize personal information about their sexual activity. She also said there was the likelihood of retaliation from the community, referring to the protests about President Barack Obama appearing on campus in 2009 to receive an honorary doctorate and deliver a commencement speech.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of courage to do this,\u201d Khan said. \u201cStudents are obviously at the mercy of \u2026 the university they attend. Employees are likewise dependent on their employers for their very livelihood. Neither students or employees are going to take lightly the prospect of prejudicing their status at the institution.\u201d\n\nJudith Fox, a clinical professor of law at Notre Dame, supports the women\u2019s decision to maintain anonymity. She said the students approached several faculty members to join them in the motion to intervene, but none was willing for fear of retaliation or because they were beyond their child-bearing years.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "Three students who say the University of Notre Dame should include contraception in its health care coverage are seeking to intervene in their school\u2019s lawsuit challenging the federal...", "title": "3 Notre Dame students weigh in on school's lawsuit against health care law", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-08/news/chi-3-notre-dame-students-weigh-in-on-schools-lawsuit-against-health-care-law-20140108_1_contraception-mandate-religious-employers-health-care-law", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-52cddde7/turbine/chi-3-notre-dame-students-weigh-in-on-schools--001/2048/2048x1436", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818}, "description": "Three students who say the University of Notre Dame should include contraception in its health care coverage are seeking to intervene in their school\u2019s lawsuit challenging the federal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc47\"", "article_summary": "Three students who say the University of Notre Dame should include contraception in its health care coverage are seeking to intervene in their school\u2019s lawsuit challenging the federal government\u2019s birth-control mandate.\n3 Notre Dame students weigh in on school's lawsuit against health care lawThe three unidentified women said in their motion Wednesday that they are entitled to participate in the lawsuit because they will be directly affected by its outcome.\nThe three Notre Dame students are the first individuals seeking to voice objections in court over their institution\u2019s challenge of the contraception mandate, according to interest groups involved in the cases.\nNeither students or employees are going to take lightly the prospect of prejudicing their status at the institution.\u201dJudith Fox, a clinical professor of law at Notre Dame, supports the women\u2019s decision to maintain anonymity.\nIn December, a judge ruled against Notre Dame\u2019s lawsuit, and the university appealed to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago."}
