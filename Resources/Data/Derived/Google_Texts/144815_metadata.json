The small community of some 2,500 residents was \"erased\" by the overflowing water from the Mississippi River during the Great Flood of 1993. With help from the U.S. government, the village was rebuilt on nearby bluffs \"where it thrives today,\" says Nicholas Pinter, professor of geology at Southern Illinois University.\n\nIf other solutions aren\u2019t implemented, many floodplain residents in America may face similarly forced migrations.\n\nThe National Flood Insurance Program is some $24 billion in the hole. Many homeowners in flood zones are beginning to feel that fiscal pain as flood insurance premiums skyrocket. Rate increases of 18% to 25% for some policyholders have gone into effect as of April 1, with additional surcharges up to $250.\n\nClimate change and subsidies, or FEMA mismanagement?\n\nBlame it on climate change and decades of premiums lagging risk, professor Pinter says, but the \"government handout\" of flood insurance subsidies will have to end \u2014 with homeowners absorbing a \"doubling or tripling, or in some cases much more,\" increase in premiums \u2014 or else floodplain residents should consider moving to higher ground.\n\nGeorge Kasimos, a real estate agent in Toms River, N.J., knows a thing or two about flood insurance . His home was damaged by Superstorm Sandy, but his claim was paid, and he rebuilt. Kasimos says the $24 billion flood insurance shortfall is due to the bureaucracy and \"mismanagement\" of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Homeowners in flood zones face rapidly increasing insurance premiums, falling home values \u2014 and perhaps even forced relocation.", "author": "Hal Bundrick", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Homeowners in flood zones face rapidly increasing insurance premiums, falling home values \u2014 and perhaps even forced relocation.", "title": "Flood Insurance Crisis: If the High Water Doesn\u2019t Get You, the High Premiums Might", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/flood-insurance-crisis-if-the-high-water-doesnt-get-you-the-high-premiums-might", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/homeinsurancebook.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/homeinsurancebook.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "flood insurance, hazard insurance, homeowners policy, superstorm sandy, katrina, disaster insurance", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "disaster insurance", "published_time": "2015-04-21T08:07Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1608888"}, "date": "2015-04-21T08:07Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13117794, "twitter": {"description": "Homeowners in flood zones face rapidly increasing insurance premiums, falling home values \u2014 and perhaps even forced relocation.", "title": "Flood Insurance Crisis: If the High Water Doesn\u2019t Get You, the High Premiums Might", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/flood-insurance-crisis-if-the-high-water-doesnt-get-you-the-high-premiums-might", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/homeinsurancebook.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/homeinsurancebook.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "flood insurance, hazard insurance, homeowners policy, superstorm sandy, katrina, disaster insurance"}, "article_summary": "Many homeowners in flood zones are beginning to feel that fiscal pain as flood insurance premiums skyrocket.\nKasimos says the $24 billion flood insurance shortfall is due to the bureaucracy and \"mismanagement\" of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nThe National Flood Insurance Program is some $24 billion in the hole.\nGeorge Kasimos, a real estate agent in Toms River, N.J., knows a thing or two about flood insurance .\nThe small community of some 2,500 residents was \"erased\" by the overflowing water from the Mississippi River during the Great Flood of 1993."}
