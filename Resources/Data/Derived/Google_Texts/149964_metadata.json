Similar strategies have been employed by other large multinationals like Google and Apple. In Facebook\u2019s case, one subsidiary, Facebook Ireland Limited, collects advertising revenue from around the world. In 2012, for example, it boasted a profit of \u20ac1.75 billion (or about $2.3 billion), but that quickly turned into a pre-tax loss of \u20ac626,000 (or about $850,000) when the company paid \u20ac1.75bn in \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d tied to the use of intellectual property to the second subsidiary, Facebook Holdings Limited, the Financial Times reported.\n\nThe string of money moves dramatically reduced the taxes Facebook owed for 2012. In the end, Facebook reportedly paid \u20ac1.9 million (about $2.6 million) in Irish corporate taxes even as revenues surged to \u20ac1.79 billion.\n\nRelated: Tax Havens: Offshore Operations Cost U.S. Billions\n\nThe company defended its tax payments. \u201cFacebook complies with all relevant corporate regulations including those related to filing company reports and taxation. We have our international headquarters in Ireland that employs almost 400 people and a series of smaller local offices providing support services all over Europe. Dublin was selected as the best location to hire staff with the right skills to run a multilingual hi-tech operation serving the whole of Europe,\u201d a spokesman for Facebook said in a statement.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the social media giant\u2019s tax practices have come under scrutiny. Earlier this year, the Center for Tax Justice, a left leaning tax advocacy group, released a report saying Facebook paid a negative tax rate in 2012, as company filings showed it would receive a tax refund of $429 million despite booking $1.1 billion in U.S. profits. The tax refund resulted from Facebook\u2019s use of a tax break that allows companies to treat executive stock options the way they treat compensation\u2014as an expense that trims their profits. The company\u2019s CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg paid a bigger tax bill last year \u2013 about $1 billion.\n\nFacebook is not alone, of course. In fact, every year U.S. multinational corporations avoid paying an estimated $90 billion in federal income taxes by sheltering profits in subsidiaries registered in tax havens, according to a report issued earlier this year by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG).\n\nThe report showed that the top 100 publically traded U.S. corporations, including tech giants Apple, Microsoft and Google, had a collective $1.17 trillion stored offshore. Just 15 companies accounted for about two-thirds of that total.\n\nHere are the top 10 companies sheltering the most money offshore, according to PIRG.\n\nGeneral Electric: GE has the most money parked offshore. In 2012, it held at least $108 billion abroad, with the money distributed across 18 subsidiaries in tax havens like Bermuda, Bahamas and Ireland.\n\nApple: The tech titan stores $102 billion offshore \u2013 under three Irish subsidiaries, two of which have no employees. PIRG estimates that if Apple didn\u2019t harbor these profits offshore, it would owe the U.S. government $26 billion in taxes. Instead, it paid an effective tax rate of 3.4 percent on its offshore cash.\n\nPfizer: The world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company operates 174 subsidiaries in tax havens and currently stores $73 billion offshore. According to PIRG, Pfizer made more than 40 percent of its sales in the U.S. between 2010 and 2012 and still managed to report no federal taxable income in the U.S.\n\nMicrosoft: The company reported that five offshore subsidiaries held $60.8 billion in 2012. PIRG estimated that the software giant would owe $19.4 billion in U.S. taxes if it didn\u2019t use tax havens. Microsoft also uses a subsidiary in Puerto Rico to avoid U.S. taxes on 47 percent of its U.S. sales, a Senate investigation found last year.\n\nMerck: One of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, New Jersey-based Merck Co., had an estimated $53.4 billion offshore at 151 different subsidiaries in tax haven countries.\n\nJohnson & Johnson: The company may be based in New Jersey but it harbored an estimated $49 billion abroad. It operates 55 different subsidiaries in tax havens like Ireland, Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Singapore.\n\nIBM: The tech and financial consulting corporation headquartered in New York stored $44.4 billion offshore in 2012 through 16 different subsidiaries.\n\nExxon Mobil: The Texas-based oil giant generated some $450 billion in 2012 revenue. It had $43 billion offshore, controlled by 36 different subsidiaries in places like Bermuda, Luxembourg and Hong Kong, among others.\n\nCitigroup: The bank reported operating 427 tax haven subsidiaries in 2008 but disclosed only 20 in 2012. Over that time period, Citigroup increased the amount of cash it reported holding offshore from $21.1 billion to $42.6 billion, ranking the company ninth on PIRG\u2019s list.\n\nCisco Systems: The California-based tech company shelters $41.3 billion offshore. It reported having 47 different subsidiaries in places like Bahrain, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Jordan and Ireland.\n\nFollow Brianna Ehley on Twitter: @BriannaEhley\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Facebook reportedly sheltered more than $1 billion in profits earned overseas in the Cayman Islands last year.", "title": "Facebook \u2018Likes\u2019 Tax Schemes to Avoid Paying Uncle Sam", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/08/Facebook-Likes-Tax-Schemes-Avoid-Paying-Uncle-Sam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/01242012_Facebook_HQ_13_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/08/Facebook-Likes-Tax-Schemes-Avoid-Paying-Uncle-Sam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/01242012_Facebook_HQ_13_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Facebook reportedly sheltered more than $1 billion in profits earned overseas in the Cayman Islands last year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Tax Havens: Offshore Operations Cost U.S.\nThe string of money moves dramatically reduced the taxes Facebook owed for 2012.\nPfizer: The world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical company operates 174 subsidiaries in tax havens and currently stores $73 billion offshore.\nIt operates 55 different subsidiaries in tax havens like Ireland, Hong Kong, Luxembourg and Singapore.\nPIRG estimated that the software giant would owe $19.4 billion in U.S. taxes if it didn\u2019t use tax havens."}
