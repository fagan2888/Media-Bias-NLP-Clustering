Those of us who grew up in conservative Christian churches know all too well the culture that shapes the parenting beliefs of people like Peterson.\n\nToday, the most notable proponents of spanking are American evangelicals. They not only preach the gospel of corporal punishment, they also impart messages that lay the foundations for abuses against children and the protection of such abuse by our legal system.\n\nWe have books about spanking. Popular Christian talk shows promote the benefits of spanking. Pastors preach and theologize spanking. Organizations like Focus on the Family offer parents resources about how and when to spank.\n\nThe ties between Christianity and corporal punishment are so strong that a large number of conservative Christians parents simple deny studies that suggest spanking does more harm than good.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that evangelical churches are to blame for what Peterson did to his son. But the church isn\u2019t innocent in the matter, either.\n\nWithout the church, the popularity of spanking would have dwindled. Stricter laws would probably be in place to protect the rights and livelihoods of children. And people like Peterson would not feel as though he has a license to do whatever he wants to his child.\n\nFor decades, American evangelicals have fiercely fought any legal or cultural limits on parents\u2019 \u201crights\u201d to discipline their children.\n\nAs a result, American children are some of the least protected people in the world. They are often innocent pawns to the vile disciplinarian doctrine of folks like Michael and Debi Pearl, pro-spanking theologians who suggest that corporal punishment should begin when a child is only 6 months old.\n\nBut spanking theologies are not simply the teachings of Christian extremists.\n\nI was spanked. Not simply because my father was spanked or because I grew up in a part of the country where spanking was deemed acceptable but because my family and I belonged to a church that often preached the \u201cgood news\u201d of spanking.\n\nSpanking wasn\u2019t simply one of my parents disciplinary methods; it was a part of their gospel at the time, an idea that they believed was commanded by God in the Book of Proverbs:\n\nWithhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. (Proverbs 23: 13-14)\n\nThose verses trumped all other outside messages that suggested spanking wasn\u2019t good for a child.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t believe my parents enjoyed spanking, because our pastor said that parents disobeying God by not spanking their kids would result in the ruination of America, they spanked me.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a Christian parent who doesn\u2019t spank my kids. Not because I don\u2019t believe in being obedient to God but because I think the Bible, at least as interpreted by a large number of God-fearing Americans, is wrong about spanking.\n\nBut many evangelicals believe that God is an Almighty spanker and that in order to be \u201cgood Christian parents,\u201d they must obey God and spank their kids.\n\nThat faith-based ideology is what has manufactured the American culture of spanking. It\u2019s also why so many conservative Christians are among Peterson\u2019s most vocal apologists, because obedience to God trumps the rights of children in favor of the benefit of the doubt for parents.\n\nThat\u2019s why the details of Peterson\u2019s crimes, pictures that showcase the lacerations and bruises on his child\u2019s back, buttocks, hands and scrotum, don\u2019t change their minds about the benefits of spanking.\n\nThey believe that God suggested \u201cspare the rod, spoil the child\u201d - a phrase that never appears in the Bible - and they will do whatever it takes to protect their rights to do just that.\n\nBecause of scenarios like Peterson\u2019s, many of the loudest Christian cheerleaders promoting spanking have, in recent years, added boundaries, caveats and kinder language to their pro-spanking positions.\n\nThese edits and limitations are meant to make their encouragement of biblical discipline less rigid and more socially acceptable, at least in theory.\n\nIn the end, the Christian doctrine of spanking isn\u2019t about obeying scripture or God; after all, nobody is promoting God\u2019s idea of our stoning our kids for disrespecting their parents as outlined in Leviticus 20:9.\n\nChristian spanking is about parents wanting to wield control, instill their values and put children in their place when they question their parent\u2019s authority.\n\nA few hours after being let out of jail on bail, Peterson tweeted Bible verses and Christian devotionals in his defense against his critics.\n\npic.twitter.com/MWx2msqj9d \u2014 Adrian Peterson (@AdrianPeterson) September 14, 2014\n\nThis suggests that spanking his kid wasn\u2019t just a onetime mistake. It seems engrained into Peterson's faith: that God has given him a license to beat his children.\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing holy, good or true about that.\n\nMatthew Paul Turner is the author of \"Our Great Big American God: A Short History of Our Ever-Growing Deity.\" The views expressed in this column belong to Turner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opinion by Matthew Paul Turner, special to CNN (CNN) \u2013 There\u2019s one detail about the Adrian Peterson child abuse charges that no one seems to be noting:\u00a0his\u00a0alleged crimes didn\u2019t happen simply under the guise of \u201cparenting\u201d but rather \u201cChristian parenting.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Adrian Peterson and the false gospel of spanking", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/16/adrian-peterson-and-the-false-gospel-of-spanking/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140915222406-ac-adrian-peters-triggers-new-debate-on-abuse-00014914-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Opinion by Matthew Paul Turner, special to CNN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) \u2013 There\u2019s one detail about the Adrian Peterson child abuse charges that no one seems to be noting:\u00a0his\u00a0alleged crimes didn\u2019t happen simply under the guise of \u201cparenting\u201d but rather \u201cChristian parenting.", "title": "Adrian Peterson and the false gospel of spanking"}, "keywords": "belief, bible, christianity, crime, culture wars, ethics, evangelicals, opinion, violence, adrian peterson, bible, corporal punishment, evangelicals, spanking", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/16/adrian-peterson-and-the-false-gospel-of-spanking/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe042c\"", "article_summary": "Matthew Paul Turner is the author of \"Our Great Big American God: A Short History of Our Ever-Growing Deity.\"\nAs a result, American children are some of the least protected people in the world.\npic.twitter.com/MWx2msqj9d \u2014 Adrian Peterson (@AdrianPeterson) September 14, 2014This suggests that spanking his kid wasn\u2019t just a onetime mistake.\nChristian spanking is about parents wanting to wield control, instill their values and put children in their place when they question their parent\u2019s authority.\nFor decades, American evangelicals have fiercely fought any legal or cultural limits on parents\u2019 \u201crights\u201d to discipline their children."}
