(Photo: Henrietta Wildsmith/The Times)\n\nAbby\u2019s 13-year-old son Travis (not their real names) had a history of fighting \u2014 in school, out of school, whenever he had the chance. Abby said she tried to take care of the situation at home, but she couldn\u2019t get her son to change his actions. Nothing seemed to work.\n\n\u201cHe would sneak out at night to meet up with friends,\u201d Abby said. \u201cI would have to call the police to find him. He was destructive.\u201d\n\nThen, Travis was enrolled in Caddo\u2019s Individualized Disposition Docket Court \u2014 the state\u2019s first mental health court for children with severe mental or behavioral challenges \u2014 where for the first time the family had access to counseling, educational support and a parole officer who regularly checked in on Travis. Today, Abby said her son\u2019s life has turned around.\n\n\u201cHis number of problems have gone down. His grades are up, they offer counseling, he has a mentor that stops by and checks on him,\u201d Abby said. \u201cThey should have more parents going through it. They help families.\u201d\n\nAbby and Travis \u2014 The Times has agreed to withhold their identity to protect their privacy \u2014 are an example of how children and families can turn their lives around when given access to needed services. But officials say a lack of critical mental health providers can set the state\u2019s most at-risk children up for failure that results in imprisonment in jails, hospitals and residential treatment facilities.\n\n\u201cOur mental health system is definitely broken,\u201d said Judge Paul Young, who established Caddo Juvenile Services\u2019 IDD Court as a pro-active step to help the area\u2019s children. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have this program, kids get placed and have to stay in detention, which is expensive and also through the (Office of Juvenile Justice) which is also very expensive.\u201d\n\nYoung said his previous work with individuals in need of psychiatric care helped him realize poor populations often rely on the court system for counseling and treatment. The services provided by the IDD Court have reduced the number of children in out-of-home placements and also have reduced the number of children who re-offend. Young said the court, established over four years ago, has reduced out-of-home placement for children from more than 50 percent to less than 15 percent. The judge estimated it costs about $50,000 per year to house a child in a facility; with 74 percent of children completing the program successfully \u2014 meaning they don\u2019t reoffend \u2014 that\u2019s significant savings and also fewer youth experiencing further trauma when placed outside their homes.\n\nBut when access to those services is interrupted or suspended \u2014 or when at-risk children don\u2019t have access to those services to begin with \u2014 they become more likely to get into trouble with the law.\n\nMore than 70,000 children in Louisiana receive mental or behavioral health services through Medicaid, according to 2014 data from the Department of Health and Hospitals. Close to 2,000 of those children are from Bossier and nearly 4,000 are from Caddo. In 2013, Louisiana adopted a Coordinated System of Care modelto help accommodate children\u2019s mental health care needs by listing a full spectrum of services including youth and parent support, independent living skills, and two specific crisis intervention services: respite care and crisis stabilization.\n\nSara Godchaux, aSouthern Poverty Law Center attorney, said the spectrum of care looks good on paper. But in reality, crisis stabilization services in Louisiana are literally non-existent, and a general lack of providers leaves local agencies struggling to meet children\u2019s mental health care needs, Godchaux said.\n\n\u201cMore than two and a half years after the creation of the program, huge gaps remain in the provision of CSoC services, preventing eligible children and youth from accessing the full benefits of the program and putting these children at further risk of out-of home placement,\u201d Godchaux wrote in a 2014 letter to the state Centers for Medicaid and Medicare. \u201cFamilies and providers participating in CSoC similarly report that respite care remains either nonexistent, unavailable when needed, or at best, inconsistently delivered.\u201d\n\nA lack of crisis intervention services\n\nIn a response letter to SPLC, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare stated it was a challenge to provide crisis intervention services because only a small number of children needed the services. That small population \u2014 fewer than 2,000\u2014 remains a problem in the current day, said state Medicaid director Ruth Kennedy.\n\nKennedy said the limited number of children in CSoC in need of crisis interventions has caused a lack of investment from service providers. She added the agency has submitted a statewide Medicaid plan that would open crisis intervention services to all children who could benefit from them \u2014 not just the ones in CSoC\u2014 to create more demand for the services to interest providers and also provide another service to all families.\n\nBut Kennedy said the mental health care system\u2019s success does not hinge completely on the availability of crisis intervention services.\n\n\u201cCrisis intervention is one of a list of services available,\u201d Kennedy said, referencing the other services available in the spectrum of care. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to adequately draw conclusions about such a complex system. With the first three years of everything we\u2019ve done, our results are impressive.\u201d\n\nAccording to DHH data, the total number of children placed in restrictive environments dropped from 32.4 percent, before enrollment in CSoC, to 18 percent, after enrollment in CSoC \u2014 proof CSoC services are working, DHH spokesperson Samantha Faulkner said. At the end of June, DHH data also showed a 45 percent decline in emergency room visits, a 46 percent decline in bed days and a 25 percent drop in readmission rates for inpatient care for CSoC youth.\n\nWhile DHH data may show improvements for some children, officials from SPLC and The Advocacy Center said the lack of crisis intervention services remains unacceptable.\n\nIn a 2014 letter, the Advocacy Center in New Orleans and SPLC said the centers\u2019 failure to provide crisis intervention services puts many families and their children at risk. Children in crisis who lack access to services are often arrested and put in detention centers or hospitals, the letter said.\n\n\u201cOver two years later, Louisiana\u2019s implementation of the program remains deeply flawed,\u201d the letter stated. \u201cThis failure to provide mandated and essential services not only puts these children and youth in touch with the criminal justice system, jails and hospitals, but is also contradictory to the overarching purpose of CSoC \u2014 to keep youth out of institutions and in the community.\u201d\n\nLouisiana has four primary hospitals with units equipped to handle children in need of intensive services: Brentwood hospital in Shreveport, Liberty Health Care Systems in Bastrop, Children\u2019s Hospital in New Orleans and Longleaf Hospital in Alexandria. Three of these hospitals reported transferring children, at times, to alternative placement sites \u2014 sometimes an hour or more away from the child\u2019s family and community \u2014 due to maxed out capacity. The hospitals also voiced frustrations in finding adequate mental health providers for children once they left the hospital setting.\n\nA reliance on law enforcement and hospitalization\n\nThe lack of crisis intervention providers means they often aren\u2019t included in youth service plans, Godchaux said. As a result, parents of children who act out are often told to turn to law enforcement or temporary hospitalization as first responders.\n\n\u201cRelying on police to respond to a child in a mental health crisis puts that child at an increased risk of arrest and incarceration \u2013 simply for experiencing a mental health crisis,\u201d Godchaux said. \u201cThe purpose of home and community-based crisis services, such as respite care and crisis stabilization, is to provide alternatives to law enforcement or hospitalization...the very places the state\u2019s Coordinated System of Care is designed to help children avoid.\u201d\n\nKeturah Darby, regional program manager at Ekhaya Youth Project in Shreveport, said possible solutions to the lack of care need to include the family and a down-to-earth approach. The values of Ekhaya include providing culturally-competent services that are family driven, youth guided, and home and community-based, which take into account a child\u2019s natural networks of support. Darby said care also is unconditional, meaning that once a family is enrolled in Ekhaya they will have access to the program\u2019s services.\n\n\u201cIf juveniles are on house arrest, where they can\u2019t go out and do anything, how does that help them?\u201d Darby said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really know about Ekhaya. They\u2019re starting to find out, and they\u2019re interested.\u201d\n\nEkhaya is the only family support organization in the state, Darby said, and provides a strength-based approach to working with children and their families. Darby said the program has received good feedback from enrolled families, but many families who have been through juvenile justice systems decline help based on past experiences.\n\nEnrollment requirements for the Ekhaya program include Medicaid, a mental health diagnosis, and the youth and a related adult\u2019s participation. Once enrolled, youth and their families have access to mentoring, academic support, direct peer and parent support services, advocacy services and life skill training. The center\u2019s computer lab can be used by youth for research, filling out job applications or applying to colleges. An on-site kitchen and classrooms also teach students skills to empower their independence, such as how to cook healthful meals or to properly clean an apartment.\n\nDespite the many services Ekhaya provides, Darby said some families are wary of enrolling when they first hear of the program.\n\n\u201cParents with kids with mental health issues have been through so many things. They see so many people, and nothing changes in their perspective,\u201d Darby said. \u201cOne of their first reactions when they meet us is, \u2018Why are you here?\u2019\u201d\n\nLocal agency takes matters into its own hands\n\nCaddo\u2019s children\u2019s mental health court has helped break that stigma.\n\nYoung equipped the IDD court system with two parole officers and a supervisor who had backgrounds in mental health. The court develops a treatment plan for juvenile offenders that includes individual and family therapy and regular check-ins with a parole officer who acts as a coordinator and mentor as well as an authority figure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we came in the company of the IDD court,\u201d said another mother, whose 14-year-old daughter was referred to the IDD court for breaking probation. The Times also is withholding their identity for privacy. \u201cThey actually help people. They provide counselors, they\u2019re always finding services for the families.\u201d\n\nLaMarcus Williams, a parole officer with the court, said a small caseload size \u2014 currently nine kids \u2014 and his background in mental health help him form better relationships with children and their families.\n\n\u201cI want for the kids to understand their parole officer is there to help them. I don\u2019t want them on probation for life, stuck in the system,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think the rehabilitative approach is greatly appreciated by families and their kids.\u201d\n\nFor Young, solutions include restored funding to a true continuum of care for children and adults on both the state-wide and national levels.\n\n\u201cThis starts with a comprehensive system of community-based treatment and preventative services, along with an effective crisis intervention team of professionals whose purpose is to intercede in emergencies, stabilize and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations,\u201d Young wrote in an email. \u201cShort-term and intermediate hospital treatment needs to be available on a regional basis.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1R3UU26", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "More than 70,000 children in Louisiana who are eligible for Medicaid receive mental or behavioral health services, according to 2014 data from the Department of Health and Hospitals.", "og": {"site_name": "thenewsstar.com", "description": "More than 70,000 children in Louisiana who are eligible for Medicaid receive mental or behavioral health services, according to 2014 data from the Department of Health and Hospitals.", "title": "Children\u2019s mental health services shortage puts children at risk", "url": "http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/local/2016/01/02/childrens-mental-health-services-shortage-puts-children-risk/78212306/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thenewsstar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 70,000 children in Louisiana who are eligible for Medicaid receive mental or behavioral health services, according to 2014 data from the Department of Health and Hospitals.", "title": "Children\u2019s mental health services shortage puts children at risk", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/083587041fad18eed950a1d0c8cd80ffa59d0b75/c=1090-0-4387-3297&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/02/Monroe/B9320349026Z.1_20160102175255_000_GVED1HUNR.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@thenewsstar", "site": "@thenewsstar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=820377811", "fb": {"app_id": 174541472579431}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRelying on police to respond to a child in a mental health crisis puts that child at an increased risk of arrest and incarceration \u2013 simply for experiencing a mental health crisis,\u201d Godchaux said.\nBut Kennedy said the mental health care system\u2019s success does not hinge completely on the availability of crisis intervention services.\nMore than 70,000 children in Louisiana receive mental or behavioral health services through Medicaid, according to 2014 data from the Department of Health and Hospitals.\nThe hospitals also voiced frustrations in finding adequate mental health providers for children once they left the hospital setting.\n\u201cOur mental health system is definitely broken,\u201d said Judge Paul Young, who established Caddo Juvenile Services\u2019 IDD Court as a pro-active step to help the area\u2019s children."}
