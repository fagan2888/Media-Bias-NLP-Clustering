Trump\u2019s candidacy with, gulp, Ted Cruz: You brought it on yourselves.\n\nNot just by failing for too long to take Mr. Trump seriously or by lacking an effective response once you did. That\u2019s well-covered territory. Most important, you created the anger that lifted his candidacy by years of systematically and effectively preventing passage of legislation that might have ameliorated the tough economic state of Mr. Trump\u2019s core voters.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s biggest supporters are disproportionately white, middle-aged, working-class men without college educations, a group whose fortunes have flagged as globalization and new technology have rendered millions of jobs obsolete and cut into the wages of many more. While the trade agreements that Mr. Trump bashes have played a role, the mistake was not having entered into them, but having failed to sufficiently help affected workers adjust to the new dynamics.\n\nWho Likes Him Best (and Least) Men and lower-income voters are among Donald J. Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters. Here are groups that have voted for Trump in greater or smaller numbers than his average primary support of 39.1 percent. Figures in percentage points. LESS SUPPORT GREATER Male Female +2.9 \u20135.6 AGE 18-29* 30-44 45-64 65+ \u20138.9 \u20134.0 +0.5 +0.7 EDUCATION +7.0 H.S. or less Some college College grad Post-grad +3.4 \u20134.5 \u201312.1 INCOME +4.9 Under $50K $50-$100K $100K + \u20132.5 \u20133.7\n\nFor too many, those new dynamics have been painful indeed. In Michigan, where Mr. Trump won big, wages in manufacturing have fallen from a high of $28 per hour in 2003 to $21 at present, after adjustment for inflation, a stunning 25 percent decline.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of manufacturing jobs in the state has fallen from almost 900,000 in September 1999 to just under 600,000 at present, a picture that is repeated across the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThroughout his presidency, Mr. Obama has put forward constructive proposals to help those displaced workers. For its part, the Republican Congress has been behaving like Nero.\n\nTake, for example, the administration\u2019s 2011 proposal of a $447 billion package of measures including payroll tax cuts and the creation of an infrastructure bank that would have led to the creation of thousands of construction jobs, as well as other substantial economic benefits.\n\nDesigned to be bipartisan and fully paid for by higher taxes on rich Americans and some corporations, the American Jobs Act was nonetheless dead virtually upon its arrival on Capitol Hill.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. During his administration, Mr. Obama put forth proposals for larger tax credits for child care; community college investments; expansion of the earned-income tax credit; changing retirement plans to be portable across employers and available to part-time workers; and tax credits for manufacturing communities.\n\nMichigan\u2019s Decline $25 800,000 $20 600,000 Total jobs in manufacturing Mfg. wage $15 Average hourly earnings of production workers. 400,000 $10 200,000 $5 \u201990 \u201995 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 \u201903 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 \u201329% \u201327% since 1990 since Feb. 2004 $27.36 845,700 895,800 $25 800,000 $20.07 $20 596,300 600,000 Total jobs in manufacturing Manufacturing wage $15 Average hourly earnings of production workers. \u201329% since 1990 400,000 $10 \u201327% 200,000 since Feb. 2004 $5 \u201990 \u201995 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 \u201903 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915\n\nAll these \u2014 and many more \u2014 were ignored by Congress. Even seemingly obvious steps, like continuing federal emergency benefits for the large number of long-term unemployed, have been blocked. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 19 states \u2014 mostly with Republican governors \u2014 have declined Mr. Obama\u2019s Medicaid expansion plan.\n\nIn its most recent budget, the White House put forth a robust plan for wage insurance, a concept with much support among economists. Under it, a worker who lost his or her job and was forced to take a lower-wage one that paid less than $50,000 per year would receive half of the lost wages for two years, up to $10,000.\n\nLike many of Mr. Obama\u2019s proposals, that wouldn\u2019t be a game changer for working-class Americans, but it would have been a constructive piece of a more comprehensive solution.\n\nLow-Energy Congress Recent sessions were the least productive in many decades.

And Mr. Obama deserves substantial credit for the drop in joblessness on his watch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that\u2019s not sufficient progress. For one thing, Mr. Trump\u2019s support tends to be concentrated in areas with low labor force participation. For another, with real wages declining for many Americans, the enactment of relatively minor initiatives is small beer.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nWhoever wins the Republican nomination, it\u2019s too late to address the concerns of Mr. Trump\u2019s core constituents before November. The anger felt by so many will not be eased until Washington takes affirmative steps.\n\nTo ease the immediate pain, we need a much stronger safety net: extended unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed, wage insurance, a higher minimum wage and the like. Cutting our irrational austerity frenzy to step up investment in infrastructure is a no-brainer. All of this can \u2014 and should \u2014 be paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy.\n\nMr. Trump may have succeeded in directing the anger of his supporters toward Washington in general and President Obama in particular. But Republicans should take heed: Given your shutdown of legislation that would help downtrodden Americans, their anger should really be focused on you.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160413032123, "twitter": {"description": "Congress shut down almost every measure to help the struggling working class.", "title": "By Opposing Obama, the Republicans Created Trump", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/opinion/by-opposing-obama-the-republicans-created-trump.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004313179"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/13/opinion/13rattnerWeb/13rattnerWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/opinion/by-opposing-obama-the-republicans-created-trump.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004313179", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/opinion/by-opposing-obama-the-republicans-created-trump.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Foiling Obama, Congress Made Trump", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 13, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/steven_rattner/", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-04-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Federal Budget (US)", "published": "2016-04-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Trump  Donald J,United States Economy,Presidential Election of 2016,United States Politics and Government,Obama  Barack,Primaries and Caucuses,Labor and Jobs,Factories and Manufacturing,Wages and Salaries,Republican Party,Federal Budget (US)", "interactivegraphic": {"height": {"300": 1088}}, "description": "Congress shut down almost every measure to help the struggling working class.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Steven Rattner", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/13/opinion/13rattnerWeb/13rattnerWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "slug": "13rattner", "byl": "By STEVEN RATTNER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Congress shut down almost every measure to help the struggling working class.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20160413131806, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/13/opinion/13rattnerWeb/13rattnerWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "CN": "steven-rattner", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 13, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "org": "Republican Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "column", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/opinion/by-opposing-obama-the-republicans-created-trump.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/13/opinion/13rattnerWeb/13rattnerWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Congress shut down almost every measure to help the struggling working class.", "title": "By Opposing Obama, the Republicans Created Trump"}, "pdate": 20160413, "des": "Federal Budget (US)", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/steven-rattner", "tagline": "Economics and finance.", "uri": "/column/steven-rattner", "display-name": "Steven Rattner", "identifier": "steven-rattner", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000004313179, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "By Opposing Obama, the Republicans Created Trump", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "Not just by failing for too long to take Mr. Trump seriously or by lacking an effective response once you did.\nMr. Trump may have succeeded in directing the anger of his supporters toward Washington in general and President Obama in particular.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThroughout his presidency, Mr. Obama has put forward constructive proposals to help those displaced workers.\nAnd Mr. Obama deserves substantial credit for the drop in joblessness on his watch.\nWhoever wins the Republican nomination, it\u2019s too late to address the concerns of Mr. Trump\u2019s core constituents before November."}
