However, most libertarians are not anarchists and accept that some tax revenue must be raised to pay for the legitimate functions of government.\n\nAs such, libertarians should advocate for a flat tax, a form of taxation that infringes less upon individual liberty, is more conducive to economic growth, and when done correctly, has minimal collection costs.\n\nThe flat tax has many features that should make it attractive to libertarians. The elimination of progressive marginal tax rates would dramatically enhance incentives to work, save, and invest. People who work hard, invest in their education, or start new enterprises would no longer be overly penalized by punitively rising tax rates.\n\nA flat tax could also help constrain the size of government through limiting political discretion and making it harder for the government to single out specific groups. In contrast to progressive income-tax systems, politicians would no longer be able to propagate the illusion that they can foist the cost of new government programs on higher income taxpayers.\n\nWith all taxpayers facing the same marginal rate, they are likely to be leery of new spending proposals, correctly grasping that the flat tax would mean higher taxes for all, not just a politically unpopular minority. By clearly highlighting the costs of more government to all, a flat tax would increase the constituency for smaller government and deter politicians from proposing new spending.\n\nA flat tax should also reduce the power that special interest lobbies exercise over our political institutions. Presently, the income-tax systems of most nations are packed with deductions and tax credits that benefit select interest groups.\n\nThis narrows the tax base and leads to higher marginal rates than otherwise would be needed to raise sufficient revenue. Under an ideal flat-tax system that replaces the myriad of deductions and credits with one lower rate, legislators would be less favorably disposed towards calls for tax gifts from special interest groups, realizing that granting such preferences would inevitably mean the unpopular prospect of higher taxes on all other taxpayers.\n\nFurther, without these deductions and credits, collection and compliance requirements would drop. This would be welcomed considering the Canada Revenue Agency has over 40,000 employees, making it the single largest Canadian federal government department (National Defense is second with nearly 23,000 employees).\n\nFinally, a flat tax would restore equity to the tax system. Through history, there have been two competing conceptions of fairness, the Aristotelian and the Marxian. To the Aristotelian, fairness means treating people equally under a set of neutrally applied rules. In contrast, the Marxian believes that fairness is not procedural but distributive.\n\nA flat tax would move society away from the flawed Marxist conception of fairness. By levying a uniform rate, it would treat all individuals fairly.\n\nThe flat tax is a largely libertarian reform. While some may find it imperfect, it is imperative that the perfect not become the enemy of the good.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hatherly says the flat tax is much more libertarian than the current progressive system, while Vance argues it's still a wealth-confiscating income tax.", "generator": "Give v1.4.5", "og": {"site_name": "PanAm Post", "description": "Hatherly says the flat tax is much more libertarian than the current progressive system, while Vance argues it's still a wealth-confiscating income tax.", "title": "Debate: Is the Flat Tax a Libertarian Reform?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 710, "identifier": "https://panampost.com/wp-content/uploads/ft-flat-tax-debate.jpg", "height": 350}, "updated_time": "2015-12-15T14:25:01-04:00", "url": "https://panampost.com/editor/2015/07/14/is-the-flat-tax-a-libertarian-reform/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hatherly says the flat tax is much more libertarian than the current progressive system, while Vance argues it's still a wealth-confiscating income tax.", "creator": "@PanAmPost", "image": "https://panampost.com/wp-content/uploads/ft-flat-tax-debate.jpg", "title": "Debate: Is the Flat Tax a Libertarian Reform?", "site": "@PanAmPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100002447837660, "app_id": 272171646459645, "pages": 197511413705974}, "google-site-verification": "ypzV0RhKyEDAxsbXG0ThtpSGZ18ECcSk-fWHTlztAQQ", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/PanAmPost", "section": "Canada", "tag": "IRS", "published_time": "2015-07-14T10:34:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-15T14:25:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The flat tax is a largely libertarian reform.\nFinally, a flat tax would restore equity to the tax system.\nA flat tax could also help constrain the size of government through limiting political discretion and making it harder for the government to single out specific groups.\nBy clearly highlighting the costs of more government to all, a flat tax would increase the constituency for smaller government and deter politicians from proposing new spending.\nThe flat tax has many features that should make it attractive to libertarians."}
