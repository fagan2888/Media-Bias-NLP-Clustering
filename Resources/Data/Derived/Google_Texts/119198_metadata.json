Patients \u201care not looking just for insurance, they\u2019re looking for someone to help them.\u201d The health care system right now leaves patients confused and struggling to deal with its complexities, he said. \u201cI represent an industry and a company that is part of the problem. We recognize it. We have to make it simpler.\u201d\n\nProviders, for their part, need to fully commit to care based on value instead of volume. \u201cCapacity might have to shrink,\u201d he said.\n\nPrefacing his statement with \u201cthis is a little uncomfortable for me,\u201d Broussard said, \u201cthe problem is in this room,\u201d which was filled with roughly 5,000 technology executives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we need more technology, we need to be bold leaders in health care,\u201d he insisted, adding that medical information should not be proprietary. \u201cIt is an asset that should be flowing through the system freely.\u201d\n\nBroussard urged the attendees to join in the effort. \u201cWe can start with interoperability as the base to bring this all together,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a keynote speaker at HIMSS15, Humana President and CEO Bruce Broussard told the audience of roughly 5,000 health technology pros that everyone is doing it wrong.", "csrf-token": "UosuSeKHjlXHBQpoDSZImF5SmOMv3F7w2W0jfUW8PeY=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Technology4_190x127.jpg?1448315757", "description": "As a keynote speaker at HIMSS15, Humana President and CEO Bruce Broussard told the audience of roughly 5,000 health technology pros that everyone is doing it wrong.", "card": "summary", "title": "Humana CEO Tells HIMSS Attendees to Shift Focus from Technology to Patient"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/Technology4_190x127.jpg?1448315757", "type": "Article", "description": "As a keynote speaker at HIMSS15, Humana President and CEO Bruce Broussard told the audience of roughly 5,000 health technology pros that everyone is doing it wrong.", "title": "Humana CEO Tells HIMSS Attendees to Shift Focus from Technology to Patient"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "humana Broussard, health reform hospitals, patient-centered care, himss15, technology patients HIMSS", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02f5\"", "article_summary": "Like Bertolini at HIMSS last year, who predicted major change in the health care system, or Swedish, who has argued for more patient-centered care, Broussard took a strong stand on transforming health care.\n\u201cWe have to change the focus for how we improve health,\u201d and put the patient at the center, Broussard said.\nInsurance company CEOs are emerging as unlikely cheerleaders for health care reform, one of the latest being Bruce Broussard, president and CEO of Humana.\nPatients \u201care not looking just for insurance, they\u2019re looking for someone to help them.\u201d The health care system right now leaves patients confused and struggling to deal with its complexities, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we need more technology, we need to be bold leaders in health care,\u201d he insisted, adding that medical information should not be proprietary."}
