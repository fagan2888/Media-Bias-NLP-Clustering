Gov. Nancy Wyman kicked off the first Connecticut Lions Clubs Women and Family Symposium on Saturday by encouraging women to take care of themselves, in the era of the \u201cPanini generation,\u201d where they put a priority on caring for their spouses, children and aging parents.\n\nHer main advice to the some 75 attendants at Wesleyan University in Middletown was that they should get involved and help change things that need to be changed.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act has helped 550,000 people, the majority of which are women, said Wyman, who chairs the board of Connecticut\u2019s Access Health insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cFinally women are going to get preventive care,\u201d she said, which men have been much better at getting. \u201cWe have to bring women up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen a woman is offered a job she accepts the $35,000 salary, she said.\n\n\u201cA man says,\u2019 I can\u2019t live on that. I have a family,\u2019\u201d said Wyman. \u201cOur granddaughters have to learn how to speak out on this. I see what they do with sports and everything at school, but I also see they sometimes don\u2019t speak out.\u201d\n\nThe minimum wage debate is also an issue important to women, said Wyman.\n\n\u201cWhat you are doing here today is fantastic,\u201d she said, and thanked the Lions Club for their leadership in this new direction.\n\nAs she did 30 years ago by gaining a seat on the Tolland Board of Education, Wyman encouraged people to get involved in politics. She told the story of three women asking her to run for the school board, but three months after winning a seat she had not heard from them. She called them on it.\n\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked them.\n\nPoliticians want support during elections, but that\u2019s not where the public\u2019s support should end, she said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let them get away between that time,\u201d she said. \u201cIf things are wrong and you\u2019re unhappy, pick up the phone and call them.\u201d\n\nShe invited the audience to visit her office.\n\n\u201cCome and visit me at the lieutenant governor\u2019s office. It\u2019s your building,\u201d she said.\n\nWomen and family issues are not just about women, said Wyman.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a women\u2019s issue,\u201d said Wyman. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s issue.\u201d\n\nThe symposium offered 12 sessions on topics such as empowerment for women and teens, diabetes, health and fitness, autism, investments and eye health and screenings.\n\nColette Anderson, LCSW, executive director of The Connecticut Women\u2019s Consortium, a training and advocacy organization in women\u2019s health in Hamden, conducted a workshop on how to empower teenagers to make responsible decisions, which develops over time and with guidance.\n\nThe five key components of empowerment, preparing them to make decisions in adulthood, include trusting teens, helping them to solve problems rather than doing it for them, offering advice when they ask for it, let them take responsibility for their actions and allowing them to make their own decisions, said Anderson.\n\nTrust teens from the start, but if they break that trust, they will have to earn it back, she said.\n\nLet teens solve their problems.\n\n\u201cIf we always give them an answer, they\u2019re not going to be an empowered teen,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nGive advice when the teens ask for it and work it into the problem-solving process, she said.\n\nLet teens take responsibility for their actions, allow them to fail, she said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t undermine their ability to solve a problem on their own,\u201d she said. \u201cTeenagers will learn from their experience,\u201d right or wrong.\n\nAn important part of becoming an empowered individual is resiliency, said Anderson, who said two people can come from the same backgrounds and yet one will give up while another will never quit on their goals.\n\nThere are some basic concepts that make people resilient, including a sense of competency, confidence, connections to people in their communities, character or clear sense of right or wrong, a feeling they can contribute to their community, using good coping skills and feeling a sense of control, said Anderson.\n\nAmong her advice was not to compare the abilities of children in the same family, give them budgeting skills, and provide sincere praise so they have realistic expectations. She also encouraged family time together, as well as time when the teens have downtime in their busy lives.\n\n\u201cWe did get a lot out of it,\u201d said Wendella Benjamin, president of the Bloomfield Lions Club, who attended the symposium and said her group is active with a lot of youth.\n\nLion Club leaders and district governors Kathy Patterson, Mike Wilcox and Nanette Burdick organized the event, partially paid through a grant from Lions Club International.\n\nThe Lions Clubs, an international organization begun in 1917 by Chicago businessman Melvin Jones, is the world\u2019s largest service organization, with more than 46,000 clubs and 1.37 million members of men and women.\n\nIt\u2019s known for its work in vision health, but also works in the area of environment, feeding the hungry, aiding seniors and the disabled.\n\nThe Middletown Lions Club meets the second Tuesday of the month at the Cypress Grill at 1265 South Main St., at 6:30 p.m. For more information, call Debbie French at 860-346-2692.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Middletown news, CT news, US news, world news.", "title": "Nancy Wyman says women need to learn to speak up, speak out", "og": {"url": "http://www.middletownpress.com/article/MI/20150412/NEWS/150419883", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.middletownpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MI/20150412/NEWS/150419883/AR/0/AR-150419883.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Nancy Wyman says women need to learn to speak up, speak out"}, "twitter": {"domain": "middletownpress.com", "description": "MIDDLETOWN >> Lt.
