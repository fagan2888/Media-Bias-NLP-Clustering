The Silver State Health Insurance Exchange announced a replacement for an outgoing executive.

Damon Haycock, the agency’s information systems project manager, will be promoted to chief operating officer on Feb. 4, a day after current COO Shawna DeRousse leaves.

Exchange Executive Director Bruce Gilbert said in a statement that Haycock’s new position will help the marketplace.

“Damon did an outstanding job in managing our transition to the federal application and enrollment platform, and I am certain the exchange will benefit greatly as the result of his expanded role,” Gilbert stated.

Also on Feb. 4, current Quality Assurance Officer Laura Rich will be named project management officer. In that position, Rich will oversee case resolution as well as health plan management and certification.

The exchange, which is the marketplace through which consumers can buy federally subsidized health insurance to comply with the Affordable Care Act, is nearing the end of its open-enrollment session. The sign-up process closes to most new applicatants on Feb. 15.
