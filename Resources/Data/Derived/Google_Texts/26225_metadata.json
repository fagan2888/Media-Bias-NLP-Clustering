If the spending limits were lifted, they said, smaller, grassroots organizations would be marginalized.\n\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told The Daily Signal McConnell\u2019s campaign finance measure should\u2019ve expanded to all political entities.\n\n\u201cI support free speech and want to expand the ability of all Americans to exercise their First Amendment rights,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should ensure that political parties do not receive special treatment over other entities, such as political action committees, when it comes to speech. Unfortunately, there did not seem to be a willingness to make changes that would ensure all Americans were treated equally and fairly under the law.\u201d\n\nKen Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund and one of the conservative leaders who spoke out against McConnell\u2019s measure, said the provision served specific political interests.\n\n\u201cThis rider was nothing more than a political earmark for Mitch McConnell, who wants more power to crush conservative candidates. It would have only benefited the national party committees and offered nothing to Americans who want to support conservative candidates and conservative PACs,\u201d he said. Cuccinelli continued:\n\nIf Mitch McConnell wants to remove campaign finance restrictions, he should remove them for everyone. Then, and only then, can he claim to be advancing free speech.\n\nMcConnell, who opposes campaign finance rules, said his policy rider would have given more power to political parties during a time where super-PACs have increased sway because of their ability to raise unlimited amounts of money.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nConservative lawmakers in the House Freedom Caucus found themselves alongside government watchdog groups Public Citizen and Democracy 21 in opposing the majority leader\u2019s campaign finance measure.\n\nIn a statement, Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Congress Watch division, said the organization was \u201chappy that the congressional leadership stood firm against\u201d McConnell\u2019s provision.\n\nTo the contrary, the measure had the backing of David Keating and Brad Smith, president and chairman, respectively, of the Center for Competitive Politics.\n\nKeating told The Daily Signal he believed that the measure was removed because of opposition from Democratic groups. However, he said the omnibus spending bill did include other favorable campaign finance measure, despite the absence of McConnell\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt was strongly pro-First Amendment, and so we\u2019d like to see more free speech, and the campaign finance law provided for it,\u201d he said in an interview with The Daily Signal of McConnell\u2019s measure. Keating continued:\n\nI\u2019m optimistic that it\u2019s going to pass in the near future. To my mind, it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when it will. \u2026 [Super-PACs] are putting a lot of pressure on the political parties because they\u2019re not allowed to speak as independent groups. Members of Congress can do something about that by changing the law. I think it\u2019ll happen; it\u2019s just a question of when.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed published earlier this month, Keating and Smith criticized the Freedom Caucus for its opposition to the measure and said the lawmakers in the group were objecting to \u201cpolitical free speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrapping coordination rules will remove an artificial wedge between parties and their candidates and encourage more honesty and transparency in campaign spending,\u201d Keating and Smith said. \u201cIt will also benefit some Freedom Caucus members who face tougher general elections. Most important, it will enhance vital First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nUnder current campaign finance law, political parties can spend $48,000 in coordination with House candidates and up to $20 million for presidential nominees.\n\nCongress has in the past used must-pass government spending bills as a vehicle for campaign finance measures.\n\nDuring the debate last year over an omnibus dictating spending for 2015, former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., inserted a measure into the legislation raising the amount an individual can contribute to party committees to between $97,200 and $777,600.\n\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, though, the contributions are restricted to accounts for activities like legal proceedings or party headquarters buildings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate and House negotiators notably kept Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's campaign finance measure out of the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate and House negotiators notably kept Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's campaign finance measure out of the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill.", "title": "Campaign Finance Measure Kept Out of Spending Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151216_CampaignFinance_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-17T12:38:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1P7K07T"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate and House negotiators notably kept Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's campaign finance measure out of the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151216_CampaignFinance_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "Campaign Finance Measure Kept Out of Spending Deal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "budget", "published_time": "2015-12-16T16:42:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-17T12:38:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mitch McConnell, campaign finance, omnibus, Super PACs, House Freedom Caucus, Ken Cuccinelli, David Keating, Center for Competitive Politics, Federal Election Commission"}, "article_summary": "However, he said the omnibus spending bill did include other favorable campaign finance measure, despite the absence of McConnell\u2019s.\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Rep.
