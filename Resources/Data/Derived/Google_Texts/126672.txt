Matt Thornton is the newest member of the Washington Nationals’ bullpen.

The team on Tuesday acquired the veteran left-hander off waivers from the New York Yankees. Thornton was 0-3 with a 2.55 ERA in 46 appearances for the Yankees this season.

He previously pitched for the Mariners, White Sox and Red Sox, compiling a 32-45 record and 3.49 ERA in 11 major league seasons.

Thornton, 37, was Seattle’s first-round pick (22nd overall) in the 1998 draft.

The Nationals transferred right-hander Taylor Jordan to the 60-day disabled list to clear a spot for Thornton on the 40-man roster. It was not immediately clear whose place he would take on the 25-man active roster.
