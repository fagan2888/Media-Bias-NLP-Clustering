Partnering with pharmacy chains, she said, will allow them to go where the consumer is.\n\nAs of Dec. 15 \u2013 the deadline for coverage beginning Jan. 1 \u2013 more than 4 million people, including nearly 89,000 in Ohio, had selected insurance plans through the federal marketplace, according to the Obama administration.\n\nForty-eight percent of Ohio residents who signed up for Obamacare in the first month of open enrollment were new consumers, with 52 percent of people re-enrolling in their plans or choosing a different plan from 2014.\n\nThe administration's stated enrollment goal for 2015 is just over 9 million people.\n\n\"We think there's a lot of opportunity, with a number of uninsured to make progress,\" Burwell said. \"We want to continue to focus here in the state.\"\n\nThe collaboration with pharmacies is the Obama administration's latest in a series of efforts to reach out to consumers who need to buy \u2013 or switch \u2013 health insurance plans.\n\nShortly before the second enrollment period began, an administrator with HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration spent the day in Cleveland to promote Obamacare.\n\nDuring the holiday season, health insurance sign-up events were held at shopping malls in a handful of states.\n\nCVS is holding a series of Project Health events at the following area CVS locations (all are from 2 to 6 p.m.): Friday, Jan. 9 at 424 Pearl Rd., Cleveland; Saturday, Jan. 10 at 2007 Brookpark Rd., Cleveland; Jan. 15 at 11223 Granger Rd., Garfield Heights; and Jan. 17 at 13215 Shaker Square, Cleveland. Go to cvs.com/project-health for more information.\n\nMajority of people who get Obamacare get financial help, government says\n\nThe administration continues to emphasize that financial assistance is available, and the majority of people who are signing up for private insurance qualify.\n\n\"Last year, 85 percent of folks who came to the marketplace received financial assistance,\" Burwell said. Similar numbers are being seen during the current enrollment period, she said.\n\nAlso, some pharmacy chains this month started offering up to a 30-day \"transitional\" supply of prescription medications for people who have signed up for insurance but who don't yet have an insurance card with their plan identification number. Once the consumers have received their card, they will be billed for any co-pays that apply.\n\nOpen enrollment ends Feb. 15; local sign-up help available\n\nIf you haven't heard by now, the deadline to get health insurance during the open enrollment period is Feb. 15. People who were automatically re-enrolled in the plan they had in 2014 can still change plans until then as well.\n\nGet Covered America, the nonprofit, nonpartisan campaign of the pro-ACA group Enroll America, will have enrollment assisters available at its Cleveland Enroll America office, 13437 Cedar Road, Cleveland Heights, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday, Jan. 12 through Thursday, Jan. 15. People also can go to the Get Covered Connector at getcoveredamerica.org/connector/\u200bto make an appointment in advance.\n\nYou can also schedule an appointment for help at areyoucoveredohio.org or find a location with enroller assistance near you at the 2-1-1 website at 211cleveland.org, which has information on 15 counties in northern Ohio.\n\nIf you're getting in-person assistance, remember to bring a photo ID, proof of income, W-2, and/or immigration cards/papers, and your Social Security card or number.\n\nYou can also call the consumer assistance center at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services at 800-318-2596.\n\nHealth insurance law comes with new tax implications\n\nIf you don't have insurance \u2013 either private insurance or coverage through Medicaid or Medicare \u2013 you could be facing a tax penalty.\n\nStarting this year, taxpayers will see a new item on their tax return. The majority of people will just need to check a box on their tax return indicating they had health coverage in 2014. For those who decided not to buy health insurance, online tools and other resources will soon be available to help see if they qualify for claiming an exemption \u2013 such as a religious objection or an approved hardship.\n\nThe penalty for not having health insurance is currently $95 for the year, or 1 percent of your household income, whichever is higher. If you don't have health insurance in 2015 the penalty will go up to $325, or up to 2 percent of your household income.\n\nThose with Marketplace coverage will receive a new form in the mail \u2013 Form 1095-A \u2013 to use to deal with any subsidy they received to help pay for insurance.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aca, cvs, health-insurance, obamacare, sylvia-burwell, health, living", "title": "HHS Secretary Burwell touts Obamacare during visit to Lakewood (photo gallery)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"HHS Secretary Burwell touts Obamacare during visit to Lakewood (photo gallery)\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2015/01/hhs_secretary_burwell_touts_obamacare_during_visit_to_lakewood_cvs.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain-dealer/photo/2015/01/08/16728644-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14911996\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-08T20:45:23Z\", \"author\": \"Angela Townsend, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"@lakewood\",\"@mobile\",\"aca\",\"cvs\",\"health-insurance\",\"obamacare\",\"sylvia-burwell\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain-dealer/photo/2015/01/08/16728644-large.jpg", "creator": "@atownzz", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell spent time in the Cleveland area Thursday, her second visit to Ohio in less than two months.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, January 08, 2015,  5:03 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/plain-dealer/photo/2015/01/08/16728644-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"atownsen\", \"author_nickname\": \"Angela Townsend, The Plain Dealer\", \"author_id\": \"5587\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health and Fitness\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell spent time in the Cleveland area Thursday, her second visit to Ohio in less than two months.", "title": "HHS Secretary Burwell touts Obamacare during visit to Lakewood (photo gallery)", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2015/01/hhs_secretary_burwell_touts_obamacare_during_visit_to_lakewood_cvs.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain-dealer/photo/2015/01/08/16728644-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, January 08, 2015,  3:45 PM", "article_author": "Angela Townsend, The Plain Dealer", "Description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell spent time in the Cleveland area Thursday, her second visit to Ohio in less than two months."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd299a\"", "article_summary": "During the holiday season, health insurance sign-up events were held at shopping malls in a handful of states.\nThe penalty for not having health insurance is currently $95 for the year, or 1 percent of your household income, whichever is higher.\nIf you don't have health insurance in 2015 the penalty will go up to $325, or up to 2 percent of your household income.\nThe majority of people will just need to check a box on their tax return indicating they had health coverage in 2014.\nThe collaboration with pharmacies is the Obama administration's latest in a series of efforts to reach out to consumers who need to buy \u2013 or switch \u2013 health insurance plans."}
