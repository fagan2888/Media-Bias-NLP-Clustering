Ask anyone.\u201d In time, we would learn that the rules for corroborating assertions were more stringent and that disputable claims required either reasoned argument or reference to a reputable source.\n\nLately, though, I\u2019ve wondered whether some journalists are relying too much on the \u201cask anyone\u201d method of citation. Its more sophisticated form appears in a passive-voice clause that includes the word \u201cwidely\u201d: \u201cwidely believed,\u201d \u201cwidely suspected,\u201d \u201cwidely thought,\u201d \u201cwidely considered,\u201d and so on.\n\nClearly, there are some beliefs or suspicions that really are shared \u201cwidely,\u201d and there is nothing wrong with saying so. When a Telegraph reporter writes that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 is \u201cwidely believed to have been shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired by Russian-backed separatists,\u201d that\u2019s reasonable. The connection can\u2019t be documented with finality, not yet anyhow, but almost everybody believes it.\n\nJust as often, though, that little word \u201cwidely\u201d seems designed to appear to do the work of citation or argument without actually doing it. You can sense the author\u2019s thought process: If he writes \u201cU.S.-British relations are thought to be at their most strained in decades,\u201d the obvious question is, \u201cThought by whom?\u201d But if he inserts a \u201cwidely,\u201d the problem somehow goes away. \u201cU.S.-British relations are widely thought to be at their most strained in decades.\u201d Ah, well, if it\u2019s \u201cwidely\u201d thought, it\u2019s probably close to the truth.\n\nConsider this passage, from a recent article in the Economist on the trend toward greater college enrollment by women: \u201cNumbers in many of America\u2019s elite private colleges are more evenly balanced. It is widely believed that their opaque admissions criteria are relaxed for men.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s \u201cwidely believed\u201d and maybe it isn\u2019t \u2014 it depends on what \u201cwidely\u201d means \u2014 but that allegation is a serious one, and it deserves more support than a casual allusion to what\u2019s \u201cwidely believed.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, an article published on the website of San Francisco\u2019s public media outlet KQED explained some Democratic congressional leaders\u2019 reluctance to support the Iran deal. \u201cIt\u2019s widely suspected,\u201d we learn, \u201cthat many of these elected leaders have been influenced in part by powerful conservative pro-Israeli lobbying groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which strongly opposes the agreement.\u201d The passive voice, together with the vague qualifiers \u201cmany\u201d and \u201cin part\u201d \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s widely suspected\u201d (who suspects it?) that \u201cmany\u201d lawmakers were influenced \u201cin part\u201d by lobbyists \u2014 allows the writer to make an unsubstantiated opinion sound like unassailable fact.\n\nSometimes writers attempt to use a \u201cwidely\u201d clause to validate an observation but make nonsense of it in the process. From a recent article in the New York Times: \u201cIn the early years of the AIDS crisis, it was widely believed that the threat to women via sexual transmission was overblown.\u201d But that belief couldn\u2019t have been very \u201cwidely\u201d held if the threat was over-hyped \u2014 right? And again, in an otherwise fine piece on British novelist John Cowper Powys in the Telegraph, we read that \u201chis name remains little known, even though he wrote what are widely thought to be at least three other great novels.\u201d If the greatness of those novels is so \u201cwidely\u201d appreciated, how can Powys\u2019s name remain little known?\n\nBy far the most insidious use of \u201cwidely,\u201d however, occurs when the word refers to a manifestly small number of people who nonetheless share the writer\u2019s view. Earlier this year, for instance, a writer for the Los Angeles Times began his column by noting that \u201cit is widely held that the dopiest anti-Obamacare lawsuit is King vs. Burwell.\u201d And an editor at the New Republic observed that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is \u201cwidely considered one of the most socially inept candidates.\u201d Maybe both these statements are true and I am irritated by them only because, not sharing the writers\u2019 political views, I am not included in their uses of \u201cwidely.\u201d But when the New Yorker, in a highly flattering profile of Secretary of State John Kerry, refers offhandedly to \u201cGeorge W. Bush, who is widely considered the worst President of the modern era,\u201d I am pretty sure that that \u201cwidely\u201d does not mean what most of us mean when we use it.\n\nSurely a \u201cwidely considered\u201d opinion must be shared by almost everyone who has an opinion on the subject. In any case, most people do not actually believe George W. Bush to have been the worst president of the modern era.
