JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - State troopers with the Florida Highway Patrol said suspended Jaguars football player Justin Blackmon was involved in an early morning crash.



The Florida Highway Patrol said Blackmon, 24, was originally cited for careless driving, but Saturday afternoon said the man would not face any charges. Troopers also said drugs and alcohol were not factors in the crash.

Investigators said around 3:30 a.m. Blackmon was driving his 2009 GMC Denali on Interstate 295 south near Pulaski Road when he had a tire blowout. His SUV crashed into a guardrail and ended up in a ditch.

The Jaguars wide receiver Blackmon was suspended indefinitely in November for violating the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse.

Blackmon can return to the Jaguars' active roster September 30, 2014. Blackmon is eligible to participate in all preseason practices and games.

Blackmon was charged with driving under the influence in 2010 and 2012, according to police records.
