BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A conservative lawmaker from Meridian says he filed paperwork Saturday to begin raising money for a possible challenge against Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter in the May 2014 Republican primary.

Senate GOP Caucus Chairman Russ Fulcher cites Otter’s decision to establish a state-run health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act as a motivating factor. The 51-year-old Fulcher tells the Idaho Statesman in a written statement that he’s concerned Otter has lost touch with the will of the people of Idaho.

Fulcher opposed the state exchange, contending it meant Idaho surrendered its sovereignty. He says he hasn’t decided to run but is exploring the possibility due to the support he’s received. Fulcher is a former Micron executive now in the commercial real estate business. He’s married with three children.
