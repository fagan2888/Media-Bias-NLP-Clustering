Bush.\n\nBut Obama has yet to deliver on that promise, as many Republicans -- and some Democrats -- have long been wary of closing the facility and having to transfer remaining inmates.\n\nIn February, Obama detailed his plan to Congress to close the prison.\n\nThe blueprint involves transferring the bulk of remaining detainees to other countries and moving the rest -- who can't be transferred abroad because they're deemed too dangerous -- to an as-yet-undetermined detention facility in the United States.\n\nA major concern of lawmakers has been the risk that released detainees will return to the battlefield. Underscoring the threat, Spain, working with Moroccan intelligence officials, announced in February the arrest of four individuals in anti-terror operations in Spain and Morocco, including one who had spent time at Guantanamo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States is transferring nine detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said Saturday.", "language": "english", "author": "CNN", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Nine-Guantanamo-detainees-transferred-to-Saudi-Arabia-375957551.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Guantanamo_Bay_Gitmo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The United States is transferring nine detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said Saturday.", "title": "Nine Guantanamo detainees transferred to Saudi Arabia"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The United States is transferring nine detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said Saturday.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Nine-Guantanamo-detainees-transferred-to-Saudi-Arabia-375957551.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Guantanamo_Bay_Gitmo.jpg", "title": "Nine Guantanamo detainees transferred to Saudi Arabia", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Nine Guantanamo detainees transferred to Saudi Arabia", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nine Guantanamo detainees transferred to"}, "article_summary": "Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (MGN)The United States is transferring nine detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said Saturday.\nThe Department of Defense identified the men as Ahmed Umar Abdullah Al-Hikimi, Abdul Rahman Mohammed Saleh Nasir, Ali Yahya Mahdi Al-Raimi, Tariq Ali Abdullah Ahmed Ba Odah, Muhammed Abdullah Muhammed Al-Hamiri, Ahmed Yaslam Said Kuman, Abd al Rahman Al-Qyati, Mansour Muhammed Ali Al-Qatta and Mashur Abdullah Muqbil Ahmed Al-Sabri.\n\"The United States is grateful to the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its humanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility,\" the statement said.\nIt also comes ahead of Obama's planned trip to Saudi Arabia next week.\nThe blueprint involves transferring the bulk of remaining detainees to other countries and moving the rest -- who can't be transferred abroad because they're deemed too dangerous -- to an as-yet-undetermined detention facility in the United States."}
