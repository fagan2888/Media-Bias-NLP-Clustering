Carson revealed late last year that he was subject to a first-time IRS audit after going public with his Obamacare criticism.\n\nAfter recently changing his party affiliation from independent to republican, Dr. Carson is also considering tossing his stethoscope into the ring in a campaign for the White House in 2016. He intends to make a decision by May 1.\n\nCarson recently compared Obama to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the context of the executive action on amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nIn an interview on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show earlier week, Carson also weighed in on the aftermath of the Ferguson decision in which a grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of Michael Brown, and which prompted violent protests in the St. Louis suburb.\n\n\u201cI actually believe that things were better before this president was elected. And I think that things have gotten worse because of his unusual emphasis on race.\u201d\n\nWhen Hewitt asked him to explain further, Carson referenced the 2009 confrontation between a Harvard professor and a Cambridge, Massachusetts police officer that culminated in the White House beer summit.\n\n\u201cWell, for instance, in the incident with Henry Louis Gates, Skip Gates, and him calling out the police, and you know, how they always do this kind of thing, and the Trayvon Martin case, you know, if I had a son, this is what he would look like, rather than trying to take the balanced, objective look at things, and then, you know, what\u2019s happened here. And then the way, which really irritates me to some degree, the way he and a bunch of progressives manipulate, particularly minority communities, to make them feel that they are victims. And of course if you think you\u2019re a victim, you are a victim.\u201d\n\nCarson also claimed that the president has played the race card from time to time, but is \u201ctrying very hard not to do so\u201d in the Ferguson situation.\n\nIn terms of what happened at Ferguson in August, Carson insisted that the officer did nothing wrong, but should have been better trained to deal with dangerous encounters. Asked if Michael Brown was a victim, Carson answered that he became a victim of \u201cnot having a well-established idea of how to relate to authority.\u201d\n\nThe transcript of the entire Ben Carson interview with Hugh Hewitt can be found here.\n\nDo you agree or disagree with Ben Carson\u2019s assessment of race relations in America?\n\n[image credit: Gage Skidmore]\n\nAdded: A new poll from Bloomberg Politics seems to be consistent with Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s assertions. In the poll of 1,001 American adults, 53 percent indicated that race relations have gotten worse under Obama, including 56 percent of white respondents and 45 percent of black respondents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson claims that race relations have deteriorated since Barack Obama took office as president.
