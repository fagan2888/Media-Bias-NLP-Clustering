SPRINGFIELD, Mass. — Spencer Haywood and Dikembe Mutombo were great players who accomplished as much or more off the court.

On Friday night, they were celebrated for both.

Haywood, a former ABA Denver Rocket, and Mutombo, a former Nugget, were enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, part of a class of 11 players, coaches and referees.

Kentucky coach John Calipari was to be the last member of the class to speak at Symphony Hall.

The rest of the class includes referee Dick Bavetta, former Celtic Jo Jo White and women’s star Lisa Leslie. Tom Heinsohn is being inducted as a coach after already being enshrined as a player, and will be joined by former coaches George Raveling and Australia’s Lindsay Gaze, as well as ABA star Louis Dampier and early African-American player John Isaacs.

Current NBA stars such as LeBron James and Kevin Durant will probably be here one day — and will owe a debt of gratitude to Haywood.

His battle with the NBA that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1970 knocked down the age requirement that required players to be four years removed from high school. Once in the league, he went on to play 12 seasons, make four all-star teams and win a championship.

“Remember, guys, I had game,” Haywood said. “It was not like I just did this Supreme Court thing. I had some serious game.”

So did Mutombo, a fierce defender and shot blocker for 18 seasons. He said he was proud to have been the third African to play in the NBA, “to come to the U.S. with nothing and now I’m part of the NBA history.”

And he’s giving back, opening a hospital in his homeland of Congo that he said has served 140,000 people. He twice won the NBA’s J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award and now works for the league as a global ambassador.
