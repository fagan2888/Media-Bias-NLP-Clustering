I had just come back from an excessive Chinese business trip - I was tired. I will remain on the council.\n\n'That is all I want to say until I release a press release.'\n\nOther Facebook users reacted with fury, with one labelling Mr Drury a \u2018pitiful excuse for a human being\u2019 and another saying they would not want to be represented by a councillor who made the comment.\n\nCouncillor Ferris Cowper, Conservative leader of East Hampshire District Council, said Mr Drury\u2019s comment was regarded \u2018offensive'. He called the council\u2019s decision to allow him to stay \u2018deeply disappointing\u2019.\n\n'For the record and as you would expect, this council finds the crime of rape to be deeply deplorable not only because of the physical invasion but also the lasting psychological consequences,' Mr Cowper said.\n\n'Our only interest as a council would be to offer the victim all the sympathy and assistance possible.\n\n'Although EHDC has now exhausted its legal options, the Council remains disappointed both with the actions of the councillor and also the effectiveness of the regulatory regime.'\n\nMiss Bowers in Florence: The second-year Newcastle College student, who is hoping to join the Army when she graduates, had been on a trip to the city as part of her fashion course when she said she was raped\n\nAlleged rape victim Miss Bowes, 21, who waived her right to anonymity, is now facing extradition and a possible 12 years in jail because Italian police believe she may have made up the incident.\n\nAlexander Tahiri asked police to open a case of slander against Miss Bowers after officers decided not to charge him following an investigation\n\nThe second-year Newcastle College student, who is hoping to join the Army when she graduates, had been on a trip to Florence last May as part of her fashion course.\n\nShe had visited the nightclub in the city's Via della Vigna Vecchia with a group of friends, and says she had started talking to Alexander Aveiro Tahiri, 23, inside.\n\nShe claims that as the the pair were made their way to the VIP area of the club, she was taken to the unisex toilet and attacked.\n\nThe alleged assault was reported to police, and gave statements to officers, as well as being examined in hospital.\n\nItalian news reports from the time the allegations were made said police had watched CCTV images which showed Miss Bowes leaving the bathroom together with Mr Tahiri, who was employed by the nightclub.\n\nHe faced no further action. He later lost his job with the club as a result of the allegation after bosses said 'having sex in the toilets is not what he is being paid for.'\n\nMiss Bowes returned to Newcastle and tried to put the trip behind her, until she was sent a letter from Italian police, which she took to a nearby police station to be translated.\n\nShe expected to hear that her alleged attacker was to be prosecuted. Instead she was served notice that she will go on trial for \u2018slander\u2019 against Mr Tahiri.\n\nUnder the Italian justice system if Miss Bowes is prosecuted she would not have to be present at the trial. If she were convicted she would be automatically entitled to two appeals.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Lib,Dem,council,leader,quits,party,saying,no,one,want,rape,British,woman,claims,sexually,assaulted,Italian,nightclub", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2896186/Lib-Dem-council-leader-quits-party-saying-no-one-want-rape-British-woman-claims-sexually-assaulted-Italian-nightclub.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Philip Drury, left, shadow cabinet leader of East Hampshire District Council, made the comment on Facebook about 21-year-old fashion student Serena Bowes,right, who claimed she was raped in Italy.", "title": "Councillor quits Lib Dems after saying girl is too ugly to be raped", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2896186/Lib-Dem-council-leader-quits-party-saying-no-one-want-rape-British-woman-claims-sexually-assaulted-Italian-nightclub.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/04/2468BF5C00000578-0-image-a-39_1420378480107.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2896186/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2896186/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2896186, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Lib,Dem,council,leader,quits,party,saying,no,one,want,rape,British,woman,claims,sexually,assaulted,Italian,nightclub", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-01-04T13:33:32.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Damien+Gayle+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-01-04T18:45:25.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Lib Dem council leader quits party saying no one want rape British woman claims sexually assaulted Italian nightclub"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Philip Drury, left, shadow cabinet leader of East Hampshire District Council, made the comment on Facebook about 21-year-old fashion student Serena Bowes,right, who claimed she was raped in Italy.", "title": "Councillor quits Lib Dems after saying girl is too ugly to be raped", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2896186/Lib-Dem-council-leader-quits-party-saying-no-one-want-rape-British-woman-claims-sexually-assaulted-Italian-nightclub.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/04/2468BF5C00000578-0-image-a-39_1420378480107.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Philip Drury, left, shadow cabinet leader of East Hampshire District Council, made the comment on Facebook about 21-year-old fashion student Serena Bowes,right, who claimed she was raped in Italy."}, "article_summary": "Under the Italian justice system if Miss Bowes is prosecuted she would not have to be present at the trial.\n'Not sure anyone would want to even think about it looking at her lol,' the senior local politician posted in response to a thread discussing Miss Bowes' case.\nPhilip Drury, shadow cabinet leader of East Hampshire District Council, made the comment on Facebook about 21-year-old fashion student Serena Bowes, who claimed she was raped in Italy.\nMr Drury put his comment, which was immediately slammed as 'awful' and 'vile' by others on Facebook, down to tiredness following a business trip in China.\nOther Facebook users reacted with fury, with one labelling Mr Drury a \u2018pitiful excuse for a human being\u2019 and another saying they would not want to be represented by a councillor who made the comment."}
