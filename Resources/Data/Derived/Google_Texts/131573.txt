PORTLAND, Maine — An attorney charged with possessing child pornography has been sentenced to 90 days in jail.

Lawrence Winger, 64, a Falmouth resident who practices law in Portland, pleaded guilty as part of a plea agreement on May 20 in Cumberland County Superior Court. He admitted having sexually explicit images of children younger than 12 on his computer.

Winger was arrested on Aug. 27, 2014, after an investigation by the Maine State Computer Crimes Unit. He was originally sentenced to five years in prison, but most of that was suspended. He will serve four years’ probation following his release.
