( Jane Meredith Adams/EdSource Today )\n\nAn anonymous donor seeking to improve Oakland is investing in education. Nearly a quarter of the donor\u2019s $34 million gift made this week to city organizations is targeted to school health centers, discipline reform in schools, and early education teacher training and materials.\n\nThe donor reportedly cold-called the San Francisco Foundation earlier this year to float the idea of the gift and to ask Fred Blackwell, chief executive of the philanthropic foundation, to help disperse the funds. The focus of the grants is on \u201cscaling proven solutions\u201d to academic and economic obstacles faced by Oakland residents, according to a news release from the foundation, which donates grant money to nonprofits throughout the Bay Area.\n\nThe upshot is an $8 million gift to Oakland schools for what the foundation described as \u201ca preK-12 system of support.\u201d The donor requested that the money be put to work this summer.\n\n\u201cWe have a chance to have a very direct, immediate and positive impact on Oakland schools and families starting this school year and continuing for quite some time,\u201d said Troy Flint, spokesman for the Oakland Unified School District.\n\nThe California School-Based Health Alliance, a statewide organization, received $2 million to support trauma-informed care in 15 school-based health centers in Oakland, including centers at Oakland Technical High School, Elmhurst/Alliance Middle School and Castlemont High School.\n\nThe work will include schoolwide screenings, support groups and support for teachers to help students cope with the effects of severe trauma, according to the Alliance.\n\nThe Oakland Public Education Fund, the district\u2019s fundraising and grant management arm, received $6 million to fund early childhood education teacher training, restorative justice programs, the expansion of the African American Student Achievement program, and community school coordinators.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Foundation and Oakland Unified, the funding means that:\n\n15 middle and high schools will gain new clinic staff and programs dedicated to addressing the impact of trauma;\n\nEight schools will launch restorative justice programs to reduce suspensions and expulsions;\n\n14 schools will have a full-service community schools coordinator;\n\nAn African American Female Achievement program will be created to complement the existing African American Male Achievement program, which works to improve academic performance and graduation rates of African American boys, and\n\nAll early childhood classrooms will receive teacher training, new curriculum and literacy materials\n\nOakland schools also will benefit indirectly from the donor\u2019s new grants to nonprofit organizations that serve youth, Flint said. Those grants include $1.3 million to the Destiny Arts Center, $1 million to the East Oakland Youth Development Center and $2.5 million to Youth Uprising, a community center for health services, arts programs and education support.\n\nJane Meredith Adams covers student health and well-being for EdSource.
