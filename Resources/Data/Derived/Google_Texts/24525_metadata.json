She also won in 2009, 2010 and 2012 and was the runner-up in 2011. Only Portugal\u2019s Rosa Mota has more career Bolder Boulder victories with five.\n\nEven with temperatures in the high 60s, and even with a hard early pace from Deena Kastor, Daska felt the pace was too slow. So she took off down the left side of a long straightaway before the first mile while the rest of the women followed the inside curve of the road.\n\nThe champion \u201cdid good training and felt the pace was easy at the beginning,\u201d Daska said through a translator.\n\nThat set the tone: If you want to win, prepare for bold moves and a long grind over the scorching pavement of this rolling, high-altitude course.\n\nPHOTOS: Thousands run in Colorado\u2019s 2014 Bolder Boulder 10K\n\nShalane Flanagan, who most recently finished as the top American in the Boston Marathon, tried in vain to move with her. But the gap only grew with each passing mile \u2014 five seconds at mile one, then nine at two miles, 16, 22, 28 \u2014 until the finish: 43.48 seconds. Flanagan and Daska ran nearly the entire race solo.\n\n\u201cI think she knew I probably didn\u2019t have the adaptation to altitude, so I was a little cautious, even though that felt really fast for me,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cSo I tried to be as cautious as possible but not give away the race. I didn\u2019t want to hand it to her. But I tried to keep her within distance to see if she faltered and misjudged herself.\u201d\n\nAbout halfway through the race, Flanagan realized Daska wasn\u2019t coming back.\n\n\u201cAt that point, the competitor in me \u2014 it was hard to let that go,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was worried about the team aspect, and I was wanting to safely hold second for my team.\u201d\n\nWith Kastor\u2019s fourth-place finish and Sara Hall\u2019s 16th-place finish \u2014 a race Hall described as the most challenging she had ever run \u2014 the American women\u2019s Red team finished third behind Ethiopia and Kenya.\n\nFor Daska, there was only one regret: not breaking the course record of 32:13, set in 1995 by Kenya\u2019s Delillah Asiago in cool, rainy conditions.\n\n\u201cShe says it\u2019s very difficult to run alone,\u201d Daska\u2019s translator said. \u201cIf she had other people, it would help her push the pace, and she would run a better time.\n\n\u201cShe knows this course very well. She was planning to break the course record, but because of the hot weather, she wasn\u2019t able to.\u201d\n\nWould she come back to try again?\n\n\u201cYes, she hopes so,\u201d her translator said. So does Cliff Bosley, co-race director and co-founder.\n\nKastor, 41, turned in another stirring fourth-place finish. The roaring crowd of tens of thousands rose to its feet as she entered Folsom Field, a sign of respect for a woman whose status as a running legend becomes more solidified with dominant performances each passing year.\n\n\u201cMy husband and coach, Andrew Kastor \u2026 told me to take it out hard because we live at a higher altitude than Boulder,\u201d said Kastor, of 7,880-foot Mammoth Lakes, Calif. \u201cSo I knew that it was my intention to take the sting out of the rest of the field. In taking the sting out of myself the rest of the way, I was suffering quite a bit during the race.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mamitu Daska of Ethiopia wins 4th elite women\u2019s Bolder Boulder title", "title": "Mamitu Daska of Ethiopia wins 4th elite women\u2019s Bolder Boulder title", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/26/mamitu-daska-of-ethiopia-wins-4th-elite-womens-bolder-boulder-title/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140526__dp-Mamitu-Daskap1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140526__dp-Mamitu-Daskap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-26T17:22:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:39:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98ca\"", "article_summary": "BOULDER \u2014 Mamitu Daska is unquestionably the current queen of the Bolder Boulder\u2019s elite women\u2019s 10K race.\nBut I tried to keep her within distance to see if she faltered and misjudged herself.\u201dAbout halfway through the race, Flanagan realized Daska wasn\u2019t coming back.\nEven with temperatures in the high 60s, and even with a hard early pace from Deena Kastor, Daska felt the pace was too slow.\nThe Ethiopian won her fourth title Monday well ahead of the rest of the field, finishing in 32 minutes, 21.63 seconds.\nThe champion \u201cdid good training and felt the pace was easy at the beginning,\u201d Daska said through a translator."}
