His company also operates 80 hospitals nationwide.\n\nFetter spoke after a morning conference call with analysts that, in part, detailed his company\u2019s strategy in the growing area of urgent care centers, ambulatory surgery centers, imaging centers and freestanding emergency departments.\n\nIn 2010, Tenet earmarked $400 million to buy or develop outpatient centers and expected to generate $70 million in incremental adjusted earnings \u2014 before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nSo far, Tenet said that it has invested $306 million, generating $87 million in extra earnings. That\u2019s 25 percent more earnings with 25 percent less capital, the company said.\n\nOthers in the industry also see potential.\n\nLast week, Nashville-based hospital giant HCA said it planned to acquire privately held CareNow, which operates two dozen urgent care centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nMost of Coppell-based CareNow\u2019s locations are within 5 miles of an existing HCA facility. An HCA executive said the company hopes to replicate that in other markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a model that works for everybody,\u201d Fetter said, emphasizing the convenience. \u201cConsumers drive up, park right in front and are seen right away.\u201d\n\nUrgent-care facilities also are open evenings and weekends, and prices are generally lower.\n\nIn May, Tenet rebranded its urgent care centers into a national network called MedPost Urgent Care. The company has four hospitals and five MedPost locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nAs part of its conference call presentation, Tenet reviewed the typical economics of outpatient centers:\n\nUrgent-care centers cost about $800,000 in capital to establish, eventually generate $2 million to $3 million in annual revenue, and have profit margins of 10 percent to 20 percent.\n\nAmbulatory surgical centers cost $5 million to $8 million, generate $5 million to $8 million in revenue, with margins of 30 percent to 35 percent.\n\nFree-standing emergency departments cost $6 million to $10 million, generate $7 million in revenue, with 25 percent to 30 percent margins.\n\nImaging centers cost $3 million to $5 million, generate $3 million to $4 million in revenue, with margins of 10 percent to 25 percent.\n\n\u201cThe reason margins are so high is that you don\u2019t have all the overhead and cost of a 24-7 hospital,\u201d Fetter said.\n\nTenet reported its third-quarter earnings after the markets closed Monday. Despite what Fetter called the company\u2019s best quarterly performance fundamentals ever \u2014 strong growth in admissions, revenue and adjusted earnings \u2014 investors were cautious Tuesday.\n\nTenet stock closed at $53.06 a share, down $3.66, or 6.45 percent. About 6.5 million shares traded, four times the recent average, according to Google Finance.\n\nOther health care stocks were also weak, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a slight gain.\n\nOn the conference call, some analysts attributed the market reaction to Election Day and uncertainty over the Affordable Care Act. The U.S. Supreme Court will decide soon whether to hear another challenge.\n\nFetter said he can\u2019t predict what the Supreme Court will do. But the Affordable Care Act is so well established, and so many people depend upon it, he said, that it\u2019s hard to imagine it going away.\n\n\u201cI think this train has left the station big time,\u201d Fetter said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since 2010, Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp. has invested $306 million in outpatient facilities that specialize in urgent care, surgery, imaging and emergency care.", "og": {"description": "Since 2010, Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp. has invested $306 million in outpatient facilities that specialize in urgent care, surgery, imaging and emergency care.", "title": "Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter sees big growth in outpatient centers", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20141104-tenet-ceo-trevor-fetter-sees-big-growth-in-outpatient-centers.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-11-05T04:00:05Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-11-05T02:48:00Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter sees big growth in outpatient centers\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20141104-tenet-ceo-trevor-fetter-sees-big-growth-in-outpatient-centers.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2022568\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-05T02:48:00Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"GARY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-05T02:48:00Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3f8\"", "article_summary": "In May, Tenet rebranded its urgent care centers into a national network called MedPost Urgent Care.\nFetter spoke after a morning conference call with analysts that, in part, detailed his company\u2019s strategy in the growing area of urgent care centers, ambulatory surgery centers, imaging centers and freestanding emergency departments.\nLast week, Nashville-based hospital giant HCA said it planned to acquire privately held CareNow, which operates two dozen urgent care centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\nImaging centers cost $3 million to $5 million, generate $3 million to $4 million in revenue, with margins of 10 percent to 25 percent.\nAmbulatory surgical centers cost $5 million to $8 million, generate $5 million to $8 million in revenue, with margins of 30 percent to 35 percent."}
