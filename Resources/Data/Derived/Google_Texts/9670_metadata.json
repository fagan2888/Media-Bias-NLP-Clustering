They're called the Aseema Schools, which are run by these women who take over abandoned state schools and offer a wonderful education, really. They're benefiting hugely... (Producer Christian Colson and I) go to Mumbai at least once a year...\" Boyle told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"They're bright kids... They've learned to speak English, which they couldn't do when we were shooting and that will benefit them in terms of (future) opportunities. And we have provisions made for them to help them (when they leave school) as well, which we can't tell them, because her (Ali's) father will mortgage it off to some gangster...\"\n\nCast of Slumdog Millionaire: (From left) Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, Rubina Ali, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, (back left) Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Tanay Hemant Chheda arrive at the Oscars in 2009.

He's a very bright kid. He's off making movies. I see him occasionally in New York. And the weird thing is he's six-foot-tall [182cm] now. You have an image of them and then they shoot up (grow bigger)!\"\n\nBoyle is planning his next trip out to Mumbai in March.\n\nAAP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Movies", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The child actors who rose from poverty in India to star in Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire are thriving eight years on from the film's release, according to British director Danny Boyle.", "title": "Slumdog Millionaire kids thriving: Danny Boyle", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/slumdog-millionaire-kids-thriving-danny-boyle-20140302-33txo.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/03/02/5217617/th-slum-20dog-202.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "cXenseParse": {"ffx-assettype": "article", "ffx-assetid": 5217612}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msvalidate.01": "3A0F8B0A5D246EFE15A2F9F975D1E623", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The child actors who rose from poverty in India to star in Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire are thriving eight years on from the film's release, according to British director Danny Boyle."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b9d\"", "article_summary": "MoviesAzharuddin Ismail, left, who played the young Salim, and Rubina Ali, who played the young Latika at a Mumbai slum in 2009.\nPhoto: ReutersThe child actors who rose from poverty in India to star in Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire are thriving eight years on from the film's release, according to British director Danny Boyle.\nDirector Danny Boyle with Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubina Ali at the Governors Ball in Hollywood in 2009.\nThey're benefiting hugely...
