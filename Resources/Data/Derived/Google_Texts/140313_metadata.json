While 15 years ago 51 percent said guns make a house more dangerous, today only 30 percent believe that, while a majority, 63 percent, say they provide more safety.\n\nAmericans are increasingly embracing their gun rights because they recognize firearms are an important resource for self-defense. In March 2013, Americans cited protection as the top reason for purchasing a gun - and it seems the trend has only continued.\n\nThese numbers suggest that Americans are rejecting the Obama administration's gun control agenda. Two years ago, after the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, President Obama showed real remorse for the young lives lost, yet offered a misguided response by trying to push through anti-gun legislation. His gun control measure, which would have expanded background checks and banned \"assault weapons,\" didn't get very far in Congress. Now, it's clear his gun control agenda is just as unpopular outside Capitol Hill.\n\nThe Obama administration hasn't let this failed bill halt their anti-gun plans, however. One look at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF) efforts suggests he and his cohorts are more determined than ever to restrict gun access. However, some of his administration's methods are being exposed by members of Congress who are concerned about an unfair rollback of the Second Amendment rights.\n\nIt's time the president stops following his misguided intuition and starts paying attention to the numbers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans are increasingly embracing gun rights..05/26/2016 5:25:55AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Americans are increasingly embracing gun rights.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Pew: Highest Support for Gun Rights in 25 Years", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/04/20/pew-highest-support-for-gun-rights-in-25-years-n1987741", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/28/1579678b-6ed8-4ab6-ad11-b02f5900bc17.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Americans are increasingly embracing gun rights.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Pew: Highest Support for Gun Rights in 25 Years", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/04/20/pew-highest-support-for-gun-rights-in-25-years-n1987741", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/28/1579678b-6ed8-4ab6-ad11-b02f5900bc17.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Pew: Highest Support for Gun Rights in 25 Years, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf94\"", "article_summary": "In a survey conducted in December 2014, it was revealed that 52 percent of Americans believe defending gun rights is more important than gun control, as opposed to 46 percent who believe gun ownership should be restricted.\nHis gun control measure, which would have expanded background checks and banned \"assault weapons,\" didn't get very far in Congress.\nAmericans are increasingly embracing their gun rights because they recognize firearms are an important resource for self-defense.\nNow, it's clear his gun control agenda is just as unpopular outside Capitol Hill.\nThese numbers suggest that Americans are rejecting the Obama administration's gun control agenda."}
