Warren answered that Clinton had experience in investing in people, so they could afford to live in their communities, contribute, and have good paying jobs.\n\n\u201cMyself and twelve other mayors around the state of Massachusetts believe that Hillary Clinton understands what needs to be done in job creation, investment, and education,\u201d said Warren.\n\nJohnston said the core of Sanders\u2019 message was that the country needs to invest in infrastructure to create new jobs and ensure that everyone has access to affordable healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on the economic inequities that have developed over the last several decades,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cBernie Sanders is very focused on that.\u201d\n\nBut which candidate has a better idea of how to get the money to make these things happen?\n\n\u201cI think that Senator Sanders has a very specific plan to raise significant revenue,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cOnly the wealthy are going to be taxed in a serious way\u2013and they should be. As he says, we bailed out Wall Street, now it\u2019s time that Wall Street helped us.\u201d\n\nAs for Clinton?\n\n\u201cWhat Secretary Clinton talks about is the transactions that go on on Wall Street, and making sure those are taxed, so we make the investments that matter on Main Street, in all of our cities and towns,\u201d said Warren.\n\nJon asked the surrogates how their candidates would reduce the cost of healthcare. Johnston mentioned Sanders\u2019 support of medicare.\n\n\u201cWe need a simpler kind of system in this country, and I think the medicare for all plan makes enormous sense in terms of access and in terms of cost containment,\u201d said Johnston.\n\nWarren noted that Clinton wants to build off the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cShe still believes in the public option, and she believes that we need to work with states to impliment that,\u201d said Warren. \u201cThat could help expand access to healthcare for folks. We want to bring down the costs, including deductibles.\u201d\n\nWatch the mini-debate here:\n\nAnd view the extended segment here:", "article_metadata": {"description": "With just two days to go until Massachusetts voters get their chance to weigh in on the presidential race, Clinton and Sanders campaign surrogates held a mini-debate with WBZ political analyst Jon Keller.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/02/28/keller-large-clinton-sanders-surrogates-debate/", "image": {"width": 628, "secure_url": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/keller22.jpg?w=628", "identifier": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/keller22.jpg?w=628", "height": 353}, "type": "article", "description": "With just two days to go until Massachusetts voters get their chance to weigh in on the presidential race, Clinton and Sanders campaign surrogates held a mini-debate with WBZ political analyst Jon Keller.", "title": "Keller @ Large: Clinton, Sanders Surrogates Debate"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/keller22.jpg?w=628", "description": "With just two days to go until Massachusetts voters get their chance to weigh in on the presidential race, Clinton and Sanders campaign surrogates held a mini-debate with WBZ political analyst Jon Keller.", "site": "CBSboston", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Keller @ Large: Clinton, Sanders Surrogates Debate"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Boston News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Boston's Best", "msvalidate.01": "FDD12CE797EAB78953FDE9ACF7F312A5", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Boston", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston"}, "keywords": "bernie sanders, hillary clinton, super tuesday, phil johnston, setti warren, democrats, massachusetts primary", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://boston.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/72ff1baf55fe94c284ce5747d8d4a96e?s=16", "news_keywords": "bernie sanders, hillary clinton, jon keller, keller at large, phil johnston, setti warren"}, "article_summary": "As he says, we bailed out Wall Street, now it\u2019s time that Wall Street helped us.\u201dAs for Clinton?\nSetti Warren, mayor of Newton, represented Clinton\u2019s campaign, while former Massachusetts Democratic Party chair Phil Johnston represented Sanders\u2019 campaign.\nBOSTON (CBS) \u2014 With just two days to go until Massachusetts voters get their chance to weigh in on the presidential race, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaign surrogates held a mini-debate with WBZ political analyst Jon Keller.\nWarren answered that Clinton had experience in investing in people, so they could afford to live in their communities, contribute, and have good paying jobs.\n\u201cI think that Senator Sanders has a very specific plan to raise significant revenue,\u201d said Johnston."}
