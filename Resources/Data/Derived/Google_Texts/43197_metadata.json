So I wonder what I should be? I don't really see myself as an exclamation point kind of guy, so that's out. Maybe Kevin? is the ticket. But would that make me seem curious and questioning, or tentative and questionable?\n\nHmmm. Kevin@ is no good. It just seems like half an email address. Kevin# looks like a hashtag written by a confused oldster. Kevin% would remind a tiny number of people of an old BASIC variable. Kevin& just begs the question: Kevin & what? Kevin* would make people start looking around for the footnote. Kevin/ doesn't even make sense.\n\nBut Kevin> has potential, doesn't it? Forward looking! To the point! Greater than all the rest of you! Plus it sort of looks like an HTML tag, which gives it a faux Silicon Valley techie vibe. And best of all? It's not an exclamation point! Jeb is going to be sorry he didn't think of this first.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT: Seriously, is it something in the water, or what? Jeb and Hillary both have hideous logos. Who's making design decisions in campaign-land these days?", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/06/watch-school-jeb-punctuation-game", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Watch me school Jeb in how to play the punctuation game"}, "twitter": {"title": "Watch me school Jeb in how to play the punctuation game", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/06/watch-school-jeb-punctuation-game", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb43\"", "article_summary": "I don't really see myself as an exclamation point kind of guy, so that's out.\nKevin/ doesn't even make sense.\nIt's not an exclamation point!\nKevin# looks like a hashtag written by a confused oldster.\nI see that Jeb Bush is now Jeb!"}
