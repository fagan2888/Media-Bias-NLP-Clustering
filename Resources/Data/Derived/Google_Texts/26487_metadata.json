Or the first time you filled out your medical history form without having to ask your parents whether you\u2019d had a meningococcal vaccination or if there\u2019s a family history of heart disease?\n\nA poll conducted by the University of Michigan\u2019s C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital revealed that parents have very little faith (pdf) in their adolescents\u2019 ability to do these things. Less than half of parents believe their 18- or 19-year-olds can make a doctor\u2019s appointment. Perhaps as a result, only 30% of parents said that their 18- to 30-year-olds transferred to adult care at age 18.\n\nThe most popular part of Obamacare has long been the provision allowing young Americans to stay on their parents\u2019 plan until their 26th birthday. The rate of uninsured 19- to 25-year-olds declined to 21% in the first quarter this year, from 34% in 2010.\n\nBut even those of us between 18 and 26 who don\u2019t have to worry about getting our own healthcare still need to know how to perform basic tasks like making appointments and filling out medical forms.\n\nThe question, then, is parents\u2019 pessimism misplaced?\n\nThe internet has been both a boon and a hindrance to adolescent health literacy. Information is readily available to teens on the internet, but much of it is bad information. There hasn\u2019t been much research into how health-literate adolescents are, but one study from 2012 showed that only half of high-school students display adequate levels of health literacy.\n\nIn other words, parents\u2019 pessimism about their kids\u2019 ability to manage their own health care isn\u2019t unfounded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When was the first time you went to the doctor or ER by yourself?
