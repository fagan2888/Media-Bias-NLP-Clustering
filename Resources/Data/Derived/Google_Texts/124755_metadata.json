A large body of scientific evidence suggests that the presence of guns in the home directly increases the risk of suicide, partly because people who are attempting to kill themselves are more likely to succeed when they opt for a gun.\n\nParticularly in the mental health community, there\u2019s been a renewed emphasis on safe gun storage to prevent kids struggling with depression from accidentally getting their hands on their parents\u2019 firearms. Researchers at the University of Washington assumed that would mean that kids with suicidal tendencies would be more likely to live in homes where guns are out of reach.\n\nBut, after they reviewed the data from a national survey of more than 10,000 U.S. teens, they found that wasn\u2019t actually the case. Kids struggling with mental health issues were just as likely to report easy access to guns as kids without the same risk factors for suicide. That even held true among teens who had made a previous attempt to kill themselves.\n\n\u201cSafe firearm storage is widely recommended by public health experts, professional medical societies, and gun rights organizations, especially for households where children might be suffering from mental heath and substance abuse issues that put them at increased risk for suicide or unintentional injury,\u201d Joseph A. Simonetti, the study\u2019s lead author, told Medical Research. \u201cThere is an obvious disconnect between generally agreed upon recommendations for firearm safety practices and what we\u2019re actually doing in the community.\u201d\n\nAddressing this issue is incredibly inexpensive. Tools to keep guns away from kids, like trigger locks, cost less than $10 at major stores. Some cities have recently moved to make this type of safe storage mandatory.\n\nDoctors can easily be part of the solution, too. In light of previous research that\u2019s confirmed that many doctors aren\u2019t asking about guns in the home \u2014 in some states, they\u2019re even legally prohibited from doing so \u2014 Simonetti recommended finding ways to remove the barriers to those conversations with medical professionals.\n\n\u201cImportantly, several studies have shown that parents are not offended when providers ask about safe firearm storage during clinical encounters,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nNonetheless, linking gun violence prevention with the medical community is often incredibly politically contentious. For instance, gun rights proponents blocked President Obama\u2019s nominee for the vacant U.S. Surgeon General spot for months because of his public comments about gun control as a public health issue \u2014 even though that\u2019s the mainstream position of every major medical association in the country. Dr. Vivek Murthy was finally confirmed by the Senate last month, in what was largely characterized as a victory over the National Rifle Association.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"There is an obvious disconnect between generally agreed upon recommendations for firearm safety practices and what we\u2019re actually doing in the community.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"There is an obvious disconnect between generally agreed upon recommendations for firearm safety practices and what we\u2019re actually doing in the community.\"", "title": "Teens With Mental Health Problems Often Have Easy Access To Guns At Home", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/01/05/3607803/teens-mental-health-guns/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_239911273.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"There is an obvious disconnect between generally agreed upon recommendations for firearm safety practices and what we\u2019re actually doing in the community.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_239911273-321x214.jpg", "title": "Teens With Mental Health Problems Often Have Easy Access To Guns At Home", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_239911273.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shutterstock_239911273.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-05T08:48:32+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb73\"", "article_summary": "Health Teens With Mental Health Problems Often Have Easy Access To Guns At Home CREDIT: ShutterstockU.S. teenagers with a history of mental health problems and suicidal tendencies are often able to easily access firearms in their homes, which could increase their risk of killing themselves, according to the results from a new study published in JAMA Psychiatry.\nKids struggling with mental health issues were just as likely to report easy access to guns as kids without the same risk factors for suicide.\nParticularly in the mental health community, there\u2019s been a renewed emphasis on safe gun storage to prevent kids struggling with depression from accidentally getting their hands on their parents\u2019 firearms.\nTools to keep guns away from kids, like trigger locks, cost less than $10 at major stores.\nBut, after they reviewed the data from a national survey of more than 10,000 U.S. teens, they found that wasn\u2019t actually the case."}
