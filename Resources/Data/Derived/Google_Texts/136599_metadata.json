China Horrell, her co-worker, had a pulmonary embolism that cost more than $100,000 to treat. And Daniel McCloskey, a comic-book artist, told of being uninsured when he smashed his teeth in a bicycle accident last year, at a cost of more than $22,000.\n\nThese are among the dozens of stories Ms. Sokolow, 26, has collected over the past two years, showing how the lives of Pittsburgh artists are intertwined with their struggles over the costs of medical coverage. Her online video series, \u201cHealthy Artists,\u201d has chronicled the experiences of more than 40 painters, poets and musicians \u2014 talented, ambitious and often with a painful story of medical debt \u2014 and drawn the attention of national media figures like Michael Moore.\n\n\u201cEveryone in America has a health care story,\u201d said Ms. Sokolow, whose project has culminated in a new 30-minute documentary, \u201cHealthy Artists: The Movie.\u201d\n\nMs. Sokolow\u2019s films \u2014 made on a shoestring budget and uploaded to YouTube \u2014 are also a microcosm of the national health care debate as it relates to the young creative class, a group that is disproportionately underinsured. And while her survey of Pittsburgh\u2019s scene is unusual, it is also an example of grass-roots approaches around the country, like the O+ Festival in Kingston, N.Y., and San Francisco, where performers are paid in free health care.\n\nAccording to one survey last year, 43 percent of artists lacked health insurance, more than double the national average for the uninsured.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJulie\u2019s work unearthed what was obvious but hidden at the same time,\u201d said Dan Byers, a curator at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh who helped judge a \u201cHealthy Artists\u201d poster competition that is featured in the documentary. \u201cIt brought the more abstract national debate into a very specific, concrete, local context.\u201d\n\nMs. Sokolow, who grew up in New Jersey and studied psychology and fiction writing at the University of Pittsburgh, said the origins of her project came through her volunteer work at a nonprofit organization, HealthCare 4 All PA. Assigned to film interviews with people who had dire health care problems, she was troubled by a lack of involvement among 20-somethings.\n\nIn response, the \u201cHealthy Artists\u201d series was conceived as a kind of \u201cindie \u2018Cribs\u2019 for social justice,\u201d profiling young creatives in brief vignettes and getting them talking in a personal way about medical issues. The pieces were collected online and publicized through social media.\n\nThe goal, Ms. Sokolow said, was not to dwell on tragedies but to approach the problem with some optimism and use the films to advocate for broad reform through the idea that basic health care is a human right.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take a more positive approach, to not just focus on health care horror stories, but the people who would be empowered by a universal health care system,\u201d Ms. Sokolow said. \u201cLook at the work they are able to do without it. Imagine what they\u2019d be able to do if they had a social safety net.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nYet part of the power of the vignettes is how they detail the frustrations of freelancers in an economy in which health insurance has historically been tied to employment. In one profile, Jennifer Gooch demonstrated some of her work as a \u201cmusician, artist, crafter, maker, doer,\u201d before tearfully recounting how she had declared bankruptcy after getting an $18,000 medical bill that included a colonoscopy.\n\n\u201cThe procedure I got would have cost $800 in a socialized-medicine country, and I lost 10 years of credit,\u201d Ms. Gooch, whose work has been covered by National Public Radio and the BBC, said in a recent interview. As a result of the bankruptcy, she had to give up her tailoring business. The $180-a-month plan she recently signed up for through the Affordable Care Act is a big help, she said, but still expensive.\n\nThe number of people ages 18 to 34 who have signed up for health coverage through federal and state exchanges grew substantially last month. But Ms. Gooch\u2019s view was echoed by many artists who came out for a gallery crawl in the artsy Garfield section of Pittsburgh, some of whom said they had signed up for plans, while others said they still could not afford one.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Sokolow said that with the completion of the 30-minute documentary, the \u201cHealthy Artists\u201d project in Pittsburgh was now largely finished, and that she hoped it would be a model for activism in other cities. She is also finishing her first feature film, \u201cAspie Seeks Love,\u201d another documentary about the dating life of a Pittsburgh man who learned in his 40s that he had Asperger\u2019s syndrome, and in her parallel career as a musician, she is recording her second album.\n\n\u201cJulie\u2019s ability to reach out through social media and connect artists and culture to a critical social policy issue is significant,\u201d said Jim Ferlo, a Pennsylvania state senator who has introduced a single-payer health care bill. \u201cI wish we could multiply her around the country.\u201d\n\nA subtext in the \u201cHealthy Artists\u201d films, and in Ms. Sokolow\u2019s wider advocacy, is a challenge to the notion that artists must suffer outside the basic economic protections of society. A single-payer health care system, offering coverage to all, could solve that problem, at least as far as it applies to health. But an important step, Ms. Sokolow said, is persuading artists simply to stand up for themselves and address a problem that is felt by all but rarely talked about.\n\n\u201cI would like for artists to be advocates for themselves and their own health and not buy into stereotypes,\u201d Ms. Sokolow said. \u201cThe people I profiled are working hard and trying to be healthy, and working against a society that\u2019s not allowing that for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140218172238, "twitter": {"description": "An online video project, \u201cHealthy
