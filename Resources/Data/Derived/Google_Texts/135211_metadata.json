For five years, Americans have been told that \u0091the tide of war is receding,' that we can pull back from the world at little cost to our interests and values. This has fed a perception that the United States is weak, and to people like Mr. Putin, weakness is provocative.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry warned of a \u201cstrong response\u201d by the United States and severe economic sanctions against Russia if Putin proceeds as he has threatened in Ukraine. Whose threats are more credible? Obama has retreated on everything from Iraq and Afghanistan to Iran's nuclear program and his \u201cred line,\u201d which Syria crossed and paid no price when it used chemical weapons against its own people. He has even retreated on domestic policy issues, most glaringly on the individual mandate in the misnamed Affordable Care Act.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

It\u2019s not just a question of military power. It is about formulating, articulating and implementing a consistent foreign policy that is credible and produces results in support of U.S. interests.\n\nSomewhere between Ron Paul's isolationism and neocon interventionism is what the U.S. should be modeling to the world. Somewhere between John F. Kennedy's noble but impractical ideal of \u201cpay any price, bear any burden\u201d in the defense of liberty and George McGovern's \u201cCome home, America\u201d is a foreign policy we should pursue. It's up to the president to articulate that policy and then make it credible by consistently acting on it. Kennedy also noted, \u201cDomestic policy can only defeat us; foreign policy can kill us.\u201d\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador John Bolton spoke last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He said, \u201cOur biggest national security crisis is Barack Obama.\u201d Bolton suggested the president allowed the murderers of America's ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three others to \u201cget away scot-free\u201d after he repeatedly promised they would be brought to justice.\n\nTyrants, terrorists and dictators watch an indecisive president and take note. Action matters far more than words.\n\nPresident Obama, perhaps our most self-absorbed chief executive, has said: \u201cI would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president -- with the possible exceptions of Johnson, FDR, and Lincoln -- just in terms of what we've gotten done in modern history.\u201d\n\nLeaving aside his hubris and a debate over whether retreat from the world and pressuring Israel to give up more land to its enemies are accomplishments, what should be concluded from such a ridiculous statement about America's foreign policy?\n\nFormer Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has observed: \u201cNo foreign policy \u2014 no matter how ingenious \u2014 has any chance of success if it is born in the minds of a few and carried in the hearts of none.\u201d\n\nAmerican foreign policy in 2014 hasn't been born, because under this administration, it does not even appear to have been conceived yet.\n\nCAL THOMAS, a Washington Examiner columnist, is nationally syndicated by the Tribune Content Agency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may eventually be discovered, but there is something else that has been missing for much longe,r and its \u201cdisappearance\u201d has far greater implications for America.
