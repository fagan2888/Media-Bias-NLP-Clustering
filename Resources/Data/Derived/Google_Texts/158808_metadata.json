As of Friday, however, about 218,000 appointments had been booked and about 23,000 applications had been processed. Officials said those figures put New York\u2019s program on the verge of surpassing San Francisco\u2019s, which began in 2009 and is currently the largest in the country.\n\nWith such a large backlog of appointments, city officials said they had been urgently retooling the enrollment system and had more than doubled its capacity as of Friday. New measures underway include opening two large enrollment centers and doubling the program\u2019s staff, to about 200, officials said on Friday. The changes have enabled administrators to not only add the 70,000 new slots to the calendar but also to expedite nearly 43,000 appointments, moving them from the summer and fall to much earlier dates.\n\nIn interviews this week, officials said their original projections had been based in large part on the experiences of other cities with municipal ID programs, including New Haven, Oakland, Calif., and San Francisco. In those cities, about 1 percent of the eligible population had applied for the cards each year.\n\nPhoto\n\nNew York officials also convened focus groups to gauge interest and conferred with various third parties, including business and religious leaders as well as advocates for the homeless, immigrants and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, who can declare their preferred gender, or no gender at all, often for the first time on a government-issued ID.\n\nWhile there was broad enthusiasm for the initiative, officials said, some immigrant advocates had warned that rules requiring the government to retain certain personal documents might dissuade immigrants without legal status from registering.\n\nAfter weighing those and other factors \u2014 including the estimated size of the undocumented immigrant population and the disproportionately large number of city residents without driver\u2019s licenses \u2014 New York officials decided to err on the side of caution. They built a system that could handle an annual application flow equal to about 2.5 percent of the eligible population, which is how they arrived at the 300,000 figure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in an early sign that they had underestimated the appetite for the IDs, the 17 enrollment centers around the city processed a total of more than 1,000 applications on the first day and more than 800 on the second. In the meantime, anticipation among residents gave way to griping, as waits in some places lasted hours.\n\nThe city quickly took steps to \u201cmeet that demand with an equally ferocious response,\u201d said Nisha Agarwal, commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, which is helping to coordinate the program.\n\nAt the end of the second day, officials activated an online application system, which had been prepared in case of a spike in demand. Overloaded, it failed to work for several hours.\n\nSocial media crackled with complaints about the difficulty of getting an appointment and about the long hold times to speak with an operator at the city\u2019s 311 service center, which was helping schedule appointments.\n\nAlfonso Xicali, 38, a day laborer from Mexico, said he had stood in line at an enrollment center in the Bronx for at least two hours on each of the first two days, but was turned away both times because there were too many applicants. On the second day, he was redirected to the website and to 311 to schedule an appointment. When he called 311, he said, the operators told him they were not prepared to make appointments. As of Thursday, he had yet to find an available appointment online that fit his work schedule.\n\n\u201cI think they put too few centers for too many people,\u201d he said. \u201cVery frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe city sought to alleviate the pressure, bolstering the work force at the enrollment centers by redeploying city employees from various departments and hiring new workers. Officials also extended the centers\u2019 business hours and opened two smaller, temporary centers.\n\nIncreased staffing and other improvements at 311 reduced the average hold times, which in recent days were down to less than one minute, officials said.\n\nNew Yorkers continue to register for appointments at a high rate: about 7,000 a day on average last week and about 5,000 a day this week.\n\nPhoto\n\nCity officials have played down the problems, portraying them as a byproduct of a popular program. The unexpectedly high number of applicants, they said, served to repudiate concerns that the retention of information would scare undocumented immigrants away. (The city does not ask applicants to reveal their immigration status.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt just tells you the importance of people having a valid ID that can validate their presence and who they are,\u201d said Melissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker and a Democrat.\n\nMs. Agarwal recalled visiting an enrollment center at the Mid-Manhattan Library on the first day and talking to people waiting in line.\n\n\u201cThey were really excited about this opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that many opportunities in public service to feel like the work you\u2019re doing actually is accomplishing something, and that felt like a moment where I got to see that really tangibly.\u201d\n\nCity officials said that if they had deployed hundreds more workers from the outset and been met with a far smaller turnout, they would have been accused of wasting money.\n\n\u201cOur approach was fiscally responsible,\u201d Ms. Agarwal said. \u201cI feel we really did the due diligence.\u201d\n\nCentral to the city\u2019s strategy are the two new enrollment centers, which officials are calling \u201chubs.\u201d The city first plans to use them to speed up the processing of scheduled appointments, and then will open them to walk-ins. The two existing temporary centers \u2014 one in Brooklyn, the other in Queens \u2014 may be augmented with up to three more.\n\nOfficials are trying to calculate and adhere to an acceptable maximum wait time, while also tempering expectations and counseling patience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBertha Asitinbay, 37, an Ecuadorean immigrant, said she was mostly drawn to the discounts to cultural institutions that come with the card, but had been unable to get an appointment before April.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m losing so much important time,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you imagine? That\u2019s three months that I could be taking my daughters to the museums.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the mayor gave careful enough thought to all the people who wanted an ID,\u201d she continued, adding, \u201cBut what can you do?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150206060026, "twitter": {"description": "The introduction of municipal identification cards, one
