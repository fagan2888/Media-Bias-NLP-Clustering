IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THIS WEEK THE STATE'S GOVERNOR SIGNED SWEEPING NEW LEGISLATION ON GROUNDWATER PUMPING MAKING IT THE LAST STATE IN THE WEST TO REGULATE THE PRACTICE. AND WITH SOME LOCAL WELLS RUNNING DRY, THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT ARE DRILLING DEEPER. AND THAT'S LEAVING SOME POOR COMMUNITIES IN THE DUST. HERE'S NBC'S AL ROKER. >> Reporter: A SPECK OF A TOWN IN CALIFORNIA'S SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. >> THIS IS OUR DAILY LIFE. NO WATER. >> Reporter: HER WELL RAN DRY. SO THREE MONTHS YOU ARE LIVING WITHOUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE. >> A PRECIOUS LIQUID. YES. WE CAN'T SHOWER. WE HAVE TO CARRY IN BUCKETS TO SHOWER. >> Reporter: GLADYS AND HER HUSBAND OWN THEIR HOME. AND WHILE THE COUNTY'S DELIVERING DRINKING WATER, THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN WELL. SO WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THE WATER FROM? >> WELL, WHEN MY HUSBAND GETS OFF OF WORK HE HAS TO GO HUNTING FOR WATER FOR US. >> Reporter: THEY ARE NOT ALONE. IN NEARBY EAST PORTERVILLE ROUGHLY 1,200 PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT WATER. >> ALL GONE. >> Reporter: IN LATE AUGUST THE COUNTY HAD RALLIED A TEAM TO ASSESS AND DELIVER. >> A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT HERE ARE IN DESPAIR. >> Reporter: THE FOOD, NUT AND DAIRY BASKET FOR THE NATION. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A CENTURY THERE WAS NO SERVICE WATER, THAT'S TO SAY WATER FROM MOUNTAINS, RIVERS AND LAKES TO DELIVER TO FARMERS. >> WE ARE TOTALLY RELIANT NOW ON WHATEVER FLOWS UNDERNEATH OUR FEET. >> Reporter: AND IN ORDER TO GET THAT WATER MOST EVERYONE IS HAVING TO DRILL DEEPER. BY JULY OF THIS YEAR THE COUNTY HAD ALREADY ISSUED MORE WELL DRILLING PERMITS THAN THEY DID IN ALL OF 2013. >> SO IF AGRICULTURE LOSES THAT SCARCE PRECIOUS RESOURCE TO GROW AGRICULTURAL CROPS, IT'S NOT JUST AN IMPACT TO THE FARMER. IT'S AN IMPACT TO THIS ENTIRE PART OF CALIFORNIA. >> Reporter: BUT WATER APPLICANTS SAY THE LACK OF GROUNDWATER REGULATION HAS LEFT POOR COMMUNITIES VULNERABLE. >> IT'S LITERALLY A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. SO IT'S WHOEVER CAN AFFORD -- PUT IN A DEEPER STRAW WINS. >> Reporter: LAURA IS CO-FOUNDER FOR THE NOT FOR PROFIT COMMUNITY WATER CENTER. A LOT OF MONEY'S MADE ON AGRICULTURE HERE. >> WELL, I THINK WE ARE ALL PART OF THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO START THINKING THAT WAY MORE WHOLISTICALLY BECAUSE WE'RE ALL INTERCONNECTED. >> Reporter: AND RESIDENTS LIKE GLADYS ARE HOPING THE FUTURE HOLDS A SOLUTION. >> YOU SEE IT HAPPENING SOMEWHERE ELSE, BUT NOT HERE IN CALIFORNIA.
