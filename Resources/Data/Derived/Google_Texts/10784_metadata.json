More than one-tenth of all job growth since 2009 has been temporary and temp hiring is becoming a core part of businesses rather than a short-term solution in a questionable economy.\n\nThe problem for the economy is that uncertainty breeds more uncertainty. In a consumer-driven economy it\u2019s a viscous cycle. Businesses are uncertain so they don\u2019t hire permanent employees; employees are uncertain about income so they don\u2019t spend.\n\n\u201cWe do not see this as an indicator that we are at a \u2018peak\u2019 economy,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Joerres, chief executive of ManpowerGroup, one of the country\u2019s largest staffing firms. \u201cWe rather see it as more of a structural or secular change, that our industry will be absorbing more of the workforce than it did in the past.\u201d\n\nThe thing is, temp hiring is terribly inefficient. Companies like Manpower take a large part of the compensation. Simply put, the value of being able to fire a worker is more coveted than the extra cost of hiring temps.\n\nFor me, the solution is to make it much easier to hire and fire employees. It\u2019s painful but it\u2019s an incentive for employees to work harder and would mean they collect 100% of the compensation for labor. In exchange, the government needs to provide re-training and benefits for fired workers. Denmark has moved to that model with some success.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Flexibility is touted as the end-goal for a competitive economy but the reality isn&#8217;t as pretty as the theory as government meddling has killed incentives to hire employees permanently.\r\n By Adam Button", "og": {"site_name": "http://www.forexlive.com", "description": "Flexibility is touted as the end-goal for a competitive economy but the reality isn&#8217;t as pretty as the theory as government meddling has killed incentives to hire employees permanently.", "title": "The &#8216;flexible&#8217; jobs market is broken", "url": "http://news.forexlive.com/!/the-flexible-jobs-market-is-broken-20140407", "image": "//az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20140407/flexible-jobs-market.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forexlive", "card": "summary", "creator": "@forexlive"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#232629", "robots": "noodp", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "5BC3182C8EF9D6BA898EA9201AAD2463", "google-site-verification": "5kizQNkYtCdVSkaBtIgir1HUxQlZnh3hgg-seqAJpWY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84eb\"", "article_summary": "Businesses are uncertain so they don\u2019t hire permanent employees; employees are uncertain about income so they don\u2019t spend.\nFlexibility is touted as the end-goal for a competitive economy but the reality isn\u2019t as pretty as the theory as government meddling has killed incentives to hire employees permanently.\n\u201cWe rather see it as more of a structural or secular change, that our industry will be absorbing more of the workforce than it did in the past.\u201dThe thing is, temp hiring is terribly inefficient.\nThe problem for the economy is that uncertainty breeds more uncertainty.\nObamacare and uncertainty has accelerated a huge shift to temp agencies, the WSJ reports today."}
