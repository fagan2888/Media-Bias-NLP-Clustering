(AP) - Wyoming public health officials don\u2019t systematically track heroin deaths, but it\u2019s clear that the nation\u2019s least populated state is not immune to the national trend of rising heroin use.\n\nAcross the nation, people addicted to expensive prescription painkillers increasingly are turning to heroin because it\u2019s cheaper - often with fatal results.\n\nIn Wyoming, overdose deaths from prescription and illegal drugs rose from 29 in 2005 to 116 in 2012, the latest figures available, according to state Department of Health.\n\nTen of the 2012 deaths were from illegal drugs, which may include heroin and other drugs. Five of the 2012 deaths were a combination of illegal and prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cWhile heroin use at any level is a concern, at this time it would not be considered among our highest health priorities,\u201d department spokeswoman Kim Deti said in a written response to The AP.\n\nHeroin\u2019s toll comes into razor-sharp focus in the criminal justice system.\n\nOn March 21, U.S. District Judge Alan B. Johnson of Cheyenne sentenced a Laramie man to five years in prison for providing heroin that resulted in a friend\u2019s fatal overdose in April 2013. Kyle Adams, 25, pleaded guilty to providing the heroin that killed Kaleb Paul Skog, 25.\n\nSkog, of Evanston, had graduated summa cum laude from the University of Wyoming and lived in pain from cystic fibrosis.\n\nAdams told the judge he started taking the prescription painkiller Vicodin for a back injury when he was a teenager and later turned to heroin because it was cheaper. David Weiss, an assistant federal public defender, said Adams traveled to Denver to buy heroin but wasn\u2019t dealing the drug for profit.\n\n\u201cI think something that needs to be said on behalf of Kyle is he was suffering with a several-year opiate addiction,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cAnd when he turned to heroin, it took off.\u201d\n\nHeroin overdoses that killed a young bull rider and two other people in Cheyenne in 2009 uncovered a network that brought heroin in from Denver.\n\nBull rider Bryan Guthrie, 21, had been ranked third in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association before he was knocked out of competition with a leg injury earlier in 2009.\n\nNearly five years later, Laramie County District Attorney Scott Homar said he sees an increase in heroin possession and sales cases.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s attributable to the prescription pill problem that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd when people can\u2019t get the prescription, \u201cheroin\u2019s a cheap, easy replacement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wyoming public health officials don't systematically track heroin deaths, but it's clear that the nation's least populated state is not immune to the national trend of rising heroin use.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/5/heroin-grows-as-alternative-to-prescription-drugs/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Wyoming public health officials don\u2019t systematically track heroin deaths, but it\u2019s clear that the nation\u2019s least populated state is not immune to the national trend of rising heroin use.", "title": "Heroin grows as alternative prescription drugs"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Wyoming public health officials don't systematically track heroin deaths, but it's clear that the nation's least populated state is not immune to the national trend of rising heroin use.", "card": "summary", "title": "Heroin grows as alternative prescription drugs"}, "Author": "BEN NEARY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Law Crime, Cheyenne"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6ac\"", "article_summary": "Ten of the 2012 deaths were from illegal drugs, which may include heroin and other drugs.\nFive of the 2012 deaths were a combination of illegal and prescription drugs.\n(AP) - Wyoming public health officials don\u2019t systematically track heroin deaths, but it\u2019s clear that the nation\u2019s least populated state is not immune to the national trend of rising heroin use.\nIn Wyoming, overdose deaths from prescription and illegal drugs rose from 29 in 2005 to 116 in 2012, the latest figures available, according to state Department of Health.\nAcross the nation, people addicted to expensive prescription painkillers increasingly are turning to heroin because it\u2019s cheaper - often with fatal results."}
