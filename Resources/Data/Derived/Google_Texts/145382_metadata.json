(In other words, sometimes the easy answer is the correct one.)\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen told reporters that the tax gap \u2014 the difference between what taxpayers owe and what they actually pay \u2014 is up to about $458 billion a year, Tax Pro Brian Faler reports. (That number fell to roughly $406 billion annually between 2008 and 2010 after IRS enforcement efforts like audits.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSome other tidbits via Brian: The taxpayer compliance rate is around 82 percent, or about the same as the last time the IRS tackled the tax gap in 2012. Around 1 percent of the income that the IRS gets reports on, like W-2s from employers, gets misreported. But about 63 percent of the income that isn\u2019t subject to withholding or third-party reporting \u2014 like small business income \u2014 was under-reported.\n\n\"We're famous as a tax-compliant society but that's pretty much as long as we have the information from third parties,\u201d Koskinen said.\n\nBut while Koskinen noted that the IRS\u2019 budget has taken a pretty severe chop in recent years, he also said it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to try to recover all of the uncollected revenue, even as the federal debt keeps growing. \u201cRealistically that wouldn't work because the strain on taxpayers, and our resources, would be too great,\u201d he said. More from Brian: http://politico.pro/1qZuKmo\n\nTHE RESPONSE FROM THE HILL: \u201cThis is money that could be put to good use shoring up critical programs such as Medicare,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s time the IRS put an effective tracking and auditing system in place to locate this lost money.\u201d\n\nTHE RESPONSE FROM OFF THE HILL: The National Association of Enrolled Agents noted that the latest statistics are from before the IRS started seeing its budget cut. \u201cLet\u2019s not conclude that a flat tax gap indicates tax compliance hasn\u2019t taken a hit because of reduced IRS resources,\u201d said the group\u2019s Robert Kerr. \u201cWe won\u2019t know that for years.\u201d\n\nWELCOME TO FRIDAY, where we\u2019re excited for three to six more games of this Capitals-Penguins series. Quick question though: Have some of the Caps fans around town grown playoff beards too, or are hockey people just more likely to have beards?\n\nReach out with your scoops, feedback or if you just want to talk playoff beards.\n\nEmail: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, kodonnell@politico.com.\n\nTwitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nWE\u2019VE GOT A LAWSUIT: South Dakota, in what could be a sign of things to come from other states, expanded its efforts to collect sales tax on out-of-state retailers \u2014 filing a lawsuit just before a new law on those taxes went into effect. (The retail groups who announced and support the suit didn\u2019t say who exactly the state sued.) South Dakota's new law, poised to go into effect on May 1, forces retailers without a physical presence in the state to collect sales taxes if they sell at least $200,000 worth of products or conduct at least 200 transactions.\n\nWith online sales tax legislation stalled on Capitol Hill, key proponents like Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) have predicted that states would file suit if Congress wouldn\u2019t act. That\u2019s in no small part because Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote last year that the Supreme Court should revisit its holding, last stated in the 1992 case Quill Corporation v. North Dakota, that states can only tax businesses that have a physical presence within their borders.\n\nWAIT A SECOND: Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is none too pleased about what he believes is the excessive secrecy surrounding federal tax regulations \u2014 think anything from Treasury\u2019s new inversion rules to all sorts of IRS regulations to even the Affordable Care Act. Congress gets to examine the costs and benefits of most regulations that will have an annual economic impact of at least $100 million a year.\n\nBut Hatch said that the White House and Treasury have a \u201clittle-understood and non-public memorandum of understanding,\u201d now more than three decades old, that basically says that IRS regulations generally don\u2019t have a major impact on the economy. And now the Utah Republican is pressing Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to make that memorandum public, even as he said he understood why the department might want to avoid interference from the White House and the argument that tax regulations merely implement policies instead of creating new regulatory burdens. \u201cThese considerations must be weighed against the public benefit of regulatory transparency and an honest accounting of the affects tax regulations have on families and businesses across the country.\u201d A story from The Washington Times, which had the letter first: http://bit.ly/21idwgQ.\n\nPARTISANSHIP: The House Ways and Means Committee passed on a party-line vote a measure that blocks the IRS from collecting lists of donors that contribute more than $5,000 to nonprofits, as Tax Pro Katy O\u2019Donnell reports. In other words, it was the latest installment of the Koch brothers (for the bill) versus the campaign finance reformers (against). Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) noted the IRS itself has considered scrapping Schedule B on the Form 990, while adding the agency still isn\u2019t really to be trusted. Democrats warned the bill would take away one of the few protections against ensuring foreign money isn\u2019t used in domestic campaigns. More from Katy: http://politico.pro/1UjNw3v.\n\nProbably no shocker here, but The New York Times\u2019 editorial board is on the Democrats\u2019 side on this one. http://nyti.ms/1SCwRUh\n\nBIPARTISANSHIP: Ways and Means passed two other bills \u2014 one to allow the IRS to share taxpayer information to help in missing children cases, and another to battle identity theft \u2014 without any real rancor at all. On the tax fraud bill, Republicans even agreed to drop a provision that would make stealing an identity punishable by up to five years in prison, given concerns among Democrats and immigration advocates that the measure might ensnare undocumented workers that use Social Security numbers from friends or family to get jobs. More still from Katy: http://politico.pro/1SvQvVk\n\nOBAMA RIFFS ON THE ECONOMY: The New York Times\u2019s has a big takeout of President Barack Obama\u2019s views on his own economic legacy, and there are a couple of interesting takeaways for the tax wonks among us.\n\nFirst, Obama basically thinks he got the grand bargain: \u201cProgressives don\u2019t fully appreciate the degree to which the 2011 budget deal not only averted a potential default but actually limited the potential damage of a newly emboldened Congress in imposing austerity on a still-fragile recovery,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd by me winning in 2012 and getting the Bush tax cuts for the upper 2 percent repealed, we ended up getting a grand bargain. It\u2019s just we got it sequentially instead of all at once.\u201d (That idea might grate on some who wanted more of a tax reform out of a big deficit deal.)\n\nAnd, perhaps not surprisingly, Obama thinks the Republicans running for president have lost sight of reality when it comes to economics. \u201cIf we can\u2019t puncture some of the mythology around austerity, politics or tax cuts or the mythology that\u2019s been built up around the Reagan revolution, where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts, as opposed to a shift in interest-rate policy \u2014 if we can\u2019t describe that effectively, then we\u2019re doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes.\u201d Full piece here: http://nyti.ms/1Wtg1vL\n\nGUESSING THEY\u2019RE NOT ALONE: The conservative Heritage Foundation said Thursday that Wyden\u2019s efforts to simplify depreciation rules were nice, but not nearly as exciting as the idea of full expensing. Wyden\u2019s plan, Heritage said, \u201cwould reduce the administrative and accounting costs for businesses. That would have a modest positive impact. But because it does not reduce the tax-lives of assets or move toward expensing, it does not reduce the cost of capital and would not significantly increase investment, productivity or real wages.\u201d More here: http://dailysign.al/1VWUw7J\n\nABOUT THAT VAT: You\u2019ve all heard the argument about how a value-added tax can be regressive, or just an ATM for government. (You\u2019ve even heard Ted Cruz swear up and down that his plan isn\u2019t a VAT.) But over at the Tax Policy Center, Bill Gale wants to give assurances that a VAT doesn\u2019t have to be a burden on small businesses, as long as some sort of exemption is included. \u201cA recent study by Treasury economists suggests that the optimal exemption is about $200,000 in sales for a 10 percent VAT,\u201d Gale writes.\n\nLEBRON\u2019S FAIR SHARE: It\u2019s perhaps a bit simplistic, Politifact found, but the outspoken Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) was basically right with this claim: Basketball uberstar LeBron James \u201cstops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season.\u201d In fact, James makes almost $72,000 a quarter, and the payroll tax cap lands at $118,500. (Many Democrats want to restart the payroll tax for income over $250,000.)\n\nStill, Politifact notes Grayson\u2019s construct doesn\u2019t take into account all the practice time James puts in (not to mention his role in \"Trainwreck\"), that the NBA season actually starts in October and that LeBron pays other taxes outside the income tax as well.
