John Kasich crush criticism of Medicaid expansion by misleading the state about billions in Obamacare spending?\n\nThat is exactly what\u2019s been happening for the past two years, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has confirmed. Contrary to Kasich\u2019s assurances, rejecting the Obamacare expansion would not send Ohio tax dollars to other states.\n\nCRS, a department of the Library of Congress providing policy guidance to members of Congress, answered questions about Obamacare \u2014 also referred to as the Affordable Care Act \u2014 in a Jan. 30 memo published by the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability.\n\n\u201cIf a state doesn\u2019t implement the ACA Medicaid expansion, the federal funds that would have been used for that state\u2019s expansion are not being sent to another state,\u201d CRS explained. \u201cThere is not a set amount of federal funding for Medicaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf a state hasn\u2019t implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion, the state would not receive any federal Medicaid funding for the expansion. However, this doesn\u2019t mean any additional federal Medicaid funding would be allocated to states that have implemented the expansion,\u201d CRS clarified further.\n\nAs FGA, Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute and other center-right think tanks have been telling lawmakers since early 2013, each state\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion is paid for with new federal spending. The nationwide cost of Medicaid expansion increases with every state that opts in.\n\nKasich and his administration have told Ohio General Assembly members the opposite. Kasich, a Republican, insists his Obamacare expansion is being paid for with Ohio tax dollars that would otherwise be sent to other states.\n\n\u201cThe CRS memo is very important as it highlights how Medicaid is actually structured \u2014 it is an entirely open-ended program with no defined limits,\u201d Greg Lawson, a policy analyst with the free-market Buckeye Institute, said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cIt is flat-out inaccurate to say our money will go to other states,\u201d Lawson said.\n\n\u201cThe Buckeye Institute made this case throughout 2013 during the Medicaid debate and this report validates our position,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cThe report undermines claims that if Ohio doesn\u2019t expand Medicaid it will lose tax dollars to other states.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis reinforces the urgency of reforming Medicaid and getting recipients off of it as quickly as possible,\u201d Lawson concluded. \u201cMedicaid expansion in Ohio not only did not keep money in Ohio but instead ensured that Ohio citizens will eventually face higher taxes to pay for this program.\u201d\n\nDuring his 2013 State of the State speech, Kasich said, \u201cif we don\u2019t do what we should do on Medicaid, they\u2019ll be spending it in California.\u201d\n\nHe called the Obamacare expansion \u201can unprecedented opportunity to bring $13 billion of Ohio\u2019s tax dollars back to Ohio to solve our problem.\u201d\n\nKasich has spun his Obamacare expansion as a way to bring \u201cOhio dollars back to Ohio\u201d in a series of national interviews, and has done the same while promoting Obamacare in other states.\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion, meanwhile, has blown through $2.5 billion in federal money that would otherwise not have been spent. At current enrollment, the expansion will cost federal taxpayers more than $10 billion by June 2017.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office noted in a February 2014 budget outlook that total Medicaid spending would increase as more states implemented the Obamacare expansion. Obamacare advocates have long acknowledged this fact.\n\nDespite all of this, Ohio newspapers have helped Kasich mislead taxpayers about billions in new federal spending because they support the Obamacare expansion.\n\nThe Kasich administration failed to respond to a request for comment on the CRS memo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What if Ohio's newspapers helped Gov.
