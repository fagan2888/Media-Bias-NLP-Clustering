Republicans have zeroed in on incumbent Senator Mark Pryor, one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate. Pryor is being challenged by Rep. Tom Cotton, a rising star in the conservative faction of the House GOP.\n\nOutside spending groups have already poured about $17 million into attacking Pryor and have repeatedly tied him to President Obama, who is vastly unpopular in the state.\n\nRelated: The Three Hottest Issues Dominating the Midterms\n\nPryor has been one of the rare liberal Democratic candidates in this election cycle to actually embrace some of the president\u2019s policies \u2013 including Obamacare, which has reduced the uninsured rate in Arkansas by 10 percent.\n\nStill, the law remains highly unpopular among the public. Pryor has also fallen slightly behind in the most recent polls, with Real Clear Politics showing him trailing Cotton by nearly 5 points. Cotton\u2019s gains in the race have prompted the Pryor campaign to elicit the help of the Natural State\u2019s own Bill Clinton \u2013 who stumped for the senator last week.\n\nStill, even Clinton\u2019s star power may not be enough to save Pryor as Arkansas continues turning from blue to red; since the 1990s, the state has slowly grown more conservative. For the first time ever, the state\u2019s Senate and House have GOP majorities.\n\nRelated: Louisiana\u2019s Messy Senate Race Could Hijack the Election\n\nIt will all come to down to voter turnout, naturally. A recent CNN poll on the Arkansas Senate race revealed that among registered voters, Pryor was leading by nine points. But among those who said they were likely to vote in the election, Cotton was up by two points.\n\nThe Players\n\nSen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) Incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor, 51, served in the state legislature and was elected attorney general before making a successful run for the U.S. Senate in 2001. He grew up in state politics as the son of former Arkansas governor and U.S. senator David Hampton Pryor. He\u2019s served two terms and ran unopposed in 2008, when Republicans didn\u2019t put up a candidate against him.\n\nTom Cotton (R-AR) GOP challenger Rep. Tom Cotton, 37, is a Harvard educated lawyer and former infantry officer in the U.S. Army who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He was elected to serve in the state\u2019s 4th congressional district in 2012. He serves on the House Financial Services and Foreign Affairs committees.\n\nThe Issues\n\nSen. Pryor, who supports Obamacare, has touted the law\u2019s help in reducing the state\u2019s uninsured rate. He\u2019s an advocate of teachers\u2019 unions and has sparred with Cotton on benefits for seniors. Cotton, a fiscal conservative, is part of the \u201cvote no\u201d caucus in the House that\u2019s opposed to \u201cout of control\u201d federal spending. He voted against the farm bill, against disaster relief funding, and against funding for a program to prevent pandemics.\n\nMoney\n\nIncumbent Pryor has outraised his challenger, though not by much; he\u2019s also significantly outspent him. Open Secrets reports that Pryor has raised $8.9 million and spent about $7 million. Rep. Cotton has raised about $7 million and spent just $4 million.\n\nThe last spending report showed that Pryor had about $4 million left in his war chest in June, while Cotton had about $2.7 million cash on hand.\n\nOutside groups, meanwhile, have spent roughly $26 million on this race. Some $17 million of that has been for Cotton; $8 million has been in support of Pryor.\n\nPolls:\n\nWildcard\n\nThe outcome of the race largely hangs on the pending decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court on the legality of the state\u2019s voter ID law, which went into effect this year. Republicans say the law helps \u201censure the integrity of elections,\u201d since voters need to show photo ID. Democrats say the law reduces voter turnout and have made intense efforts to register new voters. \u201cWith incumbent Senator Mark Pryor trailing in the polls, voter mobilization is crucial to his hopes of prevailing against very difficult odds,\u201d says The Washington Post.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The battle over control of the Senate is growing fiercer by the minute \u2013 especially in", "title": "Tight Arkansas Race Hangs on Money, Voter ID Law", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/10/Tight-Arkansas-Race-Hangs-Money-Voter-ID-Law", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Arkansas_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/10/Tight-Arkansas-Race-Hangs-Money-Voter-ID-Law", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Arkansas_0.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The battle over control of the Senate is growing fiercer by the minute \u2013 especially in", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c6d\"", "article_summary": "A recent CNN poll on the Arkansas Senate race revealed that among registered voters, Pryor was leading by nine points.\nPolls:WildcardThe outcome of the race largely hangs on the pending decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court on the legality of the state\u2019s voter ID law, which went into effect this year.\nRelated: Louisiana\u2019s Messy Senate Race Could Hijack the ElectionIt will all come to down to voter turnout, naturally.\nRepublicans have zeroed in on incumbent Senator Mark Pryor, one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate.\n\u201cWith incumbent Senator Mark Pryor trailing in the polls, voter mobilization is crucial to his hopes of prevailing against very difficult odds,\u201d says The Washington Post."}
