The State Patrol said she was ejected through a rear window from the backseat and landed in the center lane, where she was struck by a 2005 Toyota Tacoma and a 2008 Toyota Sienna.\n\nShe was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe Jeep rolled onto its left side after Tarango was ejected. Inside, two 19-year-old women from Greeley, Madeline Perez and Madison Walton, sustained minor injuries. They were taken to a hospital.\n\nPerez, who was driving the Jeep, was wearing her seatbelt. Walton was not.\n\nThe State Patrol said the drivers of the two Toyotas were not injured, remained at the scene and cooperated with the investigation.\n\nThe patrol suspects alcohol use may have been a contributing factor in the crash. Charges against Perez are pending the completion of the investigation, the release said.\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Thornton teen killed in I-25 crash", "title": "Thornton teen killed in I-25 crash", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/22/thornton-teen-killed-in-i-25-crash/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-22T17:20:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-22T17:20:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd54d\"", "article_summary": "A teen from Thornton was killed on Interstate 25 early Sunday after she was ejected from a Jeep and struck by two cars, the State Patrol reported.\nThe State Patrol said the drivers of the two Toyotas were not injured, remained at the scene and cooperated with the investigation.\nPerez, who was driving the Jeep, was wearing her seatbelt.\nThe Jeep rolled onto its left side after Tarango was ejected.\nThe patrol suspects alcohol use may have been a contributing factor in the crash."}
