Emergency medical personnel pronounced her dead at the scene.\n\nPolice previously said the girl was shot by her 5-year-old sibling and were searching for the child\u2019s father or stepfather, who was believed to have owned the gun used. But Phillips turned himself in Saturday night and ultimately said he, not the other child, had been responsible, Sgt. Eric Gripp said Sunday.\n\n\u201cAfter investigation, (he) admitted to accidentally shooting the victim, and stated that the sibling had nothing to do with it,\u201d Gripp said.\n\nPhillips is charged with third-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child. It was not immediately known whether he has an attorney who could comment on the charges.\n\nNeighbor Louise Sawyer said the girl\u2019s mother had been quite protective, rarely letting her children out to play for fear of violence in a neighborhood in which shootings and drugs were a constant concern.\n\nShe would say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not bringing these kids out with this trouble,\u201d Sawyer told The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nCrystal Dougherty, who said she was a friend of the family, said the little girl who died was sweet and loved Barbie dolls and coloring.\n\n\u201cShe was just an outgoing little girl,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The parent of a 4-year-old girl who was killed in a Philadelphia neighborhood has confessed to accidentally shooting her, police said.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/17/police-man-says-he-not-boy-shot-girl-accdentally/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The parent of a 4-year-old girl who was killed in a Philadelphia neighborhood has confessed to accidentally shooting her, police said.", "title": "Police: Parent says he accidentally shot, killed 4-year-old"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The parent of a 4-year-old girl who was killed in a Philadelphia neighborhood has confessed to accidentally shooting her, police said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Police: Parent says he accidentally shot, killed 4-year-old"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The parent of a 4-year-old girl who was killed in a Philadelphia neighborhood has confessed to accidentally shooting her, police said.\nInvestigators said the girl was shot in the face by Phillips in a home in the Kensington neighborhood shortly before 2:30 p.m. Saturday.\nThe child was originally believed to have been fatally shot by her young brother.\n\u201cAfter investigation, (he) admitted to accidentally shooting the victim, and stated that the sibling had nothing to do with it,\u201d Gripp said.\nShe would say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not bringing these kids out with this trouble,\u201d Sawyer told The Philadelphia Inquirer."}
