This month, Maine became one of a handful of states that lets residents freeze their files from new credit check requests \u2014 for free.\n\nGetting a credit freeze may pose a challenge if you expect to tap into credit lines for a mortgage, car or even a new cellphone plan in the near future, but it frees up a new method of identity security that previously cost up to $10 \u2014 times three, for each major credit reporting agency \u2014 every time a credit file was frozen or unfrozen.\n\nThe new law took effect Oct. 15.\n\nWill Lund, superintendent of Maine\u2019s Credit Protection Bureau, said the new law could be valuable as recent data breaches have shown there\u2019s real risk in keeping the right heaps of information out of the wrong hands.\n\nThe credit reporting agency Experian earlier this month reported a data breach affecting an estimated 15 million people who applied for T-Mobile service in the past two years.\n\nThe scale and nature of that breach, Lund said, \u201cshows that there is no such thing as a system that is completely unbreachable.\u201d\n\nTo date, however, that hasn\u2019t been the primary threat.\n\nLund said someone close to the victim is most often the culprit in cases of identity theft. With that in mind, the new law also allows certain representatives of people younger than 16, who may have no credit record, to seek a freeze on credit requests in their name, which may be subject to a charge of up to $10 per request.\n\nA credit freeze prevents new companies or individuals from accessing a credit report, while still allowing access for existing creditors, debt collectors or government agencies. Limiting access to that credit report makes issuance of a new line of credit in your name less likely.\n\nLund said residents best positioned to consider a free credit freeze under the new law fall into three general groups:\n\n\u2014 People who don\u2019t have immediate or substantial credit needs \u2014 i.e. people who have already purchased homes, cars and who don\u2019t plan on applying for department store credit cards on a whim.\n\n\u2014 People who are generally concerned about privacy and security and willing to take on the additional planning and care required to freeze or unfreeze their credit scores for new credit checks \u2014 this happens more often than you might think, like when applying for a job, renting an apartment or buying insurance, in addition to signing up for a new phone plan or buying a car or house.\n\n\u2014 Past victims of identity theft who aren\u2019t able to freeze or unfreeze their credit files for free.\n\nState law requires a credit reporting agency to act within three business days to unfreeze a credit file and within five days to freeze a credit file.\n\nOnce a request is made, the credit agency provides a personal identification number within two weeks that is then used to freeze or unfreeze a file. Lund said those requesting a credit freeze under the new Maine law should take care in storing that number, as it\u2019s a passcode used less frequently than others. On top of that, the process for replacing a PIN could cause complications when a credit check is needed.\n\n\u201cThese issues come in very time-sensitive situations,\u201d Lund said, during mortgage closings, car sales or insurance changes.\n\nThe new law allows people who have requested a credit freeze to have the freeze temporarily removed later for specific people or companies or for a specific period of time.\n\nThose options could depend on the situation, Lund said. If a person is seeking to buy a car from a specific dealer, it may make sense to ask the dealer which credit reporting agency or agencies they use. Getting the appropriate access may only require one call and not three to each credit reporting agency.\n\nIf a person knows they\u2019ll be shopping at various dealerships, Lund said it may make sense to get a general lift on the freeze for a period of time.\n\nThe new law allows customers to request a credit freeze from all three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax (800-349-9960), Experian (888-397-3742) and TransUnion (888-909-8872) \u2014 online, by mail or through an automated process by telephone.\n\nSuch a freeze will not prevent certain companies from making checks to pre-approve customers for lines of credit, Lund noted, but people can make a request to stop getting prescreened offers of credit online or by calling 888-567-8688.\n\nThe freeze also is different from credit monitoring or fraud alerts, which warn consumers of suspicious activity but do not necessarily block access to credit report information.\n\nConsumers can regularly check their own credit reports for free, at annualcreditreport.com.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 If an identity thief applied for credit in your name, they\u2019d need a heap of your information, along with what the real you would need: a credit check.
