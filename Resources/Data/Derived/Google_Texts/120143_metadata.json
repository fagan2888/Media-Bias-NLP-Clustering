He has been bombarded by all the Republican factions. Even Mitt Romney says the Wisconsinite can unify the Republican conference and take the job.\n\nI applaud Ryan\u2019s leadership and policy skills and think he would make a good speaker.\n\nBut there\u2019s a backstory to the current chaos of the GOP conference and the withdrawal of Kevin McCarthy from the speakership race. The GOP leadership in the House and Senate has failed to pass legislation to repeal the Obama agenda and put the measures on the president\u2019s desk. If he vetoes them, so be it. We go to 2016. But it\u2019s all been broken promises.\n\nFormer Bush speechwriter Peter Robinson just reminded readers on the Ricochet website of an interview he had with Kevin McCarthy before the 2014 midterms.\n\nRobinson: \u201cYou will pass a reform agenda, putting bill after bill on President Obama\u2019s desk?\u201d (Italics mine.)\n\nMcCarthy: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s our job.\u201d (Italics mine again.)\n\nIt never happened. No bills passed by the House and Senate to repeal Obamacare. No pro-growth tax reform (especially corporate tax reform). No broad-based energy bill. No bill to retract Obama\u2019s illegal executive immigration actions.\n\nThis failure has enraged the Republican grassroots and has sent three outsiders \u2014 Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina \u2014 to the top of the GOP presidential field.\n\nWhat have the congressional Republicans been waiting for?\n\nWell, according to ace Washington policy analyst Dan Clifton of Strategas, the Ryan-led Ways and Means committee has been moving on three pieces of reconciliation legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and target specific pieces of Obamacare for repeal. And Clifton notes that reconciliation legislation requires just 51 votes in the Senate. Sure, Obama would veto this. But at least the GOP would signal its intentions should they win the White House in 2016.\n\nAnd with Boehner on the way out, House Republicans have now developed a laundry list of reconciliation provisions to repeal the individual mandate, the employer mandate, the medical-device tax, the Cadillac tax, IPAB (Independent Payment Advisory Board), and the auto-enrollment requirement that forces small businesses to enroll full-time employees in Obamacare.\n\nGood news.\n\nBut what happened to tax reform, particularly corporate tax reform? This would be the single strongest stimulant to the economy, which is showing dangerous signs of yet another slowdown inside the already sub-par recovery.\n\nThere are three easy pieces here. First, slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 40 percent and permit small business pass-through S-corps to pay the lower C-corp rate. This has been proposed by Donald Trump. Second, allow for full cash expensing of new business investment as a tax deduction. FedEx CEO Fred Smith says this by itself would generate a strong business-investment recovery. Third, pass a repatriation provision to bring back the roughly $2 trillion of U.S. multinational cash stashed overseas (to avoid double and triple taxation) and turn the whole system from worldwide to territorial taxation. Jeb Bush has proposed the second and third parts here, to his credit.\n\nI spoke with Paul Ryan a few days ago (coincidentally the day before McCarthy bowed out), and he worried that Obama would never sign a pass-through small-business tax cut. He also worried that the Senate would never pass broad-based business tax reform. \u201cThe leadership will never do it,\u201d he said. (Orrin Hatch from the Senate Finance Committee and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell would have to play ball.) He also expressed concern about the Byrd rule inside reconciliation that requires tax-and-spend-and-debt packages to reduce budget deficits.\n\nBut if you go back and read the history of reconciliation, you\u2019ll see that the Byrd rule can be whatever you want it to be. Republicans and Democrats have defined it and redefined it.\n\nAnd if a reconciliation provision is deemed to be \u201cextraneous,\u201d any senator can raise a procedural objection that would be ruled on by the presiding officer on the advice of the Senate parliamentarian. But the presiding officer need not follow the advice of the parliamentarian. And the parliamentarian can be replaced by the Senate majority leader.\n\nWhen we talked this week Ryan didn\u2019t seem to be in a mood to be all that aggressive. And when I suggested that defunding Obamacare could be put into the same reconciliation bill as corporate tax reform, he didn\u2019t say yes or no \u2014 he decided to keep his own counsel.\n\n\n\nBut the moral of the story for the post-Boehner period is that a Speaker Paul Ryan along with the legislative strategy of reconciliation and a Senate leadership that plays ball can solve the economy and the GOP\u2019s grassroots revolt.
