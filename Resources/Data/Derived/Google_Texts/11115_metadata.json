In an 88-page inspection report, the officials pointed out a number of deficiencies that put the funding at risk, from a failure to ensure staff and patient safety to a dentist\u2019s failure to wear eye protection during exams.\n\nThe legislation was an attempt to ease Riverview\u2019s overcrowding. The state\u2019s transfer of some patients from the psychiatric hospital to the state prison would fit a trend in recent decades in which prisons and jails have seen a surge in the number of people with mental illness.\n\nA move away from hospitals\n\nThe United States in the 1950s started a major move away from the use of psychiatric hospitals to treat the mentally ill. Deinstitutionalization, as the change was known, came as a new antipsychotic medication, Thorazine, was introduced, potentially allowing mentally ill adults to manage their conditions outside institutional walls.\n\nIn 1965, the start of Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled, accelerated the shift away from institutional treatment for the mentally ill. Deinstitutionalization also gained momentum as public opinion turned against psychiatric hospital treatments such as electroshock therapy.\n\nIn 1959, nearly 559,000 patients with mental illness were committed to state-run psychiatric hospitals. Forty years later, according to the National Institute of Corrections, that number had dropped to about 70,000.\n\nIn 1955, there was one hospital psychiatric bed for every 300 Americans. Fifty years later, that ratio dropped to one bed for every 3,000, according to a 2010 study by the National Sheriffs Association and the Treatment Advocacy Center.\n\n\u201cThere was an effort to get folks out into the community,\u201d said Jenna Mehnert, executive director of Maine\u2019s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. \u201cThe challenge is, you have to do the work to make sure what that plan [for providing services in the community] looks like and really be smart about the services you put in place, and you have to fund it.\u201d\n\nBut states largely failed to put in place the quality of community-based services \u2014 such as housing and specialized treatment \u2014 that mentally ill patients leaving psychiatric institutions required.\n\n\u201cServices in the community are harder to manage because they\u2019re not happening right under your nose,\u201d Mehnert said. \u201cThey\u2019re the right thing to do. They\u2019re just the harder thing to do.\u201d\n\nAs institutions released their patients, the percentage of inmates with mental illness at local jails, state prisons and federal correctional facilities grew rapidly. In 1983, a study estimated about 6.4 percent of the U.S. prison and jail population had a serious mental illness. Today, according to the sheriffs association study, the number is about 16 percent.\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated in 2006 that 1.3 million mentally ill adults were incarcerated in U.S. prisons and jails.\n\nThe growth in the mentally ill prison population isn\u2019t directly connected to the closure and downsizing of state psychiatric hospitals, said Helen Bailey, general counsel for the Disability Rights Center.\n\n\u201cWould the fact that we no longer put people into institutions lead to more mentally ill people in prison?\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re failing people and not providing services that they otherwise need, then that would happen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a matter of definition, she said. \u201cThe whole notion of what is mental illness has changed.\u201d\n\nMaine\u2019s shrinking psychiatric hospitals\n\nWhile a national move away from psychiatric institutions began in earnest in the 1950s, Maine\u2019s two state-run psychiatric hospitals in Bangor and Augusta didn\u2019t start shrinking until the 1970s.\n\nThe Bangor Mental Health Institute\u2019s patient count peaked in 1970 at 1,200. The population dropped to 470 in 1974, and the hospital housed 300 patients through much of the 1980s. The hospital was renamed the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center in 2005, and today it\u2019s a 51-bed facility.\n\nThe Augusta Mental Health Institute treated an average of about 1,700 patients in the 1950s. In the 1960s, the hospital started moving some of its patients to foster and boarding homes, but the order to deinstitutionalize didn\u2019t come until the next decade.\n\nIn the 1970s, AMHI\u2019s population dropped to about 300 patients from 1,500 in five years. AMHI\u2019s population continued to shrink, and the hospital closed in 2004, replaced by the new, 92-bed Riverview Psychiatric Center on the AMHI campus.\n\nMental health treatment in Maine\n\nAs the Bangor and Augusta psychiatric hospitals contracted, Maine relied heavily on boarding homes for housing the patients who left the hospitals, said Bailey.\n\n\u201cWe developed a system, and then I think we\u2019ve neglected the system,\u201d she said.\n\nThere have been a number of efforts over the years to provide services for people with mental illness, according to Bailey, but those services often fell victim to state budget cuts. Plus, the treatments often have involved frequent changes for the people receiving them, she said, with patients being moved to different settings to receive different levels of care.\n\n\u201cIf you want to stabilize mental illness, you have to stabilize housing and stabilize relationships,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWe do things that are absolutely destructive. We change things.\u201d\n\nAnd without appropriate services, she said, \u201cGuess what door they\u2019re going to re-enter through. They\u2019re going to re-enter through the emergency department.\u201d\n\nOr through the criminal justice system, which often is someone\u2019s only outlet for receiving required treatment.\n\nIt remains a challenge in Maine today to find specialized mental health services in many parts of the state. According to Mehnert, it\u2019s nearly impossible to find specialized services north of Augusta.\n\nThat means it becomes more challenging to diagnose mental health conditions early in life, when people can be taught to manage those conditions and live with them without being hospitalized, Mehnert said.\n\n\u201cIt really is a workforce issue layered on top of a service issue,\u201d she said.\n\nMehnert recommends a concerted effort to attract mental health professionals to work in Maine through a student loan forgiveness program. The professionals need to be paid well, and they need frequent, hands-on training in best practices, she said. And the state needs to contract with treatment providers who are using evidence-based treatments recognized by the U.S. Substance Abuse Services and Mental Health Administration.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is, how do we look comprehensively at a continuum of quality services that start in the community, that start with early identification for kids,\u201d she said, \u201cand not invest all our money in the deeper end and institutionalize mental illness.\u201d\n\nMatthew Stone is BDN opinion page editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine lawmakers last week signed off on a plan that will allow the state to transfer certain patients from Riverview Psychiatric Center in Augusta, one of Maine\u2019s two state-run psychiatric hospitals, to an expanded, 32-bed mental health unit at Maine State Prison in Warren.
