Quid pro quo donations from the global rich and powerful fueled the Clintons\u2019 jet-setting networking.\n\nIn between political campaigns, the foundation provided sinecures for out-of-work Clinton politicos. This is hardly proof of Hillary\u2019s grass-roots progressivism.\n\nThen came Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email fiasco. No one knows how the current investigation of her alleged misuse of email accounts, servers and classified information will end up. But most people accept that it was an unnecessary and self-induced scandal, brought on both by her paranoia and habitual expectation of being exempt from the law.\n\nABC News just disclosed that ex-president Bill Clinton sought huge speaking fees from foreign governments (well over a half-million dollars per talk), while Hillary was secretary of state. Unfortunately, some of his proposed speaking deals involved odious regimes like those of Congo and North Korea. This year, Hillary herself routinely charged universities $200,000 to $300,000 for brief talks \u2014 after decrying the cash-strapped status of indebted students. What will the Clintons not do to make money?\n\nAll these imbroglios raise more issues. Was Sen. Barack Obama, largely a political unknown at the time, really all that unstoppable in 2008? Or did Hillary simply blow a 30-point lead in the polls because then as now she proved a lousy candidate?\n\nCan\u2019t Hillary Clinton turn voters\u2019 attention to her recent stewardship of American foreign policy?\n\nMost of what happened on her watch as secretary of state is better forgotten: the destruction of a self-reliant Iraq, the rise of the Islamic State, chaos in Libya, failed reset with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, disaster in Benghazi, the alienation of Israel and moderate Arab nations, and Iran\u2019s ascendancy.\n\nInstead of hailing her foreign policy tenure, Clinton is now attacking her critics.\n\nMrs. Clinton just blasted her Republican opposition, some of whom want various federal agencies to cite undocumented immigrants who broke federal law, and then process them for deportation before hearing their applications for amnesty. She misleadingly equated that position with wanting to \u201cliterally pull people out of their homes and their workplaces, round them up and, I don\u2019t know, put them in buses or boxcars, in order to take them across the border.\u201d\n\nIs it wise to tar critics with the infamous imagery of the Holocaust, in which Jews were rounded up, put in boxcars and sent to death camps?\n\nAfter all, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own prior positions on immigration were akin to those of many of the Republicans she now attacks. Here is what then Sen. Clinton asserted in a 2003: \u201cI am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigrants.\u201d Note her use of the personal \u201cimmigrants,\u201d rather than the abstract \u201cimmigration.\u201d\n\nLast week, Mrs. Clinton compared Republican opponents of abortion to \u201cterrorist groups\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t want to live in the modern world.\u201d\n\nBut such ad hominem attacks on free expression are exactly what Mrs. Clinton once denounced. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of people who say that if you debate and disagree with this administration, somehow you\u2019re not patriotic,\u201d she said in 2003, ironically during the George W. Bush presidency.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s serial meltdowns may bring Vice President Joe Biden into the race. The only other serious Democratic alternative to Mrs. Clinton at the moment is 73-year-old socialist Bernie Sanders. He is not registered in the party whose nomination he seeks.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s derailment has given breathing space to Republicans. Otherwise, they would be panicking that erratic showman Donald Trump has hijacked their party and might lead it to a meltdown in 2016.\n\nBoth parties face crises \u2014 though there are more viable Republican alternatives to Mr. Trump than there are strong Democratic choices, at least for now. And whereas the upbeat Mr. Trump would probably agree with \u2014 or even welcome \u2014 charges that he is an egomaniac, Mrs. Clinton would hardly accept the equally common impression that she cannot tell the truth.\n\nHillary\u2019s latest troubles reflect a quarter-century of Clinton habits that transcend time and space.\n\nBoth Bill and Hillary seem to have always believed they should be exempt from the law. Both seem needlessly tawdry in their avarice. Their cover-ups often prove even more damaging than their indiscretions.\n\nBill was always the far better speaker and political schmoozer than Hillary. And now Hillary is proving \u2014 again \u2014 that she prefers slandering accusers rather than refuting accusations.\n\nAre Hillary\u2019s first four and a half months of campaigning a glimpse of the next 14?\n\nIf so, the Democratic Party \u2014 and the country \u2014 are going to be utterly exhausted.\n\n\u2022 Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton's second race for the presidency is only about a quarter through, but she already seems to be causing general fatigue.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s second race for the presidency is only about a quarter through, but she already seems to be causing general fatigue.", "title": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead slipping away", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/2/victor-davis-hanson-hillary-clintons-lead-slipping/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/02/9_2_2015_b3hansenlghillary8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/02/9_2_2015_b3hansenlghillary8201.jpg", "description": "Hillary Clinton's second race for the presidency is only about a quarter through, but she already seems to be causing general fatigue.", "card": "summary", "title": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead slipping away"}, "Author": "Victor Davis Hanson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton"}, "article_summary": "After all, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own prior positions on immigration were akin to those of many of the Republicans she now attacks.\nCan\u2019t Hillary Clinton turn voters\u2019 attention to her recent stewardship of American foreign policy?\nThen came Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email fiasco.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s serial meltdowns may bring Vice President Joe Biden into the race.\nThe only other serious Democratic alternative to Mrs. Clinton at the moment is 73-year-old socialist Bernie Sanders."}
