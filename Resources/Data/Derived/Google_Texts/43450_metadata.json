The program is targeted at state residents who are at high risk of infection.\n\nThe Pre-E xposure Prophylaxis Drug Assistance Program, or PrEP DAP, covers the cost of the medication for eligible individuals interested in using it to reduce their chance of HIV infection as prescribed by their doctors, regardless of whether they are insured. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, comes in the form of a daily prescription pill, Truvada, and costs about $1,300 per month \u2014 an obstacle for many who seek the medication with insurance, and especially the uninsured.\n\nParticipants in the Washington program pay nothing.\n\nDavid Kern, manager of the Infectious Disease Prevention Section at the Washington Department of Health said he is unaware of any other states with programs specifically providing financial support for PrEP, but that someday it could serve as a model for state public health officials across the country.\n\n\u201cIn Washington, we really see PrEP as a new and important tool in the toolbox for HIV prevention,\u201d Kern told BuzzFeed. \u201cIt is a strategy that supports our overarching public health goals and it\u2019s an important part of what we\u2019re doing with resources.\u201d\n\nWashington health officials \u2014 just like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization \u2014 have identified PrEP as an effective means of preventing new HIV infections in addition to using condoms, but with that, the state found that increasing access to the drug is among strategic priorities in its fight against HIV, particularly among men who have sex with men in urban communities. Washington hopes to reduce new HIV infections statewide by 25% by 2016.\n\nIn May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines to medical providers, saying PrEP could reduce HIV infection when taken daily by more than 90%. And this month, the World Health Organization said men who have sex with men should consider PrEP alongside the use of condoms as another method of HIV prevention.\n\nSo far, the program has seen a \u201cvery soft\u201d launch, since it was announced in early April with the DOH teaming up with local health organizations to mobilize patients who may need the financial assistance, according to Kern. As of July 22, there are only 17 active participants, the majority of whom are gay men ranging in age and ethnicity, but Kern said there has been a big uptick in interest in recent weeks.\n\nFinancial support includes all of the costs of the medication for participants who are uninsured, underinsured, and even for people with insurance, so that there is no cost of the pills out of pocket. For those with insurance, the provider is billed first and then the program covers the co-pay, which is about $450 per month on average, Kern said. For clients without insurance, PrEP DAP covers the entire $1,300 monthly cost of Truvada. The PrEP DAP does not cover lab work costs and medical visits.\n\nFred Swanson, executive director of Gay City Health Project in Seattle, a leading provider of HIV and STI testing in Seattle, said the Washington PrEP DAP program answers the question for people who are seeking to access PrEP and don\u2019t know how to pay for it.\n\n\u201cCost is one of the biggest barriers to PrEP,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cEven with the Affordable Care Act, people are choosing plans that still require really large co-pays, so when they go to access PrEP, it\u2019s not really plausible for them. We have seen that even people with insurance aren\u2019t able to afford the prescription.\u201d\n\nSwanson said Gay City Heath Project offers application forms to the program and informs clients of the available financial assistance from the state so that they can discuss PrEP with their doctors and know how to pay for it. With that, Swanson said they are also seeing an increase in interest surrounding PrEP over the last few months.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a definite shift,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there were just a lot of questions and a lot people not quite sure about it because of concerns with side effects and other concerns, but we\u2019ve reached some sort of tipping point and I think it\u2019s a combination of community education and the CDC guidelines, the World Health Organization recommendations \u2014 all of those things add together.\u201d\n\nEligibility in the assistance program is limited to Washington state residents who are HIV negative and declare certain risk factors, Kern said.\n\nGay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men are eligible if they\u2019ve met one or more of five criteria: if they have been diagnosed with a bacterial STI in the last year, if they were exposed to an STI from sexual partners in the last year, if they\u2019ve had 10 or more sexual partners in the last year, used methamphetamine in the last year, or have had unprotected anal sex with someone of unknown HIV status. Individuals who are in a sexual relationship or share needles with someone who is HIV positive are also eligible.\n\n\u201cUnless someone marks \u2018no\u2019 to all of those conditions, they are eligible,\u201d Kern said. \u201cWe wanted to have as broad of coverage as possible and not stifle interest.\u201d\n\nKern expects the program to \u201cget up to speed\u201d in the coming months and increase the number of participants, which the DOH has planned to leave unrestricted, assuming the state\u2019s budget for it remains at its current $1 million to $2 million. The department will then review the program after the first 100 participants or after about six months. Kern also noted the budget comes from state resources and not federal funding.\n\nThe DOH also provides funding for the Public Health STD Clinic at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, which offers a PrEP clinic service where patients who are interested in PrEP could talk to doctors about getting a prescription. Additionally, the DOH is leading public education initiatives on PrEP.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t imagine that our PrEP DAP program will ever be the primary payer of PrEP services in the state, but because the state has taken an interest and is communicating that we do care and will make resources available for this intervention, it lets people know that the state Health Department endorses the prevention option and hope we reach communities with it.\u201d\n\nAnd ultimately, Kern said the DOH hopes that Washington\u2019s commitment to utilizing PrEP as a key HIV prevention strategy will motivate other states and local health departments to make similar commitments if they can.\n\n\u201cWe believe that PrEP DAP can definitely serve as a model for states that are interested in setting up a similar system, i.e., paying for PrEP medications,\u201d Kern said via email. \u201cHaving said that, we recognize that many states depend heavily (and sometimes exclusively) on federal funding to support their HIV programs. Currently, federal funding cannot be used to purchase PrEP medication, so it\u2019s not possible for some jurisdictions to provide this program.\u201d\n\nKern, again emphasized the importance of PrEP, saying, \u201cWe need all public health colleagues to promote and support it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3395807, "userid": 923620}, "description": "The state's new program, the first of its kind, is designed so that people who qualify will pay nothing out-of-pocket. \"In Washington,...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
