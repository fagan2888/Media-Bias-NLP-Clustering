FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - Kentucky Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton will be the keynote speaker at a Bowling Green conference for women veterans.

Hampton, an Air Force veteran, will speak at the Western Kentucky Women Veterans Regional Conference on April 30 in her hometown.

The conference is the first of two regional conferences for women vets this year, the second will be in eastern Kentucky this fall.

The Kentucky Department of Veterans Affairs was asked to hold more regional conferences that were accessible to women around the state, said the department’s deputy commission, Heather French Henry.

The April 30 conference will feature sessions on veterans’ benefits, education, entrepreneurship and starting local women veterans groups.
