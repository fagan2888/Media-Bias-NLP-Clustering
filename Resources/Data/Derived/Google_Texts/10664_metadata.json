In some big suburbs and metropolitan areas, retail clinics are already pulling away patients in primary care, chronic condition management and non-emergent urgent care from dominant providers.\n\n[Also: Walgreens cuts ties with two ACOs]\n\nMackey is a progressive libertarian and vegan who argues for merging environmental sustainability with consumer-focused business in a book called Conscious Capitalism, and he is working on number of ideas to enter the healthcare economy with a focus on the American diet \u2014 something traditional healthcare providers have not really been able to improve.\n\n\u201cAmericans are sick of being sick,\u201d Mackey told Bloomberg Business. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do, and there\u2019s so much misinformation, which is why we started Whole Foods in the first place.\u201d\n\nOne idea Mackey has is a \u201cweight loss and nutrition camp for employees and customers,\u201d marketed as a weekend retreat and based on a weeklong clinic already available to employees, according to Bloomberg Business. Workers and customers would be able to have supervised testing, group discussions with nutritionists and cooking classes. The company is reportedly staking out property to locate the retreat space in Austin, Texas, near its headquarters. If \u201cit works here, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t do it in every major city in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother, more ambitious idea is a Whole Foods health clinic, where employees and customers could walk in and consult practitioners about minor health ailments or chronic conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol and metabolic syndrome.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cHealthcare is so broken in America,\u201d Mackey told Bloomberg. \u201cIf we allow markets to work, if we allow entrepreneurs to get in here and do things like I\u2019m talking about doing, we will pretty much solve the healthcare problem in a generation.\u201d\n\nWhole Foods strategy would be to attract the kind of consumers who are deeply health conscious but skeptical of mainstream medicine\u2019s heavy use of pharmaceutical products for lifestyle-related diseases that can be prevented or treated with exercise and eating changes.\n\nBut Whole Foods has its own financial ailments that could get in the way. The company\u2019s 400 stores have seen mediocre sales as traditional grocery stores start offering organic and minimally processed products, even as its \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d nickname continues.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/whole-foods-ceo-floats-plan-enter-healthcare-eyes-clinics", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/whole%20foods%20feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "John Mackey also suggests weight loss and nutrition camps for employees and customers, marketed as a weekend retreats.", "title": "Whole Foods CEO floats plan to enter healthcare, eyes clinics"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/whole%20foods%20feature.png"}, "title": "Whole Foods CEO floats plan to enter healthcare, eyes clinics", "description": "John Mackey also suggests weight loss and nutrition camps for employees and customers, marketed as a weekend retreats.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Whole Foods, the company that brought health food mainstream, now wants to sink its teeth into healthcare, according to a recent interview with founder and co-CEO John Mackey.&#13; Mackey is considering opening health clinics at stores that would be available to employees and the general public, Bloomberg Business reported.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Mackey is considering opening health clinics at stores that would be available to employees and the general public, Bloomberg Business reported.\n\u201cAmericans are sick of being sick,\u201d Mackey told Bloomberg Business.\nAnother, more ambitious idea is a Whole Foods health clinic, where employees and customers could walk in and consult practitioners about minor health ailments or chronic conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol and metabolic syndrome.\n\u201cHealthcare is so broken in America,\u201d Mackey told Bloomberg.\nWhole Foods Market photo by ChadPerez49 via Wikimedia CommonsWhole Foods, the company that brought health food mainstream, now wants to sink its teeth into healthcare, according to a recent interview with founder and co-CEO John Mackey."}
