Then, he worried about how his peers would react, despite that his friends and classmates accepted he was gay.\n\nThe 18-year-old, who was nominated for prom king, definitely did not expect what happened at the May 30 prom.\n\n\u201cYou would have thought the entire place was on fire,\u201d Astacio said. \u201cPeople were screaming so loud when I got there. They were going crazy, they loved it.\u201d\n\nThe graduating senior at Long Branch High School said he never encountered any problems with peers over his sexuality, and added that his school always had been supportive.\n\nOn April 2013\u2019s National Day of Silence \u2014 where students across the country vow to take a form of silence to call attention to bullying against people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or LGBT \u2014 Astacio said Long Branch High School had more than 300 participants.\n\nAfter being bullied in his childhood years and having to change schools because of it, Astacio said he is now comfortable with the LGBT community and advocates for acceptance in school.\n\nAstacio has served as the president of the school\u2019s Gay-Straight Alliance and attends conferences as a board member of the Central New Jersey chapter of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. He is trained to teach educators at his school about how to address LGBT students and make their learning environments more comfortable.\n\nAstacio gave a speech at his June 20 graduation as student body president. He has enrolled in Brookdale Community College\u2019s Culinary Education Center and will either continue with his education in the program or pursue studies in social work law and non-profit business in the fall.\n\nGRADUATE SPOTLIGHT\n\nDo you know of a 2014 graduate who has an interesting story to share about his or her experience?
