Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who once led the Finance Committee, sent out a letter recently that might have raised a few eyebrows \u2014 essentially wondering why federal authorities were prosecuting astonishingly few tax scammers.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhy would that be a surprise? For one thing, the IRS has made battling identity theft a top priority, and has even circulated releases extolling its top 10 identity theft prosecutions. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which compiles a plethora of government data, also said in a report a couple years back that the greatest increase in IRS criminal prosecutions over fiscal 2013 was under the statute for \u201cfraud and related activity \u2014 ID documents.\u201d Those prosecutions rose 580 percent over that one year, and a full 7,550 percent over five years.\n\nAs it turns out, Grassley\u2019s letter to the Justice Department focused on a very specific type of fraud, his office told Morning Tax, one that the Treasury inspector general for tax administration has only been tracking since October 2013. But it\u2019s also the sort of phone scam \u2014 taxpayers receiving calls seemingly out of the blue claiming they\u2019ll be arrested unless they immediately pay a tax debt \u2014 that\u2019s gotten a lot of attention in recent months.\n\nA spokeswoman for Grassley said they were only able to find three indictments for those sorts of scams, under statutes for conspiracy to impersonate an officer, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit extortion affecting interstate commerce and the use of unauthorized access devices to obtain $1,000 or more.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to dispute Grassley\u2019s characterization that federal authorities had \u201cprosecuted a very limited number\u201d of people for the scams. \u201cThis is an issue the Department takes seriously and will respond to the letter,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThe Justice Department is committed to working with our federal law enforcement partners in investigating these crimes and identifying and prosecuting the individuals involved.\u201d\n\nWELCOME TO TUESDAY, where we\u2019re celebrating the 24th anniversary of one of the most presidential quotes of all time \u2014 Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cI didn\u2019t inhale\u201d comment about trying marijuana. (Yes, we know Clinton wasn\u2019t president yet.)\n\nGive us your tips, feedback or the latest state revenue score for legal marijuana.

Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who added he would appeal the decision \u201cimmediately.\u201d http://yhoo.it/1MNMQw8\n\nWal-Mart, Puerto Rico\u2019s largest employer, had previously complained that the commonwealth\u2019s move to more than triple a tax on goods imported from distributors off the island would leave it with an effective income tax rate of 91.5 percent. Jose Antonio Fuste, the judge in the case, left no doubt that he had little sympathy for the Puerto Rican officials who had sought the tax hike, per the Financial Times. The tax, Fuste wrote, \u201cis a legislative money grab pure and simple, funding the personal account of Puerto Rico\u2019s insolvent Treasury from the presumably deeper pockets of large multistate corporations and their local affiliates.\u201d http://on.ft.com/1UXUsmw\n\nNOT THERE BY A LONG SHOT: The IRS\u2019s data security efforts are still falling short, the Government Accountability Office said Monday. (Or in GAO-speak, as relayed by our Katy O\u2019Donnell: The IRS \u201chad a significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting systems for fiscal year 2015.\u201d) Other problems facing the IRS include \u201cunpatched and outdated software\u201d that leaves the agency vulnerable and the IRS\u2019s own lackluster corrections to previously identified weaknesses. GAO\u2019s verdict comes as the IRS is under increasing pressure from cyber thieves, and after the agency has acknowledged attacks that affected hundreds of thousands of taxpayers. More from Katy: http://politico.pro/1Rwx6je\n\nKEEP AN EYE OUT: Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, a member of GOP leadership and a tax writer, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, one of the more vulnerable Republican incumbents this year, recently came out with a new bill that would exempt health savings accounts from Obamacare\u2019s \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on pricey employer-sponsored insurance plans.\n\nThe tax is on pause, due to December\u2019s flurry of legislating, and might never come back. But as our Brian Faler pointed out all the way back in August, HSAs could easily fall prey as companies move heaven and Earth to avoid the 40 percent tax. \u201cThey\u2019ll be one of the first things to go,\u201d said one health care actuary. http://politi.co/1UYnFgU\n\nBERKELEY GROUP GOES ALL IN: The Ecology Center, the California group from the home of the country\u2019s first soda tax, is now ramping up its efforts to get similar levies in place around the world. The group has a new 13-minute video, subtly titled Berkeley vs. Big Soda, that explains their success. And there\u2019s certainly interest elsewhere: The United Kingdom just went forward with a soda tax, and Philadelphia\u2019s mayor has shown an interest in a massive tax hike on sugary drinks. http://politico.pro/1Tfis4y\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE \u2014\n\nMORE LOBBYING FOR LEW: The Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition became the latest group to get on Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to crack down more on corporate inversions, as Katy reports. Specifically, the FACT Coalition said Treasury \u201ccould take further steps to prevent inversions through the use of its regulatory authority under Sections 956 and 7701 of the U.S. Tax Code.\u201d (Section 956 could further limit the so-called hopscotch loans that are a nice benefit for inverted companies, and 7701 could deal with the so-called de-controlling strategy for controlled foreign corporations that allows a new foreign parent company to avoid U.S. taxes.) FACT joins Americans for Tax Fairness and Sen. Bernie Sanders in calling for more action from Treasury.

They\u2019ve filed suit in the Ohio Court of Claims seeking class-action status for their effort to end collection of the sales tax and for refunds of at least $66 million, the Columbus Dispatch reports. \u201c\u2018A tax on tampons and pads is a tax on women,\u2019 the complaint reads,\u201d according to the Dispatch. \u201cOhio exempts prescription drugs, durable medical equipment and similar items from the sales tax. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies tampons and pads as \u2018medical devices,\u2019 but 40 states continue to tax them.\u201d http://bit.ly/22I7gUa\n\nROLE REVERSAL: After decades of relying on the oil industry to fill its coffers, Alaska is returning the favor \u2014 so to speak. Because of the free fall in oil prices, \u201cthe state now projects to pay oil companies about as much in tax credits as it receives in revenue from the industry,\u201d Anchorage\u2019s KTUU-TV says. \u201cAccording to a spring forecast released last week by the governor's Revenue Department, the state will collect $1 billion from the industry during fiscal year 2017, mainly from royalties, production tax, petroleum property tax, and corporate income tax. $691 million will be directed into the unrestricted general fund while the rest is required by law to go into the permanent fund, public school fund, and constitutional budget reserve. Over the same time period, the state expects to pay oil companies $825 million in credits, according to Revenue Commissioner Randall Hoffbeck.\u201d Gov. Bill Walker\u2019s solution? Boost the production tax to 5 percent from 4 percent and reduce the credits. Predictably, that plan is running into strong headwinds from the petroleum lobby. http://bit.ly/1RLJaTk.\n\n(All that sound vaguely familiar? Louisiana, currently facing its own budget nightmare, is giving up more to corporations in subsidies than it\u2019s collecting in revenue.)\n\nASK NOT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YALE: Ask what Yale can do for Connecticut\u2019s revenue situation. The mayor of New Haven, Yale\u2019s home for three centuries, is backing a new bill that would make it easier to tax the college\u2019s real estate holdings, The Associated Press reports. Toni Harp, the mayor, said cities needed more guidance on that front because taxing real estate is all they\u2019re allowed to do by Connecticut law, and that Yale now takes up roughly 1,000 acres in the city.\n\nBut Yale isn\u2019t taking that proposal lying down, or the idea of taxing earnings on the Ivy League school\u2019s roughly $25 billion endowment. \"Given Yale's unparalleled commitment to New Haven, and the gains made by the City of New Haven and Yale in building employment, expanding the tax base, and strengthening neighborhoods and schools, the proposal to single out Yale by imposing unprecedented, ambiguous, and sweeping new taxes on the university is troubling,\" said Richard Jacob, a Yale associate vice president. http://bit.ly/1XZao78\n\nQUICK LINK\n\n\u2014 The provision allowing tax-free charitable donations from retirement accounts by people at 70.5 years of age \u2014 more complicated than it might seem. http://on.wsj.com/1Rwuoue\n\nDID YOU KNOW?
