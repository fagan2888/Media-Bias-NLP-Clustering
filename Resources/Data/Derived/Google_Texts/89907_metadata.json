Since Republicans gained a majority in the chamber in 2010, the conference has asked for various concessions in exchange for allowing the federal government to keep borrowing and spending, including budget cuts and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis time around, the House GOP caucus could not agree on what to ask for \u2014 a sign of the continuing infighting consuming the party. Even a modest proposal to tie the debt ceiling increase to a repeal of military pension cuts passed in the budget this year did not garner enough support among conservative members.\n\nThe passage of the \"clean\" hike is being hailed as a victory for Democrats, particularly the president, who, after trying to come to a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on the budget with Republicans during the debt ceiling crisis in 2011, has said he will no longer gamble with the full credit of the U.S. government. Nonetheless, wranglings over the budget and debt ceiling caused a 16-day government shutdown in October and almost pushed the nation toward a catastrophic default.\n\n\u201cI hope the tactic of threatening default for budget debates is over, off the table and never to happen again,\" Gene Sperling, the departing director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters Tuesday morning.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters he hoped the development indicated that the House would move on other legislative priorities without bowing to its more conservative wing.\n\n\u201cThe House has come to the realization that following the hard right on the debt ceiling made no sense, which is good for the House, good for the Republican Party and good for America,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope soon enough they\u2019ll come to the same realization on immigration.\u201d\n\nStill, some Republicans were not thrilled with the development, including Boehner.\n\n\u201cThis is a lost opportunity,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday morning. \u201cWe could have sat down and worked together in a bipartisan manner to find cuts and reforms that are greater than the increase in the debt limit. It would have helped us begin to solve the spending problem we have, begin the process of paying down our debt. So I am disappointed.\u201d\n\nRepublican members of the House also lamented letting another chance to address Washington\u2019s continued spending and debt problem pass by, despite shrinking deficits.\n\n\u201cDefault is not a question of if, it is a question of when,\u201d said Rep.
