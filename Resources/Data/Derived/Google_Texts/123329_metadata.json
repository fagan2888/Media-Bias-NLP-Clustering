Paul Ryan to become House speaker, heralding a possible end to weeks of Republican leadership turmoil.\n\nThe decision to support Ryan by the 40-member House Freedom Caucus, which has risen in power and stature since its founding earlier this year, came after the Ways and Means chair spent much of his day courting its support.\n\n\u201cA supermajority of the caucus has agreed to support Paul Ryan,\u201d said Rep. Ra\u00fal R. Labrador (R-Idaho) after a lengthy evening meeting.\n\nHowever, it was not immediately clear whether that support \u2014 which fell short of a formal endorsement \u2014 would meet the most challenging condition Ryan set out Tuesday for serving as speaker: unity among all of the House Republican Conference\u2019s warring factions.\n\n[Paul Ryan tells House Republicans he\u2019s willing to run, if conditions are met]\n\nRyan could still decide not to serve as speaker, and some conservative activists have engaged in a vigorous campaign to cast doubt on Ryan, which might give some members cold feet before votes are cast next week.\n\nBut the support represents the first thaw in the increasingly frosty relationship between tea party conservatives and establishment Republicans. It also paves the way for fresh GOP leadership heading into imminent debates over the national debt and federal spending.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus met with Ryan for an hour in the Capitol earlier in the day. Many of its members had balked at the conditions Ryan attached to his decision to serve as speaker, and the meeting represented their first chance to question him directly on his intentions.\n\nThe meeting broke up without resolution setting up a high-stakes decision for a group that played a key role in easing the current speaker, John A. Boehner, into retirement and blocking Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s bid to succeed him.\n\nThe group reconvened Wednesday evening to debate whether to abandon their previous endorsement of Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) in order to back Ryan, who said Tuesday that a Freedom Caucus endorsement is a prerequisite for him to agree to serve as speaker.\n\n\u201cWe need to decide whether Paul Ryan is the kind of guy who is going to change this place,\u201d Labrador said before the evening meeting.\n\nRyan\u2019s declaration that he would serve as House speaker if and only if he receives formal backing from major House GOP factions \u2014 including the Freedom Caucus \u2014 effectively gives the group veto power over his ascent. It also exposes fissures in the typically close-knit group.\n\nSome, citing Ryan\u2019s demand to jettison the House rule allowing a simple majority to oust a speaker at virtually any time, said it would be nearly impossible for him to earn their support. Others argued that Ryan could be the type of transformative leader that House Republicans need.\n\nLeaving the Wednesday evening session, Rep. Marlin A. Stutzman (R-Ind.) said some caucus members are inclined to back Ryan but the matter was far from settled. Under the group\u2019s rules, an endorsement requires the support of 80 percent of its members.\n\n\u201cI think Paul Ryan is completely capable and is willing to make some of the changes that we need,\u201d Stutzman said Wednesday. \u201cAre we there tonight yet? No, we\u2019ve got a little way to go. But I\u2019m willing to start those conversations because I trust Paul. He\u2019s earned my trust. I\u2019m willing to keep talking.\u201d\n\nWhether Ryan would meet the 80 percent threshold, he added, is the \u201cbig question.\u201d\n\nRyan appeared to calm some nerves in the afternoon meeting, making clear that he did not want to end the ability of the House membership to remove the speaker \u2014 only raise the threshold for doing so. He also gave reassurances that he would respect the \u201cHastert Rule\u201d \u2014 the informal practice of former speaker J. Dennis Hastert that required the majority support of the Republican conference before moving legislation to the House floor.\n\n[Paul Ryan\u2019s offer challenges the permanently disgruntled conservative class]\n\nRep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said Ryan agreed that legislation should be moved only with the support of the majority of the majority. In particular, he said, that calmed immigration hawks wary of Ryan\u2019s past support for measures that would offer illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.\n\nBut Ryan faces a big challenge in getting the group\u2019s support, Brooks said: \u201cPaul Ryan probably made some progress . . . but to get 80 percent of Freedom Caucus to switch from Daniel Webster?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for Paul Ryan to shift that in two, three days.\u201d\n\nRyan said little upon departing the afternoon meeting, calling the gathering an \u201cexchange of ideas on how to make Congress work better.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Boehner told members that Republicans will vote internally to nominate a speaker next Wednesday, with a floor vote to follow Thursday. The announcement was made after Ryan said Tuesday night that he would run for speaker only if his terms were met.\n\n\u201cThis is not a job I\u2019ve ever wanted, I\u2019ve ever sought,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI came to the conclusion that this is a very dire moment, not just for Congress, not just for the Republican Party, but for our country.\u201d\n\nThose demands include not only the endorsements and the rule changes, but also giving Ryan time with his young family.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot to digest,\u201d Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) said of the demands late Tuesday. But after leaving the Wednesday afternoon meeting, Schweikert said he was \u201cvery optimistic\u201d that Ryan would back the sort of procedural changes that the Freedom Caucus has advocated.\n\nAnother sticking point for Freedom Caucus members is their endorsement of Webster, which was made earlier this month and played a role in ending McCarthy\u2019s bid for the speakership.\n\n[A little-known Florida man may keep Paul Ryan from meeting his conditions to be speaker]\n\nWebster\u2019s focus on procedural reforms, honed during his years as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, has won him an avid following among hard-liners who feel marginalized by the GOP\u2019s establishment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bunch of alpha people in here,\u201d said Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a Webster supporter. \u201cYou don\u2019t need another alpha leader.\u201d\n\nWebster made clear Wednesday he would not stand aside for Ryan: \u201cPeople are responding to what I\u2019m saying. They\u2019re sick of how this place is run, of the dog and pony shows on committees. They want a return to bills from members being considered, rather than approving the leadership\u2019s bills.\u201d\n\nRyan also met Wednesday with the Republican Study Committee, which counts more than two-thirds of the Republican conference as members. At the meeting, a committee spokesperson said, members were surveyed by secret ballot on whether to endorse Ryan.\n\nThe tally, which will not be released publicly, will be referred to the RSC\u2019s steering committee. It will decide Thursday whether to grant an endorsement.\n\nKaroun Demirjian, Kelsey Snell and David Weigel contributed to this report which was published originally in The Washington Post.\n\nRead More at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hard-line conservatives cleared a path late Wednesday for Rep.", "title": "Paul Ryan's Nod from the Freedom Caucus Clears His Run for Speaker", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/21/Paul-Ryans-Nod-Freedom-Caucus-Clears-His-Run-Speaker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05232011_Paul_Ryan_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/21/Paul-Ryans-Nod-Freedom-Caucus-Clears-His-Run-Speaker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05232011_Paul_Ryan_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Hard-line conservatives cleared a path late Wednesday for Rep.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f54\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA supermajority of the caucus has agreed to support Paul Ryan,\u201d said Rep.
