They can\u2019t see the doctor they used to see because he\u2019s in a different network. They go to get questions answered and they\u2019re talking to somebody reading a script in the Philippines. It\u2019s like your prostate cancer is being handled by Comcast now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most frightening thing in this article is when somebody said \u2018it\u2019s so confusing, I\u2019ve just stopped seeing a doctor\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s going on a lot, apparently,\u201d Maher later added. \u201cPeople are just not going because it\u2019s more expensive, too confusing and I think this was intentional. I think the insurance companies wanted this to happen because that\u2019s how they make money. \u201d\n\nBut Maher isn\u2019t quite warming to conservative alternatives just because he is having second thoughts about the success of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe should have a single payer system,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Liberal comedian Bill Maher, a longtime champion of Obamacare, began to change his tune on President Obama's signature legislation Friday night.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Liberal comedian Bill Maher, a longtime champion of Obamacare, began to change his tune on President Obama's signature legislation Friday night.    \"Obamacare: You know it's the signature achievement", "title": "Bill Maher Turns On Obamacare? \u2018It\u2019s More Expensive, Too Confusing\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/13/bill-maher-turns-on-obamacare-everything-has-changed/", "image": {"width": 652, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bill-e1423887724297.png", "height": 299}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It's More Expensive, Too Confusing'", "title": "Bill Maher Turns On Obamacare? \u2018It\u2019s More Expensive, Too Confusing\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/13/bill-maher-turns-on-obamacare-everything-has-changed/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bill-e1423887724297.png"}, "creator": "@Jamie_Weinstein", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-13 23:41:59", "sailthru.title": "Bill Maher Turns On Obamacare?
