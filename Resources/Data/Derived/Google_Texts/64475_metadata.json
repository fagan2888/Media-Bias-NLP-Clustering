Jason Conger, an attorney from Bend, and Monica Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon from Portland, are both hoping to oust Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.\n\nThe opponents wasted no time trying to differentiate themselves for the audience at the 50th annual Republican convention.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Conger called Wehby \u201crich\u201d and \u201cdisconnected.\u201d Wehby fired back, implying Conger is a career politician.\n\nThey faced a question about how they would handle the situation with Russia in Crimea. Both voiced concern that an international perception of U.S. weakness was leading to instability.\n\nBut the debate quickly went to one of the most contentious topics of the race: health care. Conger urged Wehby to stop spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d about his position on Cover Oregon.\n\nConger, being a state lawmaker, voted in favor of creating the exchange. The vote was a choice between creating a state-run exchange or having to rely on the federal exchange, Conger said. He thought the creation of a state-run exchange was the better option.\n\nWehby said she went out on a ledge early by opposing Obamacare, receiving hate mail and threatening phone calls for her position.\n\n\u201cI was against Obamacare, when it wasn\u2019t cool to be against Obamacare,\u201d she said.\n\nConger, in advertising and in the debate has highlighted Wehby\u2019s support of a plan proposed by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that has many of the same elements of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cIf it regulates like Obamacare, and it taxes like Obamacare and it costs like Obamacare, it is Obamacare,\u201d Conger said.\n\nBoth candidates also pointed to their personal histories during the debate, such as when an audience member asked the candidates to identify their mentors.\n\nConger replied by recounting times in his life when he skipped meals because he had no money. There were times when he didn\u2019t have a roof over his head, he said.\n\n\u201cI barely made it through high school. \u2026 As a result, I didn\u2019t develop many long-term healthy relationships. So, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a mentor,\u201d he said, adding he feels blessed he\u2019s had so many other friendships along the way.\n\nIn contrast, Wehby pointed to U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who is also a doctor.\n\nWhen considering her bid for Senate, she turned to him.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Monica, you\u2019re not leaving your patients, you\u2019re taking care of all the kids,\u2019\u201d Wehby said.\n\nA questioner, pointing to the current state of partisan bickering in the U.S. Senate, asked the candidates if they could work across the aisle, including with Sen. Wyden. Conger pointed to his past four years as a state representative, working in the minority.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found it\u2019s good to debate vigorously with the Democratic majority,\u201d he said.\n\nWehby noted she\u2019s been friends with Wyden for a decade, having worked as a medical consultant on his health care legislation.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get anywhere when you name call, bad mouth, insult the other side,\u201d she said. \u201cWho is going to work with you if you do that?\u201d\n\nWehby is the director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Randall Children\u2019s Hospital, in Portland. She\u2019s originally from Tennessee and studied at Notre Dame University and Baylor University, before moving to Portland in 1998.\n\nAlthough the topic didn\u2019t surface during the debate, Wehby has differentiated herself from the pack of Republicans vying to unseat Merkley, in part, because of her stance on abortion. Although, she said, she\u2019s personally pro-life, she doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s the federal government\u2019s job to make that decision for women.\n\nNot all state Republicans attended Dorchester. A rift between conservatives caused some to ditch the annual conference and hold their own \u201cfreedom rally.\u201d\n\nConger planned to speak at the alternative rally today.\n\nIn a letter to the Dorchester board, those charged with the new rally, including former gubernatorial candidate Kevin Mannix, wrote, \u201cIn light of the unveiled agenda to promote and celebrate liberal causes like abortion-on-demand, pet campaign projects like \u201crepublicanization\u201d same-sex marriage and the attack on people of faith and their religious liberties, many of us do not feel that our participation in this year\u2019s Dorchester Conference is welcomed. Considering our past relationships we actually find ourselves blindsided by the total disregard to our core issues.\u201d\n\nThe separate event would be a more welcoming \u201catmosphere for those with conservative leanings, both social and fiscal, along with a show of mutual respect for broader Republican values,\u201d the letter states.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-554-1162, ldake@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "SEASIDE \u2014 The two Republican front-runners vying to represent Oregon in the U.S. Senate faced off at the annual Dorchester Conference on Friday night.
