WASHINGTON (AP) - Authorities say three people were taken to hospitals after being hit by a golf cart at the National Zoo, but their injuries were not life threatening.

Officials say the group was injured Friday. A zoo spokeswoman says the injuries were minor.

It was not immediately clear what caused the crash, which radio station WTOP-FM said happened near the Amazonia exhibit, a 15,000-square-foot rainforest habitat. The radio station also reported that a zoo employee was not driving the cart and it was unclear if it was moving.
