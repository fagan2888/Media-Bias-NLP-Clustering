DDC\u2019s resident thought leader on healthcare and insurance, John Eisele, will ignite peer-to-peer dialogue with his insight covering the new healthcare legislation, recent developments in its rollout, and the impact it will have on employers for years to come.\n\nThe panel discussion will be moderated by Mark Luppi, executive vice president of HSBC North America, and will feature guest speaker Steven J. Friedman, co-chair of the Employee Benefits Practice Group at the largest global employment and labor law firm, Littler Mendelson. Topics of coverage include crucial features of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA); how costs will affect business management; issues surrounding the employer penalty mandate; as well as the potential consequences of certain ACA provisions including the tax credit and insurance exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis forum will allow attending SMEs to familiarize themselves with these complex and expensive regulations, as well as the subsequent modifications to the law that affect them individually; this is imperative to understand as there is no single, generic course of action that will work for all employers,\u201d Eisele explains.\n\nEisele credits BAB for taking the initiative to raise awareness about ACA provisions for SMEs: \"As a key partner for transatlantic business leaders, BAB has proved its dedication to providing excellent resources and up-to-date advice to its members time and time again.\"\n\n\"DDC is delighted for the opportunity to collaborate with BAB for this high-caliber program and contribute to long-term growth of their members,\" Eisele continues. \"We look forward to a compelling discussion, but, most importantly, answering questions and providing clarity on the ACA to attendees.\"\n\nTo register for the event, visit: http://www.babinc.org/events/803\n\nAbout BritishAmerican Business\n\nBritishAmerican Business is the leading transatlantic organization dedicated to helping companies connect and build constructive alliances between the United States and the United Kingdom, fostering global business expansion and innovation through targeted programs and events, with a membership of the world\u2019s most prominent multi-national and middle-market companies from a variety of industries.
