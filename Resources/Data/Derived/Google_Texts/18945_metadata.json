Same thing with Obama, Obama has turned out to be worse that I thought.\"\n\nGiuliani spent much of his time behind the podium blasting Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Barack Obama and lauding Republican hero President Ronald Reagan.\n\nRecalling his elections to the mayor's office, Giuliani said, \"Staten Island elected me,\" and called it his favorite borough.\n\nThe former mayor, standing with state Sen. Andrew Lanza, Assemblyman Joe Borelli, Councilman Steve Matteo, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, Brooklyn state Sen. Marty Golden and former mayoral candidate Joe Lhota, attacked Obama on the Affordable Care Act, foreign policy and national security.\n\nOne of several speakers to reference Reagan, Giuliani said the former president is \"turning over in his grave\" at the foreign affairs policies of the Obama administration.\n\nGiuliani attacked de Blasio, saying he \"is moving the city in exactly the wrong direction in almost every respect.\"\n\nHe also blasted Gentile, saying \"His opponent is on the wrong side of every issue imaginable and Dan is on the right side.\"\n\n\"Dan Donovan will be not just a member of Congress but a really great one because every job he's done, he's done really, really well and I've worked with him in just about every job he's done,\" Giuliani said.\n\nIn a statement, Gentile said, \"If raising the minimum wage, fighting for middle class families, providing tax breaks for small businesses and protecting seniors is wrong then I don't want to be right.\"\n\nAt the fundraiser, Giuliani called Donovan \"an articulate voice, an intelligent voice,\" and said he has shown \"tremendous courage and integrity, which I respect immensely.\"\n\nThe former mayor said, \"I know the people of Staten Island are fed up with what's going on in our city.\"\n\nHe urged people to vote for Donovan \"as a statement that we've had enough. We've had enough of Obama, we've had enough of de Blasio, we've had enough of Nancy Pelosi.\"\n\nDonovan supporter Donna Fagan yelled, \"They don't love our country, Rudy!\"\n\nHe jokingly said, \"Who said that? Who said that?\"\n\nHe has drawn the ire of many Democrats over a recent comment that Obama doesn't love America.\n\nAs Giuliani left early to attend a funeral, Donovan approached the podium as \"Eye of the Tiger\" blasted over the speakers.\n\nHe referenced Giuliani's run for president, saying the country would have been much better off with him and thanked the former mayor for his support.\n\nRallying the troops to get out the vote, he urged supporters to spread the word. If not, he joked, \"I'm the DA \u2014 I will find you.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2015 elections, daniel-donovan, island-seat, special-election, us house, us house dist 11, vincent-gentile, news", "title": "Rudy Giuliani stumps for Daniel Donovan on Staten Island", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Rudy Giuliani stumps for Daniel Donovan on Staten Island\", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/04/rudy_giuliani_stumps_for_danie.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/advance/photo/2015/04/25/17609332-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15813852\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-25T18:54:26Z\", \"author\": \"Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com\", \"tags\": [\"2015 elections\",\"@am-newsletter\",\"@elections\",\"@mobile\",\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"daniel-donovan\",\"island-seat\",\"special-election\",\"us house\",\"us house dist 11\",\"vincent-gentile\"] }", "twitter": {"creator": "@Writingrachel", "description": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Speaking to a room full of Daniel Donovan supporters in the swanky Above Rooftop lounge of the Hilton Garden Inn in Bloomfield on Saturday morning, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani stressed the importance of getting out the...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SIAdvance"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, April 25, 2015,  5:23 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.silive.com/advance/photo/2015/04/25/17609332-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rachelshapiro\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com\", \"author_id\": \"12017825\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Staten Island Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "SILive.com", "description": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Speaking to a room full of Daniel Donovan supporters in the swanky Above Rooftop lounge of the Hilton Garden Inn in Bloomfield on Saturday morning, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani stressed the importance of getting out the...", "title": "Rudy Giuliani stumps for Daniel Donovan on Staten Island", "url": "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/04/rudy_giuliani_stumps_for_danie.html", "image": "http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/advance/photo/2015/04/25/17609332-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "SILive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, April 25, 2015,  2:54 PM", "article_author": "Rachel Shapiro | rshapiro@siadvance.com", "Description": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Speaking to a room full of Daniel Donovan supporters in the swanky Above Rooftop lounge of the Hilton Garden Inn in Bloomfield on Saturday morning, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani stressed the importance of getting out the vote for the May 5 special congressional election against Democratic Councilman Vincent Gentile.
