When President Obama’s pet trade bill came up for a vote in the House, a few Republicans stood on principle and refused to vote for it — even though GOP leaders backed the proposal.

And when a committee chairman decided to punish one such rogue, House Speaker John Boehner says he has no problem with that.

“We have the majority, and when it comes to procedural votes in the House, the majority has to stick together and vote for or against … those procedural motions,” Boehner said in a press conference after a closed-door meeting of the GOP caucus.

In the private meeting, Boehner gave those who voted against the “fast track” trade deal a dressing down, telling them they should follow the party leaders. And he said he supported Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz’s right to strip Rep. Mark Meadows of his chairmanship of a subcommittee.

“I think the chairman made the right decision. I made it clear to the members I supported that decision,” Boehner said. “But I’m sure the family conversation will continue.”

Not coincidentally, Meadows was among two dozen Republicans who opposed Boehner’s bid for re-election to the speakership in January.

In another retaliatory move, Majority Whip Steve Scalise kicked three Republicans off his whipping team — the three just happened to oppose the trade bill.
