The U.S. economy is “insulated” from overseas inflation and deflation pressure from exchange rate movements owing to the fact that most of the world’s trade is invoiced in dollars, according to new economic research presented at the Federal Reserve’s summit in Jackson Hole.

If true, this would ease one concern surrounding prospective Fed rate hikes.

Some analysts have argued a U.S. central bank rate hike would cause a deflation scare in the domestic economy as a stronger dollar would cause commodity prices to fall.

Gita Gopinath, an economist professor at Harvard University, presented research showing international prices, in their currency of invoicing, are not very sensitive to exchange rates for up to two years.

She added that a good proxy for inflation sensitivity to exchange rate movements is the fraction of its imports invoiced in a foreign currency. By that measure, over 93% of all imports into the U.S. are invoiced in dollars.

This means that U.S. inflation is more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while other countries are highly sensitive to it, Gopinath said.

So a U.S. rate hike would create important inflationary concerns for a country like Turkey where only a small fraction of their imports is denominated in lira.

The flip side is that efforts by the Fed to raise inflation via easier monetary policy receives much less support from the exchange rate than it does for other countries.
