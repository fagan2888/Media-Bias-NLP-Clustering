Naturally, the financial industry isn\u2019t pleased, and congressional Republicans are eager to scrap the regulation.\n\nBut note the specifics of the Republican talking points. NPR reported yesterday:\n\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan sides with the brokers, tweeting last week that the final rule would become \u201cObamacare for financial planning.\u201d He promised to push congressional action to hold up the rule, which will not be fully implemented until January 2018.\n\nOh, for goodness sake. Are we stuck in the \u201cObamacare for _______\u201d framework again? Evidently, yes, and conservative media is only too pleased to go along. (The Daily Caller, on cue, is also complaining about \u201cObamacare for retirement planning.\u201d)\n\nTo the extent that policy details matter, let\u2019s note that the new financial-industry safeguards bear no resemblance whatsoever to the Affordable Care Act. I suspect that Republicans and their allies know that, but (a) they\u2019re reluctant to fight on Wall Street\u2019s behalf too openly; and (b) for lazy communications directors, simply throwing an \u201cObamacare\u201d label on everything is vastly easier than thinking.\n\nBut forget policy details. This is about an elaborate, and unfortunate, rhetorical exercise.\n\nFollowing up on our previous coverage , we talked last summer about the scene in \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d in which John Malkovich crawls into the head of John Malkovich (long story). Suddenly, he\u2019s stuck in a nightmare in which Malkovich is everywhere and everything.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "\"Obamacare for financial planning\" joins \"Obamacare for education,\" \"Obamacare for the Internet,\" \"Obamacare for banks,\" \"Obamacare for real estate,\" and so on.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-see-obamacare-everywhere-everything", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "\"Obamacare for financial planning\" joins \"Obamacare for education,\" \"Obamacare for the Internet,\" \"Obamacare for banks,\" \"Obamacare for real estate,\" and so on.", "title": "Republicans see 'Obamacare' everywhere, on everything", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-see-obamacare-everywhere-everything", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/2013/08/130807_impactobamacare.jpg?itok=wG4PjfWw", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-see-obamacare-everywhere-everything", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/08/130807_impactobamacare.jpg?itok=f2m388UV", "height": 553}, "title": "Republicans see 'Obamacare' everywhere, on everything", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"Obamacare for financial planning\" joins \"Obamacare for education,\" \"Obamacare for the Internet,\" \"Obamacare for banks,\" \"Obamacare for real estate,\" and so on."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-07T11:20:03-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Republicans see 'Obamacare' everywhere, on everything", "tags": "affordable-care-act,obamacare,paul-ryan,republicans,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "04/07/2016 11:20:03 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-see-obamacare-everywhere-everything"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "\"Obamacare for financial planning\" joins \"Obamacare for education,\" \"Obamacare for the Internet,\" \"Obamacare for banks,\" \"Obamacare for real estate,\" and so on.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Republicans, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Paul Ryan"}, "article_summary": "Following up on our previous coverage , we talked last summer about the scene in \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d in which John Malkovich crawls into the head of John Malkovich (long story).\nNaturally, the financial industry isn\u2019t pleased, and congressional Republicans are eager to scrap the regulation.\nI suspect that Republicans and their allies know that, but (a) they\u2019re reluctant to fight on Wall Street\u2019s behalf too openly; and (b) for lazy communications directors, simply throwing an \u201cObamacare\u201d label on everything is vastly easier than thinking.\nAre we stuck in the \u201cObamacare for _______\u201d framework again?\n(The Daily Caller, on cue, is also complaining about \u201cObamacare for retirement planning.\u201d)To the extent that policy details matter, let\u2019s note that the new financial-industry safeguards bear no resemblance whatsoever to the Affordable Care Act."}
