A video posted on YouTube by MrNakedLandscaper shows that this plant doesn\u2019t let anyone walk over it \u2014 not even large four-limbed primates that think they\u2019re at the top of the food chain.\n\nIn the video, the uploader sticks his tongue into the open jaws of the Venus flytrap. In a snap, it clamps shut on his tongue, digging its spiky claws into the flesh. Pulling his tongue out just results in a lot of blood and pain for this poor guy.\n\nVenus flytraps aren\u2019t going to kill you, but there are plenty of plants out there that could (not all succulents, bulbs, and flowers are as benign or pleasing as they may appear). And weirdly enough, it tends to be the prettiest-looking greens that are the deadliest, such as Nerium oleander, also known simply as Oleander. Even though Oleander is often found as a decorative plant in parks and gardens, eating any part of it could cause cardiac arrest, due to a wealth of cardiac glycosides \u2014 sugars that affect heart rhythm \u2014 in its gorgeously pink leaves, flowers, and fruits.\n\nOleander's pink flowers are charming, but they contain a toxic chemical that can kill you if ingested \u2014 so stay away from it.

Then there\u2019s poison ivy, which everyone (hopefully) learned to avoid during summer camp. While poison ivy affects everyone differently, causing rashes and itchiness in some, it can lead to far worse symptoms in others, including giant blisters (below).\n\nPoison ivy often causes rashes and discomfort, but in others it may cause even worse symptoms. Wikimedia\n\nLast but not least, there\u2019s the infamous Gympie Gympie stinging plant. As one of the most poisonous plants in the world, it has the power to inflict enormous pain with only a touch. In the video below, British scientist and TV presenter Dr. Mike Leahy decides to skim his hand across one of its green leaves to show viewers how excruciating it can be. \u201cI thought, how much could a tree or a shrub hurt?\" he says, bending over in pain. \"But that hurts\u2026 give me a minute.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "venus, flytraps, will, cut, you, if, you, stick, your, tongue, them, plus, 4, other, plants, can", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Don\u2019t try this at home.
