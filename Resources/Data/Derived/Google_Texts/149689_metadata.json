(AP) \u2013 Allegheny Technologies Inc. and the United Steelworkers planned contract talks to end a lockout of 2,200 workers.\n\nWednesday\u2019s talks in Pittsburgh are meant to reach a contract and end a lockout that began Aug. 15.\n\nThe Pittsburgh-based steelmaker has locked out workers at 12 plants in Pennsylvania and five other states.\n\nThe company has since idled nearly 260 union and salaried workers by idling its plant in Midland, Beaver County, and plans to do the same to its plant in Gilpin Township, Armstrong County, in April, until both facilities can generate acceptable profits.\n\nA key contract issue has been the company\u2019s demand that workers begin paying some of their health insurance premiums.
