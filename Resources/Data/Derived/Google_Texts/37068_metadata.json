Ted Cruz of Texas predicted a Republican president would undo the entirety of President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement upon taking office in 2017.\n\n\u201cI believe in January of 2017 a new Republican is going to enter the White House and in 2017 is going to sign legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, speaking at the \u201cPolitics and Eggs\u201d event in Manchester, N.H.\n\nMr. Cruz, who is considering a presidential bid of his own, tweaked \u201cgraybeards\u201d in Washington and people who predicted the fall 2013 battle over the law, spearheaded by Mr. Cruz and other conservatives in Congress, that led to a partial shutdown of the federal government would guarantee Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid would keep his job as majority leader in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cIf that had happened, there\u2019d be a lot of voices on TV going, \u2018I told you so. We told you so. That numbskull Cruz persisted in fighting against Obamacare and look what happened,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWell, the old rule: What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\u201d\n\nHe said in 2014, Republicans won an \u201cepic, historic, tidal wave\u201d election and said Obamacare was the No. 1 issue.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s interesting \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to anyone in Washington that energizing and mobilizing millions of people across this country, elevating debate about the disasters \u2014 all of the people who\u2019ve lost their jobs, lost their health care, lost their [doctor] because of Obamacare may have played some part in an historic tidal wave that changes control in Washington based on the exact issue that energized and mobilized those millions of people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Obama administration, meanwhile, said Monday that a net 16.4 million people have gained coverage since the law\u2019s major provisions took hold, driving the uninsured rate from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent between October 2013 and March 4.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz said the law was \u201cbiggest job killer in the country\u201d and that when you go to \u201cthe Upper East side of Manhattan,\u201d Obamacare isn\u2019t a big issue \u2014 but it is a big issue \u201cwith people who are struggling.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the early presidential state, Mr. Cruz also pitched a broader message of what he called \u201copportunity conservatism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means that I believe we should look at every single domestic policy with a laser focus on opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cHow does it help those at the bottom climb the economic ladder?\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s convinced that the \u201csingle biggest lie in all of politics\u201d is that the GOP is the \u201cparty of the rich.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the truth of the matter: The rich do just fine with big government,\u201d he said. \u201cBig business does great with big government. Big business inevitably has armies of lobbyists and lawyers and accountants. Big business gets in bed with government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people who get hammered by big government are the little guys \u2014 it\u2019s the small businesses, it\u2019s the mom and pop,\u201d he said. \u201cThe top 1 percent \u2014 the millionaires and billionaires that the president loves to demagogue \u2014 today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.\u201d\n\nHe said those on the left, often with good and well-meaning instincts, look at someone on the economic ladder and want to \u201cphysically grab them\u201d to move them up \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t work, and policy should be focused on empowering people to take ownership of their own future.\n\nHe relayed stories from his own parents, such as his father, a Cuban immigrant, working his way from a dishwasher to a cook on up, and said that \u201cevery other step on the economic ladder depends on getting on that first rung\u201d and then being able to pull yourself up.\n\nTo spur economic growth, Mr. Cruz also called for tax reform, the abolition of the IRS and a \u201csimple flat tax,\u201d praising the efforts on tax reform of former President Ronald Reagan and former Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill, who represented neighboring Massachusetts in the House.\n\nHe also called for regulatory reform, saying smaller community banks and institutions are getting hammered by federal regulations.\n\n\u2022 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the administration touted new health insurance enrollment numbers on Monday, Sen.
