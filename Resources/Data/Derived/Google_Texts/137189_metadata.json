The boy\u2019s left arm was also amputated below the shoulder. Neither of their identities has been released, and investigators have not stated whether the same shark attacked both victims. They were both taken to New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, where they were upgraded from critical to fair condition.\n\n\u201cBlood in the water coming over with the whitewash, kid was in shock. He was still coherent. Took it clean off. I saw what was left of what he had,\u201d Jason Hunter, an eyewitness, told CNN of the aftermath, when officials sent people with megaphones to get everyone out of the water.\n\nThe beaches were opened on Monday. Although officials have urged people to go to the beach with caution, they cannot close the beach and stop people from swimming. According to a report by the University of Florida, the U.S. led the world in shark attacks in 2014 with 52; there were 130 shark attacks worldwide. While more than half of these attacks happened in Florida waters, North Carolina was among the top states with attacks.\n\nOfficials have encouraged swimmers who have cuts to stay out of the water and to stay away from people who are fishing.\n\n\u201cOak Island is still a safe place,\u201d Tim Holloman, the town manager, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring the situation. This is highly unusual.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "north, carolina, shark, attacks, leave, 2, teens, without, left, arms, took, it, clean", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Two teenage kids lost both of their left arms in shark attacks while vacationing on the beach in North Carolina.", "title": "Two Teens In Fair Condition After Shark Attack [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/north-carolina-shark-attacks-leave-2-teens-without-left-arms-took-it-clean-338244", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/15/north-carolina-shark-attacks-leave-two-teens-without-left-arms-took-it-clean.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two teenage kids lost both of their left arms in shark attacks while vacationing on the beach in North Carolina.", "title": "Two Teens In Fair Condition After Shark Attack [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/north-carolina-shark-attacks-leave-2-teens-without-left-arms-took-it-clean-338244", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/15/north-carolina-shark-attacks-leave-two-teens-without-left-arms-took-it-clean.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/15/north-carolina-shark-attacks-leave-two-teens-without-left-arms-took-it-clean.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-15T12:59:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T13:10:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Two teenage kids lost both of their left arms in shark attacks while vacationing on the beach in North Carolina."}, "article_summary": "According to a report by the University of Florida, the U.S. led the world in shark attacks in 2014 with 52; there were 130 shark attacks worldwide.\nWhile more than half of these attacks happened in Florida waters, North Carolina was among the top states with attacks.\nA 12-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy both lost their left arms in separate shark attacks while vacationing near Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, N.C., on Sunday afternoon.\nThe girl's left arm was amputated below the elbow, though she also sustained tissue damage to her left leg.\nNeither of their identities has been released, and investigators have not stated whether the same shark attacked both victims."}
