The GOP is set to control at least 64 of the 99 chambers\u2013with two still up for grabs.\n\nDemocrats also lost control of the West Virginia Senate, which is now evenly split between the two major parties.\n\nThe victories in Nevada were perhaps the most unlikely, as Republicans managed to flip a 25-17 Democratic majority in the state House by picking up 10 seats. It was the first time in more than two decades Republicans won a majority of legislative seats in Nevada.\n\n\u201cThis is a night to remember. This is a night to savor,\u201d said newly re-elected Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval during his victory speech Tuesday.\n\nVoters in New Mexico gave Republicans control of the state House for the first time since 1952.\n\nBut the high-water mark for Republicans came in Maryland, a state with only 900,000 registered Republicans and more than 2 million registered Democrats. That\u2019s where Republican businessman Larry Hogan pulled the shocker of the night when he handily defeated Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, hand-picked successor of two-term Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, dealing a major blow to O\u2019Malley\u2019s 2016 presidential hopes.\n\n\u201cThey said it couldn\u2019t be done here in Maryland,\u201d Hogan said Tuesday night. \u201cThis is the largest mandate for change in Maryland in 63 years.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans swept into control of the Senate on Tuesday, but that only begins to tell the story of a midterm election that turned into an electoral rout.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Republicans swept into control of the Senate on Tuesday, but that only begins to tell the story of a midterm election that turned into an electoral rout.", "title": "Republican Romp Extended to State-Level Elections", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1479507_914420318583132_509197849249759605_n1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-06T17:16:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tMOOqw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Republicans swept into control of the Senate on Tuesday, but that only begins to tell the story of a midterm election that turned into an electoral rout.", "title": "Republican Romp Extended to State-Level Elections", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1479507_914420318583132_509197849249759605_n1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2014-11-07T03:01:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T17:16:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "republicans, republican takeover, election, state elections, state level, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce37f\"", "article_summary": "Voters in New Mexico gave Republicans control of the state House for the first time since 1952.\nFrom Nevada to New Hampshire, Republicans won resounding victories in state-level elections.\nIt was the first time in more than two decades Republicans won a majority of legislative seats in Nevada.\nThat\u2019s where Republican businessman Larry Hogan pulled the shocker of the night when he handily defeated Lt.
