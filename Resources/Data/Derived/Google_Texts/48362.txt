With ABC, NBC and even the Telegraph.co.uk calling 2013 the year of the selfie, it begs the question, what will 2014 bring?

Selfie, the word that Oxford dictionary named ‘Word of the Year’, is defined as "a photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website."

Many of last year’s selfies prompted much unwanted media attention. At Nelson Mandela’s funeral. President Obama posed for what could be called the ‘selfie seen around the world’ with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. And TMZ called Kim Kardashian’s post baby selfie of her backside an “Ass-selfie.”

Other selfie’s were just fun photos taken with famous people, or famous people taking fun photos of themselves.

Regardless, here’s a look at Native American selfies from 2013.

1. Three Native women posed at Emancipation Hall in Washington, D.C., during a ceremony that honored 33 tribes for the wartime contributions of the Code Talkers. The young women are taking a “tri-selfie.”

2. This woman posted her selfie on Flickr.com adding these hashtags: #me, #girl, #selfie, #brunette, #cherokee, #indian, #native… 3. Johnny Depp poses with a fan, Vanessa SKy Ellis, who has taken more than 10,000 selfies with various stars. On The Actor's Studio, Depp said that he believed he had Native American ancestry, and in May of 2012, Depp was made an honorary member of the Comanche tribe.

4. Gaining fame as the 400lbs high school running back, Tony Picard, above, poses for a selfie in his bathroom at home or maybe in White Swan’s locker room? Hang loose.

5. Funny faces are what selfies are all about, more or less. This young man wrote #tribal on his Tumblr page.

6. Two members of an Inuit tribe in northeast Russia pose (in -45 degree tempatures) for what looks to be an Artic selfie.
