As part of the Secretary\u2019s latest endeavor, she\u2019s trying to give the agency a new mission as well as a new logo.\n\nListen to the story!\n\nDuring the first few days after Florida lawmakers returned to the state Capitol, Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones made the rounds to committees in both the House and Senate.\n\nAmong the issues she talked about were her legislative budget requests.\n\nWhile she didn\u2019t give a specific number, she did outline some of her priorities.\n\n\u201cWhen we give out LBR [legislative budget request] for this year, it\u2019s a big number,\u201d said Jones. \u201cI\u2019ll warn you now. But, we\u2019ve calculated the result of investing in our infrastructure and how it relates to 10 percent reduction in energy cost and maintenance cost overtime.\u201d\n\nThe funding requests will include money for vehicles as well as funds for maintenance, like roof repairs\u2014which Rep. Kathleen Peters (R-Pasadena) agrees the prison agency needs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually been touring some prisons this Summer,\u201d said Peters, during a House Justice Budget panel meeting. \u201cSo, it\u2019s been very enlightening. And, I\u2019ve taken a look at some of the [fixed] capital expenses that were highlighted by corrections. And, I can tell you it\u2019s something that I think we need to really look very hard at. One of the facilities I was at\u2014I have very severe allergies\u2014and I very nearly ended up in the emergency room just in their administrative building. So, I think there are some serious things that we have to look at.\u201d\n\nNot only is Jones trying to spruce up the outer appearance of the buildings, she\u2019s also trying to fix the image of the prison system as a whole. It\u2019s been plagued by inmate deaths, allegations of abuse by prison guards, as well as cover ups.\n\nNow, Jones says she has a new vision for her agency. She calls it, \u201cInspiring success by transforming one life at a time.\u201d\n\nIt also comes with a new logo and changing references to the department known as the \u201cDOC\u201d to now be called the \u201cFDC.\u201d But, some lawmakers question this new direction.\n\n\u201cAnd, I\u2019m just wondering why we\u2019re doing that and what the costs are since we really haven\u2019t finished rebranding from the inside,\u201d asked Sen. Audrey Gibson (D-Jacksonville).\n\nBut, Jones says rebranding from the inside includes how the agency is perceived on the outside.\n\n\u201cSo, I know my corrections officers and my corrections probation staff and my administrative staff are all professionals, but they\u2019re not perceived as such,\u201d she responded. \u201cSo, when people start to think about the Department of Corrections, FDC\u2014the Florida Department of Corrections\u2014that they\u2019re thinking about this new agency that is positively focused and has an absolutely different outlook on life, relative to what our job is, which is transformative rehabilitation of our inmates and support of our employees and not this old branding that has perceived us to be negative, over use of force. So, it\u2019s the whole package, Senator, and the cost is minimal.\u201d\n\nShe says as part of this new mission to also create a safe environment for inmates as well as correctional employees, she\u2019s now working on strategies on how better to retain the staff that they\u2019ve worked hard to train.\n\n\u201cSince February, the Department has hired 2,200 new employees,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThat\u2019s a net gain of 800 corrections officers and 71 corrections community staff. And, it seems like a big number with a big net gain. We lose about 100 a month and we hire maybe 50 or 75, and it\u2019s a continuous churn.\u201d\n\nJones says although they\u2019ve hired a lot of employees, she\u2019s quickly losing them to local law enforcement agencies. For example, almost 70 percent of the officers at Dade Correctional have less than two years on the job.\n\nAnd, Kim Schultz says it\u2019s understandable, since the pay is not so great. She\u2019s a probation officer in North Miami Beach, who\u2019s worked in her profession for 19 years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here a very long time,\u201d said Schultz. \u201cI\u2019m getting closer to retirement. So, I\u2019m not leaving. But, for the people who aren\u2019t at that point, it\u2019s easier for them to go.\u201d\n\nShe adds while Jones is doing good work in trying to reform the agency, until there\u2019s better pay, correctional officers have no incentive to stay.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a wage disparity also when you look at an entry level for probation officer and like a first-line supervisor, middle management,\u201d Schultz continued. \u201cAnd, in our agency, let\u2019s say the entry level is $30,000, the first-line supervisor is $32,000, and middle management supervisor is $34,000. And, when you look at an agency like FDLE [Florida Department of Law Enforcement], the entry level is $45,000, the first-line supervisor is $60,000, and middle management is $87,000. So, even, when we get promoted, the increase in our pay isn\u2019t that significant.\u201d\n\nAnd, Jones says it\u2019s something she wants to look into as the 2016 session draws near.\n\n\u201cI think we need to talk very diligently with the legislature and the Governor\u2019s office for some adjustments, especially associated with higher risk areas and areas where we are losing employees,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAs for her boss, Governor Rick Scott says he\u2019s confident in the person he hired to run the Corrections agency.\n\n\u201cOh gosh, Julie Jones is doing a great job,\u201d said Scott, speaking recently to reporters. \u201cShe did a great job at Highway Safety. And, she\u2019s doing a very good job at the Department of Corrections. She is going to continue to hold individuals accountable. She\u2019s going to be doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nHe says that includes enforcement of her \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for misconduct of correctional officers. Since May, Jones says more than 300 people have been terminated for things, like excessive use of force and smuggling contraband into prisons.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida\u2019s troubled prison system is going through a bit of a revamp, as it also seeks to retain its correctional officers.
