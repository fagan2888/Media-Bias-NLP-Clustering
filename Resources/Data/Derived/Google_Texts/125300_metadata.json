Now when people think about World War II, most people consider the Holocaust its most horrific aspect.\n\nAfter his speech there was a short question-and-answer session for students and faculty to delve deeper into the topics discussed.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a very insightful presentation mainly because when I studied the Holocaust, I studied it in high school. We only focused on the horrors it caused and the destruction, but we never focused on how other people saw it and the human rights perspective,\u201d said first-year student Steven Armendariz.\n\nWhen Moyn was asked if his speech affected students he replied, \u201cI really enjoyed the response. And students asked really interesting, penetrating questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike any professor, we\u2019re in this to think about ideas and communicate them to any student.\u201d\n\nMoyn concluded by reminding us that human rights are not only about the world, but about the world we want to live in.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Elon Local News", "description": "James Bryce Professor of European Legal History at Columbia University, Samuel Moyn,\u00a0spoke Thursday evening in the McBride Gathering Space at the Numen Lumen Pavilion.
