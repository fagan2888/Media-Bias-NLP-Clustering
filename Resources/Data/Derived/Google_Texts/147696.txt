Former FBI Counterterrorism Task Force member Steve Rogers declared that the Obama administration “is more concerned about being politically correct than the safety of the American people” on Monday’s “Your World with Neil Cavuto” on the Fox News Channel.

“It’s an election year. They’re concerned that things are going to get out of control…in their eyes, out of control with regard to an election…we need to tell the truth. The truth is we’re at war and this [recent incidents such as the beheading attack in Oklahoma] is domestic terrorism at its worse” he said.

Rogers also argued “there should be no racial profiling, but because we’re at war, the rules of engagement for local law enforcement, [have] changed Neil. We need to profile, it’s called criminal profiling. It’s calling behavioral profiling. Police officers don’t wake up and target people because of their race, their religion, their color, but when there’s enough intelligence information that the police have, to lead you to certain areas where you have to criminally profile, we’ve got to do it or I’ve got to tell you, we’re going to see a lost blood on the streets of this country.”
