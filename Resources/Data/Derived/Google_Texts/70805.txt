ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli says state spending on Medicaid is projected to rise by nearly $700 million a year over the next four years.

However, DiNapoli said Thursday that the state's efforts to limit Medicaid spending are showing signs of progress with annual growth at less than 2 percent. The growth rate had previously been more than 5 percent annually.

New York's Medicaid spending has long been among the highest in the nation. The federal government picked up just over half of New York's $55.3 billion Medicaid bill last fiscal year.

Medicaid is the insurance program for low-income people. Total state enrollment is expected to exceed 6.4 million in several years.
