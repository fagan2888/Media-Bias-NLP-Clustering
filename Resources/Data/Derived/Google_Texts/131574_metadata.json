Rather, \u201cthis outreach is only to help our members by providing assistance and tools to best manage their health.\u201d\n\nDavid Nash, dean of the school of population health at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, said Mr. Tuck had received \u201cinaccurate\u201d advice, since the Affordable Care Act bars insurers from considering your health status when enrolling you in coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s against the law to deny coverage for any prior conditions,\u201d Dr. Nash said. Insurers commonly conduct such surveys, known as \u201chealth risk assessments,\u201d to help make sure members with specific health needs receive proper treatment, as well as to help predict costs so insurers can accurately set premiums. It\u2019s understandable, he said, that someone who hasn\u2019t had workplace-based insurance, where such assessments are very common, might be taken aback by being asked questions about personal topics, like their exercise habits. But gathering such information helps insurers design sustainable policies, he said.\n\nYet Sarah O\u2019Leary, who advised Mr. Tuck, said such insurer-initiated calls were reminiscent of those that insurance contractors made before the Affordable Care Act, to help vet applicants for individual policies for pre-existing medical conditions. (One such company contacting consumers on behalf of insurers, she said, is RSA Medical, which previously helped insurers underwrite individual applicants). Her firm, ExHale Healthcare Advocates, advises patients about medical coverage and negotiates medical bills, for fees ranging from $25 to $500 depending on the complexity of the situation.\n\nMs. O\u2019Leary said she was not aware of any consumers who had been improperly terminated from coverage, but that she considered the calls a \u201cred flag.\u201d She advises clients not to answer health questions from their insurers unless they have an active claim.\n\nHere are some questions about keeping your coverage under the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u25a0 What should I do if I get an unsolicited call from my insurer asking health-related questions?\n\nDr. Nash noted that answering insurer surveys was voluntary, but if you decline you can miss out on programs that may help you.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCheryl Fish-Parcham, private insurance program director at Families USA, which helps consumers, said health insurance companies were most likely trying to better understand the health profile of new enrollees as a group, to help them design their offerings for next year. Or, they may be trying to get on top of patients with complex needs, such as those who suffer from multiple illnesses. It is up to consumers if they want to answer any questions from their insurer, she said, but consumers \u201ccan rest assured\u201d that their policies can\u2019t be canceled because of their health.\n\nMs. O\u2019Leary suggests that if you get a call from your insurer that you didn\u2019t initiate, you should at the very least hang up and call the number on the back of your insurance card, to make sure the caller is legitimate.\n\n\u25a0 Is there any way I can lose my health coverage under the Affordable Care Act?\n\nYou can be terminated if you don\u2019t pay your monthly premium, so it\u2019s important to get your payment in on time. If you get assistance through premium tax credits, or subsidies, you\u2019ll have a grace period before your policy is actually canceled, to allow you to catch up. Ms. Shoemaker, the Indiana consultant, said she paid her premium online several days before the due date and then telephoned to confirm her payment was properly credited.\n\nAnother way to lose coverage is if you fraudulently filled out your application. It\u2019s not entirely clear yet what would be considered fraud, said Karen Pollitz, a health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. But one classic example might be listing a nonrelative on your application for a family policy in order to gain coverage for them; if the insurer learned the truth later, coverage could be rescinded. Saying that you don\u2019t smoke on your application, when in fact you are a smoker, isn\u2019t grounds for termination of coverage under the law. But if your status as a smoker is discovered, insurers can retroactively impose higher premiums and cancel you if you don\u2019t pay.\n\n\u25a0 Can disease management programs be beneficial?\n\nA study by RAND researchers found that disease management programs, which help patients with conditions like diabetes stick to specific medical and drug regimens by, for example, having a nurse call them to remind them to refill prescriptions, can help patients and may save money. (In contrast, generic \u201cwellness\u201d programs focusing on, say, weight loss, didn\u2019t save money, the study found).", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140610164414, "twitter": {"description": "Insurers are calling people new to the Affordable Care Act asking health questions.
