The Harvard Law graduate (he overlapped at the school with President Obama) and Iraq War veteran (he won a Bronze Star for his time there) served in the Maryland legislature before being elected to the No 2. slot in the state in 2006. He and Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley won reelection in 2010.\n\nWhy is he on theGrio\u2019s 100?\n\nIf he wins, Brown would join Massachusetts\u2019 Deval Patrick as the only black governors in the country. And if elected, he would become the leader of a large Democratic state, giving him the ability to lead on a number of progressive issues.\n\nHe has pledged to implement a universal pre-kindergarten program if he elected.\n\nBut victory is not guaranteed. Brown is facing stiff opposition in the Democratic primary.\n\nHe has a valuable ally in ex-White House advisor and Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, who joined Brown\u2019s team in July of 2013. \u201cI met a lot of people traveling across America as President Obama\u2019s campaign manager and I can tell you that Anthony Brown truly stands out as one of the best in this next generation of leaders,\u201d Messina said in a statement.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for him?\n\nAhead of next June\u2019s primary, Brown will campaign across the state. He leads in most polls and has more money than his opponents, but is facing criticism over his role in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act in Maryland, which has been beset by website problems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "theGRIO'S 100 - The 52-year-old lieutenant governor is running for the top spot in his state this year, looking to become only the third African-American ever elected governor of a state and the first in Maryland's history...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "theGrio", "description": "theGRIO'S 100 - The 52-year-old lieutenant governor is running for the top spot in his state this year, looking to become only the third African-American ever elected governor of a state and the first in Maryland's history...", "title": "theGrio\u2019s 100: Anthony Brown, looking to make history in\u00a0Maryland", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2210, "identifier": "http://i2.wp.com/thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/anthony-brown.jpg?fit=2210%2C1243", "height": 1243}, "url": "http://thegrio.com/2014/02/03/thegrios-100-anthony-brown-looking-to-make-history-in-maryland/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1699887390250781, "pages": 75928194876}, "article": {"section": "Black History", "tag": "theGrio's 100", "published_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-03T19:18:04+00:00", "author": "http://thegrio.com/author/thegrio/"}, "keywords": "black history, news, politics, thegrio's 100, anthony brown, democrats, governor, grio's 100, lieutenant governor, maryland, thegrio's 100", "google-site-verification": "nGSqmdocNPXRMLRT9q_QAemkqyzj9W5Vd4tzA7hsksg"}, "article_summary": "(Photo by Mark Gail/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)Who is Anthony Brown?\nLt Governor Anthony Brown spoke as his running mate Ken Ulman (L) and his wife Jacqueline(R) looked on at a pizza party that they hosted at the Brown for Governor headquarters on June 03, 2013 in Largo, MD.\nHe has a valuable ally in ex-White House advisor and Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, who joined Brown\u2019s team in July of 2013.\nThe 52-year-old lieutenant governor is running for the top spot in his state this year, looking to become only the third African-American ever elected governor of a state and the first in Maryland\u2019s history.\nAhead of next June\u2019s primary, Brown will campaign across the state."}
