Marco Rubio promised to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare.\u201d Rubio has been advocating repeal since 2013, helping him build support among the GOP\u2019s conservative base that is key to winning Republican presidential primaries. Yet only a few years before he was elected to the U.S. Senate, Rubio was aggressively promoting some of the core policies of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn 2006, Rubio released a book called \u201c100 Innovative Ideas for Florida\u2019s Future.\u201d In the book\u2019s section on healthcare, Rubio decried the fact that \u201cmore than 3 million Floridians lack health insurance and may face barriers in accessing needed health services.\u201d As a solution, Rubio pressed to expand government-run healthcare programs and create an insurance exchange -- both core tenets of Obamacare.\n\nFor instance, he lamented that at one government-funded health program in Florida \u201cenrollment has dropped by over 130,000 from its peak several years ago, primarily due to the tightening of eligibility screening procedures.\u201d When it came to the government-run State Child Health Insurance Program, Rubio criticized the fact that \u201cFlorida has underspent its federal SCHIP allocations by more than $450 million.\u201d\n\nRubio also touted other government-run health programs in Florida, writing: \u201cA variety of programs and services exist to meet the healthcare needs of low-income and uninsured residents. These efforts include Florida KidCare, the Florida Health Insurance Plan, Health Flex, community-based free clinics, and other safety-net programs. The state should expand these efforts.\u201d He added: \u201cFlorida should make it easier for qualified, uninsured children to get coverage through Florida KidCare.\u201d\n\nAs for private insurance, Rubio said, \u201cFlorida should launch a marketplace of affordable health insurance.\u201d He also wrote that \u201cto further jumpstart this program, the state could also provide a partial subsidy for a limited number of qualified subscribers.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nTwo of the key tenets of the ACA -- which is anathema to conservatives -- are the expansion of state-based Medicaid programs and the creation of insurance exchanges.\n\nRubio has slammed the Obama administration\u2019s energy policy. In his 2013 State of the Union rebuttal, he said that \u201csolar and wind energy should be a part of our energy portfolio\u201d but that \u201cGod also blessed America with abundant coal, oil and natural gas.\u201d He attacked the Obama administration for \u201cwasting more taxpayer money on so-called clean energy companies like Solyndra.\u201d But Rubio\u2019s 2006 book criticized reliance on fossil fuels and supported renewable energy initiatives.\n\nIn one section, he wrote that government should \u201cpromote the development and use of alternative energy sources\u201d and argued that \u201csubstitution of alternative energy sources for fossil fuels is critical to reducing our dependence on imported oil.\u201d He also expressed concern about a potential \u201coverreliance\u201d on fossil fuels, noting that \u201cfossil fuels represent 86 percent\u201d of Florida\u2019s energy generating capacity. He declared that \u201cdependence on oil jeopardizes Florida\u2019s continued economic prosperity\u201d and said that Florida should \u201cbuild energy-efficient buildings that meet environmental standards.\u201d\n\nThe Florida GOP spent roughly $575,000 to promote Rubio\u2019s book, according to the Palm Beach Post. Rubio also set up a nonprofit to promote it.\n\nThe book\u2019s promotion of themes echoed by Obama could intensify recent efforts by Rubio\u2019s rivals to peel away conservative voters flocking to his campaign. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign in particular recently called Rubio \"a GOP Obama.\"\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem for Bush: He backed Rubio\u2019s book with a back-cover endorsement and a foreword.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marco rubio, rubio, obamacare, obama energy, energy, renewable, health care, government run, kidcare, book, 100 ideas, 100 innovative ideas, florida's future, jeb bush, bush, foreword, repeal, affordable care act, marketplace", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "In 2006 GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio wrote a book urging expanded government-run healthcare.", "title": "Marco Rubio Promoted Core Tenets Of Obamacare And Obama Energy Policies", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/marco-rubio-promoted-core-tenets-obamacare-obama-energy-policies-2177585", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/11/10/marco-rubio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 2006 GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio wrote a book urging expanded government-run healthcare.", "title": "Marco Rubio Promoted Core Tenets Of Obamacare And Obama Energy Policies", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/marco-rubio-promoted-core-tenets-obamacare-obama-energy-policies-2177585", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/11/10/marco-rubio.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/11/10/marco-rubio.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "published_time": "2015-11-10T10:55:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T14:21:07-05:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rocktheboat"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In 2006 GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio wrote a book urging expanded government-run healthcare."}, "article_summary": "These efforts include Florida KidCare, the Florida Health Insurance Plan, Health Flex, community-based free clinics, and other safety-net programs.\nYet only a few years before he was elected to the U.S. Senate, Rubio was aggressively promoting some of the core policies of the Affordable Care Act.\nIn one section, he wrote that government should \u201cpromote the development and use of alternative energy sources\u201d and argued that \u201csubstitution of alternative energy sources for fossil fuels is critical to reducing our dependence on imported oil.\u201d He also expressed concern about a potential \u201coverreliance\u201d on fossil fuels, noting that \u201cfossil fuels represent 86 percent\u201d of Florida\u2019s energy generating capacity.\nRubio has slammed the Obama administration\u2019s energy policy.\nJeb Bush\u2019s campaign in particular recently called Rubio \"a GOP Obama.\""}
