He\u2019s not only an expert in health care policy and the director of the health care program at the National Bureau of Economic Research, he\u2019s also one of a small number of wonks who helped design both Mitt Romney\u2019s health care system in Massachusetts and President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nGruber sat down for a fascinating chat yesterday with Harold Pollack about where the broader policy debate stands, and while the whole discussion is worth your time, I was struck by their focus on Medicaid expansion in particular. Gruber insisted we \u201ccannot talk enough\u201d about the \u201clife-costing tragedy [that] has taken place in America.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m offended on two levels here. I\u2019m offended because I believe we can help poor people get health insurance, but I\u2019m almost more offended there\u2019s a principle of political economy that basically, if you\u2019d told me, when the Supreme Court decision came down, I said, \u2018It\u2019s not a big deal. What state would turn down free money from the federal government to cover their poorest citizens?\u2019 The fact that half the states are is such a massive rejection of any sensible model of political economy, it\u2019s sort of offensive to me as an academic. And I think it\u2019s nothing short of political malpractice that we are seeing in these states and we\u2019ve got to emphasize that. [\u2026] \u201c[Conservative policymakers in these states] are not just not interested in covering poor people, they are willing to sacrifice billions of dollars of injections into their economy in order to punish poor people. It really is just almost awesome in its evilness.\u201d\n\nThose are, to be sure, strong words. They\u2019re also words that easy to defend.\n\nTake, for example, the increasingly heated fight over Medicaid expansion in Virginia, where Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) campaigned on Medicaid expansion as a key element of his 2013 platform, but where Republican lawmakers in the commonwealth are prepared to do practically anything to block the policy \u2013 including a possible shutdown of the state government.\n\nDahlia Lithwick published a powerful piece yesterday, making the case that she\u2019s \u201cpissed\u201d because \u201cthere is no excuse, not one, to block the Medicaid expansion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It's awfully tough to defend policymakers standing in the way of Medicaid expansion in red states.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/almost-awesome-its-evilness", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "It's awfully tough to defend policymakers standing in the way of Medicaid expansion in red states.", "title": "'Almost awesome in its evilness'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/almost-awesome-its-evilness", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/181320209.jpg?itok=sC8-h649", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/almost-awesome-its-evilness", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/181320209.jpg?itok=TXPEbqYr", "title": "'Almost awesome in its evilness'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It's awfully tough to defend policymakers standing in the way of Medicaid expansion in red states."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-09T11:38:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "'Almost awesome in its evilness'", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,medicaid,obamacare,terry-mcauliffe,virginia,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "04/09/2014 11:38:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/almost-awesome-its-evilness"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "It's awfully tough to defend policymakers standing in the way of Medicaid expansion in red states.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, Obamacare, Terry McAuliffe, Virginia"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s not only an expert in health care policy and the director of the health care program at the National Bureau of Economic Research, he\u2019s also one of a small number of wonks who helped design both Mitt Romney\u2019s health care system in Massachusetts and President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\nMIT economist Jonathan Gruber brings a unique perspective to the health care debate.\nDahlia Lithwick published a powerful piece yesterday, making the case that she\u2019s \u201cpissed\u201d because \u201cthere is no excuse, not one, to block the Medicaid expansion.\u201d\nTake, for example, the increasingly heated fight over Medicaid expansion in Virginia, where Gov.\nIt really is just almost awesome in its evilness.\u201dThose are, to be sure, strong words."}
