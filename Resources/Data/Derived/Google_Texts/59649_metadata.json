Friends of Bigrock raised $150,000 in about 40 days, securing $30,000 through an online campaign and the rest through corporate donations from businesses in Aroostook County and Western New Brunswick.\n\nInitially, Friends of Bigrock announced they were looking to raise $150,000. They later increased that amount to $300,000 to ensure funding to support a turnaround plan that the mountain leadership believes will take three years.\n\nGuerrette said Saturday that Bigrock officials decided to make the announcement because they were confident that they were close to transferring ownership of the ski area from the Maine Winter Sports Center to Bigrock\u2019s board of directors.\n\nHe said that season passes are now on sale and will likely be available for purchase online next week.\n\n\u201cThe fundraising is an ongoing process,\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cWe are not going to stop.\u201d\n\nWith 980 feet of vertical drop, Bigrock Mountain is the tallest ski area in northern Maine and the Canadian Maritimes.\n\nMaine Winter Sports purchased the ski area in 1999 and, since then with the Libra Foundation, invested more than $6 million in improving the facility, including by expanding the snowmaking systems, and adding a new triple chairlift and a tubing park.\n\nMaine Winter Sports Center ended a 13-year relationship with Bigrock when it made its announcement. Earlier this summer, the organization also announced it was stepping away from Black Mountain in Rumford after 10 years of ownership. Rumford-area community members quickly raised the necessary funds to take over operations of Black Mountain.\n\nDonations may be made at www.gofundme.com/save-BigrockMountain.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MARS HILL, Maine \u2014 A massive fundraising effort to keep a beloved community ski area open has been successful, officials at Bigrock Mountain in Mars Hill announced Saturday, as supporters have managed to raise more than $200,000 to save the facility from closure.
