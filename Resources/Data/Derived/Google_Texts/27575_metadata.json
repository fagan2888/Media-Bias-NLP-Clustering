Often, she said, scammers can\u2019t be found in a second call, but legitimate navigators will be available.\n\n\u201cAnd then you can also call the health exchange folks and see whether or not somebody made a call,\u201d she said.\n\nVermonters who think they\u2019ve been contacted as part of this scam can reach the Department of Financial Regulation\u2019s insurance division at 1-800-964-1784.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "A new phone scam targeting Vermonters is capitalizing on the confusion around the Affordable Care Act, officials announced today.
