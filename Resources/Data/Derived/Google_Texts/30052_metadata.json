It quickly made the rounds of conservative media and lawmakers, who have long suspected that \u201clost\u201d emails might contain evidence of a broader problem than the IRS has been willing to admit.\n\nRelated: IRS Admits Targeting Conservatives for Tax Scrutiny in 2012\n\nThe scandal involved the IRS division in Cincinnati, which Lerner oversaw. It was revealed that the employees used a set of key words to identify organizations applying for tax-exempt status that should receive extra scrutiny. The key words were meant to identify groups that might be engaging in political activity that would make them ineligible for tax-exemptions, but they were heavily weighted toward terms that seemed to target conservative-leaning organizations in particular.\n\nBig news: 6,400 of former #IRS official Lois Lerner\u2019s emails have been recovered. http://t.co/BX4rhf05yT \u2014 Speaker John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) April 29, 2015\n\nThe additional scrutiny meant delays in approvals for an unknown number of organizations, all in advance of the 2012 election campaign. Congressional Republicans, already no fans of the IRS, were incensed at the idea that conservative groups might have been prevented from fully engaging in the campaign and launched multiple investigations. Lerner herself was memorably called to appear before a congressional hearing, where she refused to testify.\n\nRelated: \u2018Lost\u2019 IRS Emails Point to an Abuse of Power and Cover-Up\n\nThe investigations were stymied, in part, by a combination of factors related to a Lerner\u2019s IRS-issued computer crashing in 2011 and the agency\u2019s failure to have a strong system in place to capture documents considered \u201cfederal records.\u201d\n\nLike other employees at the IRS, Lerner was expected to determine what records needed to be preserved and to keep a hard copy of them. The agency repeatedly told Congress that its email servers regularly overwrote their backup tapes and that the crash of Lerner\u2019s computer meant that any emails that could not be recovered from other senders or recipients within the agency were lost.\n\nInvestigators have, for the past two years, occasionally announced that a new trove of emails to or from Lerner had been uncovered. Tuesday\u2019s report, according to The Hill, suggested that some, but not all, of the 6,400 have not yet been turned over to congressional investigators.\n\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the IRS said the discovery was \u201can encouraging development that will help resolve remaining questions and dispel uncertainty surrounding the emails.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the scandal that never ends, the Inspector General that oversees the Internal Revenue Service said that it has uncovered 6,400 emails from Lois Lerner, the central figure in the agency\u2019s alleged targeting of conservative non-profits.", "title": "Found! 6,400 New Lois Lerner Emails on the IRS Targeting Scandal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/29/Found-6400-New-Lois-Lerner-Emails-IRS-Targeting-Scandal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Lois_Lerner_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/29/Found-6400-New-Lois-Lerner-Emails-IRS-Targeting-Scandal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Lois_Lerner_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In the scandal that never ends, the Inspector General that oversees the Internal Revenue Service said that it has uncovered 6,400 emails from Lois Lerner, the central figure in the agency\u2019s alleged targeting of conservative non-profits.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd902c\"", "article_summary": "Related: IRS Admits Targeting Conservatives for Tax Scrutiny in 2012The scandal involved the IRS division in Cincinnati, which Lerner oversaw.\nBig news: 6,400 of former #IRS official Lois Lerner\u2019s emails have been recovered.\nThe discovery of the emails belonging to Lois Lerner, the former head of the IRS\u2019s division overseeing tax-exempt organizations, was first reported by The Hill newspaper on Tuesday night.\nIt quickly made the rounds of conservative media and lawmakers, who have long suspected that \u201clost\u201d emails might contain evidence of a broader problem than the IRS has been willing to admit.\nInvestigators have, for the past two years, occasionally announced that a new trove of emails to or from Lerner had been uncovered."}
