But not only is this misguided, it\u2019s inaccurate.\n\nHistorically, Business Insider (BI) reported, the term transracial referred to interracial adoption, also known as transracial adoption. Dr. Guylaine Hubbard-Brosmer, adoption coordinator for The Independent Adopting Center, explained this basic definition as \u201can adoptive placement in which the child\u2019s race/ethnicity is different from the adoptive parent\u2019s race/ethnicity.\u201d And as BI found, the #transracial hashtag that\u2019s appeared on Dolezal-related social media posts was up until recently used \u201cin tandem with the hashtag #adoption.\u201d\n\nIf not transracial, how do you describe someone who wants to identify as another race? While Dolezal has yet to give her side of the story, there are pieces of her narrative as an African-American woman that may be pyshcologically telling.\n\nSadomasochism\n\nPsychology Today traces sadism (deliberate cruelty) and masochism (enjoyment of pain) back to the 19th century German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing. Ebing, it turns out, named sadism for Marquis de Sade, an 18th century writer known for his erotic literature and a known sexual sadist. In one of Sade\u2019s books, he wrote:\n\n\u201cHow delightful are the pleasures of the imagination! In those delectable moments, the whole world is ours; not a single creature resists us, we devastate the world, we repopulate it with new objects which, in turn, we immolate. The means to every crime is ours, and we employ them all, we multiply the horror a hundredfold.\u201d\n\nWhen sadism and masochism combine, they become a subset of BDSM, hence the frequent association with sexual gratification. But The Daily Beast suggests parts of Dolezal\u2019s story are sadomasochistic; she claims her parents abused her and her brothers as children with a \u201cbaboon whip\u2026 pretty similar to what was used as whips during slavery.\u201d And similar parts of Dolezal\u2019s \u201cfamily history\u201d are \u201creplete with images of grotesque violence\u2026 like slavery. Like torture.\u201d\n\nTo The Daily Beast, \u201cThese are highly choreographed, ritualized sadomasochistic scenes, and to psychotherapists, they\u2019re nothing new.\u201d\n\nVictimization\n\nThe \u201cnothing new\u201d part of The Daily Beast\u2019s theory lends itself to the psychological idea of victimization. Dr. Jill P. Weber wrote in a separate post for Psychology Today, \u201cHow a person internalizes a particular point of view about control speaks volumes about their ability to live with a sense of well-being and contentment.\u201d\n\nWeber continued: \u201cIf you grew up with parents who continually emphasized effort and personal responsibility, you may have an easier time with life\u2019s ups and downs. On the other hand, if your parental models continually blamed external factors for their difficulty or if you genuinely struggled with events outside of your control (socioeconomic status, trauma, abuse, war, or social unrest) you may be prone to having a high external locus of control.\u201d\n\nIf Dolezal\u2019s alleged child abuse were to come out as true (her parents and brother deny these claims), she could be prone to this external locus of control, which means she\u2019d be more likely to believe her successes and failures are dependent upon outside factors rather than themselves. People with high external locus often find they repeatedly endure the same negative consequences, in addition to also being more prone to depression, alcoholism, and obesity.\n\nRacism, however, may be what ultimately motivated Dolezal\u2019s \u201cnew life.\u201d BuzzFeed News spoke with Ezra Dolezal, one of Dolezal\u2019s brothers, who said he believes his sister became \u201chateful to white people\u201d after her teachers and peers at Howard University mistreated her for being white and studying African Art. Ezra said, \u201cbecause of her work\u2026 they thought she was a black student during her application, but they ended up with a white person.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s like what psychologists call self-hating. She had no reason not to like herself being white. She was an awesome artist and she could have accomplished everything she did if she had stayed exactly the same.\u201d\n\nSelf-Hatred\n\nSelf-hatred, like an external locus of control, most often stems from childhood, Dr. Stacy Freedenthal wrote for GoodTherapy.org. Experiencing trauma can fuel a child\u2019s negative feelings, and when it\u2019s \u201cat its most extreme, self-hatred can lead people to retreat into substance use, suicidal, and other self-destructive behaviors.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding how self-hatred forms is the best way to combat it. In fact, the antidote, Freedenthal said, is self-compassion. A 2014 study from the University of Waterloo found self-compassion was the \u201ckey to positive body image and coping.\u201d\n\n\"Women may experience a more positive body image and better eating habits if they approach disappointments and distress with kindness and the recognition that these struggles are a normal part of life,\" said Allison Kelly, lead study author of the Department of Psychology at Waterloo, in a press release. \"How we treat ourselves during difficult times that may seem unrelated to our bodies and eating seems to have a bearing on how we feel about our bodies and our relationship with food.\"\n\nThe bottom line: We won't know exactly why Dolezal chose to lie about her identity until she says so herself. But when considering the idea someone would want to identify as someone else in order to imagine a scenario different from their own, it does seem to be psychologically possible.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rachel, dolezal, isnt, african, american, so, what, motivated, her, identify, one", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Parts of Rachel Dolezal's story may reveal psychological motivators  behind her choice identify and live as an African-American woman.", "title": "Why Does Rachel Dolezal Identify As A Black Woman?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rachel-dolezal-isnt-african-american-so-what-motivated-her-identify-one-338120", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/13/rachel-dolezal.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Parts of Rachel Dolezal's story may reveal psychological motivators  behind her choice identify and live as an African-American woman.", "title": "Why Does Rachel Dolezal Identify As A Black Woman?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rachel-dolezal-isnt-african-american-so-what-motivated-her-identify-one-338120", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/13/rachel-dolezal.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/13/rachel-dolezal.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-06-13T17:42:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-13T17:51:48-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Parts of Rachel Dolezal's story may reveal psychological motivators  behind her choice identify and live as an African-American woman."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9aa8\"", "article_summary": "Historically, Business Insider (BI) reported, the term transracial referred to interracial adoption, also known as transracial adoption.\nPeople with high external locus often find they repeatedly endure the same negative consequences, in addition to also being more prone to depression, alcoholism, and obesity.\nWhile Dolezal has yet to give her side of the story, there are pieces of her narrative as an African-American woman that may be pyshcologically telling.\nThe bottom line: We won't know exactly why Dolezal chose to lie about her identity until she says so herself.\nSadomasochismPsychology Today traces sadism (deliberate cruelty) and masochism (enjoyment of pain) back to the 19th century German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing."}
