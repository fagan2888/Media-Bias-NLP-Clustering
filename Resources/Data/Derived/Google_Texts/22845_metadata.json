You can\u2019t say that you stand with farmers and say \u201cI\u2019ll vote against the farm bill,\u201d that you\u2019re not a strong supporter of the renewable fuel standard because you don\u2019t agree with it in principal and these are things that have consequences for Iowans.\u201d\n\n\u201cActions speak louder than words and I have a 100 percent rating when it comes to renewable fuels; that\u2019s from the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. I will continue to stand up for farmers and rules. Now I think it\u2019s very important to have farmers in the United States Senate. When you talk about your words behind closed doors at a fundraiser in Texas, you poked fun at Senator Grassley for being just a farmer without a law degree.\u201d\n\nFact Check: What you need to know about the ad linking Joni Ernst to privatizing Social Security\n\nFact Check: What you need to know about the ad criticizing Braley's attendance record\n\nAfter the debate, supporters went both ways regarding who won the debate.\n\n\u201cOverall I say Braley did a better job at answering most of the questions and getting to the core issues,\u201d said one attendee.\n\n\u201cSomebody like Joni that has experience, she\u2019s a leader, you don\u2019t get to be a Lieutenant Colonel by being a puppet,\u201d said another attendee.\n\nAccording to the Des Moines Register, Ernst was ahead of Braley by just one point 47% - 46% on Saturday.\n\nWhichever candidate is elected in November will take over for Senator Tom Harkin who is vacating the seat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vying for an Iowa Senate seat, Joni Ernst and Bruce Braley went head-to-head in a debate Saturday, October 11, 2014.
