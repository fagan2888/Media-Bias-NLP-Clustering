The closest he got was an offhand remark in an improvised sermon Saturday, in which amid a ringing endorsement of family life he urged Catholics to \u201cprotect the family, because it\u2019s there that our future is!\u201d (RELATED: Pope Francis Gave An Amazing Unscripted Speech On The Gift Of Family)\n\nHe also gave a speech in favor of robust religious liberty while visiting Philadelphia\u2019s Independence Hall Saturday.\n\nAnd while in Washington Wednesday, he made a surprise visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of nuns is at the center of an ongoing legal battle over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. (RELATED: Pope Francis Met Little Sisters Of The Poor In Quiet Protest Of Obamacare)\n\nDuring the in-flight press conference, Francis also expanded on his sorrow over Catholic priests\u2019 sex abuse of children. Saying that abusive priests breached the trust they are meant to use to guide laypeople toward Jesus Christ, he understands when abuse victims lose their Christian faith, saying \u201cI pray for them. And I don\u2019t judge them.\u201d\n\nHe even went so far as to speculate about an abuse victim\u2019s mother who became an atheist: \u201cI\u2019m sure that that woman has been received by God.\u201d\n\nFollow Ivan Plis on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
