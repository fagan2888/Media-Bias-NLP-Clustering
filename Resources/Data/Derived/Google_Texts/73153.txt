The snow that fell Thursday through Saturday afternoon accumulated as many inches in some suburbs near Denver as it did in the northern high country.

With the arrival of 3 additional inches overnight Friday, parts of Adams, Arapahoe and Jefferson counties received as much as 9 inches of snow. It’s the same amount that fell in Granby, 60 miles northwest.

Officially, the total for Denver was only about 3 inches, as recorded at Denver International Airport.

The mountains saw considerably more snow south of Granby — beginning at Breckenridge, where totals surpassed 30 inches. Three feet of snow in Monarch and Silverton were reported to the National Weather Service and Colorado Ski Country USA.

Kari Bowen, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Boulder, said northeastern Colorado got the brunt of the storm when it first arrived on Thursday.

An upslope in Weld, Morgan, Washington and Yuma counties had yielded anywhere from 5 to 10 inches before the weekend, Bowen said. Yuma got as much as 13 inches by Saturday morning.

The snow, which tapered off in Denver on Saturday, could come back in light flurries for a week.

“It’s an unsettled pattern. There’s a lot going on,” Bowen said. “It’s not your typical ridge that moves in and settles down in a couple of days.”

A 10 percent to 30 percent chance of precipitation will persist throughout the week, Bowen said, “depending on what’s happening in the atmosphere.”
