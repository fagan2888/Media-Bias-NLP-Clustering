Eight times, she has won.\n\nThe latest comeback was in the third round of the U.S. Open on Friday night, when Williams figured out a way to deal with a tricky opponent and get her own game going before it was too late, eventually emerging to grab the last eight games for a 3-6, 7-5, 6-0 victory over Bethanie Mattek-Sands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to live on the edge,\u201d Williams said with a big smile.\n\nPerhaps. Still, no one does it better. And with so much at stake, no less.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a great closer,\u201d Mattek-Sands said. \u201cAlways has been.\u201d\n\nThe No. 1-ranked Williams is trying to become the first tennis player since Steffi Graf in 1988 to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same season.\n\nShe won the Australian Open on hard courts in January, the French Open on clay courts in June, Wimbledon on grass courts in July, and now is four wins away from adding the trophy on the hard courts of the U.S. Open. Next up is a fourth-round match Sunday against yet another American, 19th-seeded Madison Keys.\n\nLooking down the line, Williams\u2019 quarterfinal opponent could be her older sister Venus, who reeled off the last five games to beat 12th-seeded Belinda Bencic of Switzerland 6-3, 6-4.\n\nIn men\u2019s action, No. 1 Novak Djokovic and defending champion Marin Cilic moved into the fourth round, while Rafael Nadal hoped to join them in the night\u2019s closing match. Two top-10 players lost \u2014 No. 7 David Ferrer and No. 10 Milos Raonic \u2014 and No. 14 David Goffin, citing stomach problems, became the 13th man to retire during a match because of injury or illness.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Serena Williams forges rally to preserve historic bid for Grand Slam", "title": "Serena Williams forges rally to preserve historic bid for Grand Slam", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/04/serena-williams-forges-rally-to-preserve-historic-bid-for-grand-slam/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-04T21:30:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T21:30:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdda3\"", "article_summary": "Eight times this season at major tournaments, Williams has dropped the opening set.\n1-ranked Williams is trying to become the first tennis player since Steffi Graf in 1988 to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same season.\nNEW YORK \u2014 Can\u2019t count out Serena Williams, no matter how big the deficit, no matter how off-target her strokes, no matter how much the pressure might be mounting as she bids for a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n14 David Goffin, citing stomach problems, became the 13th man to retire during a match because of injury or illness.\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to live on the edge,\u201d Williams said with a big smile."}
