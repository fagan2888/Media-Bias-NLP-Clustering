Fox News reported on March 5, 2014, that polls have a majority of Americans stating Obama's administration has pretty much failed at creating jobs, improving health care, growing the economy, and lowering the unemployment rate.\n\nThe Fox News poll on Wednesday reported that only 38 percent (fewer than four out of every 10) actually approves of Obama's administration. A full 54 percent of Americans disapprove.\n\nSEE: Mom tries to kill kids: Pregnant woman drives van into ocean, spoke of demons\n\nLast year, the lowest that Obama's approval rating had been before this poll was back in Nov. of 2013 when it dropped and was 40-55 percent. In Feb. of 2013, 54 percent disapproved and 42 percent approved.\n\nOther important numbers:\n\nDemocrats: 71 percent approve (record low of 69 percent in Sept. 2013)\n\nRepublicans: Five percent (new low)\n\nIndependents: 28 percent approve\n\nSEE: Obamacare surcharge: FL restaurants add Affordable Care Act charge to receipts\n\nFifty-nine percent of Americans believe that the White House has virtually failed at creating new jobs and getting the unemployment rate down. That number is actually up from about a year and a half ago.\n\nOn the subject of health care, only 36 percent of Americans believe that the administration has improved it during Obama's tenure in office. 57 percent believe it has failed to do that.\n\nJust since 2012, the percentage of Democrats who feel the country is better off now, is down from 81 percent to 57 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama's approval rating has hit an all-time record low, according to new polls taken this week.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/polls-show-president-obama-s-approval-rating-hits-all-time-low", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/f2/33/f233caba79ce7e68f06643cec924091c.jpg?itok=CgKB7vjm", "type": "article", "title": "Polls show President Obama's approval rating hits all-time low"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama's approval rating has hit an all-time record low, according to new polls taken this week.", "creator": "@Doctor_Disney", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/f2/33/f233caba79ce7e68f06643cec924091c.jpg?itok=CgKB7vjm", "title": "Polls show President Obama's approval rating hits all-time low", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2014-03-05T16:37:09-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Top News, Obama approval rating, Barack Obama, Obama 2014 approval rating, Obama low approval rating", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-05T16:37"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f99\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama's approval rating has hit an all-time record low, according to new polls taken this week.\nThe Fox News poll on Wednesday reported that only 38 percent (fewer than four out of every 10) actually approves of Obama's administration.\nOn the subject of health care, only 36 percent of Americans believe that the administration has improved it during Obama's tenure in office.\nFox News reported on March 5, 2014, that polls have a majority of Americans stating Obama's administration has pretty much failed at creating jobs, improving health care, growing the economy, and lowering the unemployment rate.\nJust since 2012, the percentage of Democrats who feel the country is better off now, is down from 81 percent to 57 percent."}
