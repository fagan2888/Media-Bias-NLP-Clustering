I can\u2019t imagine Mount Vernon without a hospital.\u201d\n\nThe Kansas-based National Rural Health Association, which represents around 2,000 small hospitals throughout the country and other rural care providers, says that 48 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, the majority in Southern states, and 283 others are in trouble. In Texas along, 10 have changed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf there was one particular policy causing the trouble, it would be easy to understand,\u201d said health economist Mark Holmes, from the University of North Carolina, whose rural health research program studies national trends in rural health care. \u201cBut there are a lot of things going on.\u201d\n\nExperts and practitioners cite declining federal reimbursements for hospitals under the Affordable Care Act as the principal reason for the recent closures. Besides cutting back on Medicare, the law reduced payments to hospitals for the uninsured, a decision based on the assumption that states would expand their Medicaid programs. However, almost two dozen states have refused to do so. In addition, other Medicare cuts caused by a budget disagreement in Congress have also hurt hospitals\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nBut rural hospitals also suffer from multiple endemic disadvantages that drive down profit margins and make it virtually impossible to achieve economies of scale.\n\nThese include declining populations; disproportionate numbers of elderly and uninsured patients; the frequent need to pay doctors better than top dollar to get them to work in the hinterlands; the cost of expensive equipment that is necessary but frequently underused; the inability to provide lucrative specialty services and treatments; and an emphasis on emergency and urgent care, chronic money-losers.\n\n\u2018Another Disaster\u2019\n\nRural health care experts caution that national and state officials need to address the problems for rural hospitals or they could face a repeat of the catastrophic closings that followed changes in the Medicare payment system 30 years ago. That 1983 change, called the \u201cprospective payment system,\u201d established fixed reimbursements for care instead of payments based on a hospital\u2019s reported costs. That change rewarded large, efficient providers, but 440 small hospitals closed before the system was adjusted in 1997 to help them. Those adjustments created the designation of critical access hospitals for some small, isolated facilities, which are exempted from the fixed payment system.\n\n\u201cAnd now, beginning in 2010, we\u2019ve had another series of cuts that are all combining to create another expansion of closures just like we saw in the \u201890s,\u201d said Brock Slabach, senior vice president of the Rural Health Association. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wake up with another disaster.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe current surge in closures means federal officials need to come up with new legislation to halt the recent cuts to small hospitals in order to \u201cbuy time\u201d to figure out how rural hospitals should effectively operate in the future, said the association\u2019s chief lobbyist, Maggie Elehwany. \u201cIt is important to stop the bleeding right now.\u201d\n\nIn Mount Vernon, a town of 2,678 people nestled in grassland and dairy country about two hours east of Dallas, family practitioner Jean Latortue has taken out a lease on the now-vacant hospital building to convert it into an outpatient and urgent care clinic at his own expense. Reopening may be a risky move, he acknowledged, but the need is there.\n\n\u201cThe community went into panic mode,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured I had to step up.\u201d\n\nThe non-profit ETMC Regional Healthcare System, based in Tyler, Texas, closed the Mount Vernon hospital and two others of its then-12 rural hospital affiliates because it could no longer sustain operating losses that had persisted for five years.\n\n\u201cThere was no ill will,\u201d Franklin County Judge Scott Lee said in an interview from his Mount Vernon office. \u201cThey were losing money. We had a good working relationship for years, and they had a business decision to make.\u201d\n\nMount Vernon\u2019s Issues\n\nPerry Henderson, senior vice president of affiliate hospitals for ETMC, a major health care provider in East Texas, noted that rural hospitals have many uninsured patients, and Medicare accounts for \u201c60 to 70 percent of the business,\u201d while in \u201cDallas or Houston it\u2019s a fraction of that.\u201d\n\nMount Vernon, with lakefront properties that are attractive to retirees, has its share of elderly patients. Henderson also noted that many rural hospitals also have to deal with large numbers of agricultural accidents. Farming, another Mount Vernon staple, is one of the country\u2019s most dangerous occupations. Finally, he added, country roads bring large numbers of traffic accidents. When there\u2019s no hospital, emergencies mean longer trips to get help.\n\nHenderson and other experts cite three reasons for the rash of closures nationally. Sequestration, the across-the-board federal budget cut that arose out of the legislative impasse between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans, has resulted in a 2 percent reduction in Medicare reimbursements since 2013.\n\n\u201cIf Medicare is 50 percent of your revenue and you lose two points,\u201d North Carolina\u2019s Holmes said, \u201cit can be a killer.\u201d\n\nRural hospitals took a second hit from the federal health law\u2019s reductions in \u201cdisproportionate share hospital\u201d payments to hospitals with large numbers of indigent and uninsured patients. Federal officials made the cuts assuming that the law would assure that more patients had insurance.\n\n\n\nIt hasn\u2019t worked well in rural areas, the Rural Health Association\u2019s Elehwany said, because annual deductibles for the new insurance plans, which come out of consumers\u2019 pockets, \u201care running between $2,500 and $5,000,\u201d and people can\u2019t pay them.\n\nAnd in communities such as Mount Vernon, this problem is exacerbated because Texas, along with 22 other states, has refused to expand Medicaid, a key provision of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big deal,\u201d ETMC\u2019s Henderson said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we had the hurt.\u201d\n\nLatortue, who came to Mount Vernon as an ETMC hospital doctor in 2008, appears undaunted by the challenges of reinventing the hospital, which was treating an average of eight inpatients a week when it closed. Still, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very busy, and patients need to be seen\u2014we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nHe intends to provide both outpatient services, including lab work, at the new clinic, and emergency care, stabilizing patients until they can be transferred to the Titus Regional Medical Center in Mt. Pleasant, 16 miles away, or to a smaller facility in Winfield, eight miles away. He also plans a wellness clinic to treat obesity and will offer Botox and laser cosmetic services. A cardiologist and a gastroenterologist will make weekly visits, and he is also looking for an ob-gyn.\n\nLatortue got a favorable lease from the town of Mount Vernon and inherited an X-ray machine and other equipment from ETMC, but he still took out $150,000 in loans for remodeling and needs another $60,000 to $70,000 for equipment.\n\nStill, none of this will replace the hospital, and his patients know it. \u201cI live right behind the building,\u201d said Mary Hunter, a very fit grandmother of 73. \u201cI\u2019ve had very good health until my blood pressure spiked last week,\u201d she said. \u201cWe retired in 2006 and moved here, partly because of the hospital. And now it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"We all need a small amount of sodium to keep our bodies working properly \u2013 but too much is linked to heart disease.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "An estimated 48 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, the majority in Southern states, and 283 others are in trouble.", "zone": "hospitalsoftomorrow/articles", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "An estimated 48 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, the majority in Southern states, and 283 others are in trouble.", "title": "Rural Hospitals, One of the Cornerstones of Small Town Life, Face Increasing Pressure", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/17/rural-hospitals-one-of-the-cornerstones-of-small-town-life-face-increasing-pressure", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/0b/1c/6bdc18624236bd3e4dd7234f9d18/150317-hospital-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An estimated 48 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, the majority in Southern states, and 283 others are in trouble.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Rural Hospitals, One of the Cornerstones of Small Town Life, Face Increasing Pressure - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2015-03-17", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/22cccc1/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F0b%2F1c%2F6bdc18624236bd3e4dd7234f9d18%2Fresizes%2F500%2F150317-hospital-editorial.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "hospitals,Hospital of Tomorrow,health care,Pulse,public health,Medicaid,Affordable Care Act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2015-03-17"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z7qiuh", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "rural hospitals, hospitals, hospital of tomorrow, kaiser, National Rural Health Association, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, expansion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ead\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf there was one particular policy causing the trouble, it would be easy to understand,\u201d said health economist Mark Holmes, from the University of North Carolina, whose rural health research program studies national trends in rural health care.\nThat change rewarded large, efficient providers, but 440 small hospitals closed before the system was adjusted in 1997 to help them.\nBut rural hospitals also suffer from multiple endemic disadvantages that drive down profit margins and make it virtually impossible to achieve economies of scale.\nHenderson also noted that many rural hospitals also have to deal with large numbers of agricultural accidents.\n\u201cThere was no ill will,\u201d Franklin County Judge Scott Lee said in an interview from his Mount Vernon office."}
