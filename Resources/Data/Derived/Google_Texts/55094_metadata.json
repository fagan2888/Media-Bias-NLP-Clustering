And the arrest was impeccably achieved.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Only two days earlier, Guzman was surrounded by troops at his ex-wife\u2019s home in the western city of Culiacan, capital of the Mexican state of Sinaloa. He got away through a trapdoor under the bathtub, and managed to escape through a network of tunnels and the city\u2019s sewer system.\n\nU.S. drug agents and Mexican troops, acting on wiretaps and other information, pursued him 135 miles South, to this luxury condominium in the seaside resort of Mazatlan. There, just before dawn Saturday, they stormed into Guzman\u2019s room and captured him without firing a shot.\n\nIn Washington today, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney praised the joint effort.\n\nJAY CARNEY, White House Press Secretary: This is a significant achievement in our shared fight against transnational organized crime, violence, and drug trafficking. The U.S. and Mexico have a strong security partnership and we will continue to support Mexico in its efforts to ensure that cartel leaders are put out of business.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Guzman was formally charged Sunday with drug trafficking in Mexico. He faces indictments in the U.S. as well, and federal prosecutors in New York and Chicago already are asking for his extradition.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time behind bars for the 56-year-old Guzman, nicknamed El Chapo, or Shorty. In 2001, he escaped from a high-security Mexican prison before he was halfway through a 20-year sentence for drug trafficking and murder.\n\nOver the years, he built the Sinaloa cartel into Mexico\u2019s most powerful drug operation, wiping out rivals in a reign of brutality that killed tens of thousands of people. In Mexico City this weekend, word of his capture brought both hope and skepticism.\n\nFRANCISCO ALCOCER, (through interpreter): I think that it\u2019s something very good. I think it\u2019s an excellent achievement from this government that is giving us results. I think not just for Mexico, but for many countries, it\u2019s an important arrest.\n\nRAMON TORRES, (through interpreter): It\u2019s very difficult. The cartel is quite organized and has a presence in many states in the country, so it\u2019s difficult to say that just with the capture of El Chapo the cartel will fall apart.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN: Guzman now joins Miguel Angel Trevino, who was head of the Zetas, a rival cartel, and was arrested last summer. Those are major gets for President Enrique Pena Nieto, who had said he\u2019d rebalance the all-out war against cartels with a new emphasis on the economy and education.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, the head of the powerful and brutal Sinaloa drug cartel who escaped from jail in 2001, faces charges in both Mexico and the U.S.", "pubdate": 20140224, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, the head of the powerful and brutal Sinaloa drug cartel who escaped from jail in 2001, faces charges in both Mexico and the U.S.", "title": "Mexicans express hope and skepticism about \u2018El Chapo\u2019 arrest", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/elchapo1a.jpeg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/mexicans-express-hope-skepticism-for-el-chapo-arrest/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, the head of the powerful and brutal Sinaloa drug cartel who escaped from jail in 2001, faces charges in both Mexico and the U.S.", "title": "Mexicans express hope and skepticism about \u2018El Chapo\u2019 arrest", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/elchapo1a.jpeg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "mexico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "crime, drug trade, mexico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc651\"", "article_summary": "JEFFREY BROWN: Mexican marines led Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman away in handcuffs on Saturday, thus ending a 13-year hunt for one of the world\u2019s most dangerous men.\nJAY CARNEY, White House Press Secretary: This is a significant achievement in our shared fight against transnational organized crime, violence, and drug trafficking.\nJEFFREY BROWN: Guzman now joins Miguel Angel Trevino, who was head of the Zetas, a rival cartel, and was arrested last summer.\nIt\u2019s not the first time behind bars for the 56-year-old Guzman, nicknamed El Chapo, or Shorty.\nJEFFREY BROWN: Guzman was formally charged Sunday with drug trafficking in Mexico."}
