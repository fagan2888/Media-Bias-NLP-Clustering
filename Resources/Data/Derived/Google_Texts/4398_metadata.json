It first filed in March 2013, resulting in a process that cut its $1.5 billion in debt by more than 80 percent. It also resulted in investors exchanging debt for equity in the property.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Thursday that Revel warned its employees that it will shut down this summer if it a buyer can\u2019t be found for the property. The media outlet cited a letter to the staff that said employees could be terminated as soon as Aug. 18.\n\n\"If Revel is unable to complete such a sale promptly, Revel expects to close its entire facility,\" the letters read, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\n\nIn its news release Thursday, the company said it had reached an agreement to obtain a $125 million debtor-in-possession loan, arranged by one of its existing lenders, which is intended to provide Revel with liquidity necessary to operate its business while it pursues a sale through the Chapter 11 process.\n\n\n\nThe towering $2.4 billion casino hotel \u2014 which opened to great fanfare in 2012 \u2014has fallen far short of changing the fortunes of Atlantic City as stakeholders had hoped. The property has lost more than $260 million since opening, according to data from state regulators.\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nEntrepreneur says N.J. is good for business, but has room to improve\n\nMorristown property sold in reported $52 million deal\n\nNew Jerseyans paying more than national average for Affordable Care Act plans", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "The owners of Revel Casino Hotel have filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in 15 months, with an eye toward finding a buyer for the failing Atlantic City resort.", "title": "Revel Casino owners file for bankruptcy again | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20140619/NJBIZ01/140619656/revel-casino-owners-file-for-bankruptcy-again", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140619/NJBIZ01/140619656/AR/0/AR-140619656.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "The owners of Revel Casino Hotel have filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in 15 months, with an eye toward finding a buyer for the failing Atlantic City resort.", "title": "Revel Casino owners file for bankruptcy again | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140619/NJBIZ01/140619656/AR/0/AR-140619656.jpg"}, "creator": "@joshburdnj", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The owners of Revel Casino Hotel have filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in 15 months, with an eye toward finding a buyer for the failing Atlantic City resort.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fd0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cToday\u2019s announcement follows an extensive strategic review,\u201d Scott Kreeger, president and CEO of Revel Casino Hotel, said in a news release.\nThe owners of Revel Casino Hotel have filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in 15 months, with an eye toward finding a buyer for the failing Atlantic City resort.\nThe towering $2.4 billion casino hotel \u2014 which opened to great fanfare in 2012 \u2014has fallen far short of changing the fortunes of Atlantic City as stakeholders had hoped.\n\"If Revel is unable to complete such a sale promptly, Revel expects to close its entire facility,\" the letters read, according to the Associated Press.\nThe property has lost more than $260 million since opening, according to data from state regulators."}
