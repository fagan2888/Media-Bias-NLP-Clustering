The ongoing survey, based on daily interviews with 500 people, has been used by media, social scientists, and administration officials to track the law's impact.\n\n\n\nRelease of the latest installment comes after the Republican-led Congress voted to send legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act to Obama's desk. The president is certain to veto it, but opponents say that will only help their strategy of keeping \u201cObamacare\u201d alive as a political issue in the presidential election.\n\n\n\nThe sharp drop in the uninsured rate seen in 2014 - the first year of the law's major coverage expansion - now has leveled off, Gallup said in its analysis of the latest findings.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis validates concerns that similarly large reductions may not be possible in the future because the remaining uninsured are harder to reach or less inclined to become insured,\u201d the analysis said. \u201cFuture reductions will likely require significant outreach and expanded programs targeting those who have not yet taken advantage.\u201d\n\nThe survey period included the first two months of the health law's 2016 open enrollment season, which ends January 31. That covered the first big sign-up deadline, which was December 15 for those wanting coverage effective at the start of the year.\n\nGallup-Healthways said it expects results for the first three months of 2016 to show another decline in the uninsured rate. How big remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nIntensifying the debate\n\n\u201cA strong open enrollment period would allow the Obama administration to go out on a high note,\u201d said Larry Levitt, who follows the health overhaul for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cWeak enrollment could intensify the debate over the Affordable Care Act, particularly as the general election approaches,\u201d he said.\n\nThere will continue to be close scrutiny of the uninsured numbers and reports of premium increases for 2017, which will start to trickle out this summer,\u201d added Levitt. \u201cI believe the health law has crossed the threshold of sustainability, but its future success depends on growing enrollment.\u201d\n\nThe uninsured rate for adults stood at 17.1 percent in the last three months of 2013, as the law's major coverage expansion got underway, according to the survey. The drop of 5.2 percentage points by the end of last year translates to nearly 13 million adults gaining coverage.\n\n\n\nBut 2015 was a lackluster year. According to the survey, the uninsured rate dipped to 11.4 percent in the period from April-June, then edged up again the rest of the year. It was the first such reversal noted by the survey since the law's big coverage expansion began.\n\n\n\nThe health law has added coverage in two major ways, bringing the nation's uninsured rate to a historic low. Online insurance markets like HealthCare.gov offer taxpayer-subsidized private plans to people who don't have coverage on the job. And states can opt for a Medicaid expansion aimed at low-income adults with no children living at home. That's happened in 30 states, plus Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nOpposition to the law has blocked Medicaid expansion elsewhere. If major states like Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia were to expand their programs, the uninsured rate would start coming down again. Louisiana and Alabama are considering Medicaid expansion.\n\n\n\nMinorities biggest beneficiaries\n\nSince 2013, the Gallup-Healthways survey has found gains in health insurance coverage among all major demographic groups except seniors, who were already covered by Medicare. The biggest progress has come among low-income people, Hispanics, and African Americans.\n\nThe Obama administration had no direct response to the survey findings. Spokesman Aaron Albright noted that the law \u201chas led to millions of Americans getting access to quality and affordable health coverage.\u201d\n\nThe survey results were based on landline and cellphone interviews conducted from October 1 to December 31 with a random sample of 42,998 adults ages 18 and older. For results based on the total sample, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, Health, United States, health care, Obamacare, uninsured, affordable care act", "title": "Survey: US Progress on Health Insurance Stalled in 2015", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "Number of uninsured adults was virtually stagnant last year, despite Obama administration\u2019s health care law, data shows", "title": "Survey: US Progress on Health Insurance Stalled in 2015", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/obamacare-survey/3135270.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/7FFE7752-7E3A-4840-AEF9-1D9850D2F4FE_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/7FFE7752-7E3A-4840-AEF9-1D9850D2F4FE_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "Author": "Associated Press", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
