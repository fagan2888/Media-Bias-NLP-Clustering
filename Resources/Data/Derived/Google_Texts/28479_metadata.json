For instance, a woman who has breast-conserving surgery typically has radiation treatment every day for six weeks to kill remaining cancer cells. Lower-income women may have a hard time doing that, Gomez says. \u201cThe only option available to them may be unilateral mastectomy.\u201d\n\nAnd if women having single mastectomies tended to be poorer and minority, women who chose bilateral mastectomies tended to be younger, white and better off.\n\nOverall, the double mastectomy rate had increased from 2 percent to 12 percent between 1998 and 2011. But for women under 40, the double mastectomy rate had increased to 33 percent, even though most of them had stage zero or stage one cancer, a very early, very treatable form.\n\nThose women also were more likely to be treated at an academic medical center, which, along with their youth and low-risk cancer, should make it more likely that they would survive. So why are they not doing any better than women who have lumpectomies and radiation?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we know,\u201d Gomez told NPR. \u201cThis is complete conjecture at this point. A bilateral mastectomy is major surgery, and just like any major surgery there are complications, side effects. So any advantage that comes from lowering your risk of cancer in the [healthy] breast could be offset by the fact that you\u2019re having major surgery.\u201d\n\nDoing a randomized trial that directly compares the various treatments could help figure that out, but Gomez and others say it would be pretty much impossible to recruit lots of women in a trial that wouldn\u2019t give them a choice of treatments.\n\n\u201cGiven the vast size of our data set, I think these findings may be as good as it\u2019s going to get in terms of giving us clues,\u201d Gomez says.\n\nDoctors have been increasingly concerned that women are choosing bilateral mastectomy in the mistaken belief that it eliminates their future risk of cancer.\n\nDouble mastectomies made headlines in 2013, when actress Angelina Jolie had a prophylactic double mastectomy after being diagnosed with a BRCA gene mutation that vastly increases cancer risk. (Her case was different from this study which exclusively focused on women with breast cancer. Jolie did not have breast cancer, but was at extremely high risk of the disease.)\n\nYet only 5 percent of cancers are caused by BRCA mutations. Most of the women who are choosing double mastectomies haven\u2019t been diagnosed with a BRCA mutation.\n\n\u201cBilateral mastectomy surgery maximally reduces the risk of a breast cancer patient developing a completely new breast cancer, but it does not affect the potentially life-threatening risk of the known first cancer damaging other organs in the body through metatastic spread,\u201d Dr. Lisa Newman, director of the University of Michigan Breast Care Center, told NPR via email. She wrote an editorial in Tuesday\u2019s JAMA on the issue.\n\nAnd since tiny bits of breast tissue can remain in the chest after surgery, a woman who has had a double mastectomy can still get breast cancer again.\n\nStill, both Gomez and Stanford\u2019s Kurian stressed that the study should not be seen as a treatment recommendation.\n\nGomez hopes that these new numbers will shift the focus to better understanding women\u2019s decision-making process, and to educating physicians on better communications.\n\nDoctors can\u2019t presume to dictate which choice will give a woman the best quality of life, Newman says. But doctors do have to counsel patients to have realistic expectations about their treatment choices.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to understand he factors that might be motivating this trend, since there is no definitive survival advantage that has been demonstrated,\u201d Newman adds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The study compared survival rates of double mastectomy against more conservative options.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Stanford Study: Double Mastectomies Don't Increase Breast Cancer Survival Rate\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/09\\/02\\/stanford-study-double-mastectomies-dont-increase-breast-cancer-survival-rate\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-02 15:36:11\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-03 14:34:36\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":21128,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Breast Cancer\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/09\\/78022737-e1409697092845.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The study compared survival rates of double mastectomy against more conservative options.", "title": "Stanford Study: Double Mastectomies Don\u2019t Increase Breast Cancer Survival Rate", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/09/02/stanford-study-double-mastectomies-dont-increase-breast-cancer-survival-rate/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/09/78022737-640x591.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "breast cancer,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb59e\"", "article_summary": "Double mastectomies made headlines in 2013, when actress Angelina Jolie had a prophylactic double mastectomy after being diagnosed with a BRCA gene mutation that vastly increases cancer risk.\nOverall, the double mastectomy rate had increased from 2 percent to 12 percent between 1998 and 2011.\n(Her case was different from this study which exclusively focused on women with breast cancer.\nDoctors worry that women choose double mastectomy out of the mistaken belief that it eliminates their future risk of cancer.\nAnd since tiny bits of breast tissue can remain in the chest after surgery, a woman who has had a double mastectomy can still get breast cancer again."}
