Harrisburg, SD

The annual South Dakota Giant Pumpkin Contest in Harrisburg brings in pumpkin growers from across KELOLAND ever year to show case their mammoth-sized pumpkins.

But this season was a bit different. Poor weather conditions and disease hit the South Dakota large pumpkin crop hard. Across the border in Iowa however the season was better which left this contest up to one lone giant from the east.

"I read that is was a bad year in South Dakota, so I though well I'll just come with this one here, which most years would be in last place," Warren Newborg said.

The still very large pumpkin may have been smaller than past giant winners but it takes home the trophy weighing in at four hundred pounds.
