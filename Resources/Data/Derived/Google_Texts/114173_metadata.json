These computers will help solve problems, such has how to respond to a missile traveling at six times the speed of sound.\n\nWork said the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is one of these types of machines. \u201cThe F-35 is not a fighter plane,\u201d Work said. \u201cIt is a flying sensor computer that sucks in an enormous amount of data, correlates it, analyzes it and displays it to the pilot on his helmet.\u201d\n\nEven though the F-35 has been criticized for not being able to maneuver as well as older fighter jets and has had well-noted problems in its development, the aircraft\u2019s high-tech computers and sensors, Work said, will allow it to outperform its predecessors.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely confident that F-35 will be a war winner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because it is using the machine to make the human make better decisions.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Congress Gave the Pentagon a $5 Billion Haircut\n\nWork also pointed to \u201cassisted human operations\u201d and wearable electronics, which give troops access to combat apps as another game changer. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, 10 years from now, if the first person through a breach isn\u2019t a fricken robot, shame on us.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter announced in August the Pentagon would invest in electronic components that can bend.\n\nHumans and machines are already working together on the battlefield within the U.S.\u201cglobal counterterrorism network,\u201d which uses people, unmanned drones, computers and special operations forces to hunt militants, Work said.\n\nUnlike the previous offsets, the fielding of tactical nuclear weapons and precision-guided bombs and missiles, which deterred war and gave the American military in some cases four decades of advantages over adversaries, this new technology probably won\u2019t provide an edge that long, Work said.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Paid Millions to Pro Sports Teams for Military Tributes\n\nRussia is challenging \u201cour capacity to innovate and change,\u201d said Carter, during a luncheon address to the audience largely made up of lawmakers, industry, and Pentagon officials.\n\n\u201c[I]n the face of Russia\u2019s provocations and China\u2019s rise, we must embrace innovative approaches to protect the United States and strengthen that international order,\u201d Carter said.\n\nRussia\u2019s saber rattling has prompted a major shift of late in way the American military is looking at a future. Top uniformed officials have said nuclear-armed Moscow poses the greatest threat to the U.S., not Islamic State militants, who despite an international airstrike campaign, still hold large portions of land in Iraq and Syria and have a presence in other countries across Northern Africa.\n\n\u201cWe do not seek to make Russia an enemy,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut make no mistake; the United States will defend our interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords us all. We\u2019re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russia\u2019s aggression, and to help reduce the vulnerability of allies and partners.\u201d\n\nRelated: Despite the Sweet Budget Deal, the Pentagon Wants More Money\n\nAs such, the U.S. military is \u201cadapting our operational posture and contingency plans as we \u2013 on our own and with allies \u2013 work to deter Russia\u2019s aggression, and to help reduce the vulnerability of allies and partners,\u201d Carter said.\n\nThe Pentagon is \u201cmaking a number of moves in response, many but not all of which I can describe in this forum,\u201d Carter said alluding to classified battle plans and weapon projects. It is also \u201cupdating and advancing our operational plans for deterrence and defense.\u201dUpgrading America\u2019s nuclear weapons is one of these areas, he said. The Pentagon plans to buy a new stealth bomber and a replacement for the Ohio-Class submarine over the next decade, both of which are being designed to carry and launch nuclear weapons.\n\nWashington cut off nearly all but top-level dialog with Moscow after Russian forces invaded Ukraine last year. Relations between the two nuclear powers grew even more strained in recent months when Russia sent troops and weapons to Syria to back the embattled government of President Bashar al Assad. But Carter did not rule out future cooperation with Russia, pointing to Moscow\u2019s part in helping to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and talks with North Korea.\n\n\u201cIt is possible \u2026 Russia may play a constructive role in resolving the Syrian civil war,\u201d Carter said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.
