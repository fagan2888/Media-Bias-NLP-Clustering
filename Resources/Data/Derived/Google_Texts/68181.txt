Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Obama, said Sunday that first lady Michelle Obama will never run for office.

“I am absolutely 100 percent sure that will never happen,” she said definitively on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

When asked if she had any plans to run for office, Ms. Jarrett said it was “unlikely,” but not a definite no.

She said she agrees with the first lady that the country is ready for its first female president, but said its “premature” to speculate on Hillary Clinton filling that role since she hasn’t announced whether or not she’ll run in 2016.
