When someone gives you that opportunity, you have to take it and work as hard as you can and earn it back.\u201d\n\nWilson logged a team-high 25:42 of ice time in Thursday\u2019s preseason game at Montreal and was one of two defensemen to also play against the Canadiens on Friday in Quebec City at Colis\u00e9e Pepsi, the previous home of the Avs franchise formerly known as the Nordiques. Former Quebec/Colorado star center Joe Sakic, the Avs\u2019 executive vice president and general manager, was given a rousing standing ovation when introduced during the first television timeout. The Canadiens went on to win 3-2, scoring three of the last four goals to drop the Avs to 0-4 in the preseason, including two simultaneous split-squad games against the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nBut it began as a special night for everyone affiliated with the Avs, and Wilson again played well on short rest.\n\nIn both games in Quebec, Wilson, 27, looked like the player the Avs signed to a three-year, $6.75 million contract in 2012, not the one who was demoted to the American Hockey League last season for a conditioning assignment.\n\nWilson played just 28 games last season and only 12 in the previous lockout-shortened season, and Roy said a year ago his injuries and demotions stemmed from not being prepared physically. That\u2019s not uncommon for a gritty undrafted player after receiving a big contract and feeling he had won the lottery. Wilson enters this season in a contract year and surely won\u2019t be re-signed by the Avs if he fails to return to form.\n\nIs he the Ryan Wilson of old, the big-hitting, middleweight enforcer who plays a clean defensive game and can chip in offensively?\n\n\u201cI think it shows how I\u2019m playing,\u201d he said. \u201cHaven\u2019t felt this good in two, maybe three years.\u201d\n\nIn Montreal\u2019s 3-2 overtime win Thursday, Wilson was plus-2, had an assist, clanged a shot off the crossbar and had a combined 6:05 on the power play and penalty kill. Nick Holden, who did not play Friday, was the only Avs defenseman to play more than Wilson on special teams.\n\nWilson was paired with Stefan Elliott in Friday\u2019s rematch with the Canadiens, and Colorado generally loaded up with a big-league lineup with 30-something forwards Jarome Iginla, Alex Tanguay and Daniel Briere joining the series along with four-of-six defensemen.\n\nAlso, No. 1 goalie Semyon Varlamov started and saw his first action of the preseason.\n\nDefenseman Erik Johnson scored the game\u2019s opening goal, and it was 1-1 after two periods.\n\nLeft wing Ryan O\u2019Reilly scored on the power play early in the third to give the Avs a 2-1 lead, but Jiri Sekac tied it with a wraparound goal against Varlamov, who was caught in front of the opposite post.\n\nBrandon Prust beat Varlamov on a semi-breakaway after collecting a three-line area pass and gaining a step on Johnson.\n\nThe Avs play Sunday at home against the Calgary Flames before visiting the Flames on Tuesday.\n\nThe Avs also play the Los Angeles Kings twice before their Oct. 9 season opener at Minnesota.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ryan Wilson\u2019s return to Colorado Avalanche taking shape", "title": "Ryan Wilson\u2019s return to Colorado Avalanche taking shape", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/26/ryan-wilsons-return-to-colorado-avalanche-taking-shape/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926_112142_avs-1.jpg", "height": 541}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926_112142_avs-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T21:30:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:03:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f5f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAt the end of last year Patrick challenged me to get back healthy, come ready and be hungry for the season,\u201d Wilson said.\nThe Avs play Sunday at home against the Calgary Flames before visiting the Flames on Tuesday.\nNick Holden, who did not play Friday, was the only Avs defenseman to play more than Wilson on special teams.\nBut it began as a special night for everyone affiliated with the Avs, and Wilson again played well on short rest.\nWilson enters this season in a contract year and surely won\u2019t be re-signed by the Avs if he fails to return to form."}
