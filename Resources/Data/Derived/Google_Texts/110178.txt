Rock concert ettiquette 101: Don’t throw things at the musicians. It is not nice, and it interrupts their set. But if you absolutely must throw something, make sure that it is light and aerodynamic, like a frisbee, and make sure that the drummer is skillful enough to catch it while he is performing.

On Friday, Weezer’s Patrick Wilson validated one overactive fan at a concert in St. Augustine, Florida, when he caught a frisbee with his drumstick and then held it in his mouth, uninterrupted:

One more reason @patrick_wilson is my favorite drummer in the world:) @lhammond94 He caught the frisbee!!! #weezer http://t.co/e3s69bAzQS — Rivers Cuomo (@RiversCuomo) June 7, 2014

If only Macaulay Culkin had reflexes like that.
