Initially, veterinarians feared a large portion of Caitlyn's tongue would have to be removed, leading her to be severely disfigured or to concerns of potentially life-threatening complications.\n\nThe animal abuse case has garnered national attention since photos of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, or Staffie, mix went viral. The Humane Society of the United States is offering a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for taping the dog's muzzle shut. That money is in addition to the Charleston Animal Society's $1,000 reward.\n\n\"Caitlyn continues to recover from her ordeal but she is still hospitalized,\" Charleston Animal Society spokesperson Kay Hyman said in a statement. \"She has graduated from intravenous fluids and antibiotics to normal food and oral medications.\"\n\nThe dog has been receiving treatment in a hyperbaric chamber and cold laser therapy to heal damaged tissue in her mouth, she said.\n\nVeterinarians also performed a small surgical procedure on her lip Sunday. So far, there is no procedure planned for her tongue.\n\n\"We are still waiting to see how well her body will heal on its own,\" Hyman said.\n\nWhen she was found, veterinarians estimate her muzzle had been taped for up to 48 hours. Witnesses said her tongue had been trapped between her teeth, cutting off circulation.\n\nHyman credits the staff of Veterinary Specialty Care in Mount Pleasant, including Drs. Kelli Klein and Henri Bianucci, who have have been treating Caitlyn.\n\nNorth Charleston police continue to investigate the case.\n\nAnyone with information about the case should call Aldwin Roman with the Charleston Animal Society at (843) 329-1545 or Crime Stoppers at (843) 554-1111.\n\nCopyright 2015 WCSC.
