Venezuelans have resorted to using home remedies, procuring veterinary medications, and looking for black market drugs on social media as government-imposed price controls and rations have led to a scarcity of medicine so severe, 85 percent of the nation’s pharmacies are in danger of shutting down.

“85 percent of the nation’s pharmacies will go bankrupt,” asserted Freddy Ceballos, the head of the Pharmaceutical Federation of Venezuela, on Monday. “The problem is not only drug shortages, but the Venezuelan government fixed price laws froze prices in a range where the commercial chain loses,” he explained. These price fixes make it economically unviable to buy or sell drugs across the country, causing regional shortages. Ceballos is demanding a government response to what he calls a “humanitarian crisis.” The price fixes also affect the production of drugs, which has almost completely halted.

The result is a pharmaceutical market where Venezuelans are seeking remedies for their health problems by any means necessary. The PanAmerican Post notes that many have resorted to social media, Twitter in particular, to find sellers for the particular drug they need to survive.

Pharmacists, meanwhile, have resorted to other medications. “We are using veterinary drugs… because the Venezuelan state does not give us money to produce [drugs for human use] here,” Ceballos told the Cuban independent publication 14 y medio
