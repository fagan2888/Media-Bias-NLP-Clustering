Burwell case goes their way at the Supreme Court this year, gutting the Affordable Care Act in much of the country and stripping millions of families of their health insurance. But there are a few GOP lawmakers who seem to appreciate the fact that a potential victory carries some risks for the party.\n\nThis includes Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last week warning that Republicans must begin preparing for the fallout associated with a high-court win.\n\nA day later, the GOP senator, who\u2019s up for re-election next year, did a radio interview with talk-show host Jay Weber about Johnson\u2019s concerns.\n\nJOHNSON: Unfortunately, President Obama\u2019s response to an adverse decision \u2026 would be really simple. Just a one-sentence bill allowing people\u2019s subsidies to flow to federal exchanges and/or offer the governors, \u2018Hey, we know you got those federal exchanges. Just sign the bottom line. We\u2019ll make those established by the state.\u2019 And of course, he\u2019ll have the ads all racked up with the individuals that have benefited from Obamacare on the backs of the American taxpayer. He\u2019ll have all those examples as well so\u2026 HOST: And the sad sack stories about who\u2019s dying from what and why they can\u2019t get their coverage. JOHNSON: Right.\n\nWell, no, actually it\u2019s wrong.\n\nJust at face value, hearing the Wisconsin Republican complain about \u201cindividuals\u201d who \u201chave benefited from Obamacare on the backs of the American taxpayer\u201d is almost amusing. In this case, he\u2019s referring to his fellow countrymen who want access to affordable medical care. Johnson is effectively whining about American taxpayers benefiting from the American health care system on the backs of American taxpayers.\n\nIt\u2019s an ontologically interesting sentence, but as a policy position, it\u2019s hard to take this seriously.\n\nBut taking a step further, Johnson didn\u2019t mind when conservatives had \u201cads all racked up\u201d with alleged \u201cObamacare victims.\u201d Rather, he\u2019s concerned now because a new round of ads may cause trouble for his party: millions of families may lose their health security because of a ridiculous Republican lawsuit endorsed by Republican justices on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe host and the senator seemed dismissive of \u201csad sack stories\u201d about Americans whose lives would be in danger because GOP officials took their coverage away, and Johnson is clearly mindful of the potential of a political backlash. But here\u2019s the detail to keep in mind: those \u201csad sack stories\u201d would be real. Americans, in the real world, far from courtrooms and cloakrooms, would suffer if their ACA benefits are taken away.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "As an elected policymaker, Johnson's focus should be on helping those whose security is at risk, not worrying about the political impact of \"sad sack stories.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ron-johnson-has-no-use-sad-sack-stories", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "As an elected policymaker, Johnson's focus should be on helping those whose security is at risk, not worrying about the political impact of \"sad sack stories.\"", "title": "Ron Johnson has no use for 'sad sack stories'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ron-johnson-has-no-use-sad-sack-stories", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/460977091.jpg?itok=ptRISeMr", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ron-johnson-has-no-use-sad-sack-stories", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/460977091.jpg?itok=HHvlT5Na", "height": 553}, "title": "Ron Johnson has no use for 'sad sack stories'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As an elected policymaker, Johnson's focus should be on helping those whose security is at risk, not worrying about the political impact of \"sad sack stories.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-20T10:00:34-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,health,health-care-reform,obamacare,republicans,ron-johnson,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Ron Johnson has no use for 'sad sack stories'", "published": 1, "date": "04/20/2015 10:00:34 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ron-johnson-has-no-use-sad-sack-stories"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "As an elected policymaker, Johnson's focus should be on helping those whose security is at risk, not worrying about the political impact of \"sad sack stories.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Ron Johnson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f81\"", "article_summary": "But here\u2019s the detail to keep in mind: those \u201csad sack stories\u201d would be real.\nJohnson is effectively whining about American taxpayers benefiting from the American health care system on the backs of American taxpayers.\nHe\u2019ll have all those examples as well so\u2026 HOST: And the sad sack stories about who\u2019s dying from what and why they can\u2019t get their coverage.\nThe host and the senator seemed dismissive of \u201csad sack stories\u201d about Americans whose lives would be in danger because GOP officials took their coverage away, and Johnson is clearly mindful of the potential of a political backlash.\nThis includes Sen.
