The .ski domain launched onto the Web last week, creating the Internet’s first domain space for snow sports.

The new top-level domain is a fresh start for athletes, ski makers, ski resorts and other snowsports companies seeking to carve their own corner of cyberspace.

Tom Kelly, vice president of communications for the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, said .ski soon will become “an essential part of a skier’s digital tool kit.”

“This will give our industry a place where people can create their own custom-made ski experience and help foster innovation,” said Kelly in a statement released by StartingDot, the Internet registry that developed the .ski plan.

In the first few days, snowsports fans claimed almost 5,000 .ski domains, including more than 1,000 ski resorts, ski brands and snowsports athletes.

Vail Resorts was one of those .ski homesteaders. But the resort behemoth isn’t retooling its Web addresses. All the company’s .ski domains — like vail.ski and breckenridge.ski — redirect back to the company’s longtime addresses.

“We purchased them as a proactive measure in the event that .ski may someday be how our guests connect with us digitally,” Vail Resorts spokeswoman Kelly Ladyga said.

Telluride also joined the growing coalition of early .ski claimants.

“We’re always trying to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to marketing and technology trends,” Telluride ski area’s vice president of sales and marketing Matt Windt said,

noting that the .ski domain redirects to the resort’s venerable address, tellurideskiresort.com. “We’ve seen tremendous growth in brand awareness around Telluride, and it’s important for our resort to own the Telluride brand. The .ski domain plays into that.”

Denver-based domain company Name.com is one of several sites where people can register their .ski website names.
