Resistance to the bill, however, is coming from both left and right.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed into law, in March 2010, the GOP has tried to chip away at it, securing victories in the House that then died in a Democrat-controlled Senate. Republicans took the Senate in November and thus control the 114th Congress. On Thursday, the Saving American Workers Act passed the House by 252 votes to 172.\n\nThe bill alters the definition of a full-time worker under the Affordable Care Act from someone who is eligible for employment-based health insurance through working 30 hours a week to one who works 40.\n\nOn Tuesday the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the president would likely veto the bill, which is on track to be the first Republican healthcare action to make it as far as his desk. Republican leadership has nonetheless been pushing the Senate version of the bill all week, attempting to recruit Democrats to the cause. But the bill is also being challenged by some conservatives.\n\nWith the veto threat looming, and a greater to challenge to the ACA rolling through the supreme court, some see a 30-hour definition of full-time work as a strange target. Some groups have gone so far as to say it is distracting from the push for a complete repeal of the law.\n\nJoseph Antos, a healthcare analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, told the New York Times that transitioning from a general anti-Obamacare campaign to creating legislation against Obamacare could be more difficult than anticipated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that\u2019s an easy change,\u201d said Antos, of the working-hours target. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing easy about changing any one sentence in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nMichael Cannon, of the conservative Cato Institute, wrote that the current bill would give employers an incentive to cut the hours of people who work 40 hours per week: \u201cThose other workers will complain that Republicans just made Obamacare worse for them.\n\n\u201cHow is that a political win, or strategically smart?\u201d\n\nSupporters of the new bill say the ACA\u2019s 30-hour definition of full-time work gives employers an incentive to cut worker hours, painting it as a challenge to American culture and identity.\n\n\u201cOne of the worst things we could do is destroy the 40-hour work week, which has been a part of American culture and life for a very long time,\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the sponsors of the Saving American Workers Act, representative Todd Young of Indiana, echoed such sentiments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply unfair to try and finance healthcare for some hardworking American people on the backs of other hardworking Americans through a reduction in hours and wages,\u201d Young said. \u201cThat\u2019s essentially what the Affordable Care Act has done.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate this week, Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Donnelly pushed their version of the bill, the Forty Hours Is Full Time Act.\n\n\u201cIn Indiana, common wisdom is that full time is a 40-hour work week,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cAnd the healthcare law should reflect that.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a Congressional Budget Office report on the new bill showed that if it becomes law, 1 million fewer people will have employment-based health coverage. The CBO also said that between 500,000 and 1 million people would subsequently need to rely on taxpayer-subsidized programs like Medicaid.\n\nThe employer mandate in question goes into effect this month. It requires companies with 50 or more full-time employees to provide health insurance to those employees. Under the ACA, a person must work 30 or more hours a week if they are to be considered full time.\n\nA February 2014 CBO report showed that \u201cthere is no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the ACA\u201d.\n\nThe campaign against the new Republican bill is supported by lobbies including the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the National Retail Federation, the International Franchise Association and the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nPresident Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010. The number of uninsured American has since declined by about 25%, according to multiple surveys.\n\n\u201cNo one is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act today,\u201d Republican representative Michael Burgess, a doctor, said on the House floor on Thursday.\n\n\u201cFor that, stay tuned.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "After House passes the Saving American Workers Act, some Republicans consider full-time worker mandate a strange target in fight against Obamacare", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Amanda Holpuch", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "After House passes the Saving American Workers Act, some Republicans consider full-time worker mandate a strange target in fight against Obamacare", "title": "Bill to define work week as 40 hours comes in for criticism from both parties", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/09/saving-american-workers-act-40-hour-work-week-criticism", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef7b26b9aa4faead23c4376a50b8fba29774ede8/0_17_5184_3112/2000.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=769b10d4d047037884c82b2561fbf1cc", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jan/09/saving-american-workers-act-40-hour-work-week-criticism?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/09/saving-american-workers-act-40-hour-work-week-criticism", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jan/09/saving-american-workers-act-40-hour-work-week-criticism?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "site": "@guardian", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ef7b26b9aa4faead23c4376a50b8fba29774ede8/0_17_5184_3112/2000.jpg", "creator": "@holpuch"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/jan/09/saving-american-workers-act-40-hour-work-week-criticism?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US healthcare,US politics,Obama administration,US Congress,House of Representatives,US Senate,Republicans,Democrats,US domestic policy,US news,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-01-09T19:35:19.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-holpuch", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T21:39:29.000Z", "tag": "US healthcare,US politics,Obama administration,US Congress,House of Representatives,US Senate,Republicans,Democrats,US domestic policy,US news,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef7b26b9aa4faead23c4376a50b8fba29774ede8/0_17_5184_3112/2000.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=3cb35f2065e4b36e6228e74719e45142", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US healthcare,US politics,Obama administration,US Congress,House of Representatives,US Senate,Republicans,Democrats,US domestic policy,US news"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn Indiana, common wisdom is that full time is a 40-hour work week,\u201d Donnelly said.\nPresident Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010.\n\u201cNo one is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act today,\u201d Republican representative Michael Burgess, a doctor, said on the House floor on Thursday.\nUnder the ACA, a person must work 30 or more hours a week if they are to be considered full time.\nThe bill alters the definition of a full-time worker under the Affordable Care Act from someone who is eligible for employment-based health insurance through working 30 hours a week to one who works 40."}
