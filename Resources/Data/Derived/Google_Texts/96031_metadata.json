Garino added a tip-in and an assist on Cavanaugh\u2019s layup. Cavanaugh hit two free throws to make it 64-55 with 5:24 remaining.\n\nVirginia (1-1) was led by Malcolm Brogdon, who had 28 points and eight rebounds.\n\nBrogdon was the only source of offense for the Cavaliers in the final minutes. After Evan Nolte hit a 3-pointer to give Virginia a 55-54 lead with 9\u00bd minutes left, Brogdon scored 11 consecutive points for the Cavs. But after he stole the ball with 17 seconds to play and Virginia trailing by four, he missed a 3 with 10 seconds to play.\n\nThe Colonials had lost seven straight to the Cavaliers, and it was the biggest win for George Washington coach Mike Lonergan in his five seasons.\n\nThe game was played before a raucous crowd at the sold-out Smith Center, an arena that\u2019s rarely full. Some of the students rushed the court after the final horn, but Virginia players were able to leave unharmed.\n\nBig things are expected from the Cavaliers, who start three seniors and have lost twice in the last two years to Michigan State in the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe Colonials led most of the first half and had a 35-32 lead at halftime.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cavanaugh and Garino each scored 18 points, and George Washington defeated No. 6 Virginia, 73-68, on Monday in the teams' first meeting in Washington in more than 30 years.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Cavanaugh and Garino each scored 18 points, and George Washington defeated No. 6 Virginia, 73-68, on Monday in the teams\u2019 first meeting in Washington in more than 30 years.", "title": "Tyler Cavanaugh, Patricio Garino lead George Washington over No. 6 Virginia", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/16/george-washington-virginia-upset-basketball/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/16/AP_759460845650.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/16/AP_759460845650.jpg", "description": "Cavanaugh and Garino each scored 18 points, and George Washington defeated No. 6 Virginia, 73-68, on Monday in the teams' first meeting in Washington in more than 30 years.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tyler Cavanaugh, Patricio Garino lead George Washington over No. 6 Vir"}, "Author": "Rich Dubroff", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports"}, "article_summary": "Patricio Garino and Tyler Cavanaugh each scored 18 points as George Washingtonstunned No.\nBut after he stole the ball with 17 seconds to play and Virginia trailing by four, he missed a 3 with 10 seconds to play.\nAfter Evan Nolte hit a 3-pointer to give Virginia a 55-54 lead with 9\u00bd minutes left, Brogdon scored 11 consecutive points for the Cavs.\nThe Colonials had lost seven straight to the Cavaliers, and it was the biggest win for George Washington coach Mike Lonergan in his five seasons.\nThe Colonials (2-0) took control with a 10-0 run that began with Garino\u2019s three-point play for a 57-55 lead with 8:06 left."}
