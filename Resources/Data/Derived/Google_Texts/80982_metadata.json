But precious little is spent to prevent it.\n\nKenneth Thorpe is chairman of the Washington-based Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease. He doesn\u2019t give much hope to the idea of bringing down the cost of health care unless prevention gets a much bigger role.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t find ways to keep people out of the hospital, to keep people on medication adherence and managing their blood sugar levels, if we don\u2019t do that, none of the things I hear being discussed to control the cost of care are going to work,\u201d he said.\n\nNinety-seven percent of the nation\u2019s $3.1 trillion medical bill goes toward treating the sick. Three percent is spent on prevention.\n\nThorpe, who is also chair of the health policy and management department at the Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University in Atlanta, is particularly vexed with the problem of Type 2 diabetes. (Young children without the ability to produce insulin have Type 1 diabetes.)\n\nType 2 diabetes is usually a consequence of obesity. Unchecked, it can lead to blindness, amputations, kidney failure and death.\n\nAbout 700,000 people in North Texas have Type 2 diabetes, including a fourth of the seniors on Medicare.\n\nNationwide, half of the nation\u2019s seniors are pre-diabetic \u2014 that is, their blood sugar is high though not yet at diabetic levels. This condition is preventable and reversible. There\u2019s a well-established regimen of exercise and diet, developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, taught by the YMCA.\n\n\u201cThe CDC worked closely with the YMCA to put this in place. The last part of the puzzle is we\u2019ve got to find a way for it to be reimbursed,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cIt\u2019s $350 for an 18-week course. Medicare doesn\u2019t cover it. But it will pay for the amputations.\u201d\n\nThe only preventive measure for diabetes covered by Medicare is bariatric, or weight-loss, surgery, Thorpe said.\n\nPrivate insurance policies do little better at prevention. Under the Affordable Care Act, screening and counseling for obesity has to be covered by most private insurance plans. Some employer-sponsored health plans go further with wellness programs similar to the YMCA\u2019s Diabetes Prevention Program.\n\nThere\u2019s a real reluctance among companies, however, to wade into the welter of weight-loss diets, fads and arguments over which one offers the best results.\n\nYet obesity is the public health crisis of our time. In the mid-1980s, chronic disease accounted for 66 percent of health care spending. Thorpe now pegs that at 84 percent, and other estimates are as high as 86 percent.\n\nIn the same period, national obesity rates more than doubled.\n\nMedications to treat obesity, a condition now regarded as a disease by the American Medical Association, are few. More studies so far show community-based nutrition and exercise programs are much more effective.\n\nBut these cost money. Businesses, hospitals and foundations in Fort Worth are spending $45 million to $50 million over the next five years to support a communitywide program called the Blue Zones Project that aims to \u201cmake the healthy choice the easy choice.\u201d\n\nThorpe is hoping Congress will expand Medicare\u2019s obesity and diabetes prevention efforts to avoid the much more expensive alternatives.\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chronic disease consumes most of our health care dollars, but preventing such illnesses get short shrift.", "og": {"description": "Chronic disease consumes most of our health care dollars, but preventing such illnesses get short shrift.", "title": "Landers: Prevention could be the cure for high health costs", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150810-landers-prevention-could-be-the-cure-for-high-health-costs.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-08-11T01:31:57Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-08-11T01:31:57Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Landers: Prevention could be the cure for high health costs\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150810-landers-prevention-could-be-the-cure-for-high-health-costs.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2391112\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-08-11T01:31:57Z\", \"section\": \"Jim Landers\", \"author\": \"Jim Landers\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-11T01:31:57Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "He doesn\u2019t give much hope to the idea of bringing down the cost of health care unless prevention gets a much bigger role.\nSome employer-sponsored health plans go further with wellness programs similar to the YMCA\u2019s Diabetes Prevention Program.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Chronic disease, much of it stemming from lifestyle choices, accounts for more than three-fourths of the money spent on health care.\nIn the mid-1980s, chronic disease accounted for 66 percent of health care spending.\nThere\u2019s a well-established regimen of exercise and diet, developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, taught by the YMCA."}
