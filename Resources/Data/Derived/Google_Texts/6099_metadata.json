How did the water vanish? My point is, they\u2019re presenting all this stuff to you as fact just like they\u2019re presenting everything involving global warming as scientific fact. It`s nothing but wild guesses. It\u2019s nothing but based on computer models which is the result of data input that who knows if it\u2019s legit or not.\n\nThat\u2019s to be expected from Limbaugh, I suppose. If you\u2019re a huckster by trade, the truth is your enemy\u2014and not just the truth, but the very possibility of truth. The very existence of science is a threat to you. So naturally, if you\u2019ve got as much time to fill as Limbaugh does, you engage in war on science. But the real problem isn\u2019t Rush Limbaugh, it\u2019s the way that the entirety of the GOP adapts to him in various different ways\u2014especially those who are deemed \u201csensible\u201d in the world of bipartisan consensus, whose job it is to make plausible excuses for their sorry party.\n\nCase in point: GOP strategist Liz Mair, who back in March was abruptly fired after just one day as a Scott Walker online strategist, in response to outrage over an earlier set of tweets critical of Iowa during a January forum. After her firing, Mair fired off a long tweet storm clarifying her views, which she did again\u2014with a more critical edge\u2014just after Walker left the race a few weeks ago. In short, if there\u2019s anyone working inside the GOP likely to be honestly critical of its problems, it\u2019s Mair. Which presumably is why MSNBC likes having her on. But Limbaugh\u2019s anti-science conspiracism clearly illuminates the limits of such critical honesty.\n\nThus, when Chris Matthews played that clip of Limbaugh and opened up a discussion on \u201cHardball\u201d on Sept. 29 [transcript], Mair didn\u2019t come to Limbaugh\u2019s defense, but she did find a way to confuse matters further, taking the heat off the science-fearing, science-hating GOP base and blame-shifting to society at large. Before she spoke up, Jonathan Chait made a sensible point:\n\nCHAIT: So, conservatives, in general, have grown more and more distrustful in polls of science over the course of the last four decades. They used to be more trusting of science than liberals now, they\u2019re much less. And specifically with global warming, what they have is a conspiracy theory. They don\u2019t have an alternative scientific theory.\n\nSo it fell to Mair to obfuscate, to undo that degree of clarity. \u201cScience has worked for mankind across the board,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cWhen did it become the enemy of the hard right?\u201d And Mair responded:\n\nMAIR: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the enemy of the hard right. I actually think that we\u2019re in a period in society where there are a lot of people who are very skeptical of discovery and science in general. I mean, when we had the debate about vaccines, right, and we were looking at the resurgence of awful illnesses because people weren\u2019t having their kids vaccinated, a lot of that was center centered in very, very liberal enclaves of California. I think unfortunate \u2014 MATTHEWS: They were afraid to get their kids vaccinated \u2014 MAIR: They believe it\u2019s going to give them autism, right? I think we\u2019ve reached a place in society, and maybe Rush Limbaugh\u2019s comments are manifestation of this, where a lot of people just don\u2019t prioritize discovery or science anymore. I mean, remember in the 2012 election how much Newt Gingrich was derided for all of his talk about moon bases and space exploration, right?\n\nSo as Mair is framing things, \u201ca lot of people just don\u2019t prioritize discovery or science anymore,\u201d and they\u2019re all over the map ideologically. She says that \u201cmaybe Rush Limbaugh\u2019s comments are manifestation of this\u201d [my emphasis], and maybe they\u2019re not, I guess. \u201cWho knows?\u201d as Rush himself would say.\n\nBut there are a two major flaws in her argument. First, there\u2019s actual data supporting Chait\u2019s claim that conservatives alone have become much less trusting of science, and it\u2019s not very scientific of Mair to just ignore that data, because she doesn\u2019t like it, and try to counter it with anecdotes.\n\nA 2012 paper by Gordon Gauchat in the American Sociological Review, using data from the 1974 to 2010 General Social Survey\u2014the gold standard for public opinion research\u2014found that \u201cgroup differences in trust in science are largely stable over the period, except for respondents identifying as conservative. Conservatives began the period with the highest trust in science, relative to liberals and moderates, and ended the period with the lowest.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also much broader evidence that liberalism is correlated with one of the \u201cbig five\u201d personality traits, \u201copenness to experience,\u201d as discussed by Chris Mooney in his 2012 book, \u201cThe Republican Brain: The Science of Why They Deny Science- and Reality\u201d and in my review of it. Thus, to the extent that science involves prioritizing discovery, Mair is arguing against an impressive range of data.\n\nSecond, both of Mair\u2019s anecdotes misrepresent the actual stories of what was going. In California, elected Democrats didn\u2019t indulge the anti-vaxxers, they pushed back, and passed a law requiring all schoolchildren to be vaccinated\u2014over GOP opposition, by the way. As for Gingrich\u2019s space-talk in 2012, folks weren\u2019t laughing at the idea of space exploration, they were laughing at Gingrich\u2019s snake oil routine and his pretense of being a serious thoughtful leader.\n\nThe real stories surrounding both anecdotes are illuminating, so let\u2019s take a closer look at each in turn. First off, while it\u2019s true that a lot of anti-vaccine sentiment was seen in liberal enclaves around Hollywood, as the Hollywood Reporter explained in detail last year, the reasons cited weren\u2019t that those not vaccinating their children \u201cjust don\u2019t prioritize discovery or science.\u201d It was much more complicated than that:\n\nToday, on the Westside, those who abstain from vaccinating their kids see refusal through their own socio-anthropological lens. \u201cThey\u2019re well intended \u2014 the people that only want to do the best for their child. They want only natural products, organic foods, attachment parenting, family beds,\u201d says Dr. Lisa Stern, a Santa Monica pediatrician. Observes Dr. Neal Baer, a trained pediatrician and veteran TV writer-producer (ER) who wrote an episode of Law & Order: SVU about the public health consequences of vaccine refusal, \u201cIt\u2019s about not wanting to have anything that isn\u2019t \u2018natural\u2019 in your child \u2014 this whole notion of the natural and holistic versus the scientific.\u201d\n\nBaer\u2019s framing of \u201cthe natural and holistic versus the scientific\u201d reflects a broader cultural construct, but it\u2019s inaccurate. Using products of scientific discovery without adequate risk-assessment is more properly described as \u201cthe technocratic\u201d approach, rather than \u201cthe scientific,\u201d or even as \u201cthe techno-corporate.\u201d Determining where \u201cthe scientific\u201d leaves off and \u201cthe technocratic\u201d or \u201cthe techno-corporate\u201d begins may not be so easy to discern. The story continued:\n\nAccording to those on both sides of the issue, this demographic is unafraid to take on the medical establishment. \u201cThey are not intimidated by the authority of the doctor,\u201d says Brendan Nyhan, Ph.D, a political scientist at Dartmouth who has studied parents who are vaccine skeptics. \u201cEducated, high-income people are more likely to feel confident in standing up to doctors or seeking out ones who are more favorable to alternative schedules and selective vaccination.\u201d\n\nSo, the irony here is that some of what\u2019s motivating anti-vaxxers is actually a personal willingness to discover, however flawed their execution might be, which may then be taken advantage of by people with various different agendas. In short, it\u2019s nothing like the clear-cut, simplistic picture casually tossed out by Mair.\n\nBut what was remarkably clear-cut was what happened once the issue entered the public policy realm: Democratic politicians overwhelmingly looked to the science, while Republicans ignored and fought against it. A bill that would ban personal, religious exemptions for vaccinations, co-written by a pediatrician in the state Senate, Richard Pan, was passed by the state Legislature with strong Democratic support, and was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. In the California Senate, Legiscan\u2013which tracks legislation in all 50 states\u2014identified the bill on the political spectrum as \u201cStrong Partisan Bill (Democrat 27-2).\u201d The overall vote on its third reading was 46-31, so a substantial majority of Republicans opposed it. In the California Assembly, just a handful of Democrats abstained (3) or voted no (5), while just two Republicans voted for the bill. An effort to overturn the law through the referendum process, just filed in late September, was led by former Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a Republican, and former member of the anti-immigration Minuteman organization, who placed third in California\u2019s open primary governor\u2019s race in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives have become much less trusting of science.
