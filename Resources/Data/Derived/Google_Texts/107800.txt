GRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) - The University of North Dakota has set a final runoff vote for a new nickname - Fighting Hawks or Roughriders.

The university said Sunday those two names received the highest number of votes in a runoff election involving the top three nickname options from a preliminary vote. The third option - Nodaks - was eliminated.

But because no name received 50 percent or more of the runoff vote, a final runoff vote will start Thursday at noon Central time. The vote concludes at 11:59 p.m. CT on Nov. 16.

UND has been without a nickname for three years, since the state Board of Higher Education retired the school’s “Fighting Sioux” moniker that the NCAA deemed offensive. Potential nicknames North Stars and Sundogs were eliminated in the preliminary vote.
