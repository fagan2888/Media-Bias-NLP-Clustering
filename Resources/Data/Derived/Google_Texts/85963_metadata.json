Care Act, all employers \u2014 even those affiliated with churches whose doctrines express opposition to contraception, sterilization or the use of abortifacients \u2014 were required to offer their insured employees coverage that included all three at no out-of-pocket cost to the employees.\n\nRealizing that they had been lied to \u2014 and, in retrospect, what in the world made them think they\u2019d be exempt from that? \u2014 the Roman Catholic bishops cried foul.\n\nSo did a lot of private employers who run businesses rather than churches, but whose religious beliefs put contraception, sterilization and abortifacients out of bounds.\n\nObama and his minions huddled and returned with a proposal they hoped would salve the hyperactive consciences of these weirdos who actually believe in stuff:\n\nOK, your religion doesn\u2019t have to pay directly for our political sop to our religion, the Church of Abortion on Demand. We\u2019ll just order your insurer to pay for it. When it passes the cost on to you, we promise it won\u2019t be a line item. See no evil, and all that.\n\nBut they did see the evil, and the answer was, \u201cWe can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nObama and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius then settled on ordering \u201cprivate\u201d insurers to provide abortifacients, etc., as part of the package paid for by religious employers, with the federal government reimbursing the insurers so those costs wouldn\u2019t be passed along to the business owner.\n\nThat arrangement leaves the employer, whether she runs a convent or a candy store, with the choice of cooperating with evil or dumping employee health insurance altogether.\n\nNeither option is particularly good for the soul, but one is worse than the other.\n\nSo in significant numbers, employers have sued the federal government, citing the assault on their freedom to practice their religion. At last count, the government faces 61 lawsuits filed by family-run small businesses, church-affiliated and religion-based businesses \u2014 for-profits and nonprofits \u2014 that have refused to go quietly.\n\nIn the case of the Little Sisters of the Poor, government disingenuousness reaches new depths.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s brief in answer to the nuns\u2019 suit states that because the religious order is self-insured, it need only fill out a form stating its religious scruples against contraception and the like. Once the form is filed, the requirement goes away.\n\nWould that it were true.\n\nBut the form the government says would absolve the sisters of all responsibility does precisely the opposite: It includes a notation that although the Little Sisters of the Poor object to providing their employees with services that include contraceptives and abortifacients, the nuns acknowledge their \u201cobligation\u201d to do so, and direct their third-party insurer to assume the obligation.\n\nThe government further argues that if the insurer decided not to provide the objectionable services, well, no big deal.\n\n\u201cThe third-party administrator of applicants\u2019 church plan says it will not provide contraceptive coverage,\u201d the government\u2019s brief says. \u201cAs a result, a signed certification will discharge all employer applicants\u2019 responsibilities under the contraceptive-coverage provision, and their employees will not receive such coverage from the third-party administrator.\u201d\n\nSo, the government advises, to avoid being complicit in the provision of contraceptives and abortifacients to your employees, Sister, all you have to do is admit that you owe your employees those things and order your insurer to provide them.\n\nSimple enough: Up is down, black is white, orders are issued to be ignored. And if you like your third-party administrator, you can keep your third-party administrator. Trust us.\n\nBut sign the form, Sister. You will sign the form. You will attach your endorsement to a legal document that stands in open and direct opposition to the teachings of your church.\n\nFor a hair-splitting politician, that may seem like a fine solution \u2014 especially when the question involves a law founded entirely on obfuscations, misrepresentations and outright lies.\n\nBut for a religious order founded on the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, it\u2019s just one more in a long chain of insults.\n\nThe legal and political contortions to salvage Obamacare go on and on. They passed it, we found out what was in it, and they\u2019ve been waiving, exempting, delaying, ignoring and reinterpreting ever since. Whatever one may think of the motivations for passing it, it\u2019s just badly written law being executed the only way such a law can be: badly.\n\nO\u2019Brien is The Plain Dealer\u2019s deputy editorial page editor.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act, barack-obama, deaprtment-of-health-and-human-services, kathleen-sebelius, little-sisters-of-the-poor, obamacare, opinion", "title": "Even the Little Sisters of the Poor are subject to Big Brother's bullying: Kevin O'Brien", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Obamacare has to be a bad law when it gets the Little Sisters of the Poor riled up enough to sue the federal government, Kevin O'Brien writes.", "title": "Even the Little Sisters of the Poor are subject to Big Brother's bullying: Kevin O'Brien", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/obrien/index.ssf/2014/01/even_the_little_sisters_of_the.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/obrien_impact/photo/14050159-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare has to be a bad law when it gets the Little Sisters of the Poor riled up enough to sue the federal government, Kevin O'Brien writes.", "creator": "@kobrien_scribe", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/obrien_impact/photo/14050159-standard.jpg", "title": "Even the Little Sisters of the Poor are subject to Big Brother's bullying: Kevin O'Brien", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, January 07, 2014,  3:58 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, January 07, 2014,  1:47 PM", "article_author": "Kevin OBrien, The Plain Dealer", "Description": "Obamacare has to be a bad law when it gets the Little Sisters of the Poor riled up enough to sue the federal government, Kevin O'Brien writes."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd033a\"", "article_summary": "But for a religious order founded on the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, it\u2019s just one more in a long chain of insults.\nIt\u2019s worth reviewing how it came to be that The Little Sisters had to sue Big Brother.\nThe Little Sisters of the Poorneed contraception like the U.S. economy needs three more years of Barack Obama.\nIn the case of the Little Sisters of the Poor, government disingenuousness reaches new depths.\nThe government further argues that if the insurer decided not to provide the objectionable services, well, no big deal."}
