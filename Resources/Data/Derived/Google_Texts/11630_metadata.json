The reality is that colleges and universities spend big in order to get federal money, and a small proportion of colleges and universities walk away with the lion\u2019s share of federal research dollars.\n\nThis month, the University of Kentucky received a $3.75 million grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote colorectal screenings in Central Appalachia. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the University of Kentucky spent $261,000 in 2012 and $241,000 in 2013 just on lobbying. The University of Illinois was awarded $19.5 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, based on funding through the Affordable Care Act, for medical teams to go into Chicago neighborhoods to focus on children\u2019s health needs. In 2012 and 2013, the University of Illinois spent $930,000 in lobbying. Those lobbying expenditures don\u2019t mean that the scientists at Kentucky and Illinois didn\u2019t deserve their federal grant awards, but in the higher education scrum for federal research dollars, lobbying helps with access and visibility.\n\nListed by the Center for Responsive Politics as having spent $985,000 in lobbying in 2012-2013, Purdue University just announced its second-best year ever in external research funding, including federal grants such as $1.5 million from the National Science Foundation for new \u201cnanomaterial\u201d for advanced sensors and batteries for use in manufacturing and $5 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development to help sub-Saharan countries deal with poverty and hunger through reducing food waste.\n\n\u201cIt is due to the brilliant and diverse array of researchers at Purdue that we win these awards,\u201d said Purdue President Mitch Daniels. \u201cOur faculty are making vast impact with their discoveries, and it is our duty to support them with fast and effective pre- and post-award activities.\u201d To be sure, Daniels is correct that the faculty are the basis of the federal grants, but as a former politician\u2014Daniels just happens to have served eight years as governor of Indiana\u2014he knows those pre- and post-grant activities often involve lobbying federal agencies to put the university and its faculty in a position to secure those grants.\n\nLast year, the Center for Responsive Politics calculated the lobbying and campaign expenditures of colleges and universities\u2014or presumably individuals associated with the universities in the case of campaign contributions\u2014to document the strong correlation between universities\u2019 lobbying and campaign expenditures and their access to federal research and development grants.\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, the following were among the top private and public universities in terms of combined federal lobbying expenditures\u2014without any campaign-related expenditures included in the totals\u2014for 2012 and 2013:\n\nTexas A&M University $2,615,000 University of Texas $1,707,000 Boston University $1,630,000 California State University $1,613,000 University of California $1,588,000 University of Pennsylvania $1,463,358 Johns Hopkins University $1,280,000 University of Colorado $1,244,433 Northwestern University $1,223,000 Wake Forest University $1,200,000 University of Southern California $1,130,000 Yale University $1,130,000 University of Pittsburgh $1,100,000 University of Oklahoma $1,090,000 University of Washington $1,070,000 Harvard University $1,040,000 Northeastern University $1,000,000 Purdue University $985,000 University of Arkansas $940,000 University of Illinois $930,000 Clemson University $922,074 Utah State University $880,000 New York University $880,000 Penn State University $875,000 Indiana University $870,000\n\nSources: OpenSecrets.org; data accessed July 14, 2014\n\nNo one need get apoplectic and assume this list means those researchers who scored federal grants at these universities didn\u2019t deserve them. However, it is the way the game is played in Washington, D.C.: Lobbying federal agencies and their executive and legislative branch overseers counts for access, visibility, and the face-time that might lead to an agency giving a university application a second look.\n\nThe expenditures in the chart above are only the \u201cofficial\u201d federal lobbying totals as taken by the Center for Responsive Politics from the records maintained by the Senate Office of Public Records. They don\u2019t include the campaign contributions of people associated with these institutions. They don\u2019t include the \u201cunofficial\u201d lobbying that occurs through educational visits with legislators and agency representatives. And they don\u2019t include lobbying at the state level, such as the $17 million spent by the public universities and colleges in New York State to lobby the government that provides their funding.\n\nIf universities and colleges got an extra swath of face-time and access with powerful politicians through the payment of speaking fees, some of them paid for by special programs or endowments paid for by contributors, or covered by fundraising for the speaking events, that\u2019s simply to be added to the expenditures that might be the total package of purchasing influence among current and future federal decision-makers. It all counts, especially for those big universities that can spend six or seven figures a year on federal lobbying and pay speaking fees of a couple of hundred thousand to selected politicians as well.\u2014Rick Cohen\n\nFull Disclosure: This author is a graduate of Boston University and the University of Pennsylvania, both of which appear on this list of top lobbying colleges and universities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some readers were surprised in our story last week about the Clintons\u2019 speaking fees by the notion that colleges and universities might be interested in paying big dollars to politicians for speeches in the hope that they\u2019ll help the schools along when they need access to federal agencies for federal R&D grants.
