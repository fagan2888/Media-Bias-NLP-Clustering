The percentage of consumers using cash for small transactions fell 7 points to 58 percent. The rate at which credit cards were used remained steady at 11 percent.\n\nRelated: 12 Best Credit Cards for Travelers\n\nThe preference for plastic is especially common among millennials, aged 18 and 29. The report found that 46 percent of millennials use debit cards for small purchases, while 18 percent prefer credit. Of those between the ages 30 and 49, 36 percent use debit cards and 13 percent prefer credit. People between the ages of 50 and 64 use debit cards 21 percent of the time, with credit cards at 7 percent.\n\nMatt Schulz, an analyst at CreditCards.com, attributes the generational difference to a matter of convenience and an acceptance of new technology. He expects the trend to accelerate over time as \u201cpeople begin to pay more through their phones and other such devices.\u201d\n\nBut as debit cards become more common, consumers should familiarize themselves with the risks attached to them. The biggest liability is that debit cards have much weaker fraud protections than credit cards, according to NerdWallet\u2019s credit card expert, Sean McQuay.\n\nIf your credit card number is stolen, you won\u2019t be held accountable for any purchases made. If your physical credit card is stolen, your card issuer can hold you responsible for up to $50, though they don't always ask you to pay. And if you report the card stolen before it gets used, you should be off the hook entirely.\n\nRelated: Your Credit Score: What It Is and Why It\u2019s So Important\n\nAnd because you don\u2019t have to pay off a credit card bill for 30 days, \u201cit\u2019s never actually money out of your pocket,\u201d McQuay says.\n\nBy contrast, people who have their debit cards stolen are responsible for proving that a fraudulent transaction occurred. Even though you may be reimbursed for some or all of the money you lose, \u201cin the meantime, you\u2019re on the hook to make up the difference,\u201d McQuay says.\n\nAnother disadvantage of debit cards is that users miss out on credit card rewards and building up a credit history.\n\nBut if you do insist on using a debit card, McQuay offers some tips for protecting yourself. One way is to create separate checking and savings accounts and only put a small amount of money in the checking account linked to your debit card. If thieves steal your debit card, they won\u2019t have access to the money in the savings account.\n\nRelated: States with the Highest and Lowest Credit Scores\n\nAnother option is to use a prepaid debit card. If you only want to spend $200 a week, for example, you can load that amount on the card each week. If a thief gets his hands on the card, the potential loss is limited.\n\nAnd finally, McQuay suggests avoiding overdraft protection because that will limit the amount a thief can get from your checking account. If someone tries to withdraw more money than what\u2019s available, they will be denied.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Using plastic to pay for a cup of coffee or a magazine is becoming increasingly common", "title": "Love Your Debit Card? 3 Ways to Reduce the Risk of Theft", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/Love-Your-Debit-Card-3-Ways-Reduce-Risk-Theft", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162010_Credit_Cards_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/Love-Your-Debit-Card-3-Ways-Reduce-Risk-Theft", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162010_Credit_Cards_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Using plastic to pay for a cup of coffee or a magazine is becoming increasingly common", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "People between the ages of 50 and 64 use debit cards 21 percent of the time, with credit cards at 7 percent.\nThe biggest liability is that debit cards have much weaker fraud protections than credit cards, according to NerdWallet\u2019s credit card expert, Sean McQuay.\nAnother disadvantage of debit cards is that users miss out on credit card rewards and building up a credit history.\nBy contrast, people who have their debit cards stolen are responsible for proving that a fraudulent transaction occurred.\nBut if you do insist on using a debit card, McQuay offers some tips for protecting yourself."}
