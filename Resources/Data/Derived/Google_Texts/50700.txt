Decatur – The last time a candidate launched a campaign for the White House in central Illinois he won. His name is Barack Obama.



Now a Decatur woman would like to be president running on the Republican ticket. 55 year old Sherry Procarione announced her intentions to run for president in Decatur's Central Park.



“I think that once my name gets out I think it will become a household word because of the principles and the ideas that I've espoused,” Procarione told WAND's Doug Wolfe.



Procarione describes herself as fiscally and socially conservative. She would like the EPA and the IRS eliminated while repealing the affordable care act, Obamacare.



She has never held elected office and recently moved from Oakley to Decatur. She is the mother of 12 children.
