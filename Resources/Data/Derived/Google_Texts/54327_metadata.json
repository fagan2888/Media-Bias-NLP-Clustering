But J.D. Winteregg may have just taken home the prize for strangest campaign ad this year.\n\nWinteregg, a tea party-backed candidate who is challenging House Speaker John Boehner in next month\u2019s Ohio primary, released an ad on Sunday that parodies an erectile dysfunction medication commercial.\n\nThe ad opens with videos of happy couples riding bikes and grooming a horse. \u201cYou make a great team, it\u2019s been that way since the day you met,\u201d a voiceover says. \u201cBut your electile dysfunction? It could be a question of blood flow.\u201d\n\nThe remedy to \u201celectile dysfunction\u201d? According to Winteregg, it\u2019s him: \u201cUsed on a daily basis, Winteregg in Congress will help you every time the moment is right to have your voice heard at the federal level. When using Winteregg, it\u2019s important to note that the borders will be secured, Second Amendment rights protected, Obamacare and Planned Parenthood will be defunded, and common sense will be used in solving the nation\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\nThe ad also features shots of Boehner smiling and golfing alongside President Obama, while the voiceover criticizes the House speaker for being unable to \u201cmaintain a spine in the face of liberal opposition.\u201d Winteregg ends the ad by noting that he himself does not golf.\n\nThe May 6 Ohio primary is expected to draw about 85,000 Republican voters, according to the Daily Caller, who interviewed Winteregg about his new ad. \u201cThe intent is to nationalize this thing,\u201d Winteregg said. \u201c[Boehner\u2019s] everyone\u2019s speaker. He\u2019s my representative, yeah, but he\u2019s America\u2019s speaker. We want to get my name out there and tell people there\u2019s an alternative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "\"If you have a Boehner lasting longer than 23 years, seek immediate medical attention.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/boehner-opponent-ad-electile-dysfunction", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "\"If you have a Boehner lasting longer than 23 years, seek immediate medical attention.\"", "title": "Boehner opponent remedies 'electile dysfunction' in new campaign ad", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/boehner-opponent-ad-electile-dysfunction", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/04161998.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/boehner-opponent-ad-electile-dysfunction", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/04161998.jpg?itok=2lOg9NZc", "title": "Boehner opponent remedies 'electile dysfunction' in new campaign ad", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"If you have a Boehner lasting longer than 23 years, seek immediate medical attention.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-14T16:06:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "traci-lee", "tags": "election-2014,elections,republicans,tea-party,hardball", "title": "Boehner opponent remedies 'electile dysfunction' in new campaign ad", "published": 1, "date": "04/14/2014 16:06:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/boehner-opponent-ad-electile-dysfunction"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "\"If you have a Boehner lasting longer than 23 years, seek immediate medical attention.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2014, Republicans, Tea Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbd9\"", "article_summary": "Winteregg, a tea party-backed candidate who is challenging House Speaker John Boehner in next month\u2019s Ohio primary, released an ad on Sunday that parodies an erectile dysfunction medication commercial.\nThe May 6 Ohio primary is expected to draw about 85,000 Republican voters, according to the Daily Caller, who interviewed Winteregg about his new ad.\nWinteregg may have just taken home the prize for strangest campaign ad this year.\nFirst came an ad boasting a candidate\u2019s ability to castrate hogs; then, an ad featuring the destruction of the Affordable Care Act by gunfire followed.\nHe\u2019s my representative, yeah, but he\u2019s America\u2019s speaker."}
