Poll: Americans say Iran got more in nuclear deal

Americans appear to be split on the Iran nuclear deal, but a plurality seems to agree that Iran got more of what it wanted with the negotiations, according to a new Monmouth University poll out Monday.

Asked whether the United States or Iran got the better end of the agreement, 41 percent responded that the regime in Tehran gained more, while just 14 percent said the U.S. benefited more than their Iranian counterparts.

Roughly two-thirds (67 percent) of self-identified Republicans said that Iran got more of what it wanted, while just 23 percent of Democrats responded similarly.

A little more than just 2 in 10 Americans (23 percent) said that both Iran and the U.S. benefited mutually.

Americans seem less certain about whether Congress should approve the final agreement, with 41 percent expressing uncertainty. Just 27 percent say lawmakers should move to approve the deal, while 32 percent say they should vote against it.

“The public is not convinced that Congress should reject the plan, but they can’t shake their nagging doubts that Iran has the upper hand here,” said Monmouth polling director Patrick Murray in a press release.

The survey was conducted via telephone July 30-Aug. 2, polling 1,203 adults nationwide with an overall margin of error plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.
