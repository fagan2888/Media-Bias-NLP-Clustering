A family escapes their home after firefighters say a small child started a fire Sunday night.

Crews were called after 8 p.m. to a home in the 1800 block of north Piatt.

Wichita Fire Department Battalion Chief Ernie Schuler said when fire crews arrived at the home, they couldn't see it because of the heavy smoke.

Firefighters determined the fire started in a back bedroom where a child had been playing with a lighter.

"It's important to teach your children fire safety from a young age," Schuler said. "Hopefully, they'll learn from this."

Four people were in the home. No one was injured.
