John Kline heated up Monday night at a political debate in Cannon Falls, with each candidate trying to prove their conservative credentials.\n\nA former conservative talk radio host, two former state legislators, a business owner and engineer debated a range of topics, including need for a smaller federal government, immigration reform, national security and climate change.\n\n\u201cWe know that Washington is a well-oiled machine,\u201d said candidate David Gerson, who has twice run against Kline. \u201cWe will no longer accept the collusion between special interests and government.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd Congressional District, which covers the counties of Dakota, Scott, Goodhue, Wabasha and part of Rice, became open after Kline announced he\u2019d retire after his current term expired. Kline first took office in 2003.\n\nThe race is expected to be one of the most-watched in the country, as Republicans try to hold off Democrats who believe that the shifting political makeup of the district make the seat ripe for flipping to their side.\n\nSeveral of the candidates said Washington D.C. politics, and the Republican establishment, needed to be reformed, and that they would ignite that change.\n\nIn a crowded field, the candidates tried to prove they are the most electable and have the right experience.\n\n\u201cI know how to make government work for us to get the job,\u201d former state Rep. Pam Myhra said. \u201cI\u2019ve been proven to be electable.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, all of those who participated said that congressional term limits should be put in place.\n\nThe candidates all agreed that illegal immigration needed to be stemmed, radical Islamic terrorism destroyed, Planned Parenthood defunded and the Affordable Care Act repealed.\n\nAt the start of the debate, candidates were asked whether they would honor the GOP endorsement or press on to a primary. Two candidates, former state Sen. John Howe and businesswoman Darlene Miller, did not commit to the pledge.\n\nWhile most of the candidates avoided confrontation, Jason Lewis, a former talk radio personality was the most eager to criticize rivals. But he also drew some of the sharpest criticism, like when Howe criticized him for living outside the district.\n\n\u201cI live a whopping two miles outside of the district,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI\u2019m in the district every day, going to my doctor or going someplace else, so that\u2019s just a red-herring.\u201d\n\nLewis criticized Howe\u2019s support of DFL Gov. Mark Dayton\u2019s bonding bill during his time as a state lawmaker.\n\nThe GOP field is vying for the chance to challenge Democrat Angie Craig, who has no DFL rival and has already racked up several high-profile endorsements.\n\nDavid Benson-Staebler, a former Democratic political strategist, did not attend the GOP debate.\n\nChristopher Aadland is a University of Minnesota student on assignment for the Star Tribune", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "By CHRISTOPHER AADLAND.", "title": "GOP talks term limits, residency in 2nd District debate", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/gop-talks-term-limits-residency-in-2nd-district-debate/368127571/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "By CHRISTOPHER AADLAND.", "title": "GOP talks term limits, residency in 2nd District debate", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/gop-talks-term-limits-residency-in-2nd-district-debate/368127571/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "By CHRISTOPHER AADLAND."}, "article_summary": "At the start of the debate, candidates were asked whether they would honor the GOP endorsement or press on to a primary.\nDavid Benson-Staebler, a former Democratic political strategist, did not attend the GOP debate.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been proven to be electable.\u201dAt the same time, all of those who participated said that congressional term limits should be put in place.\n\u201cWe know that Washington is a well-oiled machine,\u201d said candidate David Gerson, who has twice run against Kline.\nTwo candidates, former state Sen.
