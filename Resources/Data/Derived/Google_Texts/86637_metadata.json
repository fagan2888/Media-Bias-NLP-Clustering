Burwell, the case in which opponents of the Affordable Care Act won a dramatic if temporary victory yesterday, has profound implications for millions of Americans\u2019 health care. But it\u2019s also a demonstration of a trend that is determining more and more of what our politics and our country are going to look like in future years.\n\nWe talk a lot about America being divided ideologically, with liberals and conservatives increasingly distrustful and dismissive of each other. But we\u2019re also in the process of creating two different nations, where stepping across a state border means entering a society with profoundly different laws and policy goals. And Republicans may have just stumbled on a way to use the federal government to increase that division.\n\nBoth parties are driving this broad movement. In many Republican-controlled states, it\u2019s now all but impossible for a woman to get an abortion; people are encouraged by the state government to bring their guns to church and into bars; and taxes are whittled away while social services are slashed. Democrats too have gotten more aggressive in places they control, on issues like raising the minimum wage, same-sex marriage, and legalizing marijuana.\n\nBut the challenges to the ACA have shown the Republicans a new path, a kind of federalized federalism, where they can not only make Red America a more conservative place through state laws, but exempt Red America from federal laws they don\u2019t like.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t part of a carefully laid-out plan. Initially Republicans were just using any and every means they could find to undermine the ACA, with the goal of destroying it completely. Though they failed to do that, they won their first significant (if partial) victory when the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, which meant that we have two different countries when it comes to health coverage for poor people. If you\u2019re poor and you live in a blue state or one of the few red states that has accepted the expansion, you can get free health insurance. If not, you\u2019re out of luck. See, for instance, this vivid New York Times article about the city of Texarkana, which lies half in Texas and half in Arkansas; whether you get health insurance is determined by which side of town you live in.\n\nIn the Halbig case, conservatives located a drafting error and pursued it for no reason other than that it looked like a promising vehicle for Republican-appointed judges to strike a blow at the law. Creating two different countries when it comes to the ACA wasn\u2019t really the goal, but it could be the outcome.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine the Supreme Court upheld the D.C. Circuit panel\u2019s decision. In the states that have already established state exchanges, nothing would change. With a few exceptions (like Kentucky and Idaho) these are blue states. Everywhere else, people would immediately lose the tax credits they received to buy insurance, reverting to the pre-ACA status quo. That means more people without insurance, and a system that is generally more cruel and unforgiving. The states that are Democratic-controlled or divided but haven\u2019t yet set up an exchange, like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maine, would probably move to do so in order to restore those subsidies to their citizens. Once it all shook out, you\u2019d have a situation in which, for all intents and purposes, the most consequential social legislation passed through Congress in nearly half a century was operative in only half the country.\n\nIf that were to happen (and maybe even if it doesn\u2019t), Republicans are likely to see a new means to accomplish their policy goals on any number of issues. If you can\u2019t repeal a federal law you don\u2019t like, maybe you can have it apply only to Blue America. Get a few creative lawyers together, and you can come up with a rationale for a lawsuit to allow states to opt out of almost any law; few can deny now that no matter how thin the legal reed you hang such a suit on, there will always be conservative judges who will embrace your logic. We could see a proliferation of opt-out amendments in Congress, as each significant piece of legislation is accompanied by an effort to give Republican states the ability to exempt themselves.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be surprised if perpetually vulnerable red state Democrats end up supporting those amendments from time to time, so they can give their party the votes it needs to pass bills, but also tell the folks back home that they stood up for states\u2019 rights.\n\nIn 1932, Justice Louis Brandeis wrote in a dissenting opinion:\n\nIt is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\n\nBut the assumption has always been that when states act as laboratories of democracy, they\u2019re exploring different ways to arrive at common goals. Increasingly, liberals and conservatives can agree only on the most abstract goals, like prosperity and freedom, but on almost none of the specifics. With the ACA as an example, Washington could become the new laboratory of division, where federal legislation and federal lawsuits become the means to drive Red America and Blue America further apart.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What the court's decisions on Obamacare portend.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "What the court's decisions on Obamacare portend.", "title": "The deepening divide between red and blue America", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/07/23/the-deepening-divide-between-red-and-blue-america/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/07/Capitol-01d2f_image_982w-300x200.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/07/23/the-deepening-divide-between-red-and-blue-america/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, halbig, court decisions on obamacare, affordable care act, red america, blue america, states' rights", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, halbig, court decisions on obamacare, affordable care act, red america, blue america, states' rights"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0405\"", "article_summary": "With the ACA as an example, Washington could become the new laboratory of division, where federal legislation and federal lawsuits become the means to drive Red America and Blue America further apart.\nBut the challenges to the ACA have shown the Republicans a new path, a kind of federalized federalism, where they can not only make Red America a more conservative place through state laws, but exempt Red America from federal laws they don\u2019t like.\nIf you\u2019re poor and you live in a blue state or one of the few red states that has accepted the expansion, you can get free health insurance.\nIf you can\u2019t repeal a federal law you don\u2019t like, maybe you can have it apply only to Blue America.\nWe talk a lot about America being divided ideologically, with liberals and conservatives increasingly distrustful and dismissive of each other."}
