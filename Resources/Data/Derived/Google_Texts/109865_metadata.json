Still, there\u2019s another set of numbers associated with him that cannot be ignored: three concussions, nine months.\n\nCleared to play following his third diagnosed concussion since November, the Broncos receiver will get back in a game Sunday, when Denver travels to Seattle for a Super Bowl rematch. Welker\u2019s suspension for testing positive for amphetamines in the offseason was cut in half when the NFL and the union agreed to a revamped drug policy.\n\nStill, the comeback feels a bit rushed, with the potential for life-altering consequences if the next big hit the 33-year-old takes to the head winds up being his last.\n\n\u201cWe know that having multiple concussions is not good,\u201d said Dr. Julian Bailes, clinical professor of neurosurgery at the University of Chicago and a member of the NFL Players Association\u2019s concussion committee, who noted that all sorts of factors must be taken into account on an individual basis. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily career-ending. \u2026 A contact-sport athlete who\u2019s had multiple concussions in a short period of time does risk further concussions and risks that it becomes a season- or career-ending proposition if they return to play.\u201d\n\nWelker returns less than a month since leaving an Aug. 23 preseason game after a hit to the head.\n\nOn Wednesday, he said he\u2019d been medically cleared to play in the past week or so. But his drug suspension delayed his comeback by at least a game, a layoff he said was probably for the best. He has heard ongoing debate about his future \u2014 whether an 11-year NFL veteran who\u2019s earned more than $20 million along with a reputation as one of the game\u2019s best slot receivers should even bother playing anymore.\n\n\u201cI appreciate their concern, I really do,\u201d said Welker, who has 841 catches for 9,358 yards. \u201cBut at the same time, I feel great. I feel sharp and I feel ready to go.\u201d\n\nAn NFL player\u2019s assessment of his own health is one of the most important factors in determining when he returns. It\u2019s also a reason the NFL has no hard-and-fast rules about saying, for instance, that three concussions in less than 12 months should rule a player out.\n\n\u201cIt would create a tremendous disincentive to report that third concussion,\u201d says Chris Nowinski, a driving force behind research on the topic. \u201cYou really want to leave the decision in the hands of a great doctor and an honest patient and let them make the best decision for that athlete.\u201d\n\nThe 5-foot-9, 185-pound Welker has been going over the middle and taking punishment for decades \u2014 in high school, at Texas Tech, and with three NFL teams.\n\nBut he passed the NFL\u2019s revamped return-to-play protocols established in 2009; independent doctors cleared him to play after comparing his brain function to the \u201cbaseline\u201d numbers established in pre-training camp tests that look at memory, concentration and other cognitive functions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Welker\u2019s return brings more concussion questions", "title": "Welker\u2019s return brings more concussion questions", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Welker\u2019s return brings more concussion questions", "title": "Welker\u2019s return brings more concussion questions", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/welkers_return_brings_more_concussion_questions/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/broncos-welker-football.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Welker\u2019s return brings more concussion questions", "title": "Welker\u2019s return brings more concussion questions", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/broncos-welker-football.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eddie Pells and Howard Fendrich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd281a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsDENVER (AP) \u2014 Wes Welker\u2019s receiving stats over a productive NFL career are impressive.\n\u201cIt would create a tremendous disincentive to report that third concussion,\u201d says Chris Nowinski, a driving force behind research on the topic.\nWelker\u2019s suspension for testing positive for amphetamines in the offseason was cut in half when the NFL and the union agreed to a revamped drug policy.\nCleared to play following his third diagnosed concussion since November, the Broncos receiver will get back in a game Sunday, when Denver travels to Seattle for a Super Bowl rematch.\nStill, there\u2019s another set of numbers associated with him that cannot be ignored: three concussions, nine months."}
