One of those was the 1995 episode \u201cRound Springfield,\u201d wherein the infamous joke \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkeys\u201d was coined to poke fun at the French.\n\nCruz also recalled a scene from 1996\u2019s \u201cTreehouse of Horror VII,\u201d in which space aliens named Kang and Kodos take on the identities of President Clinton and Bob Dole in order to run for president and take over the world.\n\nIn the show, Kodos the alien explains to a Springfield voter that he has no choice but to vote for one of the two them, and that in a two-party system, when someone votes third party, the vote is wasted. Kang replied, \u201cGo ahead, throw your vote away.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast later contacted Simpson\u2019s producer Al Jean for comment, and he did not return the love.\n\n\u201cTo paraphrase Kang, \u2018Ted Cruz?\u2019 Go ahead, throw your vote away,\u201d Jean told the site.\n\nDuring his interview, Cruz also stated he is not a fan of HBO\u2019s True Blood, which mocked him in 2014.\n\nUnrequited love for pop culture icons is familiar territory for Republican politicians. After years of professing his love for all things Bruce Springsteen, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie finally found himself in the good graces of \u201cThe Boss\u201d just last year.\n\n\u201cHe actually told me we were friends,\u201d Christie said of Springsteen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas Senator and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz expressed his love for The Simpsons Thursday, only to have the long-running Fox cartoon\u2019s producer publicly state the show doesn\u2019t love him back.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Texas Senator and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz expressed his love for The Simpsons Thursday, only to have the long-running Fox cartoon\u2019s producer publicly state the show doesn\u2019t love him back.", "title": "'The Simpsons' Showrunner Slams Ted Cruz Supporters: 'Go Ahead, Throw Your Vote Away' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/ted-cruz-what-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-04-17T09:40:43-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/04/17/the-simpsons-show-runner-on-ted-cruz-go-ahead-throw-your-vote-away/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texas Senator and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz expressed his love for The Simpsons Thursday, only to have the long-running Fox cartoon\u2019s producer publicly state the show doesn\u2019t love him back.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/ted-cruz-what-AP.jpg", "title": "'The Simpsons' Showrunner Slams Ted Cruz Supporters: 'Go Ahead, Throw Your Vote Away' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Al Jean, Bruce Springsteen, Governor Chris Christie, Ted Cruz 2016, The Simpsons,2016 Presidential Race, Big Hollywood,the simpsons", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-04-17T08:44:17-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T09:40:43-07:00", "tag": "The Simpsons", "categories": "Big Hollywood,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb45\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTo paraphrase Kang, \u2018Ted Cruz?\u2019 Go ahead, throw your vote away,\u201d Jean told the site.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAfter disclosing he is a big fan of The Simpsons, Cruz began to quote lines from his favorite episodes of the show.\nKang replied, \u201cGo ahead, throw your vote away.\u201dThe Daily Beast later contacted Simpson\u2019s producer Al Jean for comment, and he did not return the love.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTexas Senator and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz expressed his love for The Simpsons Thursday, only to have the long-running Fox cartoon\u2019s producer publicly state the show doesn\u2019t love him back.\nDuring his interview, Cruz also stated he is not a fan of HBO\u2019s True Blood, which mocked him in 2014."}
