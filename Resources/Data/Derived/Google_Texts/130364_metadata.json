( Carl Costas/CALmatters )\n\nIn a small room at a neighborhood clinic in Sacramento, a handful of hepatitis C patients wait to see their physician, hoping they\u2019ll be found sick enough to be approved for a cure.\n\n\u201cThere are very few tools in our toolbox\u201d to control pharmaceutical spending Diana Dooley, secretary of California\u2019s Health and Human Services\n\nThe low-income patients hope to be prescribed new breakthrough drugs, such as Sovaldi or Harvoni, which offer cures with almost no side effects. But treating the virus comes with a high price tag: at least $84,000 for a course of treatment. Getting Medi-Cal to pay for such drugs can involve a long, arduous process of tests and paperwork to prove infection has progressed to liver damage.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re practically dead \u2026 they\u2019ll approve you,\u201d said Laura Castillo, 54, who has been navigating the Medi-Cal system for four months to get Sovaldi. The former legal clerk said she contracted the virus from a blood transfusion in the early 1980s. Patients can live for years symptom free with hepatitis C, but left untreated, it can eventually lead to liver disease and death. Castillo has waited for treatment with substantial liver damage, which burdens her with overwhelming fatigue, depression and what she describes as a \u201cbrain fog.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very frustrating, knowing that you have an illness and there is a cure, and you can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Castillo said.\n\nCastillo\u2019s physician, Dr. Catherine Moizeau, says she treats hundreds of Medi-Cal patients who wait months to get approval for the hepatitis C drugs. Moizeau says health plans, under state guidelines, are rationing the drugs because of the high cost. But Medi-Cal officials say patients receive the treatments based on medical necessity, not on cost.\n\nHepatitis C drugs are not the only part of California\u2019s troubling drug spending picture. Despite recent cost-cutting measures, such as putting tighter controls on which patients get coverage for which drugs and when, California\u2019s spending on pharmaceuticals has gone up, and so has the number of pricey drugs it is covering. It\u2019s not clear state agencies have the means to balance drug cost pressures in a way that serves the best interests of patients, taxpayers and public health.\n\n\u201cThere are very few tools in our toolbox\u201d to control pharmaceutical spending, said Diana Dooley, secretary of California\u2019s Health and Human Services. She says high prescription drug costs are a problem across California\u2019s public and private health insurance, and should be addressed on a national level.\n\nDrug price concerns will also be a matter of public policy debate this year. California voters are expected to decide in November on a measure to put a ceiling on what the state pays for drugs, and lawmakers have proposed drug price transparency requirements on pharmaceutical manufacturers and health insurers.\n\n\u201cWe all have to do everything we can to try to control these drug costs,\u201d Dooley said.\n\nA CALmatters analysis found that state prisons, a California public pension system, and one subset of the Medi-Cal program spent $600 million more on pharmaceuticals in 2014 than in 2012. That does not include the Medi-Cal population in a health plan, nor does it account for discounts the state may have received from drugmakers.\n\nOver the past decade, Medi-Cal has seen a 57 percent increase in the drugs it covers that cost $600 or more per prescription. And when it comes to hepatitis C drugs alone, Medi-Cal estimates it will spend almost $482 million over this fiscal year and last. As of September 2015, only 4,200 Medi-Cal patients had received the drugs in that time period, out of 237,000 who are estimated to have the disease.\n\nThese cost trends exist despite new protocols various state agencies have introduced to tamp down on pharmaceutical spending, which include stricter controls on which patients get which prescription drugs and how.\n\n\u201cThe people that pay for health care, be it the government or employers, are asking for more prior authorization because we\u2019re having to scrutinize every penny we spend now,\u201d said Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, which manages pharmacy benefits for health plans nationally, including 7.5 million Californians.\n\nMiller said involvement from the payer is meant to get \u201cthe right patient, the right drug, at the right dose.\u201d But the process, can be \u201cclunky\u201d and cause delays and frustrations for patients like Castillo.\n\nDrugmakers say the value of the new hepatitis C drugs, the first of which hit the market at the end of 2013, is worth the cost, and in the long term, may eventually even bring savings to the health system.\n\nThe new hepatitis C drugs involve only a few months of treatment, and produce a cure in about 90 percent of patients. The older generation of treatments are cheaper, but are also about half as effective, and have side-effects that resemble the flu.\n\n\u201cThese patients are now healthier. They\u2019re more productive. They\u2019re functioning,\u201d said Priscilla VanderVeer, deputy vice president of communications at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have less people who need long-term medication therapy for their hep C, they\u2019re not going to need liver transplants, they\u2019re not going to need significant hospitalizations,\u201d VanderVeer said.\n\nHealth consumer advocates and economists argue that paying a lot for some drugs that only treat a limited population may not serve larger public health interests, or be the best use of taxpayer dollars.\n\nFor example, if the cost of the new hepatitis C drugs were cheaper, the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on treating just a few thousand patients could have been spent to help eradicate the disease, says Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, an advocacy group.\n\n\u201cYou could imagine a strategy to provide this cure in a much more broad population strategy,\u201d Wright said.\n\nSpecialty drugs, which the federal government defines as costing $600 or more a month, are raising concern among health insurers and state agencies. In CalPERS, for instance, specialty drugs are taking up a larger share of total drug expenditures, despite the fact that they account for a small percentage of prescriptions.\n\nDrugmakers are investing more in these types of drugs, said Joel Hay, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Southern California, because \u201cthe profits are very high.\u201d\n\nBut paying a high price for drugs that treat a small number of patients raises an equity question, Hay said. It may not be fair to the larger patient population for a health system to pay a high price for cancer drugs that extend a patient\u2019s life by three weeks.\n\n\u201cYou can get a lot more lives saved if you take that budget and put it into colon cancer screening or any number of other more efficient, more effective interventions,\u201d Hay said.\n\nThe cost pressure from specialty drugs may not go away soon. Pharmaceutical benefits manager Express Scripts estimates that this class of drugs will continue to grow in Medicaid programs by 13.6 percent over the next three years.\n\n\u201cAre we going to have a sustainable (pharmaceutical) industry where we are making sure the drug companies make enough money where they can bring great new products to the marketplace, yet we control cost well enough that people \u2013- all people, even the most vulnerable \u2014 have access to the drugs they need?\u201d asked Miller.\n\nState Medi-Cal administrators say it\u2019s too soon to assess the sustainability of current prescription drug spending trends. Meantime, their guidelines about which patients can get covered by new hepatitis C drugs has recently loosened up. As of July 2015, patients with a less advanced stage of liver disease can get covered for the drugs, as well as IV drug users and women who want to get pregnant.\n\nCastillo got her medication in March, after an attorney helped her challenge denied coverage for Sovaldi through a health insurance regulator. Castillo says she\u2019s glad she\u2019s in treatment now, but she doesn\u2019t know why her Medi-Cal health plan made it so hard for her to get the medicine.\n\n\u201cThey need to get it together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our health and our life that they\u2019re messing with.\u201d\n\nCALmatters data reporter Matt Levin contributed to this article.
