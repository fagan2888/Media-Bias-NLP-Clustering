Hunt will face questioning by the committee in September.\n\nThe \u00a372,000 cap was due to be introduced in April 2016 as part of the second phase of the Care Act. It was put back until 2020 after councils wrote to the Department of Health asking for the launch to be deferred, due to funding pressures faced by local authorities.\n\nIn her letter, Wollaston also asked whether the introduction of the national living wage was \u201cresponsible for delaying implementation of the Care Act\u201d. Care organisations have expressed concern that the new living wage will have a huge impact on the cost of delivering care.\n\nReaction to the delay has been mixed, with many care organisations expressing relief that local authorities would not have to try to fund the introduction of the cap next year. Harold Bodmer, vice president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said: \u201cthe pressures of rising demand, punitively reduced budgets and the impending obligation to pay an enhanced national living wage have all put an intolerable strain on social care finance\u201d. But Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of Alzheimer\u2019s Society, argued that the delay would \u201ccause unacceptable costs to continue to be borne by people with dementia and their families into the next decade\u201d.\n\nWhat do you think of the delay: is it justifiable? If you work for a local authority, do you think it would have been possible to implement the cap next year? Or are you an older or disabled person, or their relative, wondering how to afford care now that the cap won\u2019t be imposed for another four years.\n\nWe want to hear your views \u2013 let us know what you think in the comments section below, or tweet us @GdnSocialCare.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "With Jeremy Hunt facing questioning by the health select committee, tell us what you think about the four-year delay of the cap", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Ruth Hardy", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "With Jeremy Hunt facing questioning by the health select committee, tell us what you think about the four-year delay of the cap", "title": "How will the delay of the cap on care costs affect you?", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/jul/27/delay-cap-care-costs", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/27/1437996859140/f9e5cc32-8b90-44eb-9349-be2010ffb068-2060x1236.jpeg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=8dd32aa7ee759df670245bf118e4c1ff", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://social-care-network/2015/jul/27/delay-cap-care-costs?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/jul/27/delay-cap-care-costs", "iphone": "gnmguardian://social-care-network/2015/jul/27/delay-cap-care-costs?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "site": "@guardian", "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/27/1437996859140/f9e5cc32-8b90-44eb-9349-be2010ffb068-2060x1236.jpeg", "creator": "@ruthhardy22"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://social-care-network/2015/jul/27/delay-cap-care-costs?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "social care network: adult social care hub,Social Care Network,Social care,Society,Policy,Work practices,Jeremy Hunt,Health,Sarah Wollaston", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-07-27T13:02:52.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ruth-hardy", "section": "Social Care Network", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T13:02:52.000Z", "tag": "social care network: adult social care hub,Social Care Network,Social care,Society,Policy,Work practices,Jeremy Hunt,Health,Sarah Wollaston"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/27/1437996859140/f9e5cc32-8b90-44eb-9349-be2010ffb068-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=f1c473d4ea64b1b567995361c6a94c6a", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "social care network: adult social care hub,Social Care Network,Social care,Society,Policy,Work practices,Jeremy Hunt,Health,Sarah Wollaston"}, "article_summary": "Care organisations have expressed concern that the new living wage will have a huge impact on the cost of delivering care.\nThe delay of the cap on care costs until 2020 was announced more than a week ago, but the story was given new life on Sunday when the Observer reported that the U-turn had cost taxpayers between \u00a350m\u2013\u00a3100m.\nIn her letter, Wollaston also asked whether the introduction of the national living wage was \u201cresponsible for delaying implementation of the Care Act\u201d.\nThe \u00a372,000 cap was due to be introduced in April 2016 as part of the second phase of the Care Act.\nReaction to the delay has been mixed, with many care organisations expressing relief that local authorities would not have to try to fund the introduction of the cap next year."}
