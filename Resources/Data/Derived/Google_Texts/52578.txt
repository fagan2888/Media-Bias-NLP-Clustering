TAPPER: ...I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is even if you don't know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing you. Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support?



TRUMP: Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I'd have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.



TAPPER: The Ku Klux Klan?



TRUMP: There are groups in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair. So give me a list of the groups and I'll let you know.



TAPPER: OK, I mean I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...



TRUMP: I don't know anything -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I've ever met him, I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him, and I just don't know anything about him.

As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. pic.twitter.com/OIXFKPUlz2 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016

"He said he doesn't know who David Duke is. But the fact is that in the early 1990s, or at some point ten or 15 years ago when Donald Trump was thinking about running for president in the Reform Party, one of the reasons why he said he wasn't going to run is because David Duke is part of the Reform Party. So he knows exactly who David Duke is."

Donald Trump knew David Duke was a klansman in 2000, yet denies knowledge of him now. https://t.co/P3eMUj3lWP pic.twitter.com/kJQUKqMxim — Justin Green (@JGreenDC) February 28, 2016

My God.

This is Trump implying that the judge in the Trump U. case is against him because the judge is Hispanic. pic.twitter.com/lpjJJkOUqp — Benny (@bennyjohnson) February 27, 2016
