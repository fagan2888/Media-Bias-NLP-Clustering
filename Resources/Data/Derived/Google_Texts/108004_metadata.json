That\u2019s because of a lack of funding from Congress combined with increased responsibilities.\n\nThe 2015 tax filing season \u201cwill be one of the most complicated filing seasons we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d IRS Commissioner John Koskinen warned at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) National Tax Conference in Washington, DC Thursday. \u201cAll we can do is try to maximize our services as well as we can; as well as we can is still going to be miserable. You really do get what you pay for.\u201d\n\nKoskinen followed National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson \u2012 who\u2019s been in that role since 2001 \u2012 at the conference. And she was even gloomier with her predictions.\n\n\u201cThe filing season is going to be the worst filing season since I\u2019ve been the national taxpayer advocate; I\u2019d love to be proved wrong, but I think it will rival the 1985 filing season when returns disappeared,\u201d she told the audience of tax practitioners, according to Forbes.\n\nNearly half the frustrated tax filers who call won\u2019t be able to reach the IRS in 2015.\n\n\u201cPhone service could plummet to 53 percent,\u201d Koskinen said. That number is a massive decrease from \u201can already unacceptable 72 [percent]\u201d during the last filing season, Forbes reported.\n\nOlson also noted that taxpayers who do manage eventually to get a person at the IRS on the other end of the line in the upcoming filing season will have waited on hold for an average of 34 minutes. For the practitioner priority hotline, that average wait time is expected to be 52 1/3 minutes, making \u201cpriority\u201d a dubious adjective, she said.\n\nIt will be even worse for those filing outside the US. \u201cIf they are overseas, who are they going to call? There is not toll free number,\u201d Olson noted.\n\nThe IRS commissioner blamed budget woes for the upcoming poor customer service. The House has voted to cut the IRS budget for 2015 by $341 million, and the Senate has proposed to increase it by $240 million \u2012 which would still be seven percent below the agency\u2019s 2010 funding levels, Forbes reported.\n\nBut the tax agency also has increased responsibilities with its decreased funding: The IRS is in charge of implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA, better known as \u201cObamacare\u201d) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).\n\nOlson said she\u2019s very concerned about the IRS receiving accurate information from the health exchanges. It won\u2019t be the IRS\u2019s fault, but taxpayers will likely put the blame on the IRS.\n\nAnother program the IRS will implement for the first time this filing season is one of voluntary oversight for return preparers. Koskinen wants it to be a mandatory program, but that hasn\u2019t occurred yet. In the meantime, there will be a page on the IRS website with a database of qualified tax preparers, including unregulated preparers who chose to participate in the voluntary education programs. Attorneys, CPAs and enrolled agents, who all have separate licensing requirements, will also be listed.\n\nThere is also the issue of tax extenders \u2012 a collection of over 50 bills that need to be passed by the lame-duck Congress before the end of the year, with no guarantee they will become laws, according to Forbes. Koskinen warned that if the uncertainty continues into December, it could delay the start of the filing season and delay tax refunds.\n\n\u201cThe continuing uncertainty about the extender legislation imposes stress not only on the IRS but the entire tax community, including everyone in this room,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also wants Congress to pass penalty relief for taxpayers affected by the IRS\u2019s shutdown of its e-services over the Columbus Day weekend, the Journal of Accountancy reported.\n\nBut it may be difficult for Koskinen to receive any cooperation from Congress, where the agency is deeply unpopular after a seriesofscandals.\n\n\u201cIRS Commissioner John Koskinen is going to spend so much time testifying to congressional committees, he may as well bring a cot up to Capitol Hill. His agency\u2019s budget is likely to be slashed even more deeply,\u201d the Tax Policy Center wrote. \u201cBut under GOP pressure, will Treasury and IRS back down on regulatory efforts to curb corporate inversions or control the use of 501(c)4 non-profits by political organizations?\u201d\n\nKoskinen\u2019s AICPA conference speech wasn\u2019t all doom-and-gloom, however. He noted that the IRS is doing a much better job of combating tax identity theft, calling it \u201cone of the three or four most important issues we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nAfter criminal investigations, arrests, and sentencing of between 1,200 and 1,500 individuals, plus better refund safeguards, improper payments to identity thieves are now lower but still a significant problem, with an anticipated 3,000 to 4,000 victims likely this coming year, the Journal of Accountancy noted. The IRS issued $3.6 billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns for tax year 2011, down from $5.2 billion in 2010, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten most of the amateurs off the street; what we\u2019re left with is organized crime here and organized crime syndicates around the world,\u201d Koskinen told attendees. The IRS is also doing a better job than before of correcting victims\u2019 accounts, reducing the time required from a year to under 120 days, \u201cwhich is still too long,\u201d he noted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Internal Revenue Service is gearing up to be hated even more than usual due to a \u201cmiserable\u201d tax filing season, the agency\u2019s commissioner warned.
