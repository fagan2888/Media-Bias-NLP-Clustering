This reporter probably should've seen "The Skeleton Twins" before he interviewed the film's stars, Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader. But if he had, we wouldn't have this hilariously awkward moment.

News anchor Chris Parente starts off his interview with Hader and Wiig by asking them to describe the film's plot. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Parente asks Wiig, "Kristen, I am thinking, on this program, of doing the news completely full-frontal, completely nude. Do you recommend that? Do you have advice for going nude?"

Wiig, like everyone else, was completely thrown off by the question: "Um, do I have advice for going nude?"

When Parente says, "You do it in the film!" Wiig quickly catches onto his mistake.

"Not this movie. That's a different movie," Wiig clarifies, referring to her nude scene in "Welcome To Me."

The "Bridesmaids" actress ended up saving the totally awkward moment, listing off ridiculous plot twists that never actually happen in "The Skeleton Twins." Luckily, Parente was interviewing two actors with a sense of humor.
