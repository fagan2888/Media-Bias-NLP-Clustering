Only 37% approve of Obamacare but 70% of those with Obamacare rate their plan as "Good" or "Excellent.” – Gallup http://t.co/Lk78KAbcwM — Anthony De Rosa (@AntDeRosa) November 17, 2014

In spite of seeing all the promises about plans you can keep and how much money it will save everybody, there’s a rude awakening that accompanies the sign-up process, even when used as stopgap coverage:
