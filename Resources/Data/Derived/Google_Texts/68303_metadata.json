I respect and admire him. Just doing the math.\"\n\nGreat plan, Wahlberg! Except for the fact that 600,000,000 divided by 300,000,000 is two.\n\nRealizing his mistake, Wahlberg apologized and laughed it off: \"I know my math is f***ed. Ha Ha Ha!

Load up the website and healthcare for all!\u201d\n\nWahlberg's tweets have since been deleted, but he did leave us with these:\n\nPeople really need help and care and I don't feel good making light of it.
