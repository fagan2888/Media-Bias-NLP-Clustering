Its members will also have the right to commandeer the personal vehicles of ordinary Russians \u201cto come to the scene of an extraordinary event or chase criminals.\u201d The force will be empowered to stop citizens and demand their identification \u201cif there are sufficient grounds to suspect them of committing a crime or an administrative offence\u201d and to detain them either on suspicion of wrongdoing if they were unable to satisfactorily prove their identity.\n\nFurther, Interfax news service, also controlled by the Kremlin, reported that members of the guard will have the authority to enter peoples\u2019 homes to apprehend suspects. In addition, \u201cAn employee of the National Guard troops has the right to use physical force, special instruments or firearms without warning.\u201d\n\nBut Russians who feel concerned about the introduction of a new military force set loose across the country, and run by a man who allegedly knocked out a colleague with a punch to the head during a meeting, should also note that there will be significant restrictions on the National Guard with regard to the use of force.\n\nRelated: Putin Plays Defense in Advance of Corruption Report\n\nFor example, randomly shooting pregnant women is out of the question.\n\nTASS, again, reports that the bill establishing rules to guide the new force includes the following language: \u201cIt shall be prohibited to use firearms against women with the visible signs of pregnancy, people with the apparent signs of disability and underage persons, except for the cases when such persons put up armed resistance, make an assault involving a group of attackers or commit another attack threatening the life and health of citizens or a National Guard serviceman, and it shall also be prohibited to use firearms at largely crowded places, if their use may casually hurt people,\u201d the bill reads.\n\nOf course, the unstated assumption in that language \u2013 that the use of firearms in cases not enumerated in the legislation is permissible \u2013 should concern nobody.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has established a new \u201cNational Guard\u201d that will have police powers within Russia.
