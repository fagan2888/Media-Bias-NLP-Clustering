People living in rich countries across the world have gained more than 10 years in life expectancy since 1970 - but Americans are lagging behind, new research today reveals.

Men and women living in the US can expect to live until the age of 78.8 - ranking the nation 27th out of 34 in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Forty years ago, Americans lived a year longer than the average, but today they have fallen well below the average, the study warns.

At the same time, the US outstripped other nations in per capita health expenditure, spending two-and-a-half times more than the average within the OECD, which also includes a handful of emerging economies such as Mexico and Turkey.

While life expectancy around the world has risen by an average of 10 years in rich nations, the US is lagging behind. It is among the bottom 10 countries for life expectancy, according to a new report

Life expectancy at birth measures how long someone born today would live if current mortality rates continued to apply.

In reality, improvements in medicine means that age spans are likely to increase over time.

Average lifespan across all nations reached 80.5 years in 2013, an increase of more than 10 years since 1970.

A persistent gap in life expectancy between women, who live longer, and men has gradually narrowed from about seven years to five, the study found.

Japan - at 83.4 years - along with Switzerland and Spain topped the charts for life expectancy in 2013, followed by Italy, France and Australia, according to the annual overview of health metrics.

At the bottom of the 34-strong ranking were Slovakia, Hungary and, in last place, Mexico, where life expectancy was nine years less than in Japan or Spain.

The obesity rate among adults in the United States is the highest of all OECD countries, with the rate reaching 36.5 per cent in 2010

Several factors account for the poor and declining life expectancy in the US, the report said, starting with its weak public health sector and the millions of Americans who remain uninsured.

High income inequality, illegal drug use, along with high rates of obesity, traffic accidents and homicide also push average life spans down.

Looking at major risk factors -- smoking, alcohol and obesity -- the US ranked last on the obesity index, but was among healthiest nations for tobacco consumption.

Austria, Estonia, France and Hungary scored very poorly across two risk categories: smoking and drinking.

Hungarians were the only people to seriously overindulge in all three.

Sweden and Norway were the only countries among the 34 in which all three risk factors remained very low.

In analysing a range of other health habits of OECD member nations, the report revealed people living in Japan and Italy were virtuous when it came to alcohol and overeating, but fell into the middle of the pack regarding smoking.

Tobacco intake showed a surprising variation across nations.

Iceland is the only country in which more women smoked than men, but the overall rate of tobacco consumption was among the lowest among rich countries.

The largest disparity among OECD nations was in South Korea, where some 37 per cent of men smoked, and less than five per cent of women.

Among non-OECD countries included in the report, more than 70 per cent of men in Indonesia consumed tobacco compared to three per cent of women.

After Indonesia, the countries with the highest rate of smoking among men were Latvia, China, Russia and Greece.

Another category with large differences across countries and between sexes was suicide.

The countries with the lowest rates of suicide - at seven or fewer per 100,000 people - were Turkey, Greece, Mexico, Italy and Israel.

The country with the highest percentage by far of people taking their own lives was South Korea, which averaged 30 per 100,000 people.

For men, however, that figure shot up to nearly 45 per 100,000.

In all nations, the rate of suicide among women was at least twice as low as for men, and in many cases several times lower.

The report's authors note: 'The US health care system performs very well in the area of cancer care, achieving higher rates of screening and survival for several types of cancer than most other developed countries.

'However, the United States performs badly in preventing costly hospital admissions for chronic conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes, which should normally be managed through proper primary care.

'The obesity rate among adults in the United States is the highest of all OECD countries, with the rate reaching 36.5 per cent in 2010, up from 30.7 per cent in 2000.

'This is more than twice as high as the OECD average, although the obesity rate in several countries is under-estimated because it is based on selfreports of height and weight.

'As is the case in several other countries, the obesity rate in the United States tends to be higher among disadvantaged socio-economic groups, especially in women.
