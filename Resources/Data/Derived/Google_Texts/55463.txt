GoHealth Urgent Care, Atlanta, and Dignity Health, San Francisco, have entered into a joint venture to open several urgent care centers in the San Francisco Bay Area reflecting the ongoing trend of providers making convenient and lower-cost health care available to patients.

"Our partnership with GoHealth will provide more options to Bay Area residents for fast and convenient care in a lower-cost setting," says Todd Strumwasser, Dignity Health's senior vice president of operations for the Bay Area.

"These urgent care centers will be staffed with Dignity Health clinicians so that we can meet consumers where they are and provide the high-quality care that we are known to deliver," he says. Staff will include physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
