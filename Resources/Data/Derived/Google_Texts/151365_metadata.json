The move could add fuel to arguments the government was ill-prepared for the HealthCare.gov launch.\n\nBy late September, the cost of computer cloud space needed to share plan and price information with insurance seekers on HealthCare.gov and state-run Obamacare exchanges had already tripled to $37 million from roughly $11 million when Verizon\u2019s cloud division Terremark first won the contract in 2011. The September modification brought that price tag to $46 million, more than four times CMS\u2019 original estimate.\n\nThere was no requirement in Verizon\u2019s contract that its cloud support a target number of concurrent users, so CMS was forced to purchase additional computing power, the agency said.\n\nThe document posted on Friday is a limited source justification. That means CMS bought cloud storage directly from Verizon because there wasn\u2019t enough time to competitively bid for the service before HealthCare.gov\u2019s planned launch four days later.\n\nFederal contracting rules require agencies to post a justification for such non-competitive contracts within 30 days of implementing them. CMS did not immediately respond to a Nextgov query asking why this justification wasn\u2019t posted until roughly four months later.\n\nHealthCare.gov performed disastrously upon launch, shutting most insurance seekers out of the site for several weeks. It has performed generally well since December, following a round-the-clock repair process.\n\nHouse Republicans claim the site may still contain security gaps that could endanger insurance seekers\u2019 personal information. CMS officials say the site meets all government security requirements and has never been successfully hacked.\n\n(Image via phloxii/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joseph Marks", "description": "The cost of the Obamacare cloud has quadrupled since Verizon first won the contract.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "The cost of the Obamacare cloud has quadrupled since Verizon first won the contract.", "title": "HHS Bought More Cloud Storage in the Days Before HealthCare.gov Launched", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/health/2014/01/hhs-bought-additional-cloud-storage-healthcaregov-just-days-site-launched/77588/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/01/27/012714medicalcloudNG_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The cost of the Obamacare cloud has quadrupled since Verizon first won the contract.", "creator": "@Joseph_Marks_", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/01/27/012714medicalcloudNG_1/open-graph.jpg", "title": "HHS Bought More Cloud Storage in the Days Before HealthCare.gov Launched", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-27T18:13:35Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/01/27/012714medicalcloudNG_1.jpg", "sailthru.title": "HHS Bought More Cloud Storage in the Days Before HealthCare.gov Launched", "keywords": "healthcare.gov data security, verizon, cms, healthcare.gov, obamacare, hhs and obamacare", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/01/27/012714medicalcloudNG_1/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare.gov-data-security,verizon,cms,healthcare.gov,obamacare,hhs-and-obamacare,channel-nextgov->-health,type-story,length-medium,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "The cost of the Obamacare cloud has quadrupled since Verizon first won the contract."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99ad\"", "article_summary": "The agency in charge of HealthCare.gov bought an emergency cache of computing power from Verizon\u2019s cloud division just days before the online insurance marketplace\u2019s troubled launch on Oct. 1, 2013, contracting documents show.\nThat means CMS bought cloud storage directly from Verizon because there wasn\u2019t enough time to competitively bid for the service before HealthCare.gov\u2019s planned launch four days later.\nHealthCare.gov performed disastrously upon launch, shutting most insurance seekers out of the site for several weeks.\nHouse Republicans claim the site may still contain security gaps that could endanger insurance seekers\u2019 personal information.\nVerizon added that cloud space on Sept. 30, the day before HealthCare.gov went live, according to the notice posted on Friday to the Federal Business Opportunities contracting website."}
