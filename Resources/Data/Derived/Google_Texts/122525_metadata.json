It's the middle ones that don't get as much help because they are out there working two wages ... but basically one wage is coming back to cover childcare fees straight away so I don't think it's going to be a big help.\"\n\nThe owner of Sydney-based Heaven for Kids Daycare centre, Donna Mitrani, agrees.\n\n\"Especially if people have two or three children in child care, it's going to be totally unaffordable for families,\" she said.\n\nFederal Childcare Minister Sussan Ley spoke to the ABC and appeared positive about the proposal to extend the subsidies to cover qualified nannies, which the Government had asked the Productivity Commission to examine.\n\n\"There is a role for in-home child care, clearly,\" she said.\n\n\"We've had so many submissions to that effect and I hear from parents all the time, worried all day that their boss is going to keep them back past the time the childcare centre closes.\n\n\"In the end, they decide to drop out of that level of the workforce, or maybe go back part-time or do a job they're not qualified or trained for.\n\n\"All of this detracts from workplace productivity and economic output for the economy as a whole.\"\n\nBut Ms Ley says the jury is out on the proposal to means-test the childcare rebate.\n\n\"At the moment we have no plans to means-test ... and we are really at an early point in the process by which we would see final legislation brought to the Parliament,\" she said.\n\n\"But also the Productivity Commission has asked for a lot of feedback, both about the way the cost model would be structured and how it would apply to people on different incomes.\"\n\nThe Productivity Commission has called for submissions on the proposals in the draft report.\n\nThe final report is due to be handed to the Government in October.\n\nTopics: child-care, family-and-children, government-and-politics, business-economics-and-finance, australia\n\nFirst posted", "article_metadata": {"ABC_WCMS_sitesearch_include": "true", "ContentId": 5613108, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/5268496-1x1-700x700.jpg", "site": "@ABCNews", "card": "summary"}, "ICBM": "-26.000,134.500", "keywords": "childcare rebate, means-test, means-testing, nannies, productivity commission", "DC.language": "en-AU", "DC.title": "Childcare rebate 'should be means-tested'", "geo.position": "-26.000;134.500", "DCTERMS.modified": "2014-07-22T18:32:00+1000", "DC.type": "Current", "DC.date": "2014-07-22T00:19:34+1000", "DCTERMS.spatial": "east=134.500;north=-26.000", "DC.creator.CorporateName": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "ABC.site": "ABC News", "DCTERMS.issued": "2014-07-22T00:19:34+1000", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ABC News", "description": "The Productivity Commission suggests the childcare rebate should be means-tested and could cover nannies.
