It\u2019s totally at odds with the origins of that first federal law.\n\nIndiana\u2019s law is being championed by religious conservatives and opposed by secular liberals. In an intense press conference on Tuesday, embattled Republican Governor Mike Pence declared, \u201cI believe religious liberty is our first freedom.\u201d But the original RFRA was signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton in 1993 after the state of Oregon refused to pay unemployment insurance to a couple of Native Americans who got canned as drug-rehab counselors for using peyote in religious ceremonies. RFRA was passed to remedy such an obvious injustice and its main sponsor in the House was liberal congressman Charles Schumer, who\u2019s expected to become the next Senate Minority Leader and is most famous for trying to ban every goddamned good-time substance known to mankind, from Four Loko to powdered caffeine to \u201cdelicious-looking detergent.\u201d\n\nWeirder still: Arch-conservative Jesse Helms, a hardcore Christian who was an unapologetic homophobe, was one of just three senators who voted against the law. Writing for the majority in Employment Division v. Smith, the drug warrior Antonin Scalia thundered that letting religion provide a loophole in such an instance \u201cwould open the prospect of constitutionally required exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\u201d\n\nWhat a long strange trip it\u2019s been to today, man. Conservatives now see state-level RFRAs as the last, best hope of keeping religiously minded individuals from having to bake wedding cakes for gays, shoot video at gay weddings, and (at least theoretically) perform stripteases at same-sex bachelor parties. And liberals such as openly gay Apple CEO Tim Cook say such laws \u201callow people to discriminate against their neighbors.\u201d\n\nBoth sides are partly right. And they are both annoying and self-aggrandizing in their righteousness. Given the paucity of actual cases in play\u2014virtually all news accounts recycle a handful of incidents in a few states\u2014it\u2019s clear that the main function of the current controversy is to make religious conservatives feel even more persecuted than usual and to make secular liberals feel as if they are making a last stand for human decency. As my Reason colleague Scott Shackford puts it, \u201cIndiana\u2019s RFRA\u2014and the response\u2014is all about the signaling.\u201d\n\nIf religious conservatives are truly an embattled minority\u2014didn\u2019t you know that being anti-Christian is \u201cthe last acceptable prejudice\u201d?\u2014then why the hell are all prospective candidates for the Republican presidential nomination kowtowing to such folks in Iowa, South Carolina, and basically everywhere else around the country? And why did Ted Cruz, the first Republican to officially declare his presidential aspirations, kick off his campaign at Liberty University, founded by the Moral Majority\u2019s Jerry Falwell, which is proud of being \u201cthe largest Christian university in the world\u201d?\n\nFer chrissakes, even Democratic candidates dutifully proffer their Christian bona fides and the last three Democratic presidents\u2014Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama\u2014were pretty fond of \u201cpraying publicly on street corners.\u201d Atheist politicians should have it so easy.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to suggest that America is the same seething pit of homophobia it was during Three\u2019s Company thousand-year reign of terror, either. When it comes to attitudes about homosexuality and same-sex marriage, liberals are part of a large and growing majority that supports equality. Fully 66 percent of Americans agree that \u201cgay or lesbian relations between consenting adults should be legal\u201d (up from 50 percent in 1999) and 55 percent believe that \u201cmarriages between same-sex couples should\u2026be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages\u201d (up from 35 percent in 1999). Thirty-seven states recognize gay marriage already and a coming Supreme Court decision could well help run the rest of the table.\n\nFrom a libertarian perspective, there\u2019s an easy enough way to resolve the current conflict between demands for religious freedom and equality. It doesn\u2019t fully satisfy either side but it has the virtue of preserving a pluralistic society and minimizing intervention into everyday life.\n\nThe starting point should be to focus on discrimination by the government, which was the impetus behind the original federal RFRA\u2014Oregon refused to pay out unemployment based on religiously based drug use. Conservatives typically say they believe in limited government and individual rights and that the government shouldn\u2019t play favorites or accord certain people or classes of people special treatment (this is their argument against affirmative action). If they mean what they say in other contexts, conservatives should be in the forefront of pushing for marriage equality, as the state has no case for treating individuals differently under the law.\n\nFor their part, liberals should recognize the limits to and wisdom of injecting state power into every possible relationship in the country. As wrong and stupid as I think it is for a particular individual or business to discriminate against a customer or neighbor based on sexual orientation (or race, gender, and class for that matter), that should be the business\u2019s decision, especially if the business is only one service provider among many.\n\nNobody should be forced to do something they don\u2019t want to do, whether it\u2019s bake cakes for gay weddings or decorate cakes with anti-gay slurs. To me, whether a person\u2019s or a business\u2019s decision is based in religion is immaterial.\n\nWhatever you may think of Jack Phillips\u2019s refusal to bake a wedding cake for gay customers, there\u2019s something as or more disturbing about the court ruling against the owner of Lakewood, Colorado\u2019s Masterpiece Cakeshop. Not only was the baker forced to change his store policy, he and his staff were required to attend sensitivity training. That sounds like something out of China during the Cultural Revolution. It doesn\u2019t help that Phillips offered to make the original complainants any sort of item but a wedding cake.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t agree with Phillips\u2019s beliefs in this case, but such disagreements are one of the prices we pay for living in a free society, in which we seriously recognize and respect that different people have different value systems. It\u2019s worth noting that in the segregated South, very different rules applied. It was common, for instance, that local and state governments and laws actively prevented businesses from treating customers equally. When laws were not openly racist, \u201ccitizen\u2019s councils\u201d and terror groups such as the Ku Klux Klan enforced a de facto standard against businesses that treated all customers equally. This is not the case today with regards to gays and lesbians.\n\nBy the same token, any individuals or businesses that exclude certain sorts of business can\u2019t exactly bitch and moan when people decide to publicize such policies and organize boycotts, as is happening to the entire state of Indiana now.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Indiana Governor Mike Pence now says he hopes to fix the law with more legislation. \u201cThe issue here is still is tolerance a two-way street,\u201d he told ABC News over the weekend. Of course it is, and the same right that allows a business to opt out of serving some customers also allows others to respond by taking their business elsewhere. Last year, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a RFRA-style bill precisely because of possible economic fallout.\n\nReal and threatened boycotts may or may not be hypocritical. The Federalist\u2019s Sean Davis is delighted to document how Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy, who has called for a ban on state-funded travel to Indiana, doesn\u2019t realize that his own state\u2019s RFRA is more expansive than Indiana\u2019s.\n\nMaybe, but who cares, really? Conservatives cheered the decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which held that certain businesses could be granted religious exemptions from some aspects of Obamacare. Specifically, the court found that Hobby Lobby didn\u2019t have to cover certain forms of birth control its owners believed to be abortifacients. Oddly\u2014hypocriticially!\u2014the company had no problem paying for some of those same contraceptives before Obamacare. Does that mean conservatives have no standing to cheer the court\u2019s ruling?\n\nIt\u2019s wrong for liberals to use the government to force everyone everywhere to act the way that they want. And it\u2019s tendentious for conservatives to insist that Indiana\u2019s RFRA law, passed to forestall religiously minded businesses from having to contravene their beliefs, wasn\u2019t really about discrimination.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "nickgillespie"}, "keywords": "Indiana,United States, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201504010915, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Indiana United States, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Everybody's Lost Their Goddamn Mind Over Religious Freedom", "tags": "entity:provinceorstate/indiana_united_states,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Both conservatives and liberals aren\u2019t being straight about the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.", "title": "Everybody's Lost Their Goddamn Mind Over Religious Freedom", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/01/everybody-s-lost-their-goddamn-mind-over-religious-freedom.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/01/everybody-s-lost-their-goddamn-mind-over-religious-freedom/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1427899271361.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Both conservatives and liberals aren\u2019t being straight about the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Nick Gillespie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-04-01T09:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/nick-gillespiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/01/everybody-s-lost-their-goddamn-mind-over-religious-freedom", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Everybody\\\\u0027s Lost Their Goddamn Mind Over Religious Freedom\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/01/everybody-s-lost-their-goddamn-mind-over-religious-freedom.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/01/everybody-s-lost-their-goddamn-mind-over-religious-freedom/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47596642.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/01/everybody-s-lost-their-goddamn-mind-over-religious-freedom\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-01T09:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Nick Gillespie\",\"tags\":[\"indiana_united_states\",\"politics\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/n/nick-gillespie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01fc\"", "article_summary": "Indiana\u2019s law is being championed by religious conservatives and opposed by secular liberals.\nConservatives cheered the decision in Burwell v.
