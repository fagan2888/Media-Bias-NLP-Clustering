As small, rural hospitals continue to adapt to changes and challenges from the Affordable Care Act, Muhlenberg Community Hospital is joining the larger Owensboro Health system.

Owensboro Health President and CEO Philip Patterson says he is unsure of the full financial impact of the ACA on the smaller hospital but he does think it may have played a small role in Muhlenberg Community signing a management contract with them last May.

â€œThey reached out to us for help a year ago when we signed the management contract and some of that may have been to some of the fiscal pressures of the ACA, but I think what it looked at is what is the right thing to do for Muhlenberg Community so that they could ensure that access to care is sustained long term in Muhlenberg," Patterson said.

The 20-year lease and asset purchase is effective starting June 1.
