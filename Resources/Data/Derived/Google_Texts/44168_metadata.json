A semi-professional runner for Newton Running, she finished in 37 minutes, 4 seconds to win by more than three minutes. Second-place Kristin Johansen of Longmont finished in 40:10.\n\n\"Coming off the Bolder Boulder, you're always a little bit flat, so it was just kind of a tester to see how I'm feeling,\" Arendt said. \"It was great.\"\n\nJustin Young of Louisville, won the men's 10K event.\n\nArendt grew up in Bailey, and was a seven-time state champion at Platte Canyon High School (two-time Class 3A cross country champion, five state titles in Class 3A track and field). She was also an 11-time All-American at Adams State College.\n\nSaturday was her first crack at the Sunrise Stampede, though.\n\n\"Last year I wanted to do it, but it just didn't work timing wise with some other stuff we had going on in summer, but it was on my to-do list,\" she said. \"It was a great morning for it. I've never run the race before, so it's a challenging course with a lot of little ups and downs out there, but it's a great race.\"\n\nArendt said her strategy was simply to \"keep it comfortable, see what guys I could roll with and kind of see where I'd come in.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also wanted to get an idea of how her legs felt before she trains for the Peachtree Road Race on July 4 in Georgia.\n\n\"That's the U.S. 10K championships this year, so I'm gearing up for that,\" she said.\n\nYoung was competing in the Stampede for the first time, too, and was more than pleased with his results. He finished in 33:46 to beat second-place Zach Watson by nearly 2 minutes. Watson, who won the event in 2013, finished in 35:31, beating his time from last year by 29 seconds.\n\nKristen Arendt smiles after winning the women's 10K on Saturday at the Sunrise Stampede in Longmont.

I felt like where I was in my fitness, just starting,\" he said. \"I didn't know if I was going to be able to hang on, to be honest. I didn't know what pace or shape I was in or anything, so I just kind of went with the feel of the race. I probably overstepped my fitness a little bit halfway through and then hung on.\"\n\nWith all he's been through, however, Young was thrilled to experience the feeling of competition again.\n\n\"It was awesome,\" he said. \"That's exactly what I wanted. I didn't expect to win at all. I just wanted to go off the leaders and see where my fitness was, and it's pretty cool finishing in a stadium. Although, that last lap felt like a mile.\"\n\nMaybe so, but Young is hoping to have many more miles ahead. His goal is to compete in the Olympic trials for the marathon in February 2016, in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It felt like a marathon (today), but it's a good start,\" he said. \"I'm happy with it.\"\n\nContact staff writer Brian Howell at howellb@dailycamera.com or on Twitter: @BrianHowell33.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2014-06-07T16:36:30-0600", "sailthru.author": "By Brian Howell \n \n  BuffZone.com Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25920270:view"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Kristen Arendt wasn't sure what to expect out of her legs less than two weeks after running the Bolder Boulder, but on Saturday, the Longmont resident found out they're just fine.", "title": "Sunrise Stampede: Arendt, Young take 10K titles", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0607/20140607__08TCSRUNNw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-06-07T16:37:16-0600", "endDate": "2024-06-07T16:34:58-0600", "description": "Kristen Arendt wasn't sure what to expect out of her legs less than two weeks after running the Bolder Boulder, but on Saturday, the Longmont resident found out they're just fine.", "byline": "By Brian HowellBuffZone.com", "pubDate": "2014-06-07T16:37:51-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-07T16:36:30-0600", "sailthru.title": "Sunrise Stampede: Arendt, Young take 10K titles", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0607/20140607__08TCSRUNNw~1_300.jpg", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Boulder Colorado Sports news, Boulder Colorado news, Sports Boulder news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Kristen Arendt wasn't sure what to expect out of her legs less than two weeks after running the Bolder Boulder, but on Saturday, the Longmont resident found out they're just fine.", "title": "Sunrise Stampede: Arendt, Young take 10K titles"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0607/20140607__08TCSRUNNw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5aa2\"", "article_summary": "The 25-year-old won the women's 10K race at the 29th Annual Sunrise Stampede, held at Longmont High School.\nKristen Arendt smiles after winning the women's 10K on Saturday at the Sunrise Stampede in Longmont.\nSecond-place Kristin Johansen of Longmont finished in 40:10.\nYoung was competing in the Stampede for the first time, too, and was more than pleased with his results.\nJustin Young of Louisville, won the men's 10K event."}
