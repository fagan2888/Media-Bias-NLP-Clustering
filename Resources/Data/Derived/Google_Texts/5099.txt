Room-letting network plans to overtake InterContinental Hotels Group and Hilton Worldwide next year

Airbnb, the room-letting network regarded as one of Silicon Valley’s hottest properties, expects to overtake InterContinental Hotels Group and Hilton Worldwide to become the world’s largest hotelier next year.

The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, who met when Mr Blecharczyk answered an advert for a roommate.

When he later moved out, the other two came up with the idea of putting airbeds in their San Francisco loft and renting them to delegates attending a design conference. They called it “Airbed and Breakfast” and Gebbia and Chesky made $1,000 on the first weekend. Airbnb was then launched with Mr Chesky as chief executive, Mr Gebbia as chief product officer and Mr Blecharczyk as chief technology officer.

Airbnb now lists nearly 500,000 properties, including 20,000 in the UK, and has found accommodation for 9m guests, including 5m in the past nine months. It says 150,000 guests stay in one of its members’ properties every night.

Mr Blecharczyk told The Sunday Telegraph: “InterContinental and Hilton have more than 650,000 rooms. We have 500,000, though they have a much higher occupancy rate.”

Asked if he expects Airbnb to overtake the two groups next year, he replied “yes”.

“If you look at our historical growth curve, I don’t think that’s going to change very quickly,” he added. “We’ve been growing bookings and revenues two to three times every year and I would expect that to continue.”
