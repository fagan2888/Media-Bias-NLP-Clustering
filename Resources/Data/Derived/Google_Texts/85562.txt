A 14-year-old girl Arizona girl who told investigators she escaped from a North Las Vegas home where she'd kept for a month and sexually attacked has been reunited with her family, police said Saturday.

North Las Vegas police Officer Steven Wiese said investigators don't believe the girl was the only teenage victim.

The girl fled Thursday afternoon from a home in a middle-class neighborhood near Camino Al Norte and Washburn Road and called 911 from a convenience store, Wiese said.

Police later stopped a vehicle and arrested 26-year-old Michael Carter Kim, who was booked Friday into the Las Vegas City Jail pending an initial court appearance on multiple felony kidnapping and child sexual assault with use of a weapon charges.

Efforts on Saturday to identify Kim's lawyer weren't immediately successful.

Wiese said police obtained a warrant and searched Kim's home on Dawn Valley Drive, finding a gun and evidence that other children may have been held and attacked.

The girl was examined at a local hospital before being reunited with her family in Bullhead City, Arizona, about 100 miles south of Las Vegas, Wiese said. Her name wasn't disclosed. The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they are victims of sex crimes.

Wiese said the girl told investigators she was abducted in early November by a man in a vehicle.
