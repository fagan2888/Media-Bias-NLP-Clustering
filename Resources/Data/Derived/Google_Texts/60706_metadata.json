He was awarded $2.5 million in damages on Tuesday in a Philadelphia court, the Philadelphia Daily News reported.\n\nAustin Pledger reportedly took an antipsychotic drug known as Risperdal as a child and wasn\u2019t \u201cadequately warned\u201d he would grow breasts as a side effect, his lawyer Thomas Kilne stated. Pledger, who has autism, was first prescribed the drug in 2002, back when Risperdal was not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in children. He was 8 years old at the time.\n\nThe drug\u2019s label said that the risk of gynecomastia \u2014 the condition of men growing female breasts \u2014 was low. But by 2006, after the FDA had approved the drug for use in children with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder problems, the label changed to report high levels of prolactin, a hormone that aids in breast growth, Kline said.\n\nWhen the FDA revised the label, Pledger was 12 and already starting to develop breasts. And the only way they could be removed was through a mastectomy.\n\nJanssen was \"disappointed\" in the court's decision, however, claiming that the drug's side effects were clear for Pledger's family and physician, according to a spokeswoman. Pledger's \"quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal,\" she argued in a statement. But the judge didn't seem to pay heed to the company's plea.\n\n\"There was a grave mistreatment of children,\" Stephen Sheller, another attorney for Pledger, told The Wall Street Journal. The company \"hid data from the FDA, prescribing doctors and parents. Documents showed they knew there was much higher percentage of children getting gynecomastia than they admitted,\" which is unfortunately common practice.\n\nRisperdal has a spotty record: in 2013, the FDA announced that Janssen Pharmaceuticals pled guilty to a charge of misbranding the drug as a treatment for dementia without it being approved by the FDA to do so. The company had to pay a $400 million criminal fine for introducing a misbranded drug, as well as $1.25 billion for another civil settlement. In addition, there are over 1,200 cases filed in Philadelphia over Risperdal waiting to be settled, Kline said.\n\n\u201c[Pledger's] trial is important publicly,\u201d Kline told the Daily News, \u201cbecause it provided for the first time a public window into the real risks of this drug.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "risperdal, janssen pharmaceuticals, antipsychotic drugs, boobs, autism", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Alabama man won a lawsuit after an antipsychotic drug gave him an accidental moob job.", "title": "Autistic Man Wins $2.5M In Damages After Drug Gives Him 46DD Breasts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/autistic-man-wins-25m-damages-after-antipsychotic-drug-gives-him-46dd-breasts-323922", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/28/moooooobs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Alabama man won a lawsuit after an antipsychotic drug gave him an accidental moob job.", "title": "Autistic Man Wins $2.5M In Damages After Drug Gives Him 46DD Breasts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/autistic-man-wins-25m-damages-after-antipsychotic-drug-gives-him-46dd-breasts-323922", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/28/moooooobs.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/28/moooooobs.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-28T15:01:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T15:01:32-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Alabama man won a lawsuit after an antipsychotic drug gave him an accidental moob job."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe111a\"", "article_summary": "A man taking an antipsychotic drug known as Risperdal developed gynecomastia, or the condition in which men grow female breasts.\nA 20-year-old Alabama man won a lawsuit against Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary) after an antipsychotic drug caused him to develop size 46DD breasts.\nWhen the FDA revised the label, Pledger was 12 and already starting to develop breasts.\nHe was awarded $2.5 million in damages on Tuesday in a Philadelphia court, the Philadelphia Daily News reported.\nAustin Pledger reportedly took an antipsychotic drug known as Risperdal as a child and wasn\u2019t \u201cadequately warned\u201d he would grow breasts as a side effect, his lawyer Thomas Kilne stated."}
