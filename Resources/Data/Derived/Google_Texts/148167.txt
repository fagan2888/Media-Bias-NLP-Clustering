Brianna Florer is being laid to rest New Year's Day.

An Oklahoma family is mourning after a 2-year-old girl died after swallowing a button battery. Brianna Florer is being laid to rest Saturday.

The Oklahoman reports Brianna died this week. Kent Vice, her grandfather, says she hadn't been feeling well for a couple days and was throwing up and had a fever.

She threw up blood late Sunday and her body turned blue, and she was taken to hospitals in Grove and then Tulsa.

Vice says his granddaughter went into surgery, but doctors couldn't stop the bleeding. The family learned that the girl likely swallowed the battery within six days of her death.

Eddie Johnson with the state medical examiner's office says the girl's autopsy is pending.

The family has a GoFundMe account to help cover funeral and other expenses.
