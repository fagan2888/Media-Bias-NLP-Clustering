Supporters of Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) — and a few of his detractors — attended a Saturday morning rally aimed at honoring the conservative firebrand for his service and greeted the senator with a 10-minute standing ovation.

The event was organized on Facebook by a trio of women who were tired of seeing polls that claimed the Republican Senator’s popularity had fallen significantly after he supported Ted Cruz and the efforts to defund Obamacare.

The Desert News reported “hundreds” attended the rally, although some Facebook posts put the numbers in the “thousands.”

One thing is for certain, the crowd was overwhelmingly in support of their senator. As he was introduced to the waiting crowd, the applause was strong and continued for ten minutes. Seriously – ten full minutes.

After the protracted ovation and chants of “Freedom! Freedom!” and “We Like Mike!” the Senator delivered a strong speech that inspired even more applause breaks.

Here is video of the lengthy applause:
