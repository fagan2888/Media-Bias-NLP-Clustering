Memories of bloodied runners and spectators are still fresh for some doctors and nurses. And now they must get ready to care for 36,000 registered runners, thousands of unofficial \u201cbandits\u201d and an expected spike in crowds along this year\u2019s route.\n\nBut as medical tent veterans reconvene for the first time since the bombings, the mood is resolute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really good to see all of you,\u201d says Chris Troyanos from behind a podium at the Keefe Technical School in Framingham last Sunday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we have been together.\u201d\n\nTroyanos, medical coordinator for the Boston Athletic Association (BAA), looks out at a sea of faces, many of whom he\u2019s worked with for years. This is the first time Troyanos has spoken publicly about the bombings that tested years of preparation and training.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously facing some new challenges,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat\u2019s OK. This team always meets them, and you\u2019ve become, in my opinion and in the opinion of many, the best marathon medical team in the world.\u201d\n\nTo respond to a possible record number of runners, there will be 1,900 volunteers, up from 1,400 last year. Troyanos said he had to turn away 600-800 people and only took, for the most part, volunteers with prior Boston Marathon experience.\n\nMany tents along the route will double in size. There will also be more cots and medical staff. Both of the two white, glistening tents at the finish line will be bigger, with one as long as a football field.\n\n2014 Marathon Medical Team Following last year\u2019s bombing, and with this year\u2019s increase in runners, here are some of the changes: 1,900 volunteers, up from 1,400 last year\n\nA near doubling of tent capacity and cots\n\nA 60-member mental health unit\n\n30 ambulances will follow runners down the course, in case there\u2019s another mass casualty\n\nRed Cross first aid stations at every mile will turn into medical stations with doctors and nurses\n\nMedical walking teams will be stationed at every water station Security Rules: for runners and for spectators\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big tent,\u201d Troyanos said. \u201cEverything we\u2019re doing on the course, and in Boston, is to increase our cot size to make sure we can handle the need.\u201d\n\nFamily members will not be allowed into any medical tent this year, except in the case of a parent accompanying a child. The BAA says this is both a security change and an effort to avoid overcrowding.\n\nA team of volunteers will carry messages and updates between loved ones behind barricades and runners or spectators inside a tent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about communication,\u201d said runner/family relations team leader Kathleen Horvath. \u201cI do think family and loved ones \u2013 they\u2019re going to be very understanding, probably less demanding this year about getting inside the tent.\u201d\n\nTighter security at this year\u2019s race means changes for everyone on the medical team. At the training session, Troyanos took dozens of questions. Some volunteers worried about getting through or over metal barriers that will line the course from Newton to the finish line. Doctors and nurses are hoping their bags of meds, tools and supplies will get advance clearance. And ham radio operators are wondering if they can pack batteries and cables into vests with many pockets since they won\u2019t be allowed to carry bags.\n\nTroyanos answered some questions and took notes on others.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have all of it worked out. These are great questions that I\u2019m writing down to just circle back on,\u201d he told several people. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a month to kind of figure it out, so I apologize if I don\u2019t have it all buttoned up. Trust me when I tell you, every day it changes.\u201d\n\nTroyanos and his team leaders began looking for ways to improve the marathon\u2019s medical response shortly after last year\u2019s race. They anticipated an important need: mental health counseling. So a team of 60 licensed professionals will be at the race expo, at the start and finish lines and along the 26.2 miles.\n\n\u201cThe plan right now is that they\u2019ll have navy blue vests on that say \u2018Psych\u2019 and should be quite easy to recognize,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Brown, the BAA\u2019s team psychologist.\n\nBrown has helped organize support programs throughout the year and webinars for volunteers and runners who live outside the Boston area. The Schwartz Center is hosting three more confidential sessions for hospital staff, first responders and medical tent volunteers. Many volunteers have formed Facebook groups and arranged informal gatherings on their own.\n\nBrown himself had trouble with loud noises after the bombings and says he fell apart once when a toilet flushed near his seat on an airplane.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our brain, being in protection mode and being in overdrive,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat fades for some people, others may feel fatigue, like it takes more emotional energy\u201d to be at this year\u2019s marathon. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will have lots of support.\u201d\n\nBrown and many others at the training said they are not afraid to volunteer again, in part because they feel prepared. Roz Puleo, a nurse practitioner from Somerville, was in one of the finish line tents last year.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of faith in the course medical directors,\u201d Puleo said. \u201cI have a lot of faith in the BAA in general. I have a lot of faith in the city of Boston and all the cities along the course, and what they\u2019re putting together. I\u2019m really not nervous.\u201d\n\nHer husband, Greg Robidoux, is a little more on edge. He remembers getting a text from Puleo, saying she thought a bomb had gone off.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay at work. I excused myself and left,\u201d Robidoux said. He began to cry. \u201cIt was a harder day for me than I tell her,\u201d Robidoux said, nodding at Puleo.\n\nRobidoux will be on the course, near his wife this year.\n\nAs she turned to leave, Puleo laughed and said there is one event that she does not want to face on April 21 \u2026 the delivering of a baby. That possibility came up during the training.\n\nMost years, there\u2019s a runner with an unusual health condition who seeks advice or clearance from the BAA medical team. Dr. Pierre d\u2019Hemecourt, one of the marathon\u2019s medical directors, says this year it\u2019s a pregnant woman who is due on race day.\n\n\u201cThe recommendation,\u201d d\u2019Hemecourt said, \u201cwas that we didn\u2019t think it was a very good idea, but that she really needed to clear this through her obstetrician.\u201d\n\nA delivery along the course fits the general advice to volunteers: prepare for the unexpected. That may include moving teams of medical personnel to the site of any disturbance. Whatever happens, Troyanos wants to see the race through. Last year, the medical team had to evacuate the finish line an hour after the bombings.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a normal close for us, it wasn\u2019t really completed last year,\u201d said Troyanos. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for and that\u2019s what I think all these people want too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "April 21 could be doubly challenging for the Boston Marathon medical team.
