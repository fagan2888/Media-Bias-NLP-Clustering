Entertainment Weekly has published a 5-minute clip of the much-hyped “Family Guy” season 13 opener, a cross-over that brings the “albino visitors” to Springfield, home of “The Simpsons.”

In “The Simpsons Guy,” Homer and Peter Griffin become “okay” friends who bond over donuts and beer, while Stewie and Bart play pranks on Moe and ride skateboards together. Bob from “Bob’s Burgers” also makes a brief cameo.

The clip debuted at the “Family Guy” panel at Comic Con, where the show’s producers discussed the upcoming season: it will involve cameos from Fox’s cancelled “The Cleveland Show,” as well as celebrity guests Liam Neeson, Jeff Garlin, Allison Janney, Joe Buck and Julie Bowen. The show’s greatest celebrity guest, Jesus, returns for the Christmas special.
