Stacey Evans, D-Smyrna, to talk about medical care in Georgia.\n\nBut the show was stolen by state Sen. Fran Millar, R-Dunwoody, who predicted that, no matter what Republican protests you hear elsewhere, Medicaid expansion under Obamacare will ultimately happen. Look at about the 15-minute mark. Said Millar:\n\n\u201cI can show you a map that shows you, in certain counties, the only people in the medical field are marriage and family therapists. We have a real problem with the number of providers, we have a problem with nurses, throughout this entire state\u2026.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have sufficient access to many portions of this state. We\u2019ve done some things. We\u2019ve consolidated some hospitals, which makes sense \u2013 some of these regional hospitals we put together. Like down there in Statesboro and down in that area.\n\n\u201cBut access is a big problem. And I believe we will expand Medicaid. I don\u2019t know when. I think we\u2019re watching some of the other states. It\u2019s being looked at.\n\n\u201cThere are plans that are out there, whether it\u2019s Arkansas, whether it\u2019s North Carolina, whether it\u2019s these particular states. But again, we want to do it so we have more control of it. You know, there\u2019s a reason these various states are applying for various waivers. They want controls, too.\n\n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s inevitable, to be honest with you. But again, I can\u2019t tell you when.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2016/01/24/gop-state-senator-i-believe-we-will-expand-medicaid/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/franmillar.png?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Last week, GPB\u2019s \u201cThe Lawmakers\u201d had Senate Majority Leader Bill Cowsert, R-Athens, and state Rep.
