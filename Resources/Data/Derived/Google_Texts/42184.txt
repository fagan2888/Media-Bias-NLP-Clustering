“As a former tax official, if I would have done that as an employee of the IRS, I would have been referred to the Justice Department, the criminal division,” she added. “I would have not only lost my job, Greta, I would have been subject to a felony of five years hard time, in a federal penitentiary. That’s what we are talking about. that’s how serious this is the. IRS has broken laws and the american people need a redress of this grievance.”
