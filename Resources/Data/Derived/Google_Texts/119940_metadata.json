Their hope is that if they can succeed here in such a red state, the organization will be replicable around the country.\n\nIt has been a challenge. As Dr. Max Michael, the dean of the school of public health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham said, \u201cThey picked one hell of a place to try out this model.\u201d\n\nThe governor, Robert Bentley, is a Republican in a Republican-dominated state where only 10 percent of the white vote went for Mr. Obama in 2008. In January, Mr. Bentley spent a good part of his State of the State address criticizing the new federal health law.\n\nAn estimated 643,000 of the 4.8 million Alabamians have no insurance and the state has the country\u2019s lowest Medicaid income cutoff, according to a 2013 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation; a parent in a family of three with household income above $3,221 does not qualify.\n\nBut if Alabamians skew conservative politically, they are liberal about philanthropy, ranked near the top in national surveys of per capita giving.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy casting the enrollment drive in a charitable, rather than political, light, organizers have been able to broaden their appeal to attract students like Megan Ryan, an Auburn University junior from Enterprise who describes herself as \u201cconservative in morals and politics.\u201d\n\nMs. Ryan, a churchgoer, has helped conduct weekly information sessions at Greater Peace Missionary Baptist Church in Opelika. \u201cIt was encouraging to see faces light up when they realize they can have health care,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m making a difference.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWayne Flynt, a retired Auburn history professor, says that 70 percent of Alabama residents were born in the state. \u201cPeople go way back in a place, with a tremendous sense of responsibility to community,\u201d he said.\n\nHe is a member of the Bama Covered advisory board and teaches Sunday school at Auburn First Baptist Church. \u201cWhat motivates a lot of these young volunteers,\u201d he said, \u201cis they come from a religious tradition that mandates they care for people.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from two national organizations that use student volunteers to assist in enrollment \u2014 Enroll America and the Young Invincibles \u2014 say they know of no other statewide organization like Bama Covered.\n\nSeveral professors of social work and public health around the state \u2014 Dr. Pamela Foster at Alabama, Emily Myers at Auburn, Akofa Bonsi at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Tracy Pressley at Alabama State University \u2014 are permitting students to fulfill case work requirements by volunteering for Bama Covered.\n\nMr. Carpenter and Mr. Liss came up with the idea in November when they were in Britain: Mr. Carpenter doing his Rhodes research, Mr. Liss working for Deutsche Bank.\n\nBy December, Mr. Liss had quit his job and Mr. Carpenter, a University of Alabama at Birmingham graduate and a former state teacher of the year, took a break from his research. \u201cThis is a historic moment for our generation,\u201d Mr. Carpenter said. \u201cThink of being a social worker in 1936, right after Social Security was enacted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Michael, the University of Alabama at Birmingham dean, gave them free office space, but mostly they work out of the back seat of Mr. Liss\u2019s 2006 Honda, where he keeps a printer, paper cutter, water bottles and thousands of leaflets, along with a suit, tie and belt for church visits.\n\nAlabama is a small universe, and Mr. Carpenter\u2019s family is well-connected. His father, David, a minister and an electrician in Florence, is widely known in the northwest corner of the state. That got the son an introduction to Mary Jolley, 86, a former director of economic and community affairs for the University of Alabama and a founder of a network of 14 family resource centers around the state.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI told people, \u2018You need to meet these two young men, they\u2019re going to do great stuff,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Jolley said.\n\nEven among the mostly middle-class student volunteers there are families with no insurance. Jalisa Jordan, a junior at Alabama State, has a stepfather who is a waiter and who has seizures. \u201cMy mom is afraid to call an ambulance,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he wakes up, he gets upset about how we\u2019re going to pay the bill.\u201d\n\nMr. Carpenter and Mr. Liss originally spoke with representatives from Enroll America, one of the bigger national organizations doing sign-up work, but decided not to partner with it because several of the leaders served in the Obama administration and the group takes money from insurance companies. \u201cPeople in Alabama don\u2019t respond to groups that are national,\u201d Mr. Carpenter said. \u201cWe have no national names, no national funding.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of a $25,000 grant from a Birmingham-based foundation and $12,500 from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital they have almost no funding at all.\n\nMr. Carpenter says the power of students is that they are not easily discouraged. That was true for Katie Carter, an occupational therapy student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Chidinma Anakwenze, a medical student there, who spent a recent Saturday visiting a dozen black barber shops and beauty salons in downtown Birmingham. They gave out leaflets and took names.\n\nAndra Sparks, a municipal court judge who was getting his hair cut at New Deal barbers, told them he knew several people who needed insurance and asked that Bama Covered send a representative to his office.\n\nDown the street, at Fashion Hair Care, the front door was locked, the windows had bars, and though the two students could see women inside getting their hair done, no one answered their shouts. \u201cIt says \u2018No Soliciting\u2019; we probably shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d said Ms. Anakwenze, who kept ringing the doorbell.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ms. Carter said, but she continued banging on a window anyway.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news",
