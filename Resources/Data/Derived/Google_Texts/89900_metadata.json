And among the studies that did look at how kids fared after screening, researchers found that some children were not receiving continued care or referrals to specialists even after being flagged as at risk.\n\n\u201cWe need to know why,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cAre pediatricians advising parents to take a wait-and-see approach? If so, that\u2019s a concern because the sooner children get treatment, the better their outcomes.\u201d\n\nThough autism can be reliably diagnosed at age 2, most children are not diagnosed until after age 4, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for autism at 18 and 24 months and health insurers are required to cover the assessments at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nResearchers behind the new study emphasized that screening is just the first step and is only effective if it leads to kids receiving appropriate services. They said further efforts are needed to ensure that children found to be at risk have access to a full diagnostic evaluation and early intervention as needed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite a heavy emphasis on expanded screening for autism, a new study suggests that little is known about whether such efforts are leading to earlier diagnosis", "og": {"site_name": "Disability Scoop", "description": "Despite a heavy emphasis on expanded screening for autism, a new study suggests that little is known about whether such efforts are leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment.", "title": "Follow-Up Lacking On Kids Flagged By Autism Screening - Disability Scoop", "url": "https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2014/02/03/follow-up-autism-screening/19071/", "image": "https://pcdn.disabilityscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/fbimage.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "disabilityscoop.com", "description": "Despite a heavy emphasis on expanded screening for autism, a new study suggests that little is known about whether such efforts are leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment.", "title": "Follow-Up Lacking On Kids Flagged By Autism Screening - Disability Scoop", "image": "https://pcdn.disabilityscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/fbimage.gif", "site": "@disabilityscoop", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 1591029299}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pcdn.disabilityscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cropped-favicon-270x270.png", "keywords": "autism,autistic,aspergers,asperger\\'s,asd,autism spectrum disorder", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/disabilityscoop", "published_time": "2014-02-03T00:01:52Z", "modified_time": "2014-02-05T13:55:25Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb284\"", "article_summary": "In a new review, researchers found that routine screening for autism has increased the number of kids flagged as possibly having the developmental disorder, but it remains unclear whether or not children go on to receive further evaluation.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowFor the review, researchers looked at 40 studies published between 1990 and 2013 examining the effectiveness of 35 different approaches for screening young children for autism.\nResearchers behind the new study emphasized that screening is just the first step and is only effective if it leads to kids receiving appropriate services.\nDespite a heavy emphasis on expanded screening for autism, a new study suggests that little is known about whether such efforts are leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment.\nAnd among the studies that did look at how kids fared after screening, researchers found that some children were not receiving continued care or referrals to specialists even after being flagged as at risk."}
