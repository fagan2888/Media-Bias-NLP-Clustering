However, some customers are finding that they\u2019re unable to view the forms through Washington Healthplanfinder and exchange officials say they\u2019re working with their contractor, Deloitte, to fix the situation.\n\nAn additional 5,000 tax forms have not been mailed because of problems with the information, including the need for data from the IRS.\n\nIn an email statement, a spokeswoman with the Washington Health Benefit Exchange, which runs the insurance marketplace, said: \u201cWe are working closely with Deloitte to have the majority of the remaining forms produced and provided to consumers as early as the end of [this] week.\u201d\n\nBellingham\u2019s Charlotte Gaston is one of those people having problems with misinformation on her 1095-A.\n\n\u201cEither I don\u2019t understand it, or there\u2019s some kind of clerical errors,\u201d Gaston said.\n\nThe forms are supposed to show month by month the amount of a person\u2019s insurance premium and how much that person received in federal tax subsidies to lower the cost of coverage. Gaston received subsidized insurance all year, but her 1095-A is missing subsidy information for five months. The information is used to make sure people didn\u2019t receive subsidies that were too large or too small based on how much their income ended up being for 2014.\n\nGaston first noticed the error through her online account, so she contacted the exchange to question it. She was told she would receive a version in the mail that would be accurate, but it was wrong, too. She\u2019s not sure if the incorrect form was mailed out before she reported the problem or after.\n\n\u201cThe people at the exchange have been nothing less than totally helpful and patient with me,\u201d Gaston said. \u201cI have no problem with these people.\u201d\n\nCustomers with errors on their forms can fill out a correction request online or contact the Healthplanfinder customer support center at 1-855-923-4633. The exchange has added 10 customer support staff with special training to help resolve 1095-A form problems.\n\nThere is general information about filing the new tax information in this Seattle Times story, as well as through the federal health insurance exchange, the IRS and Healthplanfinder.\n\nGaston is still waiting on separate tax information from a financial institution before she can file her federal taxes for 2014, but she is eager to get this situation resolved sooner than later.\n\n\u201cThe thing about the exchange stuff that spooks me a little bit,\u201d she said, \u201cis they told me they have problems, but how long will it take them to fix that?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Washington's health insurance exchange last week began sending out federal tax forms, and that has a created a new set of challenges to sort out.
