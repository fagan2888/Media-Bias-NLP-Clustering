Rep. Dan Lipinski will continue to fight for his position as Democratic Party incumbent for the 3rd Congressional District of Illinois as he faces a new challenger, Sharon Brannigan.

Lipinski has served as the district’s representative since 2005, preceded by his father Bill Lipinski.

He will likely run on a history of fighting for jobs, responsibly reducing the deficit and helping middle-class families.

In the past, he served on the staff of former Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and taught Political Science at the University of Tennessee and at the University of Notre Dame. He serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure, and Science and Technology House committees.

Lipinski’s opponent, Brannigan, currently serves as the Palos Township Trustee and owns a small flower shop in Orland Park with her husband.

Brannigan touts her knowledge of small businesses and creating jobs and the importance of education.

She also criticizes Lipinski for his votes surrounding ObamaCare.

“If elected, I will work tirelessly to see that this job-killing legislation be repealed in its entirety,” she said in a statement.

The 3rd District is among the richest congressional districts in Illinois with a median household income of $56, 579.

It is unlikely that newcomer Brannigan will see a win in the November elections, especially considering Lipinski’s experience in the seat.

The Rothenberg Political Report considers Lipinski "safe" in the upcoming election.
