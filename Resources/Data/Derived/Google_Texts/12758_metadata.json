St. Louis Ram\u2019s owner Stan Kroenke has said that he will privately fund the construction of the proposed stadium so he can move the Rams back to Los Angeles.\n\nThe San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders are hoping a competing stadium plan in nearby Carson will be an alternative home if they cannot work out favorable deals in their hometowns. While details about the financing have yet to be released, the plan is reported to be similar to the San Francisco 49\u2019er\u2019s stadium deal in Santa Clara, CA which required over $600 million in construction loans from the city.\n\nReason TV recently sat down with Chapman University\u2019s Joel Kotkin to talk about why giving public cash for stadium projects is a really bad idea.
