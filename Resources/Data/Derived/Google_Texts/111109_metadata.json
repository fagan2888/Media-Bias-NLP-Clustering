After the treatment, the regenerated thymus was similar in structure to that of a much younger mouse, with many key functions fully restored. For example, the mice were producing significantly higher amounts of T-cells \u2014 white blood cells that fend off infections.\n\nRebuilding Organs\n\nThe new technique follows in a growing series of breakthroughs in regenerative medicine. Last year, a Japanese research lab announced that they\u2019d successfully grown a functioning human liver from stem cells. Similarly, in a recent study from Columbia University Medical Center, researchers show stem cells can be converted into functioning lung and airway cells.\n\nAccording to the authors, the new technique could inspire a range of new therapies. For example, targeting the FOXN1 protein in older people may help offset immune deficiencies associated with age-related deterioration of the thymus. It could also help patients with DiGeorge syndrome \u2014 a genetic disorder that keeps the thymus from developing properly.\n\n\u201cOne of the key goals in regenerative medicine is harnessing the body\u2019s own repair mechanisms and manipulating these in a controlled way to treat disease,\u201d Dr. Rob Buckle, head of Regenerative Medicine at the UK Medical Research Council, told reporters. \u201cThis interesting study suggests that organ regeneration in a mammal can be directed by manipulation of a single protein, which is likely to have broad implications for other areas of regenerative biology.\u201d\n\nSource: Bredenkamp N, Nowell CS, Blackburn CC.
