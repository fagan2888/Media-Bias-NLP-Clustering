The era of developer \u201cspray-and-pray\u201d \u2014 the act of flooding the mobile market with games in the hope of gathering as many users as possible \u2014 is coming to an end.\n\nRelated: The Biggest Trends and Best Releases from E3 2014\n\nRather, the report suggests, developers are looking to monetize their existing apps by engaging their audiences with a better gaming experience, hoping to hook users and pull in money through in-app purchases like special character skins or different worlds in which to play, as well as opportunities to extend playing time, like extra lives. The report also emphasizes the increasing use of audience analytics in tailoring games to make the most money possible.\n\nFor example, tablet users spend far more money on in-app purchases than smartphone users, mainly due to the increased performance and screen size these devices offer, making them better gaming platforms. In addition, game performance on tablets is rapidly approaching that of dedicated gaming devices, with the added boon of serving a multitude of other functions.\n\nAs a result, Juniper\u2019s analysts predict a steady decline in the use of dedicated portable gaming devices, like the Nintendo 3DS, Playstation Vita, or Nvidia Shield. The forecast indicates a steady decline in the installed base of \u201chardcore\u201d portable gaming devices from just over 47 million globally in 2014 to 17.5 million in 2019.\n\nAll is not lost, though, for the makers of those devices as the report predicts that they can still turn a profit based on niche appeal, though it remains to be seen if the lack of users with these platforms at hand will cause once-hardcore developers to abandon ship and instead create games for the more-profitable segments of the mobile market.\n\nFor now, though, it looks like the rise of the casual gamer has left Sony and Nintendo in the mobile gaming dust, heralding the rise of the Apple and Android era.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s sometimes hard to believe that when you\u2019re swiping away at \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u201d or", "title": "Mobile Gaming Will Be a $29 Billion Market by 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/18/Mobile-Gaming-Will-Be-29-Billion-Market-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06192014_Candy_Crush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/18/Mobile-Gaming-Will-Be-29-Billion-Market-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06192014_Candy_Crush.jpg", "creator": "@lumbology", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s sometimes hard to believe that when you\u2019re swiping away at \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u201d or", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0d5\"", "article_summary": "For now, though, it looks like the rise of the casual gamer has left Sony and Nintendo in the mobile gaming dust, heralding the rise of the Apple and Android era.\nIn addition, game performance on tablets is rapidly approaching that of dedicated gaming devices, with the added boon of serving a multitude of other functions.\nAs a result, Juniper\u2019s analysts predict a steady decline in the use of dedicated portable gaming devices, like the Nintendo 3DS, Playstation Vita, or Nvidia Shield.\nBut it\u2019s true, and according to a new report from Juniper Research, that number is likely to grow by more than 38 percent to almost $29 billion by 2016.\nThe forecast indicates a steady decline in the installed base of \u201chardcore\u201d portable gaming devices from just over 47 million globally in 2014 to 17.5 million in 2019."}
