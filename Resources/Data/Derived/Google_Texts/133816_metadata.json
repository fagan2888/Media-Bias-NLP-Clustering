He told conservative lawmakers and lobbyists at the ALEC annual meeting how drug and treatment innovations saved his life \u2014 twice.\n\nHe told of growing up with hemophilia, becoming HIV-positive as a result of blood transfusions and eventually contracting \u2014 and beating back \u2014 AIDS. And how he lost his brother to that disease.\n\nBut Maynard didn\u2019t tell all. He didn\u2019t mention he\u2019s a Democrat.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said afterward.\n\nHe was disappointed in the turnout for the drug discovery and innovation panel. Out of 1,300 registrants at the 42nd annual American Legislative Exchange Council meeting, only 60 attended the workshop.\n\nBut Maynard of the Hemophilia Council of California was among panel members \u2014 and workshop moderator Rolf Benirschke, the former Chargers placekicker \u2014 defending their presence at a convention decried by liberals outside.\n\n\u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t window dressing, because I\u2019m here trying to educate people about what they can do as legislators,\u201d Maynard said.\n\nHe called it a \u201cbad approach to politics\u201d not to engage other views. \u201cTo just yell at each other doesn\u2019t help. We can\u2019t be so close-minded.\u201d\n\nBenirschke of Legacy Health Strategies told the story of his near-death experience during his NFL days with ulcerative colitis and repeated the refrain that more drug discovery and innovation are needed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a political message,\u201d he said. \u201cDisease is an equal opportunity tyrant. It doesn\u2019t choose what party (you belong to).\u201d\n\nHe said diseases can be eradicated by funding research, and panel member Scott Suckow, a mental health advocate, even used his speaking moment to urge more \u201cbase funding\u201d for the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSuckow said he tailors his pitch to the audience.\n\n\u201cOne [group] might be interested in the human aspect and the other in the [cost] savings and health outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually costs taxpayers less money\u201d to address what he called \u201cwrap-around services\u201d such as housing, transportation \u2014 \u201cwhatever it takes to get the client into treatment and to keep him there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something the states and local jurisdictions can provide,\u201d Suckow said.\n\nWith 15 minutes left, Benirschke called for audience questions.\n\nOnly one came. Republican Linda Upmeyer, Iowa House majority leader, asked Suckow to expand on needed mental health services.\n\nSuckow noted how some patients know the drug they need but can\u2019t get it because government agencies obey the \u201cfail-first\u201d philosophy \u2014 giving the cheapest drugs first before offering more expensive ones that work.\n\nThat can result in mental patients ending up in jail or needing ambulance rides or visits to the emergency room \u2014 \u201ccosting states huge amounts of money.\u201d\n\nHaving heard that, Upmeyer said, \u201cI concur completely. There\u2019s no need to go through a bunch of drugs that don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBut Upmeyer, a nurse practitioner and member of the Iowa House for 13 years, took exception to the idea ALEC wasn\u2019t open to policies some might consider liberal.\n\n\u201cPigeonholing and blaming one party vs. another is not entirely accurate,\u201d she said after the panel. \u201cI think we have to make wise investments \u2026 targeted investments are very appropriate.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t favor the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) being scrapped either \u2014 \u201calthough it certainly needs to be improved. \u2026 Replace pieces that are problematic.\u201d\n\nBenirschke said this was his first time at ALEC and \u201chad no expectations\u201d on the workshop turnout. He chalked up the modest crowd to the existence of competing panels and meetings.\n\n\u201cWe can eradicate disease in many ways by funding research,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all of us on the panel (including Liz Helms of the California Chronic Care Coalition) are alive because of research and therapies.\u201d\n\nHe sides with conservatives on some issues, however, supporting lawsuits limits and company efforts to protect their patents (which liberals say leads to gouging on drug prices).\n\nStill Benirschke declared \u201cI\u2019m not a very political person. I really care about people.\u201d\n\nAsked about the chanting and sign-waving crowds north of the hotel, Benirschke said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re so dogmatic about something and become almost irrational, I don\u2019t think it does your argument any good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we tend to do is put people in boxes \u2014 and criticize the box,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way this [disease scourge] gets solved is you get all the stakeholders together and say: Here\u2019s the enemy we\u2019re trying to fight.\u201d\n\nMaynard, who said he didn\u2019t see any protesters when arriving for the 3:45 p.m. forum, called the name-calling \u201ca bad approach to politics. It\u2019s not being willing to discuss things \u2014 to just yell at each other doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nSuckow didn\u2019t share Maynard\u2019s disappointment in the turnout, saying the audience represented a sphere of influence that at some point could lead to a \u201clight bulb\u201d being turned on and result in progress.\n\n\u201cWhat we said today is a seed planted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when they make a decision, they\u2019ll remember some of what we said.\u201d\n\nIowa House Majority Leader Linda Upmeyer asks a question at workshop on drug discovery and innovation at ALEC meeting.
