Companies that share data with federal agencies, including the National Security Agency (NSA), will be given legal and liability protections from lawsuits relating to data sharing.\n\nThe bill passed by 74-21. The bill will now go to conference with the House where it will be reconciled with two other measures, reports Reuters.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nCritics say the bill does more to invade the privacy of ordinary Americans than protects US interests.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, the only member of the intelligence committee to vote against the bill, said CISA will \u201chave a limited impact on US cybersecurity.\u201d\n\nAll of the five pro-privacy amendments tabled by senators ahead of the vote failed.\n\nOne of the core privacy bolstering amendments, which would require sensitive and personal data to be removed before it is shared with federal agencies, was voted down. Another, which critics argue would make it more difficult to track threat-data sharing under freedom-of-information laws, was also struck down.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who sponsored the bill in 2014, said the amendments would \u201cundo the careful compromises we made on this bill.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was the only presidential candidate to vote against the bill, according to The Guardian. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a Republican presidential candidate, voted for the bill.\n\nPrivacy and rights groups criticized the bill\u2019s passing in the wake of the vote.\n\nIn remarks, Mark Jaycox, legislative analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, called the bill \u201cfundamentally flawed due to its broad immunity clauses, vague definitions, and aggressive spying authorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe passage of CISA reflects the misunderstanding many lawmakers have about technology and security. Computer security engineers were against it. Academics were against it. Technology companies, including some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest like Twitter and Salesforce, were against it,\u201d said Jaycox.\n\nGreg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said the bill is a \u201chuge step backwards for privacy rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, more personal information will be shared with the NSA and with law enforcement agencies, and that information will certainly be used for purposes other than enhancing cybersecurity,\u201d said Nojeim.\n\nThe bill, known as a \u201czombie bill\u201d after the bill previously failed CISA, has been met by unanimous public opposition to the bill.\n\nApple, Dropbox, Reddit, Twitter, Wikimedia Foundation (which owns Wikipedia), and Yelp, have said they oppose the bill. A trade group representing Facebook, Google, and others said it is \u201cunable to support CISA as it is currently written.\u201d\n\nBut there was some fraying at the edges of the opposition.\n\nFacebook was accused of secretly lobbying on CISA, but denied advocating \u201cpublicly or privately\u201d for the bill. Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet did not comment publicly on its own, but executive chairman indicated that the company may support future legislation. Speaking at an event in New York on Monday, Schmidt said he was \u201cnot an expert on the bill,\u201d but added that there \u201chas to be a way\u201d to share threat data with the government.\n\nThe security industry also lobbied against the against the bill.\n\nIn a letter published earlier this year, security experts including Jacob Appelbaum, Bruce Schneier, and Black Hat keynote speaker and lawyer Jennifer Granick, said that \u201cwaiving privacy rights will not make security sharing better.\u201d\n\nIf passed by the House, the president is not expected to veto the bill.\n\n\u00a9 2015 CBS Interactive", "article_metadata": {"description": "There was unanimous opposition to the bill across the tech industry., CISA, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, Data-Sharing, Privacy, Senate,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Zack Whittaker for ZDNet", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "There was unanimous opposition to the bill across the tech industry., CISA, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, Data-Sharing, Privacy, Senate,", "title": "CISA Data-Sharing Bill Passes Senate With No Privacy Protections", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/cisa-data-sharing-bill-passes-senate-with-no-privacy-protections/210733/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cyber.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-28T09:14:47-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There was unanimous opposition to the bill across the tech industry., CISA, Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, Data-Sharing, Privacy, Senate,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cyber.png", "title": "CISA Data-Sharing Bill Passes Senate With No Privacy Protections", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2015-10-28T09:14:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-28T09:14:47-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "CISA Data-Sharing Bill Passes Senate With No Privacy ProtectionsThere was unanimous opposition to the bill across the tech industry.\nThe bill, known as a \u201czombie bill\u201d after the bill previously failed CISA, has been met by unanimous public opposition to the bill.\nCompanies that share data with federal agencies, including the National Security Agency (NSA), will be given legal and liability protections from lawsuits relating to data sharing.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorCritics say the bill does more to invade the privacy of ordinary Americans than protects US interests.\nA controversial draft law, which one senator called a \u201csurveillance bill by another name,\u201d has passed the Senate."}
