The USPTO ruling simply strips it of trademark protection \u2013 and even that decision will be challenged in court.\n\nThe Redskins franchise, and owner Daniel Snyder, have faced growing public criticism for refusing to change the team\u2019s name, which many people, particularly Native Americans, view as racist. For his part, Snyder has been adamant about retaining the name. \u201cWe will never change the name of the team,\u201d he told USA Today last year.\n\nThe case, brought in 2006 by five Native Americans, including lead plaintiff Amanda Blackhorse, is not the first attempt to have the trademark cancelled. A similar ruling from the USPTO in 1999 was overturned on appeal. However, in the ruling issued today, the agency\u2019s panel noted that the courts never addressed the merits of the decision, ruling on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 standing to seek relief.\n\nNeither the NFL nor the Redskins franchise had issued a response to the ruling as of this article\u2019s posting. However, it is likely that the USPTO decision will be challenged.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. Patent and Trademark office on Wednesday issued a decision cancelling the trademark registrations filed by the National Football League\u2019s Washington Redskins, saying the team\u2019s name is \u201cdisparaging\u201d to Native Americans.", "title": "Washington Redskins Lose Again: USPTO Cancels Trademark", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/18/Washington-Redskins-Lose-Again-USPTO-Cancels-Trademark", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06182014_Redskins.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/18/Washington-Redskins-Lose-Again-USPTO-Cancels-Trademark", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06182014_Redskins.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The U.S. Patent and Trademark office on Wednesday issued a decision cancelling the trademark registrations filed by the National Football League\u2019s Washington Redskins, saying the team\u2019s name is \u201cdisparaging\u201d to Native Americans.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad55\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has stepped into the controversy surrounding the name of the National Football League\u2019s Washington Redskins with a bombshell decision this morning cancelling the team\u2019s trademark registrations.\nThe USPTO ruling simply strips it of trademark protection \u2013 and even that decision will be challenged in court.\nHowever, it is likely that the USPTO decision will be challenged.\nThe case, brought in 2006 by five Native Americans, including lead plaintiff Amanda Blackhorse, is not the first attempt to have the trademark cancelled.\nThe Redskins franchise, and owner Daniel Snyder, have faced growing public criticism for refusing to change the team\u2019s name, which many people, particularly Native Americans, view as racist."}
