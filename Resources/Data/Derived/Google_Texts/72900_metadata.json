He said the health care industry needs to \u201cget patients the right care at the right time and in the right setting \u2014 and in the most productive and cost-efficient way.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur health care delivery system isn't much of a system at all. It's a series of chaotic events where patients are seen in a silo fashion, and there often isn't good communication between providers,\u201d Martin said.\n\nHe stressed the council's study did not include emergency room visits, patients younger than 18 or out-of-state residents. It centered on inpatient stays, finding that super-utilizers accounted for about 7 percent of patients covered under commercial insurance.\n\nThe federal government punishes hospitals when they readmit too many patients within 30 days of discharge, a penalty that can trim reimbursements from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by $100,000 a year or more. Designed to keep readmission rates at or below national averages, the rule is part of the Affordable Care Act that President Obama signed in March 2010.\n\nSince then, hospitals in Western Pennsylvania have made strides to slash readmissions and make patients more involved in their care, said Jane Montgomery, vice president for clinical services and quality at the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania. She did not have figures available.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to have a patient be deemed a super-utilizer. That's not the best thing or the right thing for the patient or the hospital. We want them to have the best care possible,\u201d Montgomery said.\n\nShe said mental health patients present a challenge. Many tend not to follow medication regimens, leading them back to hospitals in a statewide trend that has mental health among the most frequent reasons for readmissions.\n\n\u201cWe need a much stronger safety net\u201d for those patients, said Dr. Keith Kanel, chief medical officer at the Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative, Downtown. He said some have poor support systems, while others face failures of the medical system.\n\n\u201cThat's on us to fix,\u201d Kanel said.\n\nHe leads a federally funded research project, the Primary Care Resource Center, to help primary care physicians treat labor-intensive patients. About a year in, readmissions have fallen by as much as 20 percent at seven participating hospitals in Western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, Kanel said.\n\nExecutives at the region's biggest hospital systems, UPMC and Allegheny Health Network, said they are testing programs that should streamline care and reduce repeat visits. At AHN-owned Allegheny General Hospital in the North Side, a transition program for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tries to make sure they receive prescriptions and other post-hospitalization care.\n\nReadmission rates among targeted COPD patients have fallen from about 33 percent to about 12 percent since the program began in August, organizers said.\n\n\u201cWhat works is getting them in to see their pulmonologist and making sure they keep their appointments. That's huge,\u201d said Joseph Gordon, the program coordinator. He has shepherded, tracked and followed up on 275 patients with COPD and other respiratory ailments.\n\nOne of his first stops Wednesday morning was the room of Tom Duttine, 65, of Castle Shannon, who was admitted this week with a viral infection. He expects to head home Thursday or Friday.\n\n\u201cIt helps you to know that when you have a problem, you have to call somebody. You don't have to ride it out\u201d on your own, Duttine said.\n\nAdam Smeltz is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
