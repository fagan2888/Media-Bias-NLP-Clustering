But a health insurance executive who lives in Verona says the more immediate concern is what\u2019s happening to Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement plans. If you\u2019re a senior in Verona\u2013or you care for one\u2013you may have insurance changes that have to be made, and as early as December 7.\n\n\u201cMany of the plans are being discontinued,\u201d says Robert N. Frank, president and CEO of Absolute Insurance Management in Bloomfield. \u201cYou need to find out what type of plan you have and call your insurance company to find out if your plan is going to be offered in 2014.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the changes to the Affordable Care Act aren\u2019t important. Some 800,000 people in New Jersey have individual policies that could be affected. But no one\u2013including the insurance companies\u2013has figured out how the changes will be implemented and they won\u2019t know until New Jersey\u2019s commissioner of insurance issues some guidelines. The Medicare changes are imminent, and they can affect everything from what aspects of care are covered to which doctor a senior sees.\n\nMany seniors have already gotten letters that their Medicare Advantage plan is being terminated. Medicare Advantage plans are the equivalent of a private version of Medicare and cuts in federal funding have prompted carriers to scale back their plans or end them altogether. The consulting firm Avalere Health estimates that 5% of all Medicare Advantage plans are being terminated nationwide.\n\nEven if a plan is not terminated there may still be unwanted changes: Some carriers are dropping doctors, which could force a senior to change a long-standing relationship with a doctor. According to news reports, UnitedHealth Group, which is the biggest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S., is dropping doctors from its network nationwide\u2013perhaps as much as 15% of all its doctors.\n\nIf you care for a senior, Frank advises going through their mail to look for a letter of termination from their insurance carrier or calling their carrier to check the status of their plan. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is that many folks don\u2019t even know about the changes,\u201d says Frank. \u201cThis time of year they get inundated with solicitations,\u201d he adds, because it is annual enrollment period for Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans.\n\nThe supplement plans may be a bright spot in the changes. Normally, seniors must complete a questionnaire to be considered for these plans, and the plans have been able to deny coverage if there is a pre-existing condition. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, that\u2019s not the case now. If your Medicare Advantage plan has been terminated for 2014 you can buy a supplement plan without answering any medical questions on the application. You\u2019ll also have to send in the cancellation notice from your insurance carrier with your application.\n\nWhat to do if you, or a senior you know, is hit with changes? You can investigate some options on your own, starting with the federal government\u2019s Medicare.gov Web site. You can find all the Medicare Advantage Plans available in New Jersey here and the 29 different Medicare Prescription Drug Plans in New Jersey here. If more help is needed paying for medicine, New Jersey offers the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) or the Senior Gold Prescription Discount programs. The application for both is here. There is also a very helpful site www.NeedyMeds.org where you can find programs and coupons to lower your prescription drug costs directly from the manufacturers. (These programs are for people with and without insurance.)\n\nBut remember: December 7 is the deadline to sign up or make changes to your Medicare prescription drug or Medicare Advantage plan, unless you have a special election period. If your plan was cancelled you should find a new one before December 31 so that you have coverage in place on January 1.\n\n\u201cCall the carriers individually,\u201d says Frank, \u201cor sit down with a trusted advisor who works with the major companies. There are options out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While many people are talking about the Affordable Care Act, seniors should focus on what's happening to Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement plans.", "og": {"site_name": "MyVeronaNJ", "description": "While many people are talking about the Affordable Care Act, seniors should focus on what's happening to Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement plans.", "title": "Big Changes Coming To Senior Health Insurance - MyVeronaNJ", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.myveronanj.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Senior-Care2.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2013-11-18T15:32:00-04:00", "url": "http://www.myveronanj.com/2013/11/18/big-changes-coming-senior-health-insurance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While many people are talking about the Affordable Care Act, seniors should focus on what's happening to Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement plans.", "creator": "@myveronanj", "image": "http://www.myveronanj.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Senior-Care2.jpg", "title": "Big Changes Coming To Senior Health Insurance - MyVeronaNJ", "site": "@myveronanj", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "8BFBE13D0A79E1086D52F9B2B82F3CEE", "fb": {"admins": 1046453922049190}, "google-site-verification": "CxrO67dqUZ1c-r2vHC1oA_LY0RLMvACXaqv6y49iM8w", "keywords": "Verona NJ, Verona NJ News, Verona High School, Verona Real Estate, Verona\r\nSchools, Verona Sports, Verona Park, Verona Pool, Hillbillies, ShopVerona,\r\nNorthern New Jersey, Suburban Essex, Claremont Diner", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MyVeronaNJ", "section": "Health", "tag": "Seniors", "published_time": "2013-11-18T08:02:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-18T15:32:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa38\"", "article_summary": "If you\u2019re a senior in Verona\u2013or you care for one\u2013you may have insurance changes that have to be made, and as early as December 7.\nBut a health insurance executive who lives in Verona says the more immediate concern is what\u2019s happening to Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement plans.\nYou can find all the Medicare Advantage Plans available in New Jersey here and the 29 different Medicare Prescription Drug Plans in New Jersey here.\nThe consulting firm Avalere Health estimates that 5% of all Medicare Advantage plans are being terminated nationwide.\nThe Medicare changes are imminent, and they can affect everything from what aspects of care are covered to which doctor a senior sees."}
