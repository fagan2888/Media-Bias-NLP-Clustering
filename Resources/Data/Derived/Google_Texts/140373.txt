Saturday Night Live poked fun at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this weekend in a sketch about its faulty HealthCare.gov website, also known as the Obamacare website.

Kate McKinnon portrayed U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, giving a speech about how users could access the website, and what they might find during their visit.

HealthCare.Gov is the online marketplace for legal residents of 34 states seeking health-care coverage. However, many users experienced problems with the site on its first day of operation. Recent reports said HealthCare.Gov will be fixed by December.

The SNL skit hints that the White House's lack of tech knowledge and preparation for the onslaught of visits was to blame for the site's problems. As McKinnon (portraying Sebelius) explains, "The site was only designed to handle six users at a time."
