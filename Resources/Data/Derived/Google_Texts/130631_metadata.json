Thanks, Bernie Sanders.\n\n3 On the Shameful and Skewed \u2018Redskins\u2019 Poll\n\n4 Clinton Needs Sanders Supporters to Win, But Sanders Needs Clinton Supporters to Change the System\n\n5 Anthony Weiner Wasn\u2019t the Only One Who Couldn\u2019t Stop Exposing Himself\n\n\u201cWe need to help families with the cost of living, and that means healthcare,\u201d he said vaguely, before immediately moving on to a curt dismissal of the Affordable Care Act: \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend a lot of time preaching to this choir about Obamacare.\u201d\n\nRubio critiqued his own party lightly for its public relations strategy:\n\nThe problem we\u2019ve had on the right for too long is we have not shown people how our principles of limited government and free enterprise apply to the challenges of the 21st century. And so why I\u2019m so proud to endorse candidates like Cory Gardner [who is running the Senate in Colorado], and Joni Ernst [Iowa], and Tom Cotton [Arkansas], is because they fully understand the need that our country has to restore this agenda\u2026. perhaps more than anything else that I think we have failed to do is to convince people that big government doesn\u2019t hurt the people who have made it.\n\nRubio didn\u2019t articulate many specific policy points, but he did highlight his education reform agenda, which includes a school vouchers and changes that, purportedly, would make higher education more \u201caccessible\u201d:\n\nThere\u2019s all sorts of ways to learn in the 21st century\u2014masters online courses, community colleges. You should be able to get credit for life experience and work experience. You should be able to package all these things into the equivalent of a degree, but we can\u2019t because only accredited colleges can give degrees. And guess who accredits colleges? The accredited colleges\u2026who don\u2019t want any competition from anyone else.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for an overhaul of the way that the United States accredits postsecondary schools. But proposals advanced by Rubio and other Republicans would allow states to gut quality controls for higher education\u2014which aren\u2019t very strong to begin with, as the rise of predatory for-profit colleges illustrates.\n\nThat would be a win for people seeking to extend corporate influence via academia\u2014namely, the Koch brothers, who have funded a variety of efforts to place libertarian ideology in high school and college curriculum. Spreading the free market gospel would be much easier, and cheaper, for the Kochs if they could simply offer their own accredited courses\u2014which students could pay for with federal loans\u2014instead of having to endow faculty positions at traditional universities. (This isn\u2019t that far-fetched: in 2013, the Florida legislature opened the door for the state\u2019s universities to award credit for courses developed, taught, and graded by corporations.) Ad Policy\n\nRubio also attacked the president\u2019s directive to the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants. \u201cI promise you, though, what this president just did by executive order is going to raise her electric bill,\u201d Rubio said, referring to a Florida woman named Christine whose \u201cutility is very coal dependent.\u201d While there\u2019s plenty of debate about how the rule will affect consumers, aggressive carbon regulation certainly would hurt the Kochs, whose empire is built on a carbon footprint that is by one estimate 100 million tons a year.\n\nIronically, one thing Rubio said nothing about during \u201cThe Immigrant Experience\u201d was immigration reform. Rubio was introduced by C\u00e9sar Grajales, the South Florida field director for the LIBRE initiative, a Koch-funded campaign to attract Latino voters to the GOP. Rubio\u2019s former campaign manager, Jose Mallea, is the group\u2019s national strategic director. LIBRE reaches out to Latinos by offering social services, such as free tax preparation, health checkups and a GED course. But the effort is really focused on selling conservative ideology\u2014or, as Grajales put it in his introduction, giving Hispanics \u201caccess to the truth.\u201d\n\nLIBRE appears to believe that Hispanics need \u201ctruth\u201d more than healthcare or relief from a broken immigration system. Instead of pressing Republicans for comprehensive immigration reform, which LIBRE claims to support, the group has spent millions on ads attacking Obamacare supporters. Meanwhile, Latinos are more likely to be uninsured than any other group in the US, and they\u2019ve lagged behind others in enrollment in the new insurance exchanges.\n\nCharles Koch wrapped up the evening by thanking \u201cMarco\u201d for \u201call he\u2019s doing to try to preserve and enhance our free society.\u201d He spoke about the need to build a movement \u201cof people who will act or are dedicated to act, who don\u2019t just give lip service, but are willing to dedicate themselves to our free society, and to making it better and better, whatever the cost to them personally.\u201d\n\nHe went on,\n\nAnd this is absolutely critical because to me what\u2019s going to determine the future of this country is the balance of people who are willing to act to affect the future of this country. And if the majority of those people are collectivists, we are doomed. So we have to be much more aggressive in identifying, recruiting, educating, and mobilizing those people who will be willing to act on behalf of our free society.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marco_rubio2_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Zo\u00eb Carpenter", "description": "The senator's safe homage to the American Dream illustrates his close relationship with the billionaire Koch brothers.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "The senator's safe homage to the American Dream illustrates his close relationship with the billionaire Koch brothers.", "title": "What Marco Rubio Told a Secret Koch Fundraiser (Exclusive)", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/what-marco-rubio-told-secret-koch-fundraiser-exclusive/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marco_rubio2_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T11:07:06+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The senator's safe homage to the American Dream illustrates his close relationship with the billionaire Koch brothers.", "title": "What Marco Rubio Told a Secret Koch Fundraiser (Exclusive)", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/what-marco-rubio-told-secret-koch-fundraiser-exclusive/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marco_rubio2_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marco_rubio2_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 4th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "What Marco Rubio Told a Secret Koch Fundraiser (Exclusive)", "keywords": "zoe carpenter, the nation, marco rubio, charles koch, immigration, hispanic, latino", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 112612, "sailthru.tags": "Campaigns and Elections,Inequality,Politics,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "latino", "published_time": "2014-09-04T18:41:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T11:07:06+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/zcarpenter/"}, "sailthru.description": "The senator\u2019s safe homage to the American Dream illustrates his close relationship with the billionaire Koch brothers.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marco_rubio2_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So we have to be much more aggressive in identifying, recruiting, educating, and mobilizing those people who will be willing to act on behalf of our free society.\nIronically, one thing Rubio said nothing about during \u201cThe Immigrant Experience\u201d was immigration reform.\nLIBRE reaches out to Latinos by offering social services, such as free tax preparation, health checkups and a GED course.\nRubio was introduced by C\u00e9sar Grajales, the South Florida field director for the LIBRE initiative, a Koch-funded campaign to attract Latino voters to the GOP.\nMost Popular1 The Media Must Decide Whether to Follow Donald Trump Down the Sewer2 The Democratic Platform Committee Now Has a Progressive Majority."}
