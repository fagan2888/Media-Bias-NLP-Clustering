And after Bartholomew delivered his remarks, Francis bent down and kissed his hand in remarkable show of papal respect for a patriarch when some 500 years ago a patriarch was forced to kiss the feet of the pope.\n\nThe evening prayer service was the spiritual highlight of Francis\u2019 three-day pilgrimage to the Holy Land and capped a momentous day in which the Israeli and Palestinian presidents accepted Francis\u2019 invitation to join him at the Vatican next month to pray for peace.\n\nFrancis has said his primary reason for coming to the region was to mark the 50th anniversary of the meeting in Jerusalem between Pope Paul VI and Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras of Constantinople. Their 1964 embrace ended 900 years of mutual excommunication and estrangement sparked by the Great Schism of 1054, which split Christianity.\n\nSince that meeting, the two churches have grown closer in personal friendships and even theological dialogue, but core differences remain, including over the primacy of the pope.\n\nTellingly, Francis referred to Paul not as pope but as \u201cbishop of Rome\u201d \u2014 the other main title attributed to popes and the way Francis introduced himself to the world on the night he was elected pope in a clear gesture toward his Orthodox \u201cbrothers.\u201d\n\nBartholomew, for his part, called for their meeting at Christ\u2019s tomb to show how fear, religious fanaticism and hatred of people of other faiths and races can be overcome by love. \u201cThe message of the life-giving tomb is clear: love the other, the different other, the followers of other faiths and other confessions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope, patriarch pray in Holy Sepulcher church", "author": "Nicole Winfield", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pope, patriarch pray in Holy Sepulcher church", "title": "Pope, patriarch pray in Holy Sepulcher church", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/pope_patriarch_pray_in_holy_sepulcher_church/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/mideast-jerusalem-pope-christian-conflict.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope, patriarch pray in Holy Sepulcher church", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/mideast-jerusalem-pope-christian-conflict.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Pope, patriarch pray in Holy Sepulcher church", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Pope, patriarch pray in Holy Sepulcher church", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c26\"", "article_summary": "Francis has said his primary reason for coming to the region was to mark the 50th anniversary of the meeting in Jerusalem between Pope Paul VI and Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras of Constantinople.\n\u201cThe message of the life-giving tomb is clear: love the other, the different other, the followers of other faiths and other confessions.\u201d\nAnd after Bartholomew delivered his remarks, Francis bent down and kissed his hand in remarkable show of papal respect for a patriarch when some 500 years ago a patriarch was forced to kiss the feet of the pope.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis and the spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians prayed together Sunday inside the Jerusalem church that symbolizes their divisions, calling their historic meeting a step toward healing the centuries-old Catholic-Orthodox schism.\nSince that meeting, the two churches have grown closer in personal friendships and even theological dialogue, but core differences remain, including over the primacy of the pope."}
