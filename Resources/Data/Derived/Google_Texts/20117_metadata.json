You promised the Catholic Church you would not \u2014 under Obamacare \u2014 force those with religious objection to provide contraception to employees, which is contrary to their fundamental beliefs, and their exercise of their religion. In spite of your promise, you are spending millions in legal fees to force the Little Sisters of the Poor \u2014 who spend their lives serving the sick and the elderly \u2014 to provide contraception, sterilization, and abortifacients to their employees. Pray tell, Mr. President, might you have lied to the Catholic Church? And now you want to sanction one home $6,700 a day? What don\u2019t you understand about poor?\n\nEven Muslim felons in federal prison are allowed to exercise their First Amendment religious freedoms without fear of punishment, Pirro said.\n\n\u201cMr. President, it\u2019s 2014 and we\u2019re not getting off to a good start,\u201d she said.\n\nWatch Pirro\u2019s opening statement via Fox News:\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nWatch the latest video at <a href=\u201dhttp://video.foxnews.com\u201d>video.foxnews.com</a>", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Judge Jeanine Pirro made it clear the Obama administration hasn\u2019t changed in the new year, slamming its rocky start and its attack\u00a0on Catholic nuns.
