And by the end, a lot of people figured out who my opponent was. I take this as a huge and strong indication that people understand what I\u2019m attempting to do on their behalf.\u201d\n\nSessions said he would continue to push for the repeal of Obamacare, and stressed he would work to help Republicans maintain control of the House and retake the Senate in the 2014 general elections.\n\nPierson said her showing in the primary \u201cexceeded expectations,\u201d and was about holding the Republican establishment accountable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have really done a big thing here in Texas, and especially in taking on an incumbent like Pete Sessions. We were told we wouldn\u2019t even break 20 percent.\u201d\n\nPierson said she isn\u2019t going anywhere, and plans to stay involved with the tea party, both in Dallas and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThis is a beginning of a big shift in the [Republican] party,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are several like myself who are young conservatives who aren\u2019t going away, and we\u2019re going to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing, which is working to keep these folks accountable.\u201d\n\nUPDATE at 7:55 PM: The Associated Press has called the election for Sessions.\n\nUPDATE at 7:30 PM: Dallas County Elections is reporting Sessions has 70 percent of the vote with 22,000 early votes counted. Colliln County Elections is reporting Katrina Pierson has 588 early votes to Sessions\u2019 569.\n\nOriginal Post at 7:00 PM:\n\nWASHINGTON\u2013Polls are now closing on the closely-watched Republican primary contest between Rep. Pete Sessions and challenger Katrina Pierson.\n\nThe race is something of a test of strength for the tea party movement in Texas, as Pierson runs to Sessions\u2019 right with support from tea party groups hoping for a Ted Cruz-style upset.\n\nShe enjoyed support from national tea party groups such as FreedomWorks, hoping to paint Sessions as an \u201cestablishment\u201d Republican who isn\u2019t aggressive enough in pushing a conservative agenda.\n\nSessions won a seat in Congress in 1996. He now chairs the powerful House Rules Committee, which shapes legislation and decides how bills are debated and amended on the floor. He has a solid conservative voting record and has received support from the National Rifle Association.\n\nPierson and her tea party backers call him a Washington insider who is soft on efforts to repeal Obamacare, limit government spending, and oppose immigration reform, among other issues.\n\nSessions has defended his conservative record, running ads pledging renewed efforts to fight the president\u2019s health care law.\n\nPierson, a Garland-based tea party activist, was a top volunteer on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s 2012 campaign. He never explicitly endorsed her, though he publicly praised her as \u201cutterly fearless\u201d and his father, Rafael Cruz, stumped for her.\n\nShe also drew support from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, conservative commentator Michelle Malkin, and immigration hard-liners such as ALIPAC.\n\nBut financial support never really materialized. She raised $144,000, a paltry sum compared to Sessions\u2019 almost $1.5 million.\n\nHis last serious challenge came in 2004, when redistricting pitted him against another incumbent, Democrat Martin Frost. Sessions ended up with 55 percent of the vote after the most expensive House contest in the nation that year, and the third costliest in history at that point. Together, Sessions and Frost spent roughly $9 million.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMy9yZXAtcGV0ZS1zZXNzaW9ucy1hbmQtdGVhLXBhcnRpZXIta2F0cmluYS1waWVyc29uLWZhY2Utb2ZmLWluLTMybmQtZGlzdHJpY3QuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Nick Swartsell", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "UPDATE at 8:30 PM: After the race was called, Sessions said, \u201cwe felt like this race would be very important for us to not only take seriously, but for us\u2026", "title": "Rep.
