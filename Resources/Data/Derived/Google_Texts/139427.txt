(KUTV) Last Monday on 2News at 10, Get Gephardt reported the ongoing frustrations of Kaylene and Edward Fetzer.



Due to a mistake made by the healthcare marketplace, the couple was only getting credit for having health insurance for a couple of months in 2015, when they really had insurance all year.

That's important because under the Affordable Care Act, if you don't have insurance you have to pay a stiff penalty when you file your tax return.

In the end, Get Gephardt was able to help Kaylene and Edward straighten out their problem, but the story prompted 2News viewer Althea Bird to write asking, "Where does the money you are penalized with go, and who does it benefit?"

It's a good question and for the answer I turned to Rick Florez with Platform Tax Consulting. He says that all money we pay in taxes goes to the same place.

"It all goes to the general fund," he said.

The federal government writes all of its check from the general fund. If a highway program gets federal money, it comes from the general fund. When a security guard at a federal building cashes a paycheck, it comes from the general fund. When a national park needs to plant a bunch of trees following a massive fire, the money for project comes from the general fund.

But, Florez says the vast majority of the money spent by the federal government goes to three places.

"The general fund covers Social Security, the military and healthcare. Those are the three major prongs that the Treasury Department spends money on."

So, Florez says that, in a roundabout way, when someone without health insurance pays a tax penalty, there is certainly a good chance that that money went back into what the federal government spends on healthcare -- if not that, maybe a new war plane.

So, now we know. Thanks, Althea, for the good question.
