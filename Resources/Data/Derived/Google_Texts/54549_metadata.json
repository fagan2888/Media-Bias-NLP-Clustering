The expectation of the program was that it would lower overall Medicare costs because as seniors have more access to drugs that are part of their health treatment, the amount of care these people would need would decrease.\n\nWhile early studies showed statistically significant decreases in nondrug medical spending and hospitalizations, the increased access to medications over time, however, has not led to a clear decrease in emer\u00adgency room visits, hos\u00adpital stays, inpa\u00adtient costs or mor\u00adtality, researchers said.\n\nThe Medicare Cur\u00adrent Ben\u00ade\u00adfi\u00adciary survey, which is an annual face-\u200b\u200bto-\u200b\u200bface panel survey of about 12,000 Medicare subscribers, showed the difference for Medicare subscribers has been insignificant as the data shows just a 2 percent decrease of people reporting their health as poor between 2006 and 2010.\n\nResearchers are suggesting the Congressional Budget Office, which tracks government spending and scores legislation for its potential future costs, \"re-examine\" its policy figuring that medical spending decreases by 0.2 percent for each 1 percent increase in drug prescriptions filled.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which made alterations to the Medicare program as part of its expansive effort to improve access to health care when it was passed in 2009, includes provisions to decrease over time the costs it shares with Medicare subscribers. Those decreases are based on an assumed $35 billion of savings, mostly through a reduction in hospitalization that researchers say Medicare data does not show is happening.\n\n\"We'd like the Con\u00adgres\u00adsional Budget Office to re-\u200b\u200bexamine the policy,\" Briesacher said. \"It's about prop\u00aderly scoring the leg\u00adis\u00adla\u00adtion so it doesn't assume these cost-\u200b\u200boffsets that we can't find.\"\n\nThe study is published in Annals of Internal Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicare Part D was expected to drive down health care costs, however subsidizing prescription drugs for seniors has not effected the overall cost of Medicare.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Medicare Part D was expected to drive down health care costs, however subsidizing prescription drugs for seniors has not effected the overall cost of Medicare.", "title": "Prescription drug benefit did not save Medicare money", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/06/16/Prescription-drug-benefit-did-not-save-Medicare-money/8251434486903/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/8251434486903/2015/1/14344898442394/v2.1/Prescription-drug-benefit-did-not-save-Medicare-money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8251434486903/2015/i/14344898442394/v2.1/Prescription-drug-benefit-did-not-save-Medicare-money.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Medicare Part D was expected to drive down health care costs, however subsidizing prescription drugs for seniors has not effected the overall cost of Medicare.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Prescription drug benefit did not save Medicare money"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc1c\"", "article_summary": "Medicare Part D was enacted in 2003 as part of the Medicare Modernization Act to subsidize the costs of prescription drugs for seniors using Medicare and went into effect in 2006.\n\"We are con\u00adcluding that Medicare Part D did not save the pro\u00adgram any money overall,\" said Becky Briesacher, a health ser\u00advices researcher in the School of Phar\u00admacy at Northeastern University, in a press release.\nBOSTON, June 16 (UPI) -- Medicare Part D was implemented in 2006 in an effort to drive down Medicare costs by offering seniors discounted medications but a new study has found that the program has had no effect on the amount of money spent on Medicare.\nThe Medicare Cur\u00adrent Ben\u00ade\u00adfi\u00adciary survey, which is an annual face-\u200b\u200bto-\u200b\u200bface panel survey of about 12,000 Medicare subscribers, showed the difference for Medicare subscribers has been insignificant as the data shows just a 2 percent decrease of people reporting their health as poor between 2006 and 2010.\nThe Affordable Care Act, which made alterations to the Medicare program as part of its expansive effort to improve access to health care when it was passed in 2009, includes provisions to decrease over time the costs it shares with Medicare subscribers."}
