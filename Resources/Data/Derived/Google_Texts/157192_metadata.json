The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2015 and is subject to U.S. antitrust approval, according to the statement.\n\nPartner Eric Shube led a team from Allen & Overy representing Thai Union, which included partners Ian Powell and Suparerk Auychai.\n\nCleary partner Brian Byrne led a team that provided antitrust advice to Thai Union.\n\nCorporate partners Joseph Shenker and Krishna Veeraraghavan represented Lion Capital and Bumble Bee. David Beddow, a partner at O\u2019Melveny, advised Bumble Bee on regulatory issues.\n\nThe acquisition by Bangkok-based Thai Union would create the world\u2019s largest branded shelf-stable seafood company, Bumble Bee said in the statement. Lion Capital acquired Bumble Bee, which was founded in 1899, from Centre Partners Management LLC in 2010 for $980 million.\n\nFirm Marketing\n\nRevamped Deal-Jargon Book Shows Difference a Few Years Can Make\n\nIn 2008, when the markets froze and deal work was virtually nonexistent, some enterprising lawyers at Latham & Watkins LLP decided to use the down time to put together a list of deal and capital market terms and their definitions.\n\n\u201cWe were looking for fun things to do when the work was sparser,\u201d partner Marc Jaffe said in an interview.\n\nThe result was \u201cThe Book of Jargon,\u201d a spiral-bound compilation of words and phrases, some commonplace and some arcane. Clients and lawyers alike wanted the book, Jaffe said, so the firm outsourced the printing. Eventually, a free app followed, which Jaffe said has had 30,000 downloads.\n\nThis year, although transactional lawyers have anything but time on their hands, the markets had changed sufficiently to warrant a second edition.\n\nThis version has 390 new terms, said Jaffe, co-chair of the global capital markets practice at Latham, all emanating from the legal, regulatory and market developments that have resulted in new deal terms, he said.\n\nOne addition is a capsule summary of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act, as well as the initials EGC, which stands for Emerging Growth Company, a term used in the JOBS act. Another is YieldCo, used in the energy markets and defined as a \u201cpublic vehicle created for the purpose of holding and acquiring assets with a predictable cash flow stream in order to fund a regular and increasing dividend to public investors.\u201d\n\nMore colorful terms include \u201cbad actors\u201d relating to private placements under the federal securities laws and \u201cbed bug letters,\u201d which refers to Securities and Exchange Commission letters sometimes issued when registration statements have significant deficiencies.\n\nOf course, no giveaway would be complete without a disclaimer, and Latham\u2019s book is no exception: \u201cThe information contained herein should not be construed as legal advice.\u201d\n\nLawsuit News\n\nTarget Shoppers Beat Retailer\u2019s Bid to End Data-Hacking Suit\n\nTarget Corp. must face a mass consumer lawsuit accusing the retailer of failing to protect shoppers from hackers who stole charge-card data and other personal information during last year\u2019s holiday shopping season.\n\nA federal judge in St. Paul, Minnesota, Dec. 18 denied Target\u2019s bid to dismiss the case, allowing the bulk of the claims to move forward. As many as 110 million people were affected, according to the Minneapolis-based company, although there may be overlap between those whose card data was stolen and those whose personal information was taken.\n\nTarget is one of several retail chains, including Home Depot, Barnes & Noble, Michaels Stores and Neiman Marcus, that have been sued after hackers invaded their computer systems and took customer data.\n\nMolly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, declined to comment on the ruling. Vincent Esades, a lawyer for the customers, said he was pleased with the decision.\n\nThe case is In re: Target Corp. Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, 14-md-2522, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota (St. Paul).\n\nLateral Moves\n\nDentons, Levenfeld, Robinson Brog Add New Faces to Ranks\n\nLloyd Winans joined the corporate practice of Dentons as a partner in New York. Winans, who advises foreign and domestic financial institutions, was previously a partner at Baker & McKenzie.\n\nWilliam Rome joined Robinson Brog Leinwand Greene Genovese & Gluck PC as a partner in New York. Rome, who had been a partner at Hoffman & Pollok since 1998, is a commercial litigator who represents financial services and publicly traded companies.\n\nLevenfeld Pearlstein LLC hired Blake Schulman as a partner in its real estate group in Chicago.
