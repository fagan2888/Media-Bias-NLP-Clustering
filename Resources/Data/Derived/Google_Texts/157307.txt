NEW YORK — Sen. Ted Cruz’s book, “A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Miracle of America,” is coming out this summer.

HarperCollins Publishers told The Associated Press on Thursday that it has set a June 30 release date for the book, for which Cruz reached a reported seven-figure deal last year. Cruz, a first-term Texas Republican considering a presidential run in 2016, said in a recent telephone interview that in a time of “extraordinary challenges” he wants to tell his story and share his message of free markets and constitutional liberties.

“Men and women are frustrated with career politicians in both parties who are not listening to them,” Cruz told the AP, adding that the themes of a possible White House candidacy are “certainly reflected in this book.”

Cruz, a favorite among tea party activists who has battled with Democrats and members of his own party, also said he wants to counter the “caricatures” of the right as “stupid,” “evil” or “crazy.”

“The image created in the mainstream media does not comply with the facts,” he said.

Cruz joins a bipartisan field of possible candidates with books out in the past couple of years, from Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton to Republicans Scott Walker and Rand Paul. He said that “A Time for Truth” will include vignettes about Anwar Sadat, Elie Wiesel and others who “had the courage” to speak out even at risk to themselves, a theme he acknowledged can be found in a famous work by a future president, then-Sen. John F. Kennedy’s “Profiles In Courage.”

The vignettes draw upon “an aspect of what Kennedy did” in his book, Cruz said of “Profiles in Courage,” a tribute to U.S. senators who took stands unpopular within their own party.
