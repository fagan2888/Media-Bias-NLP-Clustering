I want smaller government. I want smarter government. Just like most Republicans,\" Cuban wrote in the post, which was flagged by The Dallas Morning News. \"Put aside that I disagree with Republicans on most social issues. The Republicans have a much bigger problem that will crush them in every Presidential election until this changes.\"\n\nCuban lamented that those who disagree with the \"Consensus\" are labeled as fake Republicans.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban to Young Millennials: Live Cheap \u2013 Clothes, Cars Don\u2019t Matter\n\n\"The Republican Party requires that all their Presidential candidates Conform to Consensus. If you don't agree with every platform of the party not only are you called a RINO, a 'Republican in Name Only.' You are considered unelectable in primaries and become a source of scorn on Fox News. That's a problem,\" he said.\n\nThe \"Shark Tank\" star's desire to avoid party orthodoxy could be related to his recent praise for real-estate mogul Donald Trump, whom he hailed as \"the best thing to happen\" to politics in a long time. Indeed, Cuban even told Business Insider that he would consider being Trump's vice president if asked, though he said he would probably decline the hypothetical offer.\n\nIn his Tuesday Cyber Dust post, Cuban also reflected on the meaning of leadership:\n\nLeaders don't conform to the consensus. They create consensus to their vision and goals.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban on How Obamacare Could Help Startups\n\nLeaders don't change their positions mid debate. They welcome scorn from the masses because it creates the opportunity for dialogue.\n\nLeaders don\u2019t look backwards to condemn what has already been done, they look forward to create a better future.\n\nLeaders are not dogmatic. They are principled and know that change is never easy, but when it's necessary, they must lead.\n\nThe Republican Party does everything possible to discourage leadership.\n\nRelated: The Startup That Turned Down $30 Million from Mark Cuban\n\nThey want dogma.\n\nThey want conformity.\n\nThey want to conserve their romanticized past.\n\nThat's a shame. I wish they wanted to conserve the best of what America is today and find a leader that can take us to new places that make our future better.\n\nI realize that's not the way politics work in this day and age. And that just proves the point.\n\n\"And btw, I know a lot of the same can be said about the democrats, but I don\u2019t want to be a democrat,\" he concluded. \"Until things change, I\u2019ll sit in the middle and think for myself. Unlike the Republicans.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.\n\nRead more from Business Insider:\n\nMcDonald's just made a major change to it's burgers\n\nOne major way that Macbooks will always beat Windows laptops\n\nRick Perry now needs to go all-in in one key state\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban weighed in Tuesday on\u00a0status of the Republican Party", "title": "Mark Cuban: Here\u2019s Why Republicans Will Lose the Election", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/12/Mark-Cuban-Here-s-Why-Republicans-Will-Lose-Election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06132014_Mark_Cuban.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/12/Mark-Cuban-Here-s-Why-Republicans-Will-Lose-Election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06132014_Mark_Cuban.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban weighed in Tuesday on\u00a0status of the Republican Party", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0bef\"", "article_summary": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban weighed in Tuesday on status of the Republican Party.\nJust like most Republicans,\" Cuban wrote in the post, which was flagged by The Dallas Morning News.\nRelated: Mark Cuban on How Obamacare Could Help StartupsLeaders don't change their positions mid debate.\nRelated: Mark Cuban to Young Millennials: Live Cheap \u2013 Clothes, Cars Don\u2019t Matter\"The Republican Party requires that all their Presidential candidates Conform to Consensus.\nIn his Tuesday Cyber Dust post, Cuban also reflected on the meaning of leadership:Leaders don't conform to the consensus."}
