Andrew Cuomo and his NYS Dept. of Health create an enhanced transportation structure for Medicaid folks by using taxi\u2019s. The taxi structure then pays the State taxes and fees. The state then uses the money from the taxes and fees to create additional Medicaid services. The new taxi providers are happy to pay the taxes and fees because they are guaranteed payment from the state. The Fed then happily reimburses all of it since they also want more services for Medicaid and Medicare to accommodate the Obamacare wealth redistribution objectives.\n\nNifty huh!\n\nObamacare was packaged and gifted to you though lies and deceit, not unlike the Iranian nuke deal. Both have cost an enormous amount of non-budgeted tax dollars which has helped Obama double your national debt. Over the next couple of years, health costs will be transferred more directly to you and you will be paying, as they say in the old country, up the yin yang.\n\nUnless you are among those who get it for free, such as illegal aliens. The insurance companies are dropping out of health care so eventually a massive central government will control it all, probably as efficiently as they control the Veterans Administration.\n\nWhen Obama told you he was going to change America he wasn\u2019t kidding. Cuomo uses the same playbook. Their progressive social justice agenda is expensive, but they don\u2019t concern themselves with how to pay for it. Clinton and Sanders are promising more social justice. Free college, plus transfer $1 trillion of existing student debt to you. I trust you no longer believe that fairy tale about Wall St. paying for everything. It\u2019s a pretty old story with little result.\n\nKen Fenimore\n\nElizabethtown", "article_metadata": {"description": "So, what is the source of the Medicaid taxi problem that Essex County is forced to deal with.", "generator": "Metro Publisher (www.metropublisher.com)", "og": {"site_name": "Sun Community News & Printing", "description": "So, what is the source of the Medicaid taxi problem that Essex County is forced to deal with.", "title": "Response to Medicaid taxi editorial", "url": "http://www.suncommunitynews.com/api/content/e266c108-1c52-11e6-8b89-22000b078648/", "image": "https://d2az0yupc2akbm.cloudfront.net/vanguardistas.publicview/4.23/static/images/blank.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@suncmtynews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@suncmtynews"}, "keywords": "Elizabethtown,The Burgh Sun,NYS Department of Health,Letters to the Editor,The Adirondack Journal Sun,Gov.
