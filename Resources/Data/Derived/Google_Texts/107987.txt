Two women are hospitalized, and at least one is in critical condition, after the car they were in went off a Fort Worth bridge early Friday morning. The accident occurred on shortly before 5 this morning on the NE 28th Street bridge not far from the Stockyards.

According to at least one report, from KTVT-Channel 11′s Elizabeth Dinh, there’s construction taking place along that stretch of road, and investigators will have to see whether that played a role in the early morning accident.

A Fort Worth police spokesman said that police do not think alcohol was a factor. The crash is still under investigation and additional details remain scant. The women, whose names have not yet been released, were taken to John Peter Smith Hospital.
