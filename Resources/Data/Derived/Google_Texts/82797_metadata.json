During his Meet the Press appearance that was taped a day before, he voiced continued outrage over President Obama\u2019s executive action that would protect as many as five million undocumented children and their families from deportation.\n\nLike many of the other Republican candidates, Trump promised as one of his first acts as president to rescind the orders liberalizing immigration policy for youthful \u201cDreamers\u201d and their families, and devise \u201ca whole new set of standards.\u201d Asked by Todd whether that meant he favored splitting up families by sending them back to Mexico or Latin America, Trump replied, \u201cChuck, no, no. We\u2019re going to keep the families together. We have to keep the families together, but they have to go.\u201d\n\nImmigration Reform Trump by The Fiscal Times\n\n\u201cWe will work with them, but they have to go,\u201d Trump added, suggesting that millions of deported immigrants will have to formally apply for entry into the U.S. after they are sent back to their country of origin. \u201cChuck, we either have a country or we don\u2019t have a country\u2026. We will do it [export families] and we will expedite it so people can come back in.\u201d\n\n\u201cChuck, it will work out so well, you will be so happy,\u201d Trump gushed. \u201cIn four years you will be interviewing me and you\u2019re going to say, \u2018What a great job you\u2019ve done, President Trump.\u201d\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Just Showed Why His Campaign Is Doomed\n\nSome Republican Party officials are concerned that Trump\u2019s anti-immigration comments are over the top and will cost their party the Hispanic vote, just as Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, lost substantial Latino support by calling on illegal immigrants to \u201cself-deport.\u201d Yet Trump has steadily climbed in the polls with a relentless patter of criticism of Obama immigration policies that he argues have allowed immigrants to steal the jobs of Americans and exhaust the resources of public schools and social programs.\n\nOn Saturday, NBC News reported on a five-page document it obtained from Trump\u2019s campaign entitled \u201cImmigration reforms that will make America great again\u201d that includes the promise to \u201cput American workers first.\u201d The document also repeated Trump\u2019s pledge to build a wall to seal off the US-Mexican border, a project that Trump insists would be paid for by the Mexican government.\n\nTrump has been under pressure from the media and his critics to flesh out his immigration policies beyond his conservative crowd-pleasing pot shots at illegal immigrants and Obama\u2019s executive orders.\n\nTrump told The Washington Post on Friday he will unveil a series of position papers in September and that he consulted last month with Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) in preparing his immigration reform policies.\n\nSessions, an arch southern conservative and Tea Party ally who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s on immigration, was dubbed \u201cCapitol Hill\u2019s agitator-in-chief\u201d by Politico during the deadlock over Obama\u2019s immigration executive orders and a funding controversy that threatened to temporarily shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Sessions more recently has bitterly fought Obama\u2019s fast-track Pacific Rim trade policies, issuing detailed reports on how they would hurt average American workers.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Problem: Haters Outnumber Supporters 2 to 1\n\nSessions was the leader of the opposition to the Senate\u2019s passage of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d comprehensive immigration reform legislation in 2013 that tightened border security but also provided millions of illegal immigrants with a long pathway to legal status or citizenship.\n\nMore recently, as subcommittee chair, Sessions has shined a critical spotlight on H-1B visas that benefit immigrants with sophisticated technical skills\u2014one of the tech industry\u2019s most sought after initiative.\n\n\u201cI am opposed to any immigration policy which makes it harder for the unemployed to find jobs and easier for employers to keep pay low,\u201d Sessions said in the introduction to a 25-page manual he circulated to House and Senate Republicans in January, ahead of a GOP retreat.\n\nRelated: Are We Seeing the First Serious Cracks in Trump\u2019s Armor?\n\nTrump continues to lead the crowded field of 17 Republican candidates with 25 percent of the national GOP electorate, just slightly less than before his performance in the first nationally televised presidential debate August 6, according to Fox News. After tangling with Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly, Trump\u2019s support among women went from 24 percent two weeks ago to 21 percent today. He mostly held steady among men with 28 percent.\n\nFormer neurosurgeon Ben Carson scored a surprising second-place finish, with 12 percent \u2013 or five percentage points higher since the debate. Carson was followed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas with 10 percent and former Florida governor Jeb Bush with only nine percent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With a new", "title": "Trump Says Illegal Immigrant Families \u2018Have to Go\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/16/Trump-Says-Illegal-Immigrant-Families-Have-Go", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/16/Trump-Says-Illegal-Immigrant-Families-Have-Go", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Donald%20Trump_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With a new", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Trump has been under pressure from the media and his critics to flesh out his immigration policies beyond his conservative crowd-pleasing pot shots at illegal immigrants and Obama\u2019s executive orders.\nWe will do it [export families] and we will expedite it so people can come back in.\u201d\u201cChuck, it will work out so well, you will be so happy,\u201d Trump gushed.\nFormer neurosurgeon Ben Carson scored a surprising second-place finish, with 12 percent \u2013 or five percentage points higher since the debate.\nCarson was followed by Sen.
