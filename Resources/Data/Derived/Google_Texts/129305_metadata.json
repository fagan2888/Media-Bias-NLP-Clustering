The $85,000 shelter is rated for 34 people to fit inside and is provided by a grant, from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The shelter is rated to withstand upwards to 250 mph wind speeds and Kelly says it's a step in the right direction for the city.\n\n\"Where the shelter sits now, back in 2002 when Newton had the tornado come through, it blew out the wall of the fire station where the shelter sits. It's a common place for tornadoes to come through in the city, so it's a good place to have a shelter.\"\n\nKelly says the hope is to eventually have a shelter at the police station and at the hospital in the future.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The city of Newton received a grant from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency to purchase a Tornado Shelter.", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "The city of Newton received a grant from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency to purchase a Tornado Shelter.", "title": "Newton Receives Tornado Shelter", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Newton-Receives-Tornado-Shelter-291964801.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/8F3/C6D/8F3C6D926E524D35A393D342E68DC51B", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/5CC/AE5/5CCAE526ADDF4658A36C9C3517C6DCC8.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The city of Newton received a grant from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency to purchase a Tornado Shelter.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Newton-Receives-Tornado-Shelter-291964801.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Newton+Shelter+(400x225).jpg", "title": "Newton Receives Tornado Shelter", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Newton Receives Tornado Shelter", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe5221\"", "article_summary": "\"Where the shelter sits now, back in 2002 when Newton had the tornado come through, it blew out the wall of the fire station where the shelter sits.\nNewton Fire Chief Steven Kelly says a new tornado shelter was just installed in the city.\nIt's a common place for tornadoes to come through in the city, so it's a good place to have a shelter.\"\nKelly says the hope is to eventually have a shelter at the police station and at the hospital in the future.\nThe city of Newton just became a little safer when severe weather strikes."}
