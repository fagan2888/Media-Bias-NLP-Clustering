Patients desperate for medical breakthroughs should never have to sacrifice safety in the name of innovation, but legislation underway in Congress could do just that.

Earlier this summer, the House of Representatives passed a medical innovation bill known as the “21st Century Cures Act”—or simply “Cures”—that has several key provisions that would significantly weaken consumer health protections and could lead to patients being exposed to potentially unsafe or ineffective drugs and medical devices.

Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, has serious concerns with the bill, including:

Drug Safety

The 21st Century Cures Act would weaken the FDA’s ability to ensure safe and effective medicines by fast-tracking certain antibiotics and antifungals for approval based on less rigorous testing.

Medical Device Safety

The 21st Century Cures Act would allow the FDA to approve medical devices based on case studies or medical journal articles alone, rather than clinical trials. This means that real world testing would happen only after the device is already on the market and being used by patients. Additionally, the bill would allow medical device companies to make changes to the highest risk devices, like heart valves and brain stents, without first telling the FDA or proving that the altered device remains safe and effective.

Antibiotic Resistance

The 21st Century Cures Act includes incentives to prescribe newly developed antibiotics. Hospitals would receive a bonus for using new antibiotics, which could lead to overuse and antibiotic resistance, undermining one of the very problems the legislation is supposed to address.
