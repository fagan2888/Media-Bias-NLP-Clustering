Duke used an 11-0 run late in the first half to build a 20-point lead and never let the Seminoles get the margin back to single digits again.\n\nDuke won despite shooting 31 percent, but converted 17 FSU turnovers into 29 points and dominated the offensive glass to score 29 second-chance points against the Seminoles (13-6, 4-3).\n\nKrzyzewski is the all-time leader in career victories in men\u2019s Division I with 973. He joins Syracuse\u2019s Jim Boeheim as the only coaches with at least 900 wins at one program.\n\nOkaro White scored 14 points for Florida State, which shot 50 percent but couldn\u2019t protect the ball or keep the Blue Devils off the boards. Duke finished with a 47-24 rebounding advantage, including 27-7 on the offensive glass.\n\nFSU, which won in its last trip here on a last-second 3-pointer two years ago, led by one point for about 1 minute in the first half. But key scorer Aaron Thomas, who was coming off a 20-point effort against Notre Dame, finished with two points on 1-for-7 shooting before fouling out with 5:13 left.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a vintage Duke performance. Krzyzewski was animated and often unhappy with his team in the early minutes, slamming down a chair during an early timeout and shedding his suit jacket by the 12-minute media timeout.\n\nThen, after Duke looked to be in cruise control, the Blue Devils went nearly 7\u00bd minutes without a basket in the second half. They stayed in control by hitting free throws after FSU got as close as 11 points on Montay Brandon\u2019s layup with 6:51 to play. Quinn Cook ended the drought with a driving basket that made it 71-54 with 3:25 left.\n\nDuke made 34 of 43 free throws for the game, including 20 of 27 after halftime to offset a 6-for-27 shooting performance (22 percent) in the second half.\n\nHood was a last-second scratch from the starting lineup. Krzyzewski said Hood was sick, though Hood told reporters he had to change after spilling Gatorade on his uniform. Hood missed his first five shots, but he scored 14 points after halftime.\n\nDuke also got a boost from reserve big man Marshall Plumlee, who posted career-highs of seven points and seven rebounds \u2014 with each rebound coming on the offensive glass.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike Krzyzewski picks up 900th career win at Duke", "title": "Mike Krzyzewski picks up 900th career win at Duke", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/25/mike-krzyzewski-picks-up-900th-career-win-at-duke/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140125__p_4d0500a0-3c9d-4922-bb59-e195730eca81lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140125__p_4d0500a0-3c9d-4922-bb59-e195730eca81lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-25T13:17:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:24:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "18 Duke beat Florida State 78-56 on Saturday, giving Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski his 900th victory at the school.\nKrzyzewski said Hood was sick, though Hood told reporters he had to change after spilling Gatorade on his uniform.\nDURHAM, N.C. \u2014 Rodney Hood scored 18 points to help No.\nDuke won despite shooting 31 percent, but converted 17 FSU turnovers into 29 points and dominated the offensive glass to score 29 second-chance points against the Seminoles (13-6, 4-3).\nKrzyzewski is the all-time leader in career victories in men\u2019s Division I with 973."}
