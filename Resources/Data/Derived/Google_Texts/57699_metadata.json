There are so many who don\u2019t want to take responsibility for their destiny.\u201d\n\nOver 1.1 million migrants fleeing war and failed states flowed into the European Union in 2015 and the influx has continued, prompting countries straddling the main migration corridor through the Balkans to the wealthy north of the EU to seal their borders, trapping tens of thousands in Greece.\n\nRELATED STORY: Sanders: Pope Francis is a socialist like me\n\nLast week, Macedonia trucked 1,500 migrants back to Greece after they forced their way across the border. Images of exhausted migrants fording a fast-moving stream in the cold were splashed across Italian newspapers.\n\nUnder a European Union deal reached last week with Turkey, all migrants and refugees, including Syrians, who cross to Greece illegally by sea will be sent back to Turkey once they are registered and their asylum claims have been processed.\n\nIn return, the EU will take in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey and reward it with more money, early visa-free travel and progress in its EU membership negotiations.\n\nPalm Sunday marks the start of the busiest week in the Catholic liturgical calendar.\n\nFrancis has two events on Holy Thursday, including a ritual where he washes and kisses the feet of 12 people commemorating Christ\u2019s gesture of humility towards his apostles on the night before he died.\n\nThe pope presides at two services on Good Friday, including a candlelight Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession around Rome\u2019s Colosseum.\n\nHe leads an Easter vigil service on Saturday and on Easter Sunday he delivers his twice-yearly \u201cUrbi et Orbi\u201d (to the city and the world) blessing and message from the central balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.\n\n(Reporting by Philip Pullella)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Institutions, News, Catholic, immigrants, Palm Sunday, pope, refugees", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "VATICAN CITY -- Leading Palm Sunday services, Francis departed from his homily to criticize the treatment of refugees.", "title": "Pope says don\u2019t turn backs on refugees", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/20/dont-turn-backs-on-refugees-pope-says-at-palm-sunday-service/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RTSBAFG-e1458473792346.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/20/dont-turn-backs-on-refugees-pope-says-at-palm-sunday-service/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/03/20/dont-turn-backs-on-refugees-pope-says-at-palm-sunday-service/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "VATICAN CITY -- Leading Palm Sunday services, Francis departed from his homily to criticize the treatment of refugees."}, "article_summary": "He departed from his prepared homily to appeal to nations not to turn their backs on refugees.\nRELATED STORY: Sanders: Pope Francis is a socialist like meLast week, Macedonia trucked 1,500 migrants back to Greece after they forced their way across the border.\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis, leading the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in Palm Sunday services leading up to Easter, on Sunday criticized those who he said were washing their hands of the fate of desperate refugees.\nThe pope presides at two services on Good Friday, including a candlelight Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession around Rome\u2019s Colosseum.\nIn return, the EU will take in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey and reward it with more money, early visa-free travel and progress in its EU membership negotiations."}
