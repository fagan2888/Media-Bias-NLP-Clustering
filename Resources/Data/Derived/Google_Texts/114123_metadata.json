Standley Lake somehow rallied to beat Wheat Ridge 44-41 on Saturday afternoon in the Class 4A Mountain League at Jefferson County Stadium, yet Gators coach Don Morse was as calm as if his team had ho-hummed its way past the Farmers.\n\nCoach, weren\u2019t you excited?\n\n\u201cI think the first quarter kind of took everything out of me,\u201d Morse said.\n\nThe man had a point \u2014 earlier, he witnessed his Gators get thumped by 32-8 over the game\u2019s first 12 minutes. The coach called it the worst quarter he had ever been associated with.\n\nAnd in truth, I tweeted out a few times that Standley Lake was ripe to be under the mercy rule \u2026 by halftime.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you,\u201d Morse said.\n\nEven Connor Durant, a tight end who was seemingly all over the field for the Gators and kicked a 40-yard field goal with less than 24 seconds to play to seal it, smiled when I told him.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cYou were probably thinking you could leave at halftime, right?\u201d\n\nAfter a quarter, Wheat Ridge led 32-8. The it was 38-20 at halftime. However, the Gators scored on their opening possession of the second half and took off. Durant had two touchdown receptions among his eight receptions for 153 yards. John Ruiz-Perez rushed for four TDs and the Gators compiled 494 yards of offense, 309 rushing.\n\nMost important was the Standley Lake defensive effort after halftime. It allowed only three points and generated stops. The Gators have been surrendering about 40 points per outing, but their mistakes, Morse said, \u201ccan be fixed.\u201d\n\nAnd before Durant kicked his field goal, the gators had not one, but two TDs called back because of penalty.\n\nWhen I approached the Standley Lake locker room for postgame interviews, blaring from speakers was one of my all-time Motown favorites \u2014 \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough,\u201d performed by two greats, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.\n\nIt seems the Gators know that if they lose one more game, they\u2019re probably out of the postseason. \u201cWe\u2019re right on that bubble,\u201d Morse said.\n\nDurant and his teammates know it.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy just fighting for our lives out there,\u201d Durant said. \u201cWe still fought to live another day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Connor Durant,Don Morse,Standley Lake,Wheat Ridge", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Prepped", "description": "Seriously, it was one of the better turnarounds I\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdve seen.
