MOORE/ISTOCK\n\nGURPREET DHALIWAL: Patients want second opinions to be useful. Doctors do, too.\n\nThe second opinion consultation is an opportunity to provide reassurance or a clear path forward (when opinions agree\u2013as they do about 80% of the time) or to provide options (when opinions disagree). Like most doctors, I both request and provide second opinions, and based on that experience, offer the following tips to get the most out of the process:\n\nCollect and bring medical records yourself. A busy clinic or health system can\u2019t always get the right records to the right person at the right time. It\u2019s an awful hassle to collect all the records, but it\u2019s also a major setback when those records are not available for review at the first meeting. One benefit of these efforts is that the patient emerges more informed about their condition.\n\nFind somebody from a different team. It\u2019s tricky for doctors to disagree with a colleague. And frequently institutional culture (\u201cthat\u2019s the way we do it around here\u201d) influences our decision making as much as science does. Seek your second opinion in another health-care system or online.\n\nIn-person preferred. Online-opinion services are particularly effective for cases that hinge on a single image (photo, X-ray, or slide) or test, but when the data set is extensive, it\u2019s harder to reach a personalized decision online. In a complex case, the doctor needs to understand you as a person through conversation, facial expressions and back-and-forth questions. The doctor should hope to earn your trust in the same way. For the first visit, a lot is missed by not meeting in person.\n\nKnow your key question. Do you wonder most about the diagnosis, the treatment options or the prognosis? The doctor is going to analyze all three, but knowing where your greatest uncertainty lies helps us know where to spend the most time thinking\u2014and explaining.\n\nSometimes patients and doctors approach the second opinion with the hope of getting the \u201cright answer,\u201d but there is rarely such a thing in complex cases. The objective of the second opinion is to provide a new perspective and more information for better decision making. Sometimes the second opinion visit doesn\u2019t end with an opinion at all. Instead it becomes a space to understand the first doctor\u2019s thought process or for the patient to clarify his or her own goals and feel comfortable and informed. In my opinion, that\u2019s time well spent.\n\nDr. Gurpreet Dhaliwal is a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and a staff physician at the San Francisco VA Medical Center.\n\nRead the latest Health Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "GURPREET DHALIWAL: Patients want second opinions to be useful.
