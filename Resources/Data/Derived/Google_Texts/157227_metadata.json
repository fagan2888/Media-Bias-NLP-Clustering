Among them:\n\nCan we shut up about weather for a while, especially weather that is totally in keeping with the seasons in which it\u2019s taking place? It\u2019s only 2015, but it seems like we get storms of the century about every three to six months. Our parents famously walked three miles (uphill both ways, mind you) in sub-zero and scorching temperatures in shoes made of detergent-box cardboard while also mining coal and smoking unfiltered cigarettes by the carton. And here we are, snug in our all-wheel-drive vehicles and Gore-Tex weather wear, demanding work and school be canceled on a 40% likelihood of snow flurries....\n\nAs one Twitter wag put it in response to the non-blizzard of the moment, \u201cRemember: no snow = global warming, lots of snow = global warming, less snow than you thought = global warming.\u201d The important thing being, of course, that we always feel bad about ourselves no matter what\u2019s happening. The United States doesn\u2019t have colonies anymore, but we can still feel bad that our productive might is somehow making the world a worse place....\n\nWhich leads to a second lesson to learn from this latest snow job: To politicians, any and every day is a campaign rally just waiting to happen. Within recent memory, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took heat for failing to react quickly and efficiently to snowstorms, among other weather events. It\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it, the way that our elected leaders never really seem to be there when it matters but are always quick to petition for extra money from taxpayers, the federal government, or private businesses for the next big catastrophe?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "So New York and the East Coast more generally got much less snow than was predicted, an event which provoked this memorable headline: \"Men Promise Brooklyn", "title": "\"Can We All Shut Up About the Weather for a While?\"", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/01/27/can-we-all-shut-up-about-the-weather-for", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14223852107701.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "So New York and the East Coast more generally\ngot much less snow than was predicted, an event which provoked this\nmemorable headline: \"Men\nPromise Brooklyn Women 8 to 12 Inches, Deliver 4.3.\"\nIn a \nnew Time column, I try to draw some lessons from t", "title": "\"Can We All Shut Up About the Weather for a While?\"", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14223852107701.jpg", "creator": "@nickgillespie", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "World", "published_time": "2015-01-27T18:59:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Among them:Can we shut up about weather for a while, especially weather that is totally in keeping with the seasons in which it\u2019s taking place?\nIn a new Time column, I try to draw some lessons from this latest example of overhyped weather coverage.\nChris Christie took heat for failing to react quickly and efficiently to snowstorms, among other weather events.\nWhich leads to a second lesson to learn from this latest snow job: To politicians, any and every day is a campaign rally just waiting to happen.\nThe United States doesn\u2019t have colonies anymore, but we can still feel bad that our productive might is somehow making the world a worse place...."}
