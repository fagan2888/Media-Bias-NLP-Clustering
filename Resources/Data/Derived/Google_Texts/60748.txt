Sotheby’s Sotheby’s sold a 118-carat oval diamond to an Asian private buyer for $30.8 million, a new price record for a white diamond at auction.

Highest ever. Biggest ever. World record.

These were the terms used by Sotheby’s to describe the results of its Magnificent Jewels and Jadeite auction in Hong Kong on Monday, part of a five-day autumn sale marking the firm’s 40 years of operation in Asia.

The jewelry auction’s top lot was a large oval diamond that generated 238.7 million Hong Kong dollars (US$30.8 million), a new price record for a white diamond at auction. The figure fell within its pre-sale estimate of HK$220 million to HK$280 million.

Weighing more than 118 carats, the flawless D-color stone was sold to an Asian private buyer. According to the auction house, it is the largest diamond ever to have been sold at auction.

In China, investors prefer diamonds that are perfect — that is, D-flawless — at the expense of size, Sotheby’s specialist Lisa Hubbard told the Journal earlier this year. By contrast, buyers in other countries will accept slightly flawed stones, favoring size over perfection.

Sotheby’s jewelry sale realized a total of HK$744.7 million (more than US$95 million), the highest takings for an auction of jewelry in the region. Of the 331 lots offered, 247 were sold, while 84 were bought in.

Also on Monday, the auction house held a robust sale of Chinese fine paintings, realizing HK$406 million, more than twice the high estimate of HK$170 million. While the sale set no new records, it saw most of its 359 lots sold, with 17 items bought in. The top lot: Zhang Daqian’s “Spring Dawns Upon the Colorful Hills,” which fetched HK$34.9 million, far above its high estimate of HK$5 million.

Sotheby’s autumn sales conclude today.
