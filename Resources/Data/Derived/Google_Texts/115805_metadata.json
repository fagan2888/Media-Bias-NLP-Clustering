Lindsey Graham said none of the other Republican presidential contenders has a \u201crobust plan\u201d to defeat militant groups in the Middle East, setting himself up as the sole candidate with enough foreign policy experience to lead the United States.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he would commit to \u201cmore American boots on the ground in Iraq,\u201d offering between 3,500 and 10,000 more troops and setting up a regional army to deal with the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Graham acknowledged that fellow GOP candidate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but noted that the first-term senator has the same experience Sen. Barack Obama had when he was elected president.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we need is somebody who is not ready to be commander-in-chief on Day One,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who went on to tout his own experience by saying \u201c33 years in the Air Force, 35 trips on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, I know what works and what\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina offered a different plan to combat the Islamic State, which also is known as ISIS and ISIL.\n\n\u201cWe really are sitting by when we could be leading a coalition of Arab allies to defeat ISIS. I disagree that we\u2019re at that point where we need to put tens of thousands of boots on the ground,\u201d Mrs. Fiorina, the only female Republican candidate, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, was not able to offer a concrete answer on what he would do in the Middle East if he were to occupy the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pretend to be able to know the number [of troops] without a lot of information,\u201d Mr. Carson said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons that we have generals and people who are really able to figure out what needs to be done.\u201d\n\nAnd Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman leading the Republican polls, offered a proposition involving ground troops to take away influence from Middle Eastern countries. He said Americans need to go in and take control of the oil, thereby destabilizing militant groups by tapping into their revenue streams.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much money. And what I would do with the money that we make, which would be tremendous, I would take care of the soldiers that were killed, the families of the soldiers that were killed, the soldiers, the wounded warriors. I love them. And they\u2019re walking all over the streets of New York, all over the streets of every city without arms, without legs, and worse than that. And I would take care of them,\u201d Mr. Trump said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nMrs. Fiorina, Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump have no political experience \u2014 a point they say makes them anti-establishment and appealing to the electorate.\n\nIn a crowded primary field, even candidates with political experience have tried branding themselves as Washington outsiders, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has relied on his gubernatorial record to propel himself through the race.\n\nBut Mr. Graham said Sunday that Mr. Bush\u2019s lack of foreign policy experience has led to lackluster policy proposals.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush is a fine man, but his plan to destroy ISIL doesn\u2019t have a ground component and is really not a whole lot different than that of President Obama,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
