The requirement, which many medical experts said was unnecessary for patient safety, was supposed to take effect on Sept. 1, and it would have forced about 12 of the state\u2019s remaining 19 abortion clinics to close.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s decision, Judge Yeakel also partly rolled back a rule already in effect, a requirement that abortion clinic doctors have admitting privileges at local hospitals. That requirement, also described by medical experts as irrelevant to patient safety, has caused more than 20 clinics across Texas to close.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJudge Yeakel said the admitting-privilege rule should definitely not be applied to clinics in McAllen and El Paso. The evidence was clear, he wrote, that the rule had left women in South and West Texas with little practical access to abortions.\n\nHispanic and low-income women in the Rio Grande Valley, many of them working mothers, have been most affected by the closing of the McAllen clinic, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, chief executive of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, in a telephone news conference on Wednesday.\n\nHer organization provides financial aid to low-income women seeking abortions or other reproductive health services. The McAllen clinic used to perform more than 40 abortions per week, said Fatimah Gifford, director of public relations at Whole Woman\u2019s Health. Since its closing, she said, her group has helped about 15 to 20 women with bus tickets or gas money so they could travel to San Antonio, but \u201cmany women are simply left behind.\u201d\n\nWhole Woman\u2019s Health also announced Wednesday that in September it would open a new clinic in Las Cruces, N.M., serving an impoverished area in the southern part of that state as well as clients from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140903150406, "twitter": {"description": "Whole Woman\u2019s Health will reopen a clinic serving poor women in the Rio
