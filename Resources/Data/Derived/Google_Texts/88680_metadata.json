The insurer specializing in low-income patients gained clients, thanks to increases from the South Carolina and Illinois health plans and the expansion of Medicaid in those states due to the Affordable Care Act. It also realized higher revenue from members receiving long-term services in California, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico and Ohio.\n\nAnother factor, Molina officials said, was greater efficiency. A total 89.5% of revenue was spent on health care; Obamacare requires that insurers devote only 80% of sales toward administering care. A year ago, that figure stood at 87.1%.\n\nAdministrative expenses were cut to 7.3% during the quarter, down from 11% for the same time frame in 2014.\n\nDespite the substantial move by investors to drive up shares Tuesday, analysts weren\u2019t as enthusiastic about the results \u2014 though they were encouraged. They noted that revenue fell slightly short of expectations, coming in at $2.8 billion instead of $2.86 billion, but that earnings might have calmed a jittery market.\n\n\u201cWe see this a decent report, particularly given investor fears,\u201d Leerink Research\u2019s Ana Gupte said in a note to clients.\n\nChris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial Group noted that Molina is waiting to offer its 2015 forecast until it holds a meeting with investors on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe quarterly results suggest the company is making progress on several fronts, particularly as it relates to the ACA-fee in certain key states. Nevertheless, the more important event remains guidance later this week,\u201d Rigg said.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Medicaid expansion in various states gave a lift to insurer Molina Healthcare when it reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday.", "creator": "@russbrittmktw", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DF239_molina_MG_20150210112514.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Russ Britt", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Medicaid expansion in various states gave a lift to insurer Molina Healthcare when it reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-gives-a-lift-to-insurer-molinas-results-2015-02-10", "author": "Russ Britt", "parsely-title": "Obamacare gives a lift to insurer Molina\u2019s results", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-10T11:45:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Medicaid expansion in various states gave a lift to insurer Molina Healthcare when it reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday.", "title": "Obamacare gives a lift to insurer Molina\u2019s results", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-gives-a-lift-to-insurer-molinas-results-2015-02-10", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DF239_molina_MG_20150210112514.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DF239_molina_MG_20150210112514.jpg"}, "article.id": "7522EFE0-B13C-11E4-9E60-FD2AF902D49F", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "For the year, Molina\u2019s membership jumped to more than 2.6 million, up from 1.9 million a year ago.\nA total 89.5% of revenue was spent on health care; Obamacare requires that insurers devote only 80% of sales toward administering care.\nDespite the substantial move by investors to drive up shares Tuesday, analysts weren\u2019t as enthusiastic about the results \u2014 though they were encouraged.\n\u201cThe quarterly results suggest the company is making progress on several fronts, particularly as it relates to the ACA-fee in certain key states.\n\u201cWe see this a decent report, particularly given investor fears,\u201d Leerink Research\u2019s Ana Gupte said in a note to clients."}
