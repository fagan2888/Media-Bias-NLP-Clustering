More than six years later, he still has not finished higher in a World Cup race.\n\nNow, however, the 28-year-old from Lake Placid, N.Y., is a double Olympic medalist. He was a surprise bronze medalist in super-G four years ago at Vancouver, and Sunday he claimed silver in the same event at the Sochi Games.\n\nPeople still talk about his hair-raising performance at Beaver Creek when he was an unknown. Coming off one jump, he got his left leg in the air and landed on the other leg to avoid disaster at more than 60 mph.\n\n\u201cIt showed his guts and courage, and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen in both of his Olympics,\u201d said Sasha Rearick, U.S men\u2019s head coach.\n\nAt the Vancouver Games, teammate Bode Miller took silver ahead of him. Sunday, they reversed positions. Miller tied for bronze with Jan Hudec of Canada, becoming the oldest Olympic alpine medalist at age 36. It was his sixth Olympic medal, putting him behind only Norway\u2019s Kjetil Andre Aamodt (eight) in alpine. Miller also moved into a second-place tie among American medalists at the Winter Games with speedskater Bonnie Blair. Only short-track skater Apolo Ohno (eight) has more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been so stuck on counting them,\u201d said Miller, who missed all of last season because of knee surgery. \u201cThis was a hard year, and a lot of effort coming back to get fit and get ready, just battle everything that life throws at you. To come out and ski hard, it\u2019s almost therapeutic for me to be in these situations where I really have to test myself. I was happy for it to be on the right side of the hundredths. Some days, medals don\u2019t matter. Today was one of the ones where it does matter.\u201d\n\nDespite Weibrecht\u2019s lack of success on the World Cup circuit, he is now the fourth American man to have multiple Olympic medals in alpine racing along with Miller, Phil Mahre and Tommy Moe. Mahre and Moe claimed two each.\n\nSince the Vancouver Games, Weibrecht endured four surgeries on shoulders and ankles, and there were times when he wondered if it was worth it to keep battling.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most emotional day of ski racing I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Weibrecht said. \u201cAll the issues and troubles that I\u2019ve had, to come and be able to have a really strong result like this, it reminds me that all the work I did to come back from the injuries, dealing through the hard times, that\u2019s all worth it. Now it makes sense.\u201d\n\nNorway\u2019s Kjetil Jansrud won with a time of 1 minute, 18.14 seconds. Weibrecht was 0.30 of a second behind. Miller and Hudec, who took Canada\u2019s first alpine medal in 20 years, were 0.53 back.\n\nMiller said Weibrecht was the best man on the mountain with an \u201cincredible\u201d run, because the course was as much as 0.7 of a second slower when he ran with bib No. 29.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so much better than his results show on the World Cup,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the guys who could consistently win in three events. He\u2019s just an unbelievable talent. He\u2019s usually pretty reserved emotionally, and he doesn\u2019t connect skiing with emotion. He just skis with huge intensity normally. Here (at the Olympics), he really connects the emotion to it. That\u2019s why he gets such crazy performances out of himself.\u201d\n\nWeibrecht joked that as recently as Saturday, he wondered whether it was worth it to continue in the sport.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so many times you can get kicked before you start to really feel it,\u201d Weibrecht said. \u201cI try not to focus on results, but I really needed a result to remind me that, more than anything, I\u2019m capable of this and I belong here.\u201d\n\nIf Weibrecht had slower course conditions, he benefited from course reports by Ted Ligety and Miller, who ran ninth and 13th respectively. Ligety finished 14th.\n\n\u201cTed threw down an amazing run, gave up a great course report to Bode,\u201d Rearick said. \u201cBode threw down harder \u2014 where Ted had made a mistake, Bode skied that great. Bode made another little mistake that cost him on the bottom, radioed that up to Andrew, and Andrew put it all together by just going for it. Amazing skiing.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Andrew Weibrecht, Bode Miller medal in super-G \u2013 again", "title": "Andrew Weibrecht, Bode Miller medal in super-G \u2013 again", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/16/andrew-weibrecht-bode-miller-medal-in-super-g-again/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216__20140217_B5_SP17OLYSUPERGp1.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216__20140217_B5_SP17OLYSUPERGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T19:28:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:19:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac05\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s so much better than his results show on the World Cup,\u201d Miller said.\nAt the Vancouver Games, teammate Bode Miller took silver ahead of him.\nMore than six years later, he still has not finished higher in a World Cup race.\nMiller tied for bronze with Jan Hudec of Canada, becoming the oldest Olympic alpine medalist at age 36.\nBode made another little mistake that cost him on the bottom, radioed that up to Andrew, and Andrew put it all together by just going for it."}
