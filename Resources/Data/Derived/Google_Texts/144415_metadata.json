It shows how costs were cut or state aid increased so as to improve the district's bottom line by at least $55 million over the past five years. The tactics ranged from moving some tasks inhouse and other tasks to outside companies, to keeping better records to using the bus fleet more efficiently and changing employee insurance plans.\n\nThe proposed 2015-2016 budget that the board will vote on Sept 28 totals about $500 million, or 10 times the amount of the multi-year savings. Board member Jeanette Ward, one of three members who has been critical of spending, asked why if spending has been so efficient that the budget keeps going up a few percentage points every year.\n\nKing said one reason is that \"we will save in one place so we can invest in some other place in our organization.\" As an example, he noted the thousands of computers being bought to equip classrooms under a multiyear technology upgrade plan that was adopted by the school board a few months ago.\n\nBut even there, the report says, the district cut the estimated cost of its purchases $440,000 by buying HP Stream laptops instead of bigger conventional laptops and by buying iPad Air tablets instead of iPad Air2s. Administrators actually decided on the latter change based on a suggestion by school board members such as Ward.\n\nKing and Burnidge say the savings include:\n\nWhile overall inflation has totaled 15.1 percent over seven years, King and Burnidge said, U46 spending on supplies has gone up just 11.8 percent and on services by just 8.5 percent. That has saved the district $2.9 million, the report said.\n\nBy training special-education staffers to make more detailed reports about the services they are providing to specific students, income from the state's Medicaid reimbursements has almost doubled, from $1.64 million two years ago to $3.06 million last fiscal year.\n\nSchool bus mileage and fuel consumption has dropped because of more efficient bus routes. An estimated $500,00 a year also is being saved by doing some bus maintenance in-house that the district used to hire an outside company to do.\n\nFood service spending dropped almost $1.5 million from May 2014 to May 2015 because of more efficient purchasing, controlling employee hours and a change in employee health insurance.\n\nBy rearranging how working-cash funds are deposited, interest on them has gone up by $448,000 a year.\n\n$8,500 per year each was saved by decreasing the number of mobile classrooms in use from 95 to 36 in recent years.\n\nTotal salaries for administrators and support personnel have increased an average of just 1 percent over the last seven years because of eliminating some posts and limiting pay raises, the report says.\n\nMost professional development sessions for teachers have been moved to after-school times to lower the need to hire substitute teachers. The need for subs also will be reduced this year because the state will require fewer testing sessions. Projected savings: $750,000.\n\nThe employee health insurance offerings are decided not by union contracts but by a health care committee composed of employees and administrators. In the past five years, the report says, U46's costs have gone up an average of 2.52 percent a year while nationwide health insurance costs have gone up an average 8.26 percent. Over the next two years, King said, that will be changed further as a preferred provider organization (PPO) option is phased out and employees are encouraged to enroll in a \"healthy\" option by meeting certain health standards. King said that if the PPO is not phased out, it might be considered a \"Cadillac plan\" under the Affordable Care Act, and that would subject the district to stiff federal penalties.\n\nThe district saved $879,000 in just a year by eliminating its print shop and hiring Office Depot to do printing.\n\nThe district has received $216,000 over the past four school years by reselling recyclable materials, though that is expected to drop this school year to $22,000.\n\nThe district negotiated prices of supplies from sellers that King and Burnidge estimate yielded $8.1 million in net savings.\n\nBy switching the payroll data-processing system, licensing fees dropped from $383,000 four years ago to $69,000 last fiscal year.\n\nThe district also saved $925,000 by buying \"virtual\" computer servers that each can do the work of 15 regular servers.\n\nBy replacing or rebuilding things \u2014 capital projects that themselves cost $36 million \u2014 King estimates the district saved $5.4 million in repair costs and down time over three years.\n\nKing expects U46 to get $86,000 this year from ComEd as a reward for agreeing to let power deliveries to the high schools be reduced in times of extreme power demand \u2014 which most often would happen during the summer break as air conditioning use is at its peak. King said he expects middle schools to be added to this program next year, increasing the reward from ComEd by another $250,000 a year. An effort to cut electricity consumption in each school also has cut power bills by $75,000 a year, which King said is like getting two free months of electricity for two elementary schools.\n\ndgathman@tribpub.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "District U46 administration says they cut $55 million in costs", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "Elgin Courier-News", "description": "Responding to complaints from taxpayers and some newly elected school board members, the financial executives of Elgin School District U46 have issued a report claiming the district has saved at least $55 million in recent years through various changes in how U46 does its business.", "title": "District U46 administration says they cut $55 million in costs", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/elgin-courier-news/news/ct-ecn-u46-efficiency-st-0922-20150921-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56009684/turbine/ct-ecn-u46-efficiency-st-0922-20150921", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@couriernews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Elgin School District U46, Jeanette Ward", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/84485318", "fb": {"page_id": 60569705796, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-09-21", "Description": "As the district struggles with some complaints about its budget, an Elgin School District U46 report claims district leaders saved over $55 million in recent years through various cost efficiencies changing how things are done.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elgin School District U46, Jeanette Ward"}, "article_summary": "By replacing or rebuilding things \u2014 capital projects that themselves cost $36 million \u2014 King estimates the district saved $5.4 million in repair costs and down time over three years.\nThe district saved $879,000 in just a year by eliminating its print shop and hiring Office Depot to do printing.\nAdministrators actually decided on the latter change based on a suggestion by school board members such as Ward.\nResponding to complaints from taxpayers and some newly elected school board members, the financial executives of Elgin School District U46 have issued a report claiming the district has saved at least $55 million in recent years through various changes in how U46 does its business.\nThat has saved the district $2.9 million, the report said."}
