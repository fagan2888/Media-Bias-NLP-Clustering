Mills, who wore a Camp Crystal Lake shirt.\n\nMills and his friend Sam Donato, both traveled an hour from Scranton, Pennsylvania after hearing about the event on Facebook. The pair even made the long trek up Sand Pond Road to visit Camp NoBeBoSco, the filming location for Camp Crystal Lake or Camp Blood.\n\n\"It's just so cool to hear the locals talk about it too,\" Donato said.\n\nBlairstown resident Jenny Hovell goes to the screening every time it's offered.\n\n\"It's definitely the coolest thing here,\" she said. \"Just seeing this many people and cars is out of the normal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, her friends Faith Torppey and Debbie Magalhaes, other locals, were seeing the movie for the first time and were excited to be able to point out the Blairstown landmarks.\n\nDuring the screening, the delightfully campy premise of the movie was reinforced as the audience cheered for scenes shot in Blairstown on Main Street at the Old Mill and at the local diner.The Historic Blairstown Theatre itself, previously Roy\u2019s Hall, is featured in the film as it appeared in 1980.\n\nWhen the theater opened as an art venue in 2011, owner Mark Clifford showed the film on its opening night, also a Friday the 13th. He calls it their lucky day and plans to screen the film again on the next Friday the 13th in December.\n\nThe Historic Blairstown Theatre is not typically a movie venue, but instead features a regular schedule of live music and theatrical performances, classic film and community events. Local artists also display their work in the lobby and entrance hall.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nElephant Revival \u2014 Friday, Sept. 27\n\nVienna Teng \u2014 Saturday, Oct. 5\n\nAn Evening with RICKI LEE JONES \u2014 Saturday, Oct. 12\n\nTim Shelton & NewFound Road \u2014 Friday, Oct. 18\n\nBallet Enchante \u2014 Saturday, Oct. 19\n\nZinghoppers: A Superhero Learning Adventure \u2014 Sunday through Monday, Oct. 20-21\n\nAn Evening with The Patrick Fitzsimmons Band \u2014 Friday, Oct. 25\n\nWNTI Benefit with the Todd Wolfe Band \u2014 Saturday, Oct. 26\n\nFor tickets and information visit thehbt.com\n\nMore Warren County news: NJ.com/Warren \u2022 Twitter\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@warren','blairstown','warren-county'", "title": "Screenings of 'Friday the 13th' sell out at The Historic Blairstown Theatre", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Screenings of \\u0027Friday the 13th\\u0027 sell out at The Historic Blairstown Theatre\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/warrenreporter/index.ssf/2013/09/screenings_of_friday_the_13th.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/warren-photos/photo/2013/09/13408966-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11242843\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-14T15:04:11Z\", \"author\": \"Emily Cummins | For NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@warren\",\"blairstown\",\"warren-county\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/warren-photos/photo/2013/09/13408966-small.jpg", "creator": "@emilyacummins", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Tickets sold out for both screenings of the original \"Friday the 13th\" movie at The Historic Blairstown Theatre last night as horror fans, traveling either for miles across the state or from just down the street, lined the block to..."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 14, 2013, 11:04 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/warren-photos/photo/2013/09/13408966-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"eacummins\", \"author_nickname\": \"Emily Cummins | For NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"10751447\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Warren Reporter\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/warrenreporter/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Tickets sold out for both screenings of the original \"Friday the 13th\" movie at The Historic Blairstown Theatre last night as horror fans, traveling either for miles across the state or from just down the street, lined the block to...", "title": "Screenings of 'Friday the 13th' sell out at The Historic Blairstown Theatre", "url": "http://www.nj.com/warrenreporter/index.ssf/2013/09/screenings_of_friday_the_13th.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 14, 2013, 11:04 AM", "article_author": "Emily Cummins | For NJ.com", "Description": "Tickets sold out for both screenings of the original \"Friday the 13th\" movie at The Historic Blairstown Theatre last night as horror fans, traveling either for miles across the state or from just down the street, lined the block to secure a seat. \"I've been here before just to visit, but coming here for this is pretty awesome,\" said J.T.
