Beck said he looked in to Bevin before the interview, consulting with groups like FreedomWorks and the Senate Conservatives Fund, and was shocked that some of the groups\u2019 members described him as the best constitutional candidate they have seen, period. The Madison Project has already officially endorsed him.\n\nBevin modestly commented: \u201cTo say I\u2019m a constitutionalist like [Senators] Mike Lee or Ted Cruz would be an insult to them, although we\u2019ve had interesting discussions and I think the world of them.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to describe himself and the condition of his soul (Beck\u2019s favorite question to ask aspiring politicians), Bevin remarked: \u201cI\u2019m a guy who grew up, second of six children, and I grew up in the country in a three bedroom house. Ate everything we grew on our own land\u2026It was a home grounded very much on Judeo-Christian ethics and principles. And my Christian faith is really the cornerstone of who I am as a person. So my entire life as a business person, husband, father, how I will be as a politician is grounded in my Christian faith. So that\u2019s me from a broad stroke.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about his professional experience, Bevin said he put himself through college and joined the military, where he was an army officer on active duty for \u201ca number of years.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeft the military a little over twenty years ago. Have worked exclusively in the private sector. Small business owner, a guy who employs other people, pays taxes and pays attention,\u201d Bevin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am in this race, because I do not see the future, the American dream being offered to future generations in the way that it was to mine and those who preceded me.\u201d\n\nBevin\u2019s website has more information on his experience. One accomplishment, in particular, stands out:\n\nIn 2008, Matt began helping out at Bevin Bros. \u2013 a bell manufacturing company that had been in the Bevin family since it opened its doors in 1832. Besieged by high taxes and foreign competition, Bevin Bros. was on the verge of bankruptcy and Matt\u2019s uncle was planning to shut it down. In 2011, Matt became the President of Bevin Bros. In only a year, he paid off all the company\u2019s debts and back taxes, modernized the business model, and saved more than 20 jobs. After the company was struck by lightning in 2012 and burned to the ground, Matt started over yet again. Today, Bevin Bros. continues to make thousands of bells including those used by the Salvation Army and Macy\u2019s Santas every year.\n\nBevin has also served on numerous non-profit boards, including as chairman of the board of the American Red Cross, Louisville Area Chapter, according to his website. He has permanently endowed a number of scholarship funds, grants and centers that offer educational opportunities for young people in the U.S. with limited financial resources. He has also done extensive work to help the underprivileged overseas, helping to construct water towers, expand electrical grids, erect security walls, develop agriculture and dairy programs, and update classroom facilities in India and Africa.\n\nBeck said he felt the need to get one question out of the way before continuing the interview, seeing as Bevin described himself first and foremost as a Christian.\n\n\u201cDo you believe that rape is sometimes the way God works to create children?\u201d Beck asked sarcastically.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bevin remarked, adding that he has no \u201cburning desire to to discuss the physiology of women at any point in this campaign.\u201d\n\nThe two proceeded to discuss issues like Obamacare, the national debt, domestic surveillance, and Common Core.\n\nBeck also asked Bevin about an MSNBC interview that, when you look him up on Google, is prominently displayed. The title is, \u201cMatt Bevin: I\u2019m Not \u2018a Tea Party Guy.\u2019\u201d\n\nBevin explained that while he agrees with many of the values of the Tea Party, and is proud to have the support of more than 15 local Tea Party affiliates around the state, he isn\u2019t a member of one.\n\n\u201cI want people to understand, I\u2019m not pretending to be something I\u2019m not,\u201d Bevin said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give the impression that I\u2019ve been a Tea Party leader. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the father of nine children. I own a number of businesses. And I\u2019ve been busy paying taxes and living life.\u201d\n\nBevin\u2019s children range in age from ages 3-14. Four were adopted from Ethiopia.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
