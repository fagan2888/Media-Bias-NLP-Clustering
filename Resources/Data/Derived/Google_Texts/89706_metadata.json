The other two projects would be eligible for tax breaks under the West Virginia Tourism Development Act, which would be revived under the proposed bill.\n\nLobbyist Larry Puccio, who represents Justice, told the committee the medical clinic will be a $90 million project \u201cthat will bring money in from many different countries and many different states.\u201d\n\nAs Justice previously announced, world-renowned Dr. James Andrews and associates will be working at the clinic three-days a week. Puccio told the committee the 40-acre site near the Greenbrier has been readied for construction in recent months and the Certificate of Need required from the state Health Care Authority should be granted by the end of the year.\n\nPuccio said the other two projects Justice is planning are significant, though thy have yet to be announced publicly. He said all three projects would result in a $400 million investment.\n\nSen. Clark Barnes (R-Randolph) questioned the timing of the tax credit proposal.\n\n\u201cWhy at this point do you need to come back and get tax credits for Mr. Justice?\u201d Barnes said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in business a long time and I know when I plan a business, when I plan an office, I plan to pay for it myself. I don\u2019t come to the state and ask for tax credits.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even think about it after the project is about done. What is the reason at this point that Mr. Justice should be getting tax credits for a project that he has already planned for a long time and already begun?\u201d\n\nPuccio said Justice thought all three projects would be eligible for tax breaks under the Tourism Development Act. However, because a medical facility doesn\u2019t produce revenues from sales tax, the medical facility would not be eligible. That\u2019s why they are seeking the legislation.\n\nFinance committee members passed the bill. The legislation will be up for final reading Saturday morning in the Senate.\n\nThe Tomblin administration supports the bill, according to Deputy Chief of Staff Jason Pizatella, whol told the committee the administration insisted the proposed credit be narrowly crafted only allowing the Greenbrier to be eligible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Resort owner has plans for three projects worth $400 million.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Resort owner has plans for three projects worth $400 million.", "title": "Greenbrier\u2019s Justice seeks tax break in regular session\u2019s final hours", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2014/03/07/greenbriers-justice-seeks-tax-break-in-regular-sessions-final-hours/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Greenbrier-Medical-Institute.jpg", "height": 220}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-08T00:00:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-08T01:05:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced27\"", "article_summary": "Puccio said the other two projects Justice is planning are significant, though thy have yet to be announced publicly.\nSen.
