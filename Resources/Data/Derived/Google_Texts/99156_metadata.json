By that standard doing almost anything in an English speaking country like the U.S. must qualify. Why not a trip to an amusement park?\" Paul's report read.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Paul, who is running for president, pointed to a grant offered by the State Department \u2014 and announced through the U.S. embassy in Pakistan \u2014 that would allow \"non-elite\" Pakistani kids between the age of 13 and 18 enrolled in an English-language program to come to the United States for a two-week trip. The trip would involve visiting NASA's Space Camp and then traveling to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe program was estimated to get $250,000 in funding.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican targeted the program as part of his \"waste report,\" which Paul uses to highlight what he views as wasteful government spending.\n\nThe program, according to the State Department's announcement, was meant to teach leadership skills, improve an understanding of the United States and \"promote the development of English language, social, and analytical skills of the participants, through first-hand experiences in science and technology.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Paul is highlighting the program as part of \"waste report.\"", "description": "Paul is highlighting the program as part of \"waste report.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Paul is highlighting the program as part of \"waste report.\"", "title": "Paul takes aim at State, space camp", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/250766-paul-takes-aim-at-state-space-camp", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/paulrand_042515getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/250766-paul-takes-aim-at-state-space-camp", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-10T16:10-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Jordain Carney", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Jordain Carney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Rand Paul,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-10T16:10:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/250766-paul-takes-aim-at-state-space-camp", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Paul is highlighting the program as part of \"waste report.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Paul takes aim at State, space camp"}, "dcterms.title": "Paul takes aim at State, space camp"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1589\"", "article_summary": "\"Space Camp to learn English?\nThe trip would involve visiting NASA's Space Camp and then traveling to Washington, D.C.\nThe Kentucky Republican targeted the program as part of his \"waste report,\" which Paul uses to highlight what he views as wasteful government spending.\nBy that standard doing almost anything in an English speaking country like the U.S. must qualify.\nThe program, according to the State Department's announcement, was meant to teach leadership skills, improve an understanding of the United States and \"promote the development of English language, social, and analytical skills of the participants, through first-hand experiences in science and technology.\""}
