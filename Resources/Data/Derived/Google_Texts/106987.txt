Political Wire publisher Taegan Goddard was forced to admit his ignorance of Christian belief, after he was roundly chastised on Twitter for mocking Wisconsin’s Scott Walker and the Republican governor’s claim that he does communicate with God through prayer.

The quasi-apology came after Mr. Walker said he was still waiting on “God’s calling” before he made a decision about a presidential run. Mr. Goddard, in response to that, put out a snarky tweet: “Gov. Scott Walker’s office was unable to provide any transcripts of his conversations with God,” The Daily Caller reported.

After receiving critical Twitter replies from those in the know about the Christian faith who pointed out that Mr. Walker’s belief was actually very common, Mr. Goddard still dug down, writing in another tweet: “I don’t pretend I can talk with God. But perhaps Scott Walker can,” The Daily Caller reported.

He finally put out a more serious tweet, to a couple of his critics, writing: “Serious question: Can you divine God’s will from that prayer? Scott Walker says he’s trying to. I’m not sure he can.”

After receiving the reply — yes, that’s how Christians think, and it’s called discernment — Mr. Goddard then quieted his sarcasm a bit, tweeting: “I find it interesting when politicians say they get guidance from God. I never knew how,” he wrote, The Daily Caller found.
