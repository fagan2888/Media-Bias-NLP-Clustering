Details here.\n\nThe March 31st enrollment deadline for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is approaching. The state of California is handling the insurance exchange and enrollment through Covered California. According to the state\u2019s enrollment statistics in February, San Diego has already surpassed its target, reaching 105% of its goal by the end of December.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that everyone who is eligible has enrolled. Kaiser Permanente is hosting two events in San Diego, one on Saturday March 22 and the other on Saturday March 29 to assist people who want to enroll.\n\nKPBS recently reported that Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee came to San Diego to provide an update on the local enrollment.\n\n\u201cHere in San Diego over 80 percent of the people signing up are getting a subsidy, which means they\u2019re getting a check sent every month to the private plan they pick to lower the cost of that plan,\u201d Lee said. \u201cFor some that make less money, their share is literally 20 bucks, 30 bucks. For others it may be a few hundred dollars, depending on their income, it\u2019s a sliding scale. But the vast majority of people signing up for Covered California are getting a subsidy to lower the cost of that care.\u201d\n\nKaiser Permanente\u2019s enrollment opportunity on Saturday March 22 will be held from 9am to 3pm at the San Diego Medical Center/Kaiser Foundation Hospital, Classrooms 3 and 4.
