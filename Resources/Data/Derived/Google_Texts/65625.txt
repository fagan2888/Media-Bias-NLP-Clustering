Gov. Jay Inslee today released the following statement regarding the status of budget negotiations in the special session and upcoming bill action:

“As I mentioned last Friday, budget negotiators have been working productively and in good faith to reach an agreement on the supplemental budget. Legislators informed me this morning they made great progress over the weekend and will be briefing their caucuses this afternoon on the status of their discussions.

“This information gives me the confidence I need to begin signing bills and clears the way for legislators to reconsider the bills I vetoed as a result of the lack of a budget agreement before the end of the regular session. As I said previously, I have no objection to seeing these bills become law once a budget agreement is reached.

“I appreciate the work of both House and Senate members who have been working hard these past few weeks to reach agreement. I look forward to seeing an agreement on a supplemental budget as soon as possible and a timely finish to the special session.”
