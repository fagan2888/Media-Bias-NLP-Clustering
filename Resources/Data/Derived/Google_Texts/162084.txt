Spotlight on… Troy Tulowitzki, shortstop, Blue Jays

What’s up: The debate will rage for a long time to come, but a month after the trade that sent Tulo from Colorado to Toronto for Jose Reyes and three pitching prospects, it’s worth taking a look at how Tulowitzki and Reyes have fared in their new homes.

Background: Tulo was slumping at the time of the trade, but he got off to a fast start in his first few games wearing Blue Jays blue. Since then, he has cooled considerably, hitting just .208 in August with three homers and eight RBIs. Batting from the leadoff spot and facing new pitchers in a new league, Tulo has not been the offensive powerhouse the Blue Jays envisioned. Not yet anyway.

Saunders’ take: After hitting a two-run homer Friday night at Pittsburgh, Reyes was hitting .267 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. Although Reyes still has good speed, it has yet to transfer to games while wearing a Rockies uniform. From what I have seen, Reyes doesn’t have Tulowitzki’s arm or range. Friday night, Tulo wowed Toronto fans with one of his patented jump throws from short to throw out Detroit’s Ian Kinsler. “That play Tulo made, it doesn’t get any better than that,” Blue Jays manager John Gibbons told reporters. Bottom line: After winning Saturday, Toronto is 23-5 since acquiring Tulo — and I have a feeling he will be special down the stretch.
