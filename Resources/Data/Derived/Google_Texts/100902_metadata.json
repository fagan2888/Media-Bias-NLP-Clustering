The reason is that Obamacare requires electronic medical records and electronic prescribing and I simply don\u2019t have the finances at this time to go into debt to provide that for my office, it would just be a complete new transfer of electronic equipment in my office for that.\n\nSo for me, at my age, I\u2019m just not ready to go into financial debt. Of the 20,000 pages in there, probably up to 1,000 pages are about doctors' offices.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve got 6,000 records, some of them are two inches thick. It would just be basically impossible to scan all of these and put them on electronic medical records and very expensive, by the way,\u201d said Dr. Kiteck, pointing to the many man hours of pay that an electronic overhaul would require.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a solo practice, I\u2019m just a very small solo practice. I call myself a mom and pop practice,\u201d Dr. Kiteck explained, \u201cso I\u2019ve had it for about twenty years here in Somerset, Kentucky.\u201d\n\nThe ad ran for the sake of his customers, according to the doctor. It is a common courtesy to give patients a one-month notice, \u201cI just happened to start it out with that little notice there, because so many patients have questions why you\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nKiteck said his ad likely opened up a Pandora\u2019s Box. But the truth is, the box had already been opened when Obamacare was signed into law, and the frightening effects are only beginning to fly out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare realities just became a little more intense in the Bluegrass State.
