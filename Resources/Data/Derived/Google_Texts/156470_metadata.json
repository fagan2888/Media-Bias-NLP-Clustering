Those 10 and their enrollment rates: \u2022 Arizona: 54 percent\n\n\u2022 Indiana: 52 percent\n\n\u2022 North Dakota: 51 percent\n\n\u2022 Ohio: 45 percent\n\n\u2022 Texas: 40 percent\n\n\u2022 Louisiana: 40 percent\n\n\u2022 Oklahoma: 38 percent\n\n\u2022 South Dakota: 36 percent\n\n\u2022 Alaska: 36 percent\n\n\u2022 Mississippi: 30 percent\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona\u2019s health-insurance marketplace reached barely half of its projected enrollment under the Affordable Care Act by the end of last year, according to an analysis released Wednesday.\n\nThe analysis by the Commonwealth Fund said the state hit just 54 percent percent of its projected enrollment in the first three months of \u201cObamacare,\u201d a sluggish performance that put it in the bottom half of all states.\n\nOf the 27 states with federally facilitated exchange marketplaces, Arizona\u2019s year-end enrollment rate fell in the bottom 10.\n\nOf all states and the District of Columbia, only 10 had achieved or exceeded their projected enrollment as of Dec. 28, said Sara R. Collins, vice president of health care coverage and access for the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nErin Klug, health insurance exchange program manager for the Arizona Department of Insurance, said Wednesday that the ACA rollout has uncovered new problems in the state that her department will have to address as marketplace enrollment grows.\n\nKlug, speaking during a webinar in which the Commonwealth findings were discussed, said the most prominent issue is the lack of standards covering network adequacy for preferred provider organizations in Arizona.\n\n\u201cWe have some interesting issues coming out of the rural parts of the state,\u201d where some PPO plans are being offered even though they may not have providers in those areas, she said.\n\nArizona has adequacy standards for health maintenance organizations, but only half of the \u201cquality health plan\u201d issuers through the online marketplace in Arizona are HMOs. The rest are PPOs.\n\nOther problems that the state is concerned about are plan mismatches and fraud, Klug said.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Insurance has been receiving about 150 calls per month regarding the insurance marketplace, Klug said. But, by and large, the department is uninvolved in plan enrollment and eligibility, special enrollments and marketplace appeals, she said.\n\n\u201cAfter they\u2019ve purchased insurance, that\u2019s when the state insurance department kicks in,\u201d Klug said.\n\nThe department oversees problems with insurance plans, claim denials and delays, claim appeals, agent misconduct, insurance scams and access to care, according to Klug\u2019s prepared presentation.\n\nSarah J. Dash of the Georgetown Health Policy Institute added that states with federally run marketplaces are experiencing more coordination problems regarding Medicaid than those with state partnership exchanges or state-based exchanges.\n\nThose states that opted for the federally facilitated exchange, such as Arizona, also had significantly less funding compared to state-run exchanges, Dash said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/14/01/22-rollout-map-front.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Arizona\u2019s health-insurance marketplace reached barely half of its projected enrollment under the Affordable Care Act by the end of last year, according to an analysis released Wednesday.
