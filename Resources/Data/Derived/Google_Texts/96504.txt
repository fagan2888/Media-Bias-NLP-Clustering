2014 Presidential Medal of Honor Ceremony

In his remarks to the recipients and their families this afternoon, the President highlighted how each recipient's dedication to public service has made America stronger:

"This is one of my favorite events. Once a year, we set aside this event to celebrate people who have made America stronger, and wiser, and more humane, and more beautiful with our highest civilian honor -- the Presidential Medal of Freedom."

During the ceremony, President Obama even joked with a few of the recipients:

“I think this is like the third or fourth award Meryl’s gotten since I’ve been in office, and I’ve said it publicly: I love Meryl Streep. I love her. Her husband knows I love her. Michelle knows I love her. There’s nothing either of them can do about it.”

“And then there’s Stevie. Don't get Michelle talking about Stevie Wonder now. Early copies of Stevie Wonder’s classic album Talking Book had a simple message, written in Braille: “Here is my music. It is all I have to tell you how I feel. Know that your love keeps my love strong.” This is, by the way, the first album I ever bought with my own money. I was 10 years old, maybe 11, with my own cash. I didn't have a lot of it. And I listened to that -- that thing got so worn out, had all scratches. Young people, you won’t remember this, but you’d have albums. And they’d get scratched. “

“For more than half a century, in every single Congress, John introduced a bill for comprehensive health care. That is, until he didn’t have to do it anymore.”

At the end of the ceremony, the President described the gifts that these extraordinary individuals have given to us:

"We thank all of them for the gifts they’ve given to us, the incredible performances, the incredible innovation, the incredible ideas, and the incredible expressions of the human spirit. And not only have they made the world better, but by following their example, they make us a little bit better every single day."
