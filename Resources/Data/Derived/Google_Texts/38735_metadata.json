Chris Christie tonight tore with renewed vigor into Florida Senator Marco Rubio on the last debate stage of the Republican Presidential Primary prior to New Hampshire\u2019s Tuesday election.\n\n\u201cYou have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven\u2019t,\u201d Christie told his rival, branding Rubio as a GOP version of President Barack Obama, who was also a first-term senator when he ran for president. \u201cDo not make the same mistake again.\u201d\n\nSurging post Iowa, Rubio flailed in response.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cHe knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don\u2019t want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAll week, Christie \u2013 trying to stay alive in this, his firewall state, has criticized Rubio, whom some establishment types have begun to embrace as the party\u2019s 2016 golden boy.\n\nChristie\u2019s not buying it.\n\n\u201cSee Marco, Marco, the thing is this, when you\u2019re president of the United States, when you\u2019re a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn\u2019t solve one problem for one person,\u201d the New Jersey governor said.\n\nThe two candidates got entangled in each other while the rest of the contenders stood back and watched.\n\nSENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didn\u2019t even want to go back. They had to shake you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts, here\u2019s the bottom line, this notion that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing \u2014 CHRIS CHRISTIE: There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: That\u2019s the reason why this campaign is so important because I think this notion, I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we\u2019re going through here. We are not facing a President that doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows what he is doing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s done the things he\u2019s done. That\u2019s why we have a President that passed Obamacare and the stimulus, all this damage he\u2019s done to America is deliberate. This is a President that\u2019s trying to redefine this country. That\u2019s why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake. This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Bernie Sanders, a Hillary Clinton, or anyone like that. Our children are going to be the first to inherit a diminishes country, that will not happen. CHRIS CHRISTIE: You know what the shame is, Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work, plowing the streets, getting the trains running back on time when you have never been responsible for that in your entire life. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: He didn\u2019t want to go back. CHRIS CHRISTIE: And the fact is, I went back, it got done and here\u2019s \u2014 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: You didn\u2019t want to go back, Chris. CHRIS CHRISTIE: Oh, so wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States Senator ESP also? I don\u2019t think it is. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: You said you weren\u2019t going to go back. he told everyone he wasn\u2019t going to go back. They had to shame him into going back. And when he decided to go back, he criticized the young lady, saying, what am I supposed to do, clean it up with a mop? CHRIS CHRISTIE: It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: It\u2019s not a talking point, it\u2019s your record.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/christ.png?w=50", "description": "MANCHESTER - Gov.
