Today, a brightly colored mural reading \u201cLive in Peace\u201d adorns the house on that corner. Other motifs include a gun sprouting flowers, an anatomically correct heart and a serene woman in a yoga pose.\n\nThis is the headquarters of the Mural Music & Arts Project, an East Palo Alto-based organization that offers year-round youth development programs in the arts, including intricate graffiti art and hip-hop music.\n\nWith funding for public school art programs on the decline, the project has stepped in to fill an important void. The Ravenswood City School District, which serves K-8 students from East Palo Alto and east Menlo Park, does not offer in-school art classes. \u201cThe arts have suffered tremendously,\u201d said newly appointed Superintendent Gloria Hernandez. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an area of focus in terms of our curriculum and instruction, and my goal is to change that.\u201d\n\nStarting next school year, Hernandez wants to partner with the Mural Music & Arts Project to create a visual and performing arts curriculum for grades 6-8 that corresponds with state educational standards.\n\nHernandez\u2019s vision aligns well with the goals of the Mural Music & Arts Project. As the project\u2019s deputy director, Olatunde Sobomehin, puts it, \u201cThe mission is pretty simple: It\u2019s to educate, empower and inspire youth through participation in the arts.\u201d\n\nProject staff members are eager to work more closely with the schools, Sobomehin said, adding, \u201cIt is in the creative space, in the artistic space, where the highest form of thinking occurs.\u201d\n\nPainter and East Palo Alto resident Sonya Clark-Herrera founded the project in 2001 with her husband Eugene, a lawyer and curriculum developer. Their initial goals were modest. \u201cWe just wanted to tie in our skills,\u201d Clark-Herrera said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think we would stay doing it for 13 years. We thought it was a summer program, and then it evolved.\u201d\n\nWhat started as a program that hired local teens to design and install a public mural in their community grew into something much larger after the group\u2019s first piece was unveiled on Sept. 10, 2001. City officials and district personnel asked if the group would create a mural for every school in the Ravenswood district.\n\nThe program grew from there, always remaining youth-driven. With seven programs to date, ideas for new programming are born out of the interests of the participants.\n\nClick here to open the gallery.\n\n\n\nThe most recent development is the formation of the Youth Leadership Academy in 2011. In this program, 20 to 25 high school leaders from the San Francisco and East Palo Alto communities come together to receive social, emotional and academic support.\n\n\u201cWe found out that we couldn\u2019t touch them simply through art,\u201d Sobomehin said. \u201cWe had the trust and the leverage to address many other things.\u201d\n\n\n\nParticipants agree that the Mural Music & Arts Project has helped them develop in ways that reach far beyond arts education, especially through programs like the Youth Leadership Academy. The organization is a family, Sobomehin said.\n\nSusan Vunga, a senior at East Palo Alto Academy, has been involved with the project since her sophomore year and is a member of the Youth Leadership Academy.\n\nOn a Monday evening, Vunga sits on a cushioned couch at the Mural Music & Arts Project headquarters. Outside, two high school boys are spray painting the words \u201cSave Life\u201d onto a wall, while younger kids roll by on skateboards or shoot hoops. Kyle Tana, one of the program instructors, greets all the kids by name.\n\nVunga is taking a break from working on her essay for government class. She stares out at the wall across from her, decorated with bold splashes of blue and orange graffiti art.\n\n\u201cIf I wouldn\u2019t have come to MMAP [Mural Music & Arts Project], I wouldn\u2019t have realized I\u2019m capable of being that type of person that can\u2026 communicate with people the way I can now,\u201d she said, explaining that the program has helped her to open up and express herself more honestly.\n\nShe\u2019s been doing very well in school lately, she said. She believes this is largely due to an inspiring message she received from a former staff member, who left the project to pursue higher education. \u201cShe said something about, look at what she\u2019s doing, it shows us that we can do things like that too,\u201d Vunga recounted. \u201cI don\u2019t hear people saying that too often, especially in this community.\u201d\n\nSarah Woodward, director of Arts and Programs, explains that while the Youth Leadership Academy explicitly promotes \u201cwraparound\u201d development, all of the programs aim to address elements of educational and personal growth that extend beyond the art form being studied.\n\nThe History through Hip Hop program, for example, works to foster increased literacy, positive goal-setting and expression through performance. Sitting amid a stack of records and a set of giant speakers, History through Hip Hop director Demetric Sanders explained how he tries to \u201cextract learning through hip-hop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes Drake\u2019s line so catchy?\u201d he asked, \u201cWell, he has a cool simile\u2026. Or he has a metaphor, or he has a rhetorical question\u2026 so we learn these lyrical devices and how we can incorporate those into our rhymes.\u201d\n\nThe best rappers, he said, constantly integrate advanced vocabulary words into their music and are knowledgeable about a wide range of subjects they can cleverly allude to. Most importantly, though, he emphasizes that hip-hop can teach youth about setting goals.\n\n\u201cHip-hop is really about ambition\u2026 going out there and getting it, making things happen, dreaming about something and going and achieving your goals,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhile hip-hop artists sometimes talk about reaching these goals through illegal or violent means, Sanders teaches youth to take this ambitious mindset out of the context of hip-hop and apply it to more positive academic, personal and interpersonal goals in their lives.\n\nSuperintendent Hernandez, a big proponent of reintegrating music programs back into the Ravenswood district, wants to align after-school programs such as History through Hip Hop with the in-school curriculum and literacy goals. Like Sanders, she\u2019s excited about the vocabulary-building and performative aspects of rap and spoken word.\n\nThe Graffiti Arts Program is another artistic endeavor that connects with youth on their own terms. Developed in 2010 in an effort to both legitimize graffiti as an art form and to reduce vandalism, the program partners with the East Palo Alto Police Department and receives funding through the U.S. Department of Justice. It responds to youthful desires to find a legal outlet for self-expression via graffiti art.\n\nArtist in Residence Edward \u201cScape\u201d Martinez said the straightforward and bold style of graffiti connects with youth who are seeking affirmation and validation about their place in the world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life affirming. It\u2019s about making a statement that I exist, that other people like me exist,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea of reclaiming space, of reclaiming large spaces to say something.\u201d\n\nSince this style already speaks to so many youth, Martinez said it is a great jumping off point to teach kids about classic ideas of color theory, form and design that they may not otherwise be interested in.\n\nBut above all, he said, it allows them to look inside themselves as they try to find a message to share. \u201cIn classic art, you have to look outside yourself,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cGraffiti art is the opposite, you\u2019re reinterpreting yourself and your name \u2026 to me it\u2019s a lot more personal and a lot more direct.\u201d\n\nProgram alumni and Graffiti Arts Program instructor Daniel Nava builds on this idea, explaining that as a youth, the program taught him to expand his reach by incorporating elements of his own history into his work. This way, \u201cthey won\u2019t just see the graffiti, but they\u2019ll also see the culture,\u201d he said of his audience.\n\nSuperintendent Hernandez hopes that, ultimately, the Mural Music and Arts Project will be able to help the school district develop a holistic arts program. She hopes that in-school arts electives will be bolstered by complementary after-school programs, all of which will help students meet state education targets.\n\nShe would like to hire Mural Music & Arts instructors to serve as artists in residence, inviting them into the classroom to do demonstrations and lead workshops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at aligning all of our programs so it\u2019s not a piecemeal approach, and so that it\u2019s connected, and all connected back to academic success, student engagement and our learning outcomes,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nChanges are certainly on the horizon for the Mural Music & Arts Project. If Hernandez and the program leaders have their way, the organization will soon be able to reach more kids than ever before. However, the staff emphasizes that the program will remain a close-knit family, even as they extend their reach.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t graduate out of a family, you don\u2019t retire from a family, those things remain true in this family,\u201d Sobomehin said, \u201cOnce a student comes through here, they feel a part of this.\u201d\n\nLinks to check out:\n\nListen to reporter Katie Brigham explain the story behind the story on KZSU Stanford\u2019s \u201cPeninsula Report\u201d radio show with host Eliza Ridgeway:", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "art,East Palo Alto,east palo alto youth,Katie Brigham,Mural Music & Arts Project,Public Art,Ravenswood City School District,urban art,Culture & Features,Features,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia", "description": "With declining funding for public school art programs, the Mural Music & Arts Project has stepped in to fill an important void, offering year-round youth\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95b4\"", "article_summary": "Hernandez\u2019s vision aligns well with the goals of the Mural Music & Arts Project.\nOn a Monday evening, Vunga sits on a cushioned couch at the Mural Music & Arts Project headquarters.\nChanges are certainly on the horizon for the Mural Music & Arts Project.\nThis is the headquarters of the Mural Music & Arts Project, an East Palo Alto-based organization that offers year-round youth development programs in the arts, including intricate graffiti art and hip-hop music.\nShe would like to hire Mural Music & Arts instructors to serve as artists in residence, inviting them into the classroom to do demonstrations and lead workshops."}
