Sioux Falls, SD

More than half of fire-related deaths could have been prevented by working smoke alarms, according to the Red Cross. That statistic is why dozens of college students in Sioux Falls went door-to-door Saturday, making sure homeowners living around their campuses remain safe.

Firefighters put four brand new smoke alarms in Helen Korcal’s home. It's been 18 years since she's had her smoke alarm replaced.

“I was worried about how old our smoke detectors were, and so this is a great deal," Korcal said.

Korcal also got her blood pressure checked. Something she wasn't expecting, but she sees as important.

Augustana University student Erika Farr woke up bright and early to help make sure homeowners like Korcal had working smoke alarms and blood pressure checks.

"Without us they probably wouldn't be able to change it them themselves, and they didn't realize how often you needed to change them," Farr said.

Along with Farr, hundreds of students, firefighters and American Red Cross officials canvassed about 1,500 homes near the central Sioux Falls campuses.

"Augustana University and the University of Sioux Falls have come together in a very positive competitive rivalry, to really go out and not only effect the people in those universities but to also affect their neighbors," Tony Burke, American Red Cross Executive Director, said.

Fire-officials said it's part of their 4th annual Growing Resilient Program. This year they targeted older homes extended from 16th to 41st street between Spring Avenue and West Avenue.

Volunteers knocked door-to-door here on Lake Street. Fire officials say some of the homes' smoke alarm systems were outdated.

The groups spent about 15 minutes in each home. Most of all, making sure people who live there are fire prepared and healthy.
