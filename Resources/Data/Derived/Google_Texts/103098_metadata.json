Melinda Gates (shown), the wife of billionaire Bill Gates and co-chair (along with her husband) of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is under fire again for funding pro-abortion activities, after making emphatic statements that the Gates Foundations does not and would not support abortion.\n\nPresident Obama promised: \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\u201d It was a promise he repeated dozens of times \u2014 before his ObamaCare program started causing millions of Americans to have their healthcare plans taken away.\n\nMelinda Gates told Newsweek: \u201cFrom the very beginning, we said that as a foundation we will not support abortion, because we don\u2019t believe in funding it.\u201d\n\nBut pro-life organizations are pointing to the recent Gates-funded international population control conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as the latest example of the Gateses' promotion of abortion. In a November 15 posting on C-FAM.org, Dr. Rebecca Oas and Wendy Wright reported on the November 11-15 conference in Ethiopia:\n\nWhen world leaders pledged over $2.6 billion to Melinda Gates' global family planning campaign, she assured them, \u201cThis is not about abortion.\u201d The wife of billionaire Bill Gates branded her campaign \u201cNo Controversy.\u201d\n\nYet this week the Gates Foundation is hosting an international conference in Ethiopia on the campaign and a significant number of workshops focus on abortion. An estimated 3,000 people are expected to attend the meeting designed to build on last year\u2019s London Summit where governments, corporations and wealthy foundations pledged political and financial commitments to increase family planning in developing countries. Melinda Gates is scheduled to speak.\n\n\u201cSome people think when we talk about contraception, that it's code for abortion, which it's not,\u201d Melinda Gates said in April 2012 when she launched the campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about abortion.\u201d\n\nBut the initiatives that Bill and Melinda Gates fund do more than just \u201ctalk about\u201d abortion. As we reported here on October 24 (\u201cGates Foundation Pushing Dangerous Contraceptives on Black Populations\u201d), leaders of Black organizations and human rights groups are calling the Gates Foundation out for foisting the dangerous drug Depo Provera, an abortifacient, on women in Africa and developing countries. Concerning the latest event in Addis Ababa, Oas and Wright report:\n\nOn the agenda for the family planning conference in Ethiopia are sessions titled \u201cEfforts to Implement Policies that Expand Access to Safe Abortion,\u201d \u201cAccess to Safe Abortions,\u201d \u201cAbortion and Quality of Care,\u201d and \u201cAbortion: Before and After.\u201d These feature representatives of the world's top abortion providers \u2014 Ipas, Planned Parenthood, and Marie Stopes \u2014 as well as other pro-abortion groups.\n\nAbortion is also the topic of two of the five poster exhibits and several \u201ctopical roundtables,\u201d including an Ipas-chaired discussion promoting the World Health Organization\u2019s problematic guidelines on how to do abortions.\n\nIpas is not as infamous as Planned Parenthood (PP), but it is militantly pro-abortion, as a quick perusal of the Ipas website easily confirms. In its report on Ethiopia\u2019s \u201cprogress,\u201d Ipas claims that \u201ctwo notable trends in this country \u2014 increases in women\u2019s access to medical abortion and to post-abortion contraception services \u2014 serve as examples of the progress that is possible when comprehensive abortion care is integrated into government family planning programs.\u201d\n\nIpas boasts that through its collaborative work with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health \u201cmore than 400 public and private health facilities across four regions of the country and in the capital city Addis Ababa, women\u2019s access to comprehensive abortion care and integrated contraceptive services is expanding.\u201d\n\nIpas, together with Planned Parenthood, UNFPA, and the other population-control advocates, are carrying out a global campaign to repeal all national and local laws that restrict abortion.\n\nAccording to C-FAM\u2019s Oas and Wright:\n\nA key aim of the [Ethiopia] conference is keeping pressure on national governments. Gates\u2019 campaign partners, such as Planned Parenthood and Population Action International (PAI), have promised to increase their advocacy to keep money flowing from donor and recipient countries. A \u201clot of our work in sub-Saharan Africa is really around holding those country governments to account\u201d for their pledges, said PAI\u2019s president.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates & Friends: Serial Offenders\n\nIt\u2019s not like the Ethiopian conference is the first time the Gateses have supported programs larded with blatant, militant abortion advocates and providers. In June, Nadja Wolfe, writing for the Charlotte Lozier Institute, reported on the Gateses\u2019 sponsorship of the United Nations\u2019 Women Deliver conference in May in Malaysia. In addition to prominent participation by Ipas, PP, and UNFPA, speakers included infamous abortionist Dr. Leroy Carhart and notorious Princeton ethicist Peter Singer. Nadja Wolfe notes:\n\nDr. Carhart has been in the news in the past year for the death of a patient attributed to complications following the abortion and for a video in which he describes a late-term unborn child as \u201cmeat in a crock pot.\u201d One of the most prominent late-term abortion providers in the U.S., he has sued against legal restrictions on abortion. In many countries and some U.S. states the late-term service he is known for is illegal. If \u201csafe and legal\u201d abortion is the goal, Carhart is a poor representative of it.\n\nPeter Singer has also been no stranger to controversy for many years. While pioneering expansive notions of animal rights, Singer has also championed population control, abortion and even infanticide. His appointment at Princeton was met with protests by advocates for the disabled objecting to the hiring of someone to teach ethics who suggested that those with disabilities have less of a right to life than those without them. At Women Deliver 2013, Singer suggested contraception will not solve the overpopulation problem he sees, given that women can still choose to have more children than he considers ecologically responsible. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t get to a point where we do have to override\u201d a woman\u2019s freedom to have as many children as she likes, he stated, but he clearly considered it an option. At least one other speaker at the Gates event mentioned forcible population control.\n\n\u201c[Melinda] Gates was not merely a guest at the conference; the foundation she leads sponsors it and has a visible presence,\u201d noted Wolfe.\n\nLike Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Jerry Brown, Andrew Cuomo, and the late Ted Kennedy, Melinda Gates claims to be a Roman Catholic and to be personally opposed to abortion. But claims that her foundation does not support abortion are about as honest and credible as President Obama\u2019s promise that \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period.\u201d\n\nPhoto of Melinda Gates: AP Images\n\nRelated articles:\n\nGates Foundation Pushing Dangerous Contraceptives on Black Populations\n\nGlobal ObamaCare & the \u201cGood Club\u201d Billionaires\n\nGlobal ObamaCare and World Population Control\n\nObama Behavior Team to \u201cNudge\u201d U.S. Toward Government Goals\n\n\u201cInhuman\u201d: Abortionist Leroy Carhart \u2014 Yet Another Gosnell Exposed\n\nAbortionist\u2019s House of Horrors: Gosnell\u2019s Unindicted Media Accomplices\n\nGosnell House of Horrors: Just One of Many Abortion Slaughterhouses\n\nAnother House of Horrors: Gosnell\u2019s Abortion Counterpart in Texas", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Gates Foundation, Melinda Gates, abortion, population control, Planned Parenthood, Leroy Carhart, Peter Singer", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/africa/item/16980-gates-foundation-repeatedly-breaks-promise-not-to-support-abortion", "type": "article", "description": "The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is under fire again for its support of abortion, Planned Parenthood, and UNFPA programs around the world.
