I will prioritize restoring City services with a focus on fixing potholes and broken curbs, trimming trees, cleaning alleyways and stopping illegal dumping. Many parts of CD 8 have been ignored, these communities will be prioritized as well as moving the District forward as a whole.\n\nPriority 2: The 8th District continues to have high unemployment, investing in micro and small business will be a priority along with working with new and existing businesses in the 8th District to invest and expand thereby creating new local jobs. This will also include investing in commercial corridors and infrastructure.\n\nPriority 3: While crime has gone down in the City of Los Angeles, crime and safety issues still loom in the 8th CD. Driving down crime and increasing safety will be a priority as well as working with the Region\u2019s law enforcement\u2014particularly LAPD and City Departments\u2014 to design and Regional strategy to serve the 8th CD with respect and consciousness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Age: \u00a057 \n\nOccupation:  President and CEO of nonprofit Rise Financial Pathways, providing small business\u00a0loans\n\nWebsite:  www.forescee.com", "og": {"url": "http://graphics.latimes.com/towergraphic-city-council-d8-forescee-hogan-rowles/", "type": "article", "site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Age:  57 \n\nOccupation:  President and CEO of nonprofit Rise Financial Pathways, providing small business loans\n\nWebsite:  www.forescee.com", "title": "City Council (D8): Forescee\u00a0Hogan-Rowles"}, "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "description": "Age:  57 \n\nOccupation:  President and CEO of nonprofit Rise Financial Pathways, providing small business loans\n\nWebsite:  www.forescee.com", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "City Council (D8): Forescee Hogan-Rowles"}, "date": "2015-02-06", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009, "app_id": 121694484590917}, "keywords": "documents, history, news, headlines, data desk, los angeles times, latimes, l.a. times, projects.latimes.com", "google-site-verification": "a9pAUAoFTyj7Nut3H5OiQ-fUyyqdwdVT7VcFGICrpTo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Priority 3: While crime has gone down in the City of Los Angeles, crime and safety issues still loom in the 8th CD.\nPriority 1: The 8th District has been sorely neglected.\nI will prioritize restoring City services with a focus on fixing potholes and broken curbs, trimming trees, cleaning alleyways and stopping illegal dumping.\nMany parts of CD 8 have been ignored, these communities will be prioritized as well as moving the District forward as a whole.\nDriving down crime and increasing safety will be a priority as well as working with the Region\u2019s law enforcement\u2014particularly LAPD and City Departments\u2014 to design and Regional strategy to serve the 8th CD with respect and consciousness."}
