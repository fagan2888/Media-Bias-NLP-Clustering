Gary Herbert and GOP legislative leaders last week.\n\nThe plan, known as UtahAccess+, would have used the $450 million available annually under the Affordable Care Act to provide coverage for about 95,000 Utahns, including those living in poverty who now don't receive any health care subsidies.\n\nThe decision by House Republicans, along with a lack of support in the Senate, ended the governor's hopes of getting a Medicaid expansion plan approved in a special session.\n\nThe caucus discussion came after a protest on the Capitol lawn that included white crosses placed to represent the estimated 360 Utahns who have died during the past three years because without Medicaid expansion, they had no coverage.\n\n\"This month, next month and each succeeding month, until Medicaid expansion is enacted, there will be more lives lost and more suffering by those individuals and their families who cannot afford health care coverage,\" Jonathan Ruga said.\n\nRuga, a board member of the event's organizer, Alliance for a Better Utah, said that's \"simply unacceptable in the richest country in the world and in a state that prides itself on being caring and compassionate.\"\n\nNo mention was made of the protest at the caucus. House Republicans did, however, ask a number of questions about the amount of tax dollars coming back, as well as what's next for Medicaid expansion.\n\nSeveral caucus members, including Rep. Brian Greene, R-Pleasant Grove, wanted to know how accepting Medicaid would affect the numbers and were told that wasn't available but would be calculated.\n\nA second chart provided to the caucus noted the federal government has also reduced reimbursements for Medicaid, Medicare and other health care programs by $470 million annually.\n\nRep. Jacob Anderegg, R-Lehi, said the chart showing the state is already getting more back than is being paid in taxes \"begs the question: Why is the governor, the Democrats, and all the proponents, why are they beating us up?\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, said the argument has been made that money is coming back to the state through the health care law also known as Obamacare, but has been ignored by supporters of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"We are getting quite a bit of money back. Now, the argument again can be made, 'Well, if you expand, you'll get even more money back, OK?' But we're getting a lot of serious dollars coming to our state,\" Dunnigan said.\n\nLater, Hughes said House Republicans need to stop talking about \"chasing federal dollars\" and focus on a more limited plan now during the 2016 Legislature that begins meeting in January.\n\n\"I think we are going to have a Utah solution,\" he said. \"If you put it next to a very rich and robust Medicaid program it probably does suffer. I'm going to tell you right now it's not going to be the same program. It can't be.\"\n\nLegislative leaders met with the governor last week after the failure of UtahAccess+ and said the intent is to draft a bill that offers coverage initially only to Utahns who qualify as medically frail.\n\nHughes said there has been \"selective outrage\" about the House Republicans holding a closed caucus to take a straw vote on UtahAccess+, noting Senate Republicans always close their caucus meetings.\n\nThe speaker also defended his decision to require the 38 votes needed to approve the plan to all come from the GOP supermajority. He said it was \"a lie\" to suggest that hurt the legislative process.\n\n\"I use those words on purpose. It is that misleading. I regret that the public who might not be aware of the process that we have would think that this body would interrupt anyone's duly elected representative's role in this Legislature,\" Hughes said.\n\nSenate Republicans reportedly received only a brief update on Medicaid expansion in their closed caucus.\n\nThe governor, who pitched his Healthy Utah version of Medicaid expansion that failed in the House last session as a way to bring back tax dollars flowing to Washington, had no comment on the House numbers Wednesday.\n\nEmail: lisa@deseretnews.com\n\nTwitter: DNewsPolitics", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Even without Medicaid expansion, Utahns are paying less in taxes related to President Barack Obama's health care law than they're getting back, the House Republican caucus heard Wednesday.", "title": "Feds spending 'serious dollars' on Obamacare in Utah, House GOP hears", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "iphone": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deseretnews.android"}, "name": {"ipad": "Deseret News", "iphone": "Deseret News", "googleplay": "Deseret News"}, "id": {"ipad": 425758986, "iphone": 425758986, "googleplay": "com.deseretnews.android"}}, "creator": "@dnewspolitics", "site": "@deseretnews", "card": "summary"}, "datePublished": "2015-10-21", "vr": {"category": "utah", "type": "article"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"recommendable": "false"}}, "speare-timestamp": "2015-10-21 18:45:00", "copyright": "\u00a9 2016 Deseret News Publishing Company", "title": "Feds spending 'serious dollars' on Obamacare in Utah, House GOP hears", "image": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1614557.jpg", "dsk": "utah", "tout": {"article": {"id": 865639604}}, "thumbnail": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1614557.jpg", "medium": "news", "description": "Even without Medicaid expansion, Utahns are paying less in taxes related to President Barack Obama's health care law than they're getting back, the House Republican caucus heard Wednesday.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": 683545112, "app_id": 320112201431112, "pages": 16317479654}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-21T18:45-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=1024, initial-scale=0.1", "GOOGLEBOT": "ARCHIVE", "og": {"url": "http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865639604/Feds-spending-serious-dollars-on-Obamacare-in-Utah-House-GOP-hears.html?pg=all", "type": "article", "image": "http://img.deseretnews.com/images/article/hires/1614557/1614557.jpg", "site_name": "DeseretNews.com", "title": "Feds spending 'serious dollars' on Obamacare in Utah, House GOP hears"}, "author": "Lisa Riley Roche", "dateModified": "2015-10-21", "articleid": 865639604}, "article_summary": "House Republicans did, however, ask a number of questions about the amount of tax dollars coming back, as well as what's next for Medicaid expansion.\nHouse Republicans were encouraged to share the numbers with their constituents, in the caucus' first meeting since rejecting a Medicaid expansion plan from Gov.\nLater, Hughes said House Republicans need to stop talking about \"chasing federal dollars\" and focus on a more limited plan now during the 2016 Legislature that begins meeting in January.\nEven without Medicaid expansion, Utahns are paying less in taxes related to President Barack Obama's health care law than they're getting back, the House Republican caucus heard Wednesday.\nThe governor, who pitched his Healthy Utah version of Medicaid expansion that failed in the House last session as a way to bring back tax dollars flowing to Washington, had no comment on the House numbers Wednesday."}
