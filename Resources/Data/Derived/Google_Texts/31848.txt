CNBC's Bertha Coombs takes a look at which insurance companies could be the biggest winners when the health care exchanges go live next week.

Molina Healthcare touts itself as an extended family to its Medicaid insurance clients. In keeping with that image, the company chose to feature its employees and their kids at a family picnic for its Obamacare enrollment campaign.

"We have been doing this for over 33 years," said Dr. Mario Molina, president and CEO. "So, we've developed a lot of trust, I think, in the community and that's going to be an important part of this."

Molina covers nearly 2 million Medicaid patients across nine states, including California, Texas and Florida. The insurer is offering plans on the new health insurance exchanges in all of those states. It has hired 2,000 people in the past year and is planning a major enrollment effort that includes retail storefronts in some of its biggest markets.

"We have kiosks in places that are available in shopping malls so that people can come in a nonthreatening way just to get information and not feel like they are getting the hard sell," said Molina.

The more important part of the outreach will involve staffers at its proprietary community health clinics. These staffers already come in contact with a high number of uninsured adult patients who may now qualify for subsidized coverage on the state health exchanges or free coverage under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion program.
