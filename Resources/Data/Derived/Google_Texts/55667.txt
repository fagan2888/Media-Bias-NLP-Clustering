Spend a day on July 10 exploring with Rocky Mountain Conservancy - Field Institute Instructor Abby Schreiber and learn the great diversity of flora with a former Park naturalist. Discover the historical uses of the plants, shrubs and trees that may be encountered as you look through the lens of history. Plants that live in the Park have been used for wild edibles, dyes, in ceremonies, for tools, fiber, textiles, weapons, and medicine. Documented uses recorded by ethnobotanists, historians, and the Lewis and Clark expedition will be examined. Spend the day exploring, and you will come to look at Rocky Mountain National Park flora in a new way.
