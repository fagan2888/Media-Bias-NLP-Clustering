For example, after heart attacks, trauma and strokes, treatment must occur within the first hour to prevent loss of heart muscle and brain tissue, and troubled pregnancies often require a rapid response to deliver a healthy baby.\n\nColorado may soon add to this tally, with Leadville\u2019s St. Vincent Hospital facing closure if it does not find a partner, buyer or management relationship together with an infusion of resources. Should St. Vincent close, Leadville will lose its only emergency room and ambulance service, and the county\u2019s only nursing home. Leadville\u2019s community of 2,600 people would be required to overcome 33 snowy, mountainous miles to reach the nearest hospital in Frisco.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving this epidemic in rural health care? Rural facilities are confronting a new landscape with full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including reduced support for the uninsured, lower reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid, increased regulatory costs and electronic health records requirements, and penalties when patients must be readmitted soon after they are released.\n\nTogether with the economic recession, tight state and local government budgets, and fewer patients being allowed overnight stays, rural hospitals find themselves trapped in a perfect storm that could force many more closures in the year ahead.\n\nWhat\u2019s the prescription for rural hospitals to survive and thrive? First, development of innovative health care delivery models that promote delivery of integrated, quality health care within budgetary constraints. Health care is moving from the classic \u201cfee for service\u201d model toward integrated systems that allocate a capped amount per person \u2014 and reward those who can deliver quality results within those caps. Resource sharing, integration, and joint-venture arrangements with regional partners can yield benefits without surrendering the hospital\u2019s independence. Telemedicine also offers some hope, enabling rural communities to leverage experts and technology from afar.\n\nAs a last resort, hospitals may pursue a partnership or sale to a health care system with the financial strength, management team, and technological practices to make needed investments in the hospital and squeeze more efficiencies out of each health care dollar spent. However, many rural hospitals have difficulty attracting a suitor. To survive on their own, rural hospitals will need increased financial support. If maintaining quality care within reasonable driving distance is a community priority, the hospital and local political leadership can either tap into available funds, or ask taxpayers for greater dedicated resources, whether in the form of a mill levy, bond, or district. Finally, charitable foundations can seek out additional private support and grant monies.\n\nShould the rural hospital\u2019s doors close, what comes next? Perhaps a much smaller free-standing emergency room with a fraction of the bed space or an even leaner urgent care clinic, addressing only the most emergent of needs, with ambulance or helicopter support to move patients to facilities with greater expertise and support services. While some potential exists for telemedicine in a scaled-down facility, community members will need to travel significant distances for key aspects of their health care needs \u2014 including life-threatening emergencies.\n\nMichael King chairs the Healthcare Transactional Group at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rural hospital closures are a clear danger", "title": "Rural hospital closures are a clear danger", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/27/rural-hospital-closures-are-a-clear-danger/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150127__OP28KINGp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150127__OP28KINGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-27T16:40:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:11:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2423\"", "article_summary": "First, development of innovative health care delivery models that promote delivery of integrated, quality health care within budgetary constraints.\nWhat\u2019s driving this epidemic in rural health care?\nWhat\u2019s the prescription for rural hospitals to survive and thrive?\nHowever, many rural hospitals have difficulty attracting a suitor.\nShould the rural hospital\u2019s doors close, what comes next?"}
