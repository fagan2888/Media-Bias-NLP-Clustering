The interview was edited for brevity.\n\nQ. Why does a hospital system need an economics department?\n\nA. There is so much pressure on health-care organizations these days because we\u2019re supposed to provide the best care possible but do it in an efficient manner.\n\nThat means there has to be much more of a focus on prevention and wellness. That\u2019s the transition that\u2019s been in place for 30 years, and it\u2019s picked up steam with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat sort of people do you need to hire to conduct this sort of analysis?\n\nFor this position, we need someone who is strong with their data manipulation abilities \u2014 the data sets we are dealing with are just huge \u2014 but we also need someone who understands health-care claims, including how they are coded as presented from providers. They don\u2019t need to know everything the way a doctor would, but they do need to be able to intelligently converse with the people who are processing claims.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also important to have somebody who is naturally inquisitive about things. We hope to find someone with a curiosity to drill into the data and help us find opportunities to improve the quality of care and at the same time deliver it in an efficient manner.\n\nWhat sort of problems will this person have to solve?\n\nWe need this person to help us identify people who provide high-quality care and also cost-effective care. In many cases, the same providers fall into both camps if they\u2019re able to diagnose quickly and be really attuned to the patient.\n\nThis person will also help with risk-optimization: go into the data and identify who the really sick people are and who are the not-so-sick people. That allows you to assign risk, which in turn could drive the reimbursement that person receives from the state. If you have a sicker member in your group, they\u2019ll want to pay you more. So that allows you to match revenues with expenses.\n\nIn the Medicaid side of our business, the state works to identify how well hospitals are treating their Medicaid populations. So the state will look at historical treatment patterns so they can predict utilization patterns. . . .
