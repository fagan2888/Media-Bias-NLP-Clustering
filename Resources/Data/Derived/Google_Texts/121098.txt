The stock market rocked going into the noon hour Thursday, but the joy masked trouble in the medical sector, especially among hospital stocks.

The Nasdaq rose 1.4%; the S&P 500 gained 1.2%; and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.3%. Volume was tracking higher than at the same time Wednesday.

The stock market today received an early, added boost from overseas after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said that policymakers would consider additional eurozone stimulus measures when they meet in December. Leading indexes in Paris and Frankfurt soared 2.5%.

Among U.S. stocks, medical-related industry groups were among the worst performers. Hospital stocks were being massacred. The 11-member industry group fell 11%, the worst performer among 197 groups.

Community Health Systems (CYH), operator of non-urban hospitals, gapped down and fell 31% in massive volume after reporting preliminary Q3 results well below analysts’ estimates, followed by a flurry of downgrades.

HCA (HCA), the nation’s largest hospital chain, fell 6%, and Tenet Healthcare (THC) fell 16%.

HCA said last week that rising labor costs and uninsured patients would hurt its earnings.

Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with Mizuho Securities, said that the benefits of ObamaCare had run out.

The best performer among IBD 50 stocks was water-heater maker A.O. Smith (AOS), up 5%. It reported earnings Wednesday morning that beat estimates, missed on revenue and issued guidance above Street estimates. The stock staged a bearish reversal on the news but is recovering.
