More than 50% of sleep professionals expect the ACA could negatively affect their incomes, according to a recent Sleep Review webinar poll. Now is the time to heed the warning bells and marshal resources before the trickle becomes a flood. According to subspecialty experts, there are several strategies you can employ in 2014 to succeed in the changing landscape.\n\nAlign with Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). \u201cThere\u2019s almost no doubt that ACOs will be part of our medical future and\u2026you\u2019re going to have to participate with them,\u201d says Charles Atwood, MD, a director with the Board of Registered Polysomnographic Technologists. To find an appropriate ACO, Dennis Hwang, MD, co-chair of sleep medicine at Southern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, advises researching options in your geographic area, being sure to take into account the ACO\u2019s referral and reimbursement practices. \u201cA lot of ACOs are still in development and still on the smaller side,\u201d Hwang says.\n\nIncorporate home sleep testing (HST) when applicable. To respond to the anticipated growth in high-deductible insurance plans, offer HSTs to patients who likely have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) but can\u2019t afford a full in-lab polysomnogram (PSG). The ACA \u201cwill drive an improvement in the economics of sleep,\u201d says David White, MD, clinical professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Patients who refuse to pay out of pocket for a thousand dollar or more PSG may well agree to take an HST for a quarter of that amount.\n\nExpand service offerings. With lower reimbursements looming for swaths of existing services, this is a prime time to add new cost-effective offerings. This may manifest as a group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) class for insomnia or a lifestyle interventions for OSA course. An exclusive to Sleep Review, Emerson Wickwire, PhD, guides readers through considerations for launching a new program.\n\nConnect with sleep dentists to reap benefits (and vice versa: sleep dentists, connect with sleep physicians). Oral appliances are poised to potentially become a first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderate OSA. White notes that requiring a patient to first fail CPAP before being fitted with an oral appliance could fall out of favor since it may not be cost-effective to pay for multiple different therapy trials.\n\nOffer telemedicine services. \u201cThe future is going to be in delivering outcomes. Any intervention, test, or methodology that allows us to leverage intellectual resources will be very valuable. Telemedicine is going to be part of this conversation,\u201d says M. Safwan Badr, MD, president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. CPAP adherence tracking, CBT for insomnia, and online patient portals for self-directed care are all ways Internet-based programs can be integrated. \u201cThis will bring the patient into the center of this conversation,\u201d Badr says\u2014which, after all, is what the ACA is all about.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,24x7mag.com,allied360.com,anthemmedia.mkt5097.com,axisimagingnews.com,clpmag.com,hearingreview.com,imagingeconomics.com,orthodonticproductsonline.com,plasticsurgerypractice.com,ptproductsonline.com,rehabpub.com,responsive.24x7mag.com,rtmagazine.com,sleepreviewmag.com,www.24x7mag.com,www.allied360.com,www.orthodonticproducts.com", "description": "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate phased in January 1, yet sleep medicine will have a time cushion to adapt while the law\u2019s effects trickle in.", "og": {"site_name": "Sleep Review", "description": "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate phased in January 1, yet sleep medicine will have a time cushion to adapt while the law\u2019s effects trickle in.", "title": "Editor's Message: Acclimating to the ACA - Sleep Review", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://a360-wp-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sleeprev/2014/01/SreeHead_SIZED2.jpg", "url": "http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/2014/02/editors-message-acclimating-aca/", "type": "article"}, "com.silverpop.primary_domain": "sleepreviewmag.com", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage5.silverpop.com", "article": {"section": "Industry News", "tag": "March 2014"}, "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Telemedicine is going to be part of this conversation,\u201d says M.
