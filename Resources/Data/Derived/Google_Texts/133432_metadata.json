Campaign volunteers for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton say they\u2019ve just started canvassing this week following office openings and the arrival of paid staffers, along with ramping up phone banking, caucus trainings for volunteers, and general organizing efforts. Both campaigns say they\u2019re attempting to contact renters in hard-to-access apartment complexes either through canvassing or phone banking and neither would say how many paid staffers they had in the state.\n\nWith the March 26th Washington Democratic presidential caucuses just two weeks away, the campaigns have ramped up operations across the state, in Seattle, and, here on Capitol Hill. The Sanders campaign opened its central Seattle office on Capitol Hill over the weekend and, earlier this week, the Clinton campaign formally opened its Seattle office in Interbay with speeches from local elected Democrats.\n\nBut in predominantly white and lefty Seattle where we have a re-elected unabashed socialist on the city council, the Sanders camp feels like they\u2019re particularly strong and established, especially on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wear a Bernie shirt around and people will say \u2018Yes! feel the Bern!\u2019\u201d says Tara Rayers, a 26-year-old Seattle transplant fresh from Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Sanders campaign volunteer who now works out of the E Pike street office. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of momentum happening here. We\u2019ve had to tell people at our phone banks that they couldn\u2019t join us because we were just totally over capacity,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth campaigns opened a slew of campaign offices across the state earlier this week. The Sanders camp has the largest spread geographically, with an office as far north as Bellingham\u2014a sleepy liberal college town and through and through Bernie territory\u2014as well as Spokane, Yakima, Vancouver down south, and three Seattle locations: the Capitol Hill office, one in Northeast Seattle at 15th Ave and 120th NE, and a third just south of the Central District on 31st street adjacent to the I-90 overpass. This location, however, will serve more as a storage site for yard signs and the like.\n\nThe Clinton campaign, by contrast, has mostly clustered its offices along the densely populated and vote-rich I-5 corridor, with locations in Everett, Seattle (in Interbay), Renton, Tacoma, and then the outlier in Spokane. But the team feels it has had a head-start \u2014 the Washington director for the Clinton campaign said that they\u2019ve had paid staffers in the state since January.\n\nNot so fast. According to Laura Dean, former Wisconsin field organizer for the 2008 Obama general election campaign, a on-and-off Capitol Hill resident since 2001, and a current Sanders organizing guru on Capitol Hill, informal grassroots networks of volunteers have been holding meet-and-greet events and organizer trainings since summer of last year, powered Facebook groups like Ballard for Bernie and Capitol Hill for Bernie. Dean herself has thrown 16 events herself, including a \u201cartists for Bernie,\u201d art show of portraits of the Vermont Senator\u2014solicited from friends\u2014at the Vermillion gallery on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt\u2019s these kind of robust, pre-existing volunteer networks that the Sanders campaign is relying on to carry Washington. \u201cWe have a really strong volunteer network and that has helped us win in many states like in Colorado. There\u2019s a lot of similarities [with Colorado]\u201d said Dulce Saenz, the new Sanders campaign state director. The previous director, Joan Kato, just got promoted.\n\nWhen asked whether Washington and Colorado being predominantly white states with lefty, Democratic primary voters helps win them for Sanders, Saenz conceded \u201cyou could make that argument.\u201d\n\nClinton holds a hefty delegate lead over Sanders due to both his heavy losses in southern states where he had trouble attracting minority support, especially among African Americans\u2014and superdelegates, of course.\n\nFor Dean, like other local Sanders supporters, Bernie\u2019s appeal comes from his leftist platform of waging war on Wall Street and corporate America and his perceived ideological purity and progressive record.\n\n\u201cWhile I think Obama was a great candidate and is a great president, he tends to be more centrist,\u201d said Dean. \u201cBernie Sanders, I would say, is the first candidate in my lifetime that has really captured a lot of the values that are really important to me across all issues; across social justice, environmental justice, food, corporate welfare, the minimum wage, health care, you name it, it\u2019s across the board.\u201d\n\nRayers agrees. \u201cBacking a president who practices what he preaches? That\u2019s incredible for me. The second I heard his platform I was behind him,\u201d she said, citing his focus on income and wealth inequality and fighting \u201cpay to play politics\u201d as highlights.\n\nClinton\u2019s Hill\n\nWithout a campaign office smack-dab in the middle of the neighborhood, the Clinton campaign may seem almost non-existent. But they exist. And they\u2019re passionate. They see a resilient political insider who can work the system to benefit the working class and minority groups. Meet Charmaine Slye: a gay, 63 year-old Capitol Hill resident, lifelong Seattleite, and current Clinton campaign volunteer. She volunteered for both of Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cI like Bernie in that he has some fabulous things to say, but we all got fabulous things to say,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless you\u2019re an insider and you know Washington politics\u2014and she does\u2014we\u2019re not going to get anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was that age in the 70\u2019s,\u201d she said, referencing young Sanders voters. \u201cI thought i could change it all too but I realized the wisdom in finding that middle road.\u201d\n\nSlye points to Clinton\u2019s defense of President Obama\u2019s legacy and Obamacare, as reason to rally, wary of Sanders\u2019 calls for a universal public healthcare system. \u201cIt saves lives,\u201d she said of Obamacare, pointing to a time when her partner\u2019s niece had a baby with health issues at birth. The niece could afford the hospital charges due to Obamacare. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep tearing it up everytime.\u201d\n\nSlye has been hitting the phones for the Clinton campaign for the past month or so, targeting voters across the state. She says she doesn\u2019t canvas much anymore because of her age and the geography of the Hill, not to mention her experiences with racism while doorbelling in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m African American so people aren\u2019t really super excited to talk to me. People like to think it\u2019s super groovy up here but it\u2019s not always like that,\u201d she said.\n\nSlye added that while she doesn\u2019t think that Capitol Hill is a write-off \u201cBernie Town,\u201d she says she does think it will be hard to win over the local precincts. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m a bit nervous about it.\u201d\n\nJett Johnson, a 32 year-old Capitol Hill resident as of two years who recently completed his masters in teaching at the University of Oregon, has \u2018been with her\u2019 since her failed clash with Barack Obama in the 2008 democratic primary. \u201cFor me the stakes are really high in this election. I believe Hillary is a fighter and a champion for people who often don\u2019t have a voice. She\u2019s been fighting for women and children her entire career.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a person of color, I\u2019m part of the LGBT community. I appreciate the campaign that Sanders is running and I think he\u2019s raising some really important issues around wall street but I want a candidate that is well rounded and focused on all of the issues,\u201d he said. \u201c[Hilary] knows how to work across party lines and get legislation passed.\u201d\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t want to make any predictions regarding the Hill\u2019s eventual leanings on caucus day, though he did say he personally has been finding support for Clinton among African Americans in Seattle\u2019s Central District.\n\nAt the Seattle Clinton office opening in Interbay, local democratic elected officials threw their hats in for the former Secretary of State. Retiring congressman Jim McDermott of Seattle\u2019s 7th District (a hot contest is underway to decide his replacement), speaking after King County Council members Joe McDermott (a candidate to replace Jim) and Rod Dembowski, echoed similar arguments.\n\n\u201cThere is an authoritarian mood, movement, whatever you want to call it in this society, that wants a strong leader that says I\u2019ll make America great,\u201d he told the packed loft space of young Clinton volunteers and older supporters. \u201cWhat we have to put up is an alternative to that and Hilary is that alternative. She\u2019s thoughtful and quick and smart and willing to trade and knows how much you can push.\u201d\n\nClinton also has the support of other Washington elected bigwigs like Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell.\n\nFreshly wounded from Sanders\u2019 upset win in Michigan on Tuesday night, on a Wednesday morning conference call with reporters, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook played up the delegate lead that Clinton holds over Sanders.\n\n\u201cThe delegate math dictates that senator sanders must expand his map and compete in more states than he currently is. And he needs to not just win those states but win those by very lopsided margins to catch up,\u201d he said.\n\nCapitol Hill Sanders volunteers recognize this, but still see their efforts as important. \u201cThe better he does in the primary, the more his values as a candidate and his platform get publicized which will help future voters ask more of candidates up and down the ticket,\u201d said Dean.\n\nCaucus day is just two weeks away. Here\u2019s how it works. If you can\u2019t make it on the 26th, you can file a surrogate affidavit form until the 18th.\n\nShare: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CHS Capitol Hill Seattle", "description": "On Capitol Hill, the ground-game for presidential votes is well underway.
