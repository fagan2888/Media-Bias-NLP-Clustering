Adrian has never hidden from what happened. He has cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours. Adrian will address the charges with the same respect and responsiveness he has brought to this inquiry from its beginning. It is important to remember that Adrian never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury.\u201d\n\nThe news comes at the heels of the controversy with Ray Rice, who was suspended from the NFL for beating up his then-fiancee Janay Palmer in a hotel elevator earlier this year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.justjared.com/2014/09/13/nfl-player-adrian-peterson-indicted-for-child-abuse/", "site_name": "Just Jared", "image": "http://cdn04.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2014/09/nfl-player-adrian-peterson-indicted-child-abuse.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "NFL Player Adrian Peterson Indicted For Child Abuse"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adrian Peterson has been indicted in a child abuse case.
