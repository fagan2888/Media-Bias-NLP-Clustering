Visitors to a Crystal Coast beach this 4th of July saw red flags flying Saturday.

Rough surf and extreme wind called for the flags to be flown at Fort Macon State Park. The parking lot was completely full on the 4th.

No umbrellas were up as hundreds filled the beach.

The rough conditions did not keep people from getting into the water, though most did not venture too far from the shore. Several times lifeguards went in to help those who had been pulled too far out.

Pine Knoll Shores police said there red flags were up because of rough surf and no lifeguards were on duty.
