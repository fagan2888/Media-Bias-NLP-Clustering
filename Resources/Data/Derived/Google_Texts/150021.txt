Sioux Falls, SD

Mid-June usually marks a very active time of severe weather potential in KELOLAND.

A severe thunderstorm any time of day is not good, but when you're dealing with large hail and damaging wind chances after dark, it adds another layer of awareness we all need to have this time of year.

Typically, late June into July is favorable for nocturnal thunderstorms. Their journey across the prairies at night are most often driven by low level winds rich with higher humidity. These environments are often ripe to feed thunderstorms with a rich supply of ingredients needed to support rain at a time of year when many start looking for moisture during the hotter weeks of the summer.

So if nighttime thunderstorms with severe weather are forecast in your area, remember to turn on your weather radio before you go to bed. Most radios can be programmed for just your local county area, so you don't have to lose sleep over a storm that's not nearby.

Of course not all thunderstorms at night produce severe weather, but when they do, they can be very powerful. Anyone who remembers the July 31st, 2008 Highway 12 windstorm east of Aberdeen will tell you overnight storms can be dangerous. It's why we monitor the weather 24-7 to keep you ahead of the next round of storms.
