Click on the bar at the top to open different data views.\n\nThe document itself is dry: A U.S. government report, 29 pages of text and tables.\n\nThe report\u2019s subject, however, is hot: The first three-month enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act. The January 13 issue brief from the Department of Health and Human Services shares information about who signed up for the new Obamacare health insurance marketplaces and includes data about the population of enrollees, including age, gender and financial assistance status, along with state-by-state enrollment figures and website traffic data.\n\nRelated Stories Robert Kosara of Tableau on using data to tell a story.\n\nRead the story \u00bb Podcast: Esri\u2019s Jack Dangermond on marrying maps with big data analytics.\n\nRead the story \u00bb Advances in data visualization software empower business users.\n\nRead the story \u00bb Telling stories with visualizations: lessons from data journalists.\n\nRead the story \u00bb\n\nExtracting and formatting data from the tables and creating a visualization, in this case a website map presentation, provides a clear opportunity to see both the opportunities and limitations of such a project, said Bill Davenhall, a senior health adviser at Esri, the geographic information systems vendor.\n\nIn an interview, Davenhall talked about how this presentation\u2014created by one Esri communications staff member during part of a business day\u2014is like many maps in that it spurs more questions than answers, and that those questions depend on the audience.\n\n\u201cMost people who look at a map will say, \u2018I wish they had it for my neighborhood, or I wish they had this piece of information that is more valuable to me,\u2019\u201d Davenhall said. \u201cThat is what puts ideas into motion.\n\n\u201cWhen you visualize this information, people can tell you what\u2019s wrong with it. It sounds negative, but it\u2019s positive because what you\u2019ve done is you\u2019ve got them thinking. Where did this data come from? What is the quality of this data? Once you start down that road, I think you are on the way to what I would call this enhanced understanding with what the visualization is doing,\u201d he added.\n\nIn this case, the quality of the geographic-oriented data is limited: it only goes down to the state level. So while the map shows views of enrollment figures, gender and age group breakdowns, financial status and plans chosen, the granularity is limited to state boundaries.\n\nThere are a number of ways to enhance this view, depending on the goals of the visualization creator and especially the interests of the audience, Davenhall said. But two main themes are clear: it would help to have more granular geographic data for enrollments\u2014such as by metropolitan area, by Congressional district or ZIP code.\n\nMore granular details about enrollment trends enable these kinds of questions: How is this Congressional district (or city or neighborhood) doing in terms of health insurance enrollments? Where are certain age groups participating more than others?\n\nThe second move would be to augment the map with additional datasets, from public or proprietary sources. The list of potential questions is long and should interest partisans in the Obamacare political debate as well as health care industry players, policymakers, and the public at large. Questions like:\n\n\u2022 How are enrollments doing in areas where members of Congress opposed Obamacare? Where the law won support?\n\n\u2022 How do enrollments fare in areas where TV commercials have aired trying to influence citizens\u2019 behavior?\n\n\u2022 How are enrollments doing in states with the highest incidence of stroke, diabetes and other conditions?\n\n\u2022 How does the data look in areas where health care costs are higher than national averages? Where they are lower?\n\nA third way to build on the visualization would be to revisit it when the government issues future enrollment reports. That could allow a user to see changes over time in enrollment trends.\n\nIn the map of the Affordable Care Act (and other public projects like it), Davenhall emphasized that Esri maintains an agnostic point of view. The data is the thing. But he also said that a visualization needs to point users in a direction.\n\nTake the question about enrollment trends. \u201cI encourage people that less is more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting information on the map that\u2019s smart. If you have two periods of time, don\u2019t show me all the data ever collected on this. Show me something where the data is doing something you wouldn\u2019t expect.\u201d\n\nThis map sets the table for more questions. What questions, and what kinds of data, would you add?
