I just watched a video featuring Dr. Clayton Christensen, the Clark Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, that I wanted to share even though it is about 10 months old. So much coming out of academia lately has been utter nonsense so it is important to point out when wisdom is proclaimed as well. Money quote:

Granted, he’s not talking about orthodox Christianity per se, he actually is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, but he is absolutely right about the importance of religion in a functioning democracy.

I’d go further to say if you take away the Gospel you can’t hire enough police, but the point is well made nonetheless. Religious freedom is paramount.

This video is worth the 90 seconds it takes to watch it.
