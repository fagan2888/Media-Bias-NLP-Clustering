Moreover, little is understood about how calorie labels will impact different populations. Obesity affects more than one-third of Americans, but hits low-income, urban neighborhoods hardest.\n\n\u201cStudies have not generally examined whether labeling is more or less effective for particular subgroups,\u201d said Elbel.\n\nElbel and team set out to assess the impact of calorie labels at fast-food chains in the wake of the new legislation.\n\nIn their latest study, conducted in Philadelphia, researchers collected receipts from more than 2,000 customers, ages 18 to 64, who visited McDonald\u2019s and Burger King restaurants during lunch or dinner before and after February 2010, when the calorie-label law went into effect in Philadelphia.\n\nEach customer was asked a short series of questions, including how often they had visited \u201cbig chain\u201d fast food restaurants in the last week; whether they noticed calorie information in the restaurant; and if so, whether they used the information to purchase more or less food than they otherwise would have at the restaurant.\n\nThe research team also commissioned a professional survey firm to simultaneously conduct a random phone survey of residents within the city limits of Philadelphia.\n\nRespondents were asked a similar set of questions, including whether they had consumed any \u201cbig chain\u201d fast food within the last three months. If they had, they were asked a series of additional questions about how often they eat fast food, along with demographic questions and their height and weight.\n\nThe researchers found that only 34 percent of McDonald\u2019s customers noticed the labels posted to menu boards, compared to 49 percent of Burger King customers. Respondents with less education (high school or lower) were less likely to notice the labels.\n\nMoreover, respondents reported eating fast food more than five times a week, both before and after the labels were posted. There was no decrease in visiting fast food restaurants reported after calorie labeling began in Philadelphia.\n\n(As a control, the researchers also surveyed customers of both chains in Baltimore, where calorie labels are not mandated. About 70 percent of the customers surveyed in both cities were African-American.)\n\n\u201cWe found no difference in calories purchased or fast-food visits after the introduction of the policy,\u201d said Elbel.\n\n\u201cGiven the limits of labeling reported here and in other studies, it\u2019s clear that just posting calories is often not enough to change behavior among all populations. We need to consider other, more robust interventional policies in places where obesity is most prevalent.\u201d\n\nSource: NYU School of Medicine", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers are learning that posting the calorie content of meals at major fast-food chains does not necessarily\u00a0change purchasing habits or decrease the", "og": {"site_name": "Psych Central News", "description": "Researchers are learning that posting the calorie content of meals at major fast-food chains does not necessarily\u00a0change purchasing habits or decrease the number of calories that customers consume.
