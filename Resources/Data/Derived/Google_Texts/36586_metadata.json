Federal lawmakers had already approved the tweak, which President Barack Obama signed into law last year.\n\nHouse Bill 58, patroned by Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, was supported by both the Virginia Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation for Independent Businesses.\n\n\u201cAt a time when so many small businesses are struggling, we have to do everything we can to provide relief and certainty,\u201d Speaker of the House Bill Howell, R-Stafford, said in a written statement. \u201cThis bipartisan bill will protect small businesses from another premium spike and will ensure their employees can keep their healthcare plans.\u201d\n\nBefore the vote, House Minority Leader David Toscano, D-Charlottesville, rose to voice his support.\n\n\u201cIt does prove again that occasionally Congress and the president can work together to fix some things that need to get fixed,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cWhen we focus on trying to fix things as opposed to trying to repeal things willy-nilly, we can get some good things done.\u201d\n\nOther states have been able to enact the fix through executive action. Legislation was required in Virginia because the implementation of the health care law is overseen by the Bureau of Insurance.\n\nThe House adjourned for the weekend late Friday morning.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "RICHMOND \u2014 The Virginia House of Delegates passed emergency legislation Friday to make a widely supported fix to prevent some small businesses from facing higher costs for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "House passes emergency fix for small businesses affected by Obamacare", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/general_assembly/house-passes-emergency-fix-for-small-businesses-affected-by-obamacare/article_aba9a727-dcc0-5999-85b6-1633b301dab8.html", "image": {"width": 562, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/50/c50a3510-a5db-5826-891f-75c299d7e4e8/559866652faa4.image.jpg?resize=562%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary"}, "description": "RICHMOND \u2014 The Virginia House of Delegates passed emergency legislation Friday to make a widely supported fix to prevent some small businesses from facing higher costs for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "general assembly,obamacare,general_assembly", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "general assembly,obamacare,general_assembly"}, "article_summary": "RICHMOND \u2014 The Virginia House of Delegates passed emergency legislation Friday to make a widely supported fix to prevent some small businesses from facing higher costs for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\nHouse Bill 58, patroned by Del.\n\u201cAt a time when so many small businesses are struggling, we have to do everything we can to provide relief and certainty,\u201d Speaker of the House Bill Howell, R-Stafford, said in a written statement.\n\u201cWhen we focus on trying to fix things as opposed to trying to repeal things willy-nilly, we can get some good things done.\u201dOther states have been able to enact the fix through executive action.\n\u201cThis bipartisan bill will protect small businesses from another premium spike and will ensure their employees can keep their healthcare plans.\u201dBefore the vote, House Minority Leader David Toscano, D-Charlottesville, rose to voice his support."}
