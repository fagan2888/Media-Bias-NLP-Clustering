Farmer Jeff Jorgenson is busy harvesting soybeans. He also grows corn on about 2,000 acres in the southwest corner of the state.\n\nFarming is big business here in Iowa. This state is the biggest producer of corn in the country. And it\u2019s second only to Illinois in the production of soybeans.\n\nFor Jorgenson \u2013 whose family\u2019s been farming for four generations \u2013 it\u2019s all about keeping his yields as high as he can.\n\nJEFF JORGENSON: Yield monitor\u2019s here.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: And one of the biggest battles he fights is against weeds.\n\nJEFF JORGENSON: A weed in the field\u2019s going to take moisture, going to take sunlight, nutrients away from the plants surrounding it. And that\u2019s why we have to keep clean fields.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: But Jorgenson says, keeping \u201cclean\u201d fields has been getting harder and harder. Like many farmers, he relied for years mainly on an herbicide called \u201cRoundup\u201d that\u2019s manufactured by Monsanto.\n\nRoundup use exploded in the mid-90\u2019s with the introduction of new genetically modified crops that dominate the market today. The crops were engineered to withstand Roundup. So farmers could just spray an entire field, and the herbicide would kill the weeds, but not the crops.\n\nJEFF JORGENSON: Any weed you had in the field, Roundup took care of. Roundup revolutionized weed management for farmers.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Jorgenson says it all worked great, for awhile. He no longer had to spend lots of time plowing to kill weeds. But over time, Roundup and its generic versions \u2013 all of which contain a chemical called glyphosate \u2013 stopped working so well.\n\nMIKE OWEN: Simple use of one herbicide recurrently in the system is going to inevitably result in weeds that evolve resistance to that herbicide.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Agronomy professor Mike Owen is a nationally-recognized weed expert at Iowa State University in Ames.\n\nMIKE OWEN: It is a widespread and- and is significant from an economic perspective problem across the Midwest and, dare I say, across agriculture in general.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Owen says it\u2019s no mystery why this happened \u2013 it can all be explained by evolution. In Iowa, one of the weeds that\u2019s evolved to be resistant is called \u201cwaterhemp.\u201d\n\nJEFF JORGENSON: This is giant waterhemp, a weed we have down in southwest Iowa that\u2019s become more tolerant. This plant, when it\u2019s mature, will be, can get 5 to 6 feet tall, where it\u2019s very heavy, you can have yields cut in half, 50 percent losses.\n\nMIKE OWEN: In Iowa, we would estimate as that about 75 percent of the fields have infestations of common waterhemp that are resistant to one or more herbicides.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: The weeds are not just a problem in Iowa. In one survey, almost 50 percent of farmers across the U.S. reported herbicide-resistant weeds in their fields. The problem is worst in the south, where some cotton fields can\u2019t be farmed. But the threat is creeping north into the corn and soybean belts. Keep in mind, crop yields in the U.S. are booming. But Mike Owen says it\u2019s possible they could be even higher were it not for the weeds. Owen says it\u2019s difficult to quantify the damage. But if the weeds start having a significant impact, it could be too late.\n\nMIKE OWEN: We have, if you will, hidden yield losses and thus hidden profit losses on millions and millions of acres in the Midwest. It hasn\u2019t gotten to the point, if you will, of the train wreck.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: What could happen, or what\u2019s at stake if this doesn\u2019t get under control?\n\nMIKE OWEN: Well, the train wreck. And- and that is the inability to produce crops.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Over the last four years, the issue started to get more and more attention. Congress held hearings\u2026 and the USDA recently announced new measures it\u2019s taking to combat the problem\u2026. A problem also acknowledged by Monsanto. And now another major manufacturer has stepped in.\n\nPROMOTIONAL VIDEO: Growers across the country face an increasing problem from resistant and hard-to-control weeds.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Biotech giant Dow Agrosciences recently won federal approval for new genetically modified corn and soybeans, and a new herbicide to go with them called Enlist Duo. Dow is promoting it as an answer to the herbicide-resistant weed problem.\n\nPROMOTIONAL VIDEO: These weeds are out of control.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: But there\u2019s another piece to all of this. And that is, whether the herbicides used to control weeds pose health risks for farmers and the rest of us. The center for food safety, a national environmental advocacy group, recently sued the EPA, alleging the agency didn\u2019t fully analyze the new herbicide\u2019s potential effects on human health and the environment.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: The group cites studies that suggest a correlation between pesticides and diseases like Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Parkinson\u2019s. Attorney Andrew Kimbrell heads the Center for Food Safety.\n\nANDREW KIMBRELL: They\u2019re bad for us, right, because it\u2019s going to mean much more of these toxic herbicides in our food, in our groundwater, in the air.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: But in approving the product, the EPA published this document saying its scientists determined: \u201cwhen used according to label directions, Enlist Duo is safe for everyone, including infants, the developing fetus, the elderly and more highly exposed groups such as agricultural workers.\u201d\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: In a statement to the NewsHour, Dow quoted the EPA analysis. And added, its new system helps farmers \u201cas they struggle to control weeds that impact the food supply, while respecting the well being of both people and the environment.\u201d\n\nThe EPA approved the new product for use only in six states so far. And it imposed restrictions: 30-foot buffer zones, no aerial spraying, and no applications in windy conditions. The new product is a mix of the main ingredient in Roundup \u2013 glyphosate \u2013 and a chemical called 2,4-D \u2013 used for decades and found in many common lawn care products.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Pretty much anybody can walk into a hardware store and buy a product for use on their lawn that contains this stuff. So, if it\u2019s so dangerous, why is it so widely available?\n\nANDREW KIMBRELL: This isn\u2019t just about 2,4-D. Enlist Duo, the product that\u2019s been approved, is also glyphosate. What do they mean together? We know some of the health impacts separately, but what happens when they\u2019re- when they come together and- and combine? What does that actually mean for health effects? What does it mean for toxic effects on farmers and applicators?\n\nMIKE OWEN: We have the model system with the EPA reviewing the safety of these herbicides and my sense is that the evidence says that the herbicides when used appropriately are safe.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: But even if they are safe, there are serious concerns that weeds could become resistant to the new herbicide, just as they did to Roundup. It\u2019s something the EPA is requiring Dow to monitor.\n\nMIKE OWEN: The problem will inevitably get worse unless changes are made.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Changes like relying less on chemicals. And also going back to some of the old ways \u2013 like growing crops in the offseason to suppress weeds \u2026 and removing some weeds mechanically.\n\nMIKE OWEN: Growers thus far have been wanting a new, simple solution. And unfortunately, the industry has not been able to come up with, if you will, another silver bullet.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Farmer Jeff Jorgenson says he thinks the new Dow products \u2013 expected to come to market this spring \u2013 will help farmers, especially in the south. To battle his weeds, he\u2019s been mixing other herbicides in with Roundup, something Monsanto recommends. But, Jorgenson says he knows his system will inevitably have to evolve \u2026 just like the weeds.\n\nMEGAN THOMPSON: Are you afraid that your system might stop working?\n\nJEFF JORGENSON: Oh, there\u2019s no question. It will change. There will be a time where it will not have the effect that it does now. After seeing what\u2019s happened with Roundup, you always have the worry that whatever chemical program you\u2019re using what will happen if it loses its effectiveness. That is always on farmers\u2019 minds because we need to be able to control the problems that we have in fields.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Millions of acres of farmland in the U.S. have been affected by herbicide-resistant weeds, rendering some fields unable to be farmed.
