Cleveland, a developer and owner of the Tupelo Furniture Market. He also owns the Tupelo Commons retail development, which is home to Best Buy, Ashley HomeStore and several other stores and restaurants. Hancock has leased space at Tupelo Commons since about 2005. When Hancock filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on Feb. 2, it owed Cleveland nearly $19,000.\n\n\u201cYou never really know how it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might get a nickel for every dollar that\u2019s owed or an even smaller percentage, but I really don\u2019t expect any.\n\n\u201cBut what gets me is all the lawyers involved will get their money right away.\u201d\n\nHancock\u2019s top three secured creditors have provided financing for the company. Wells Fargo is owed the largest chunk, more than $57 million, followed by GACP Finance ($18.3 million) and Deutsche Bank ($8.4 million).\n\nAmong the unsecured priority claims \u2013 these creditors are next in line following the secured creditors \u2013 the city of Baldwyn is owed more than $157,000 in real estate taxes, plus nearly $2,000 in personal property taxes. Lee County is owed more than $127,000 in real estate taxes.\n\nJoining Cleveland in the group of non-priority unsecured creditors is Prentiss County Electric Power Association; it is owed nearly $105,000.\n\nPCEPA General Manager Ronny Rowland said the electric co-operative\u2019s customers don\u2019t have to worry about footing the bill.\n\n\u201cWe have a surety bond that can take care of that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done that for larger customers for a long time.\u201d\n\nA surety bond assures a creditor will get at least a portion of the money it is owed. While Rowland isn\u2019t sure what will happen with Hancock this time around, he said the company made good on its debt nine years ago when it filed Chapter 11 for the first time.\n\n\u201cI have to give them credit \u2013 they owed us more than $40,000, and when they got out of bankruptcy, they paid it all back,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the issue this time is that Hancock will be liquidating and won\u2019t reemerge.\n\ndennis.seid@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @dennisseid", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal Hancock Fabrics owes nearly $84 million to three secured creditors who have first dibs on any proceeds coming from the liquidation of its stores.
