Darin LaHood won the Republican nomination Tuesday in the special primary election for the 18th congressional district seat formerly held by ex-congressman Aaron Schock.\n\nRob Mellon, a high school teacher in Quincy, captured the Democratic nomination in the primary, which saw a low turnout of about 11 percent.\n\nLaHood, of Dunlap, defeated two other Republican primary candidates: Mike Flynn, who came in second, followed by Donald Rients. In the Democratic primary, Mellon beat the only other candidate, Adam Lopez.\n\nLaHood and Melon will go head-to-head in the September 10 special general election to fill Schock's seat.\n\nThe former congressman resigned in March following numerous reports and calls for investigations surrounding his spending of campaign funds and taxpayer money.\n\nIllinois Republican Party Chairman Tim Schneider issued these remarks in response to LaHood's win:\n\nI would like to congratulate State Senator Darin LaHood (R-Dunlap) on his primary election victory. Voters of the 18th Congressional District have chosen a consistent, conservative leader for Central Illinois and Western Illinois. Darin LaHood will fight to pass term limits, rein in the national debt, repeal & replace Obamacare, and ensure transparency in government. The Illinois Republican Party will work hard over the next two months to ensure that Darin LaHood is Illinois' next Congressman.\n\nThe Republican-leaning 18th congressional district covers parts of central and western Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "State Sen.
