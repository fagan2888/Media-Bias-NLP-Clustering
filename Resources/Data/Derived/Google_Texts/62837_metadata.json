Katherine Klaeren, one of the hospital's attorneys, argued that case law dictates employers aren't accountable for anything employees do outside the scope of their job duties.\n\n\"[UCMC] had a policy. It was violated,\" Luebbers said. \"It's tragic \u2026 but that's just how I see it.\"\n\nMike Allen, the woman's lawyer, called the removal order a legal technicality and said he expects his client to appeal, according to the article.\n\nNumerous cases have spurred a debate over social media, patient privacy and how to reconcile the two.
