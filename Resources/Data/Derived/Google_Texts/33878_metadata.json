(Photo: Freedom Indiana/Facebook)\n\nThe fallout over various state-level \u2018religious freedom\u2019 laws, which critics say authorize discrimination against LGBTQ people, continued into Friday, with civil rights advocates calling on politicians to reject similar measures around the country.\n\nOn Thursday, the governors of Indiana and Arkansas both signed bills aimed at clarifying their states\u2019 controversial \u2018religious freedom\u2019 laws. Indiana\u2019s revised law explicitly bars businesses from denying services to individuals on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In Arkansas, the Religious Freedom Reformation Act was amended to mirror the federal version of the law.\n\nBut the \u2018fixes\u2019 signed Thursday did little to placate the activists, businesspeople, and lawmakers who said such laws should never be passed in the first place.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nCalling for a statewide nondiscrimination law, Freedom Indiana\u2019s Katie Blair acknowledged that the changes \u201crepresent an important step forward\u201d but still fall short \u201cin many ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cStatewide nondiscrimination protections for LGBT Hoosiers still do not exist,\u201d she noted, \u201cmeaning discrimination is still legal in most of the state.\u201d\n\nWhich is why the National LGBTQ Task Force on Thursday launched the nationwide \u2018Nix It Now\u2019 campaign, urging politicians to reject similar discrimination laws being floated in states including Georgia, Maine, North Carolina, and Texas.\n\nA Time magazine map shows that \u2018religious freedom\u2019 bills already exist in 19 states and are pending in at least six others.\n\n\u201cPoliticians across the nation have a critical choice to make: do the right thing by rejecting Indiana-style discrimination laws or do the wrong thing by supporting these laws and thereby transforming their states into no-go areas for LGBTQ people and our allies,\u201d said Russell Roybal, deputy executive director for the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund.\n\n\u201cThe self-motivated politicians who peddle these laws in the short-run become the opponents of freedom in the long-run,\u201d Roybal continued. \u201c\u200bWe urge all politicians to nix discrimination now by rejecting discriminatory laws and passing strong non-discrimination laws.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed published Thursday at The Hill, Roybal explained further:\n\nThere are many reasons for the sudden interest in this tactic from the opponents of equality\u2014not least of which is the extraordinary progress the LGBTQ people have made in securing marriage equality and public support. Another is the Supreme Court\u2019s extremely controversial Hobby Lobby ruling that was a fundamental attack on reproductive justice. This decision provided a legal context for employers imposing their beliefs on their employees: all in the name of religious liberty. This isn\u2019t religious liberty; it\u2019s persecution in the name of religion.\n\nWriting Friday at The Nation, William Greider concurred that the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision was to blame for the current uproar:\n\nThe public wrath directed at God-fearing Republican politicians in Indiana and Arkansas is pounding on the wrong Christians. The real culprits are the five Bible-thumping conservatives on the Supreme Court. They inspired this controversy with their inflammatory decision last year in the Hobby Lobby case. The Supreme justices ruled then that corporate owners possess religious convictions entitled to First Amendment protection against intrusions by the federal government. That case was about birth control and Obamacare\u2019s mandated health-care coverage. But the court\u2019s half-baked logic excited the imagination of right-wing activists and lawyers. If employers can reject the birth control pills for their employees by citing their religious objections to contraception, do employers also have a right to refuse serving gay couples because they abhor same-sex marriages? Conservatives set out to initiate state laws and law suits designed to provoke more constitutional conflicts between church and state\u2014cases that can wind up before the Supreme Court and will be decided by the same right-wing majority that issued the Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\nStill, with so much national attention being focused on this issue, LGBTQ activists and their allies have an opportunity to reclaim their legal footing, Garrett Epps wrote on Thursday for The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cThe proponents of these very bad bills are on the defensive right now, largely because national business interests have stepped in,\u201d Epps stated. \u201cThe forces of equality have the advantage; and while they have it, they would be wise to insist that the new wave of state RFRAs\u2014if they are to be adopted at all\u2014contain no deception and no weasel words that might allow them to be used against civil-rights claims.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just LGBTQ advocates who are concerned about the implications of state-level religious objection laws.\n\nOn Friday, the Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations described the recent wave of such legislation as \u201d a cynical move intended to protect bias under the guise of religious liberty.\u201d\n\nWhile CAIR said \u201cthe federal RFRA is a powerful tool to protect the rights of religious minorities to practice their religion when such practice would violate laws written without their needs in mind,\u201d it added:\n\nIn contrast, the newer state RFRAs include provisions not in the 1993 federal statute that ensure that they will be used in private lawsuits brought to enforce civil rights laws and to be used by corporate, rather than individual defendants. We can foresee circumstances in which such provisions can be used to permit bias targeting members of minority faiths. CAIR opposes all forms of discrimination, particularly when such discrimination is given the cover of law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Politicians across the nation have a critical choice to make: do the right thing by rejecting Indiana-style discrimination laws,' says national LGBTQ activist.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Deirdre Fulton | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "'Politicians across the nation have a critical choice to make: do the right thing by rejecting Indiana-style discrimination laws,' says national LGBTQ activist.", "title": "Forces of Equality Intensify Fight Against 'Persecution In Name Of Religion'", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/forces-of-equality-intensify-fight-against-persecution-in-name-of-religion/203953/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/indiana.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-03T23:26:03-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Politicians across the nation have a critical choice to make: do the right thing by rejecting Indiana-style discrimination laws,' says national LGBTQ activist.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/indiana.jpg", "title": "Forces of Equality Intensify Fight Against 'Persecution In Name Of Religion'", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Indiana", "published_time": "2015-04-04T05:00:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T23:26:03-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda679\"", "article_summary": "Forces of Equality Intensify Fight Against \u2018Persecution In Name Of Religion\u2019'Politicians across the nation have a critical choice to make: do the right thing by rejecting Indiana-style discrimination laws,' says national LGBTQ activist.\nOn Thursday, the governors of Indiana and Arkansas both signed bills aimed at clarifying their states\u2019 controversial \u2018religious freedom\u2019 laws.\nIndiana clergy speaking out against the state\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\nIn Arkansas, the Religious Freedom Reformation Act was amended to mirror the federal version of the law.\nA Time magazine map shows that \u2018religious freedom\u2019 bills already exist in 19 states and are pending in at least six others."}
