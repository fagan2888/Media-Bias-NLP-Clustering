When Hillary Clinton attacks\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s immersion into campaign politics this fall has come with a surprising twist: She\u2019s talking carefully but wielding a big stick.\n\nIn more than a dozen appearances for Democrats in races around the country, Clinton has not just been talking up her candidate with anodyne stump speeches. She\u2019s been going after the Republican, in pointed ways.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nShe never mentions the opponent by name, avoiding looking like she\u2019s taking gratuitous shots. But Clinton has tailored her stump speeches to incorporate each Democrat\u2019s specific message against his or her rival, a use of her megaphone that risks making her look more partisan but that\u2019s earning her goodwill and chits.\n\n( POLITICO's polling center)\n\nThe most overt example came last week when Clinton campaigned for Bruce Braley in Iowa. She didn\u2019t just pump up the Senate hopeful\u2019s resume in her stump speech \u2013 she took a harsh jab at his rival, Republican Joni Ernst, for not sitting down with the Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial board.\n\n\u201cThey have to be willing to answer the tough questions, which Bruce has been willing to do and his opponent has not,\u201d she said in Iowa. \u201cIt really seems like it should be disqualifying in Iowa of all states to avoid answering questions.\u201d\n\nIt was a message that Braley\u2019s campaign had been trying for days to get traction on, stoking question about whether Ernst can be trusted and whether she will talk to people who aren\u2019t her supporters.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The final sprint)\n\nClinton \u201cforcefully highlighted Ernst\u2019s big problem,\u201d said Braley strategist Jeff Link, doing something that was \u201cvery important for Braley in the final days of this campaign.\u201d\n\nA few days earlier, Clinton campaigned for Mike Michaud, the Democratic candidate for governor in Maine. At a gymnasium rally in Scarborough, she asked people not to waste their votes in a campaign in which an independent candidate, Eliot Cutler, is siphoning support.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got three people running. right?\u201d Clinton said to the crowd. \u201cWhoever gets the most votes wins \u2014 you\u2019ve just gotta make sure Mike [gets] the most votes.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP gains steam)\n\nShe repeatedly implored attendees to get everyone they knew to the polls, adding, \u201cThis is no time to be throwing away a vote.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the message that message came as Democrats had been trying to minimize Cutler\u2019s impact on the race. Maine is one of the few states President Barack Obama has traveled to in an election year in which candidates in tight races have avoided him.\n\nIn Louisiana on Saturday, she hit Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s main opponent, Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, over the aftermath of Hurricane Isaac \u2014 a topic that still resonates loudly in the state.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, Mary\u2019s opponent didn\u2019t really lift a finger after Isaac,\u201d Clinton said without naming Cassidy but bolstering a Landrieu message.\n\nAnd when she traveled a bit north of her Chappaqua home to appear with former Clinton White House staffer Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, she rapped his opponent, Nan Hayworth, as someone who will \u201cturn the clock back\u201d on women\u2019s health.\n\nMaloney\u2019s \u201copponent,\u201d she said, is someone who \u201chas publicly stated she would defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d Clinton said. She \u201csupports the Hobby Lobby decision.\u201d\n\nClinton made clear out of the gate when she started campaigning for candidates this fall that she was going to make the contrasts. At a \u201cWomen for Wolf\u201d rally for Democrat Tom Wolf in Philadelphia, she invoked incumbent Republican Gov. Tom Corbett\u2019s support for a vaginal ultrasound bill in cases of abortion and his comparison of gay marriage to incest.\n\nDemocrats say it\u2019s allowed their candidates to break through some of the noise surrounding races in which the airwaves are cluttered with outside groups\u2019 attack ads.\n\n\u201cHer events have not only generated enthusiasm for our candidates and motivated our people to get out the vote, but she has made the case to undecided voters about what\u2019s at stake and why these Republican candidates are so wrong on issues they care about,\u201d said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Matt Canter.\n\nClinton has done her most extensive fall campaign work trying to bolster Senate Democrats, many of whom were her colleagues when she served as a senator from New York. She\u2019s gotten engaged in most of the highly competitive races, making two trips for three events to Kentucky, where she has stumped for Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\nClinton delivered her shots at incumbent Rep. Mitch McConnell surgically. But she made her toughest comparison against him on the issue of Obamacare, which he has said he wants to repeal outright.\n\n\u201cEither you think [Kentucky\u2019s existing health care exchange is good] for hard-working families, for children or you want to pull out health care reform root and branch,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to break through, you have to do more than just platitudes,\u201d said Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf of why Clinton can deliver a message with strong impact. \u201cIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s making cheap shots \u2013 there are very legitimate distinctions to be made here.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Josh Schwerin agreed.\n\n\u201cThere are few people in either party who can deliver a persuasive and motivating message to both base and swing voters,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton is one of those people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "In more than a dozen appearances this cycle, she has made pointed attacks on Republicans.", "title": "When Hillary Clinton attacks", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/hillary-clinton-2014-campaigns-112413.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/01/141101_hillary_clinton_gty_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Democrats,Hillary Clinton,2014 Elections,2016 Elections", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "In more than a dozen appearances this cycle, she has made pointed attacks on Republicans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "When Hillary Clinton attacksHillary Clinton\u2019s immersion into campaign politics this fall has come with a surprising twist: She\u2019s talking carefully but wielding a big stick.\nIn more than a dozen appearances for Democrats in races around the country, Clinton has not just been talking up her candidate with anodyne stump speeches.\n( POLITICO's polling center)The most overt example came last week when Clinton campaigned for Bruce Braley in Iowa.\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, Mary\u2019s opponent didn\u2019t really lift a finger after Isaac,\u201d Clinton said without naming Cassidy but bolstering a Landrieu message.\n\u201cHillary Clinton is one of those people.\u201d"}
