They told 11 News they saw sparks fly from a light switch when it happened Sunday afternoon, but thankfully no one was hurt.\n\nThe home is on the southeast side of Fountain. The lightning bolt struck the gutter and traveled through the home to a bathroom. There are visible signs of the path left by burn marks and cracks in the mirror.\n\n\"We found some blowout points in the house blowout points being the lightning followed a certain path and blew out some electrical outlets,\" Fountain Fire Captain Rick Daniels said.\n\nIf we're ever home during lightning and thunderstorms, firefighters caution all of us to stay away from water. That means no baths, or showers, and save those dirty dishes for later.\n\nDon't lie on concrete floors or lean on concrete walls because of the metal wires or bars in them. Also, try to stay off of your landline telephones and home computers.\n\n\"If lightning strikes it's going to follow that path so if you're working on that computer, you stand that chance of if you don't have a circuit breaker or a surge protector, it could electrocute you while working on the computer,\" Capt. Daniels said.\n\nThe Fountain Fire Department was called out to two other homes for lightning strikes Sunday afternoon. One other home had been hit, but had little damage. They said the other one was just a close call.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A local family had part of the power to their home knocked out when it was struck by lightning.", "language": "english", "author": "Alyssa Chin", "og": {"description": "A local family had part of the power to their home knocked out when it was struck by lightning.", "title": "Home Struck By Lightning", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Home-Struck-By-Lightning-307326071.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C83/4FB/C834FB81759141C488C2140F9E4E7327", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0D4/78D/0D478D37CD3A4ABEA590A16F09C562CB.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "A local family had part of the power to their home knocked out when it was struck by lightning.", "title": "Home Struck By Lightning", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/Home-Struck-By-Lightning-307326071.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/6-14+home+hit.jpg", "creator": "@kktv11news", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Home Struck By Lightning", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf23a\"", "article_summary": "A local family had part of the power to their home knocked out when it was struck by lightning.\nThe lightning bolt struck the gutter and traveled through the home to a bathroom.\nThe Fountain Fire Department was called out to two other homes for lightning strikes Sunday afternoon.\nIf we're ever home during lightning and thunderstorms, firefighters caution all of us to stay away from water.\n\"We found some blowout points in the house blowout points being the lightning followed a certain path and blew out some electrical outlets,\" Fountain Fire Captain Rick Daniels said."}
