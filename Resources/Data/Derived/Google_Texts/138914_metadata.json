The story began in Phoenix, but it soon came to light that facilities in several other states were treating veterans with similar bureaucratic contempt. It\u2019s a disgusting disservice to our veterans, and it\u2019s virtually certain to become normal for all of us as health care becomes rationed under ObamaCare.\n\nThe Albuquerque VA hospital evidently is now the eighth facility to place veterans on secret long waiting lists. A whistleblower says the facility has already destroyed records to cover its tracks.\n\nThe nationwide death toll is hard to pinpoint. So far, the VA only admits to 23 deaths due to delayed care, but there are allegedly 40 in Phoenix alone and the overall number will grow as more information is discovered. In fact, Dayton Daily News points to VA settlements with the families of veterans who died waiting for treatment: \u201cA database of paid claims by the VA since 2001 includes 167 in which the words \u2018delay in treatment\u2019 is used in the description. The VA paid out a total of $36.4 million to settle those claims, either voluntarily or as part of a court action.\u201d So if that\u2019s accurate, it\u2019s 167 deaths and counting.\n\nAs unbelievable as it may seem, the Obama administration recycled one of its famously false refrains \u2013 that Barack Obama only just found out about the mess from media reports. White House Propaganda Minister Jay Carney said Monday, \u201cI believe we learned about them through the reports. I\u2019ll double-check if that\u2019s not the case, but that\u2019s when we learned about them.\u201d The White House said the same thing about the IRS scandal, Fast and Furious, eavesdropping on the Associated Press, the unprepared state of Healthcare.gov and so on, and so on.\n\nIf it were true that Obama only just found out, how is that a defense? Who is running his administration? Is Obama really just an innocent bystander? The alternative is no better \u2013 the White House is lying.\n\nLet\u2019s stroll down Obama\u2019s proclamations and promises in front of national Veteran group conventions for the last seven years.\n\nIn 2007, then presidential aspirant Obama blasted George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs, saying, \u201cAfter seven years of an administration that has stretched our military to the breaking point, ignored deplorable conditions at some VA hospitals, and neglected the planning and preparation necessary to care for our returning heroes, America\u2019s veterans deserve a president who will fight for them not just when it\u2019s easy or convenient, but every hour of every day for the next four years. No veteran should have to fill out a 23 page claim to get care or wait months and even years to get an appointment at the VA.\u201d\n\nFebruary 2008: \u201cWe need to make sure folks get the care they need without long waiting lists and long drives.\u201d\n\nMay 2008: \u201cThe true test of our patriotism is whether we will serve our returning heroes as well as they have served us. That\u2019s why I have pledged to build a 21st-century VA as president.\u201d (It comes as no surprise to those of us who have honored our oaths \u201cto Support and Defend\u201d that Obama has failed that test.)\n\nObama' incoming administration was warned of the VA\u2019s problems in late 2008 by George W. Bush\u2019s transition team.\n\nAugust 2009: \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut those backlogs, slash those wait times, deliver your benefits soon. I know you\u2019ve heard this for years but the leadership and resources we are providing this time means that we\u2019re going to be able to do it. That is our mission and we\u2019re going to make it happen.\u201d\n\nAugust 2010: \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep at this until we meet our commitment to cut those backlogs, slash those wait times, and deliver your benefits sooner.\u201d\n\nAugust 2011: \u201cLet me say this \u2013 and I know Secretary Shinseki agrees \u2013 when our veterans who fought for our country have to fight to get the benefits that you have already earned, that\u2019s unacceptable. So this is going to remain a key priority for us.\u201d\n\nJuly 2012: \u201cFor the first time ever, we\u2019ve made military families and veterans a top priority not just at DOD, not just at the VA, but across the government. \u2026 New veterans shouldn\u2019t be piled onto the backlog, and we will not rest, I will not be satisfied, until we get this right.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, speaking to disabled vets, Obama rewarmed his 2009 pledge: \u201cI pledged to cut the backlog, slash those wait times, deliver your benefits sooner.\u201d He also pledged to \u201creduce wait times for veterans seeking mental health care.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Barack Obama is entangled in another of his own complex web of lies.\n\nWhile VA Secretary Eric Shinseki is \u201cmad as hell,\u201d Obama is reportedly \u201cmadder than hell.\u201d In fact, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough insists, \u201c[N]obody is more outraged about this problem right now.\u201d\n\nWe think that the families of deceased Vets are probably \u201cmore outraged.\u201d\n\nObama just found out? Check. He\u2019s angry? Check. He symbolically fired somebody? Check. He blamed Bush? Check.\n\nAnd regarding Obama\u2019s feeble and fallacious attempt to pass this buck back to the Bush Administration, especially given that George Bush actually did make measurable improvements to VA service delivery, Charles Krauthammer notes, \u201cThe statute of limitations for a president to say, \u2018Hey I just got here,\u2019 is 18 months.\u201d\n\nPolitical analyst Arnold Ahlert has the bottom line: \u201c[W]hile the political machinations, the hearings, the media stories and the investigations play themselves out, men and women who served this nation \u2013 and in many cases paid an extremely heavy price for that highly honorable commitment \u2013 are getting the short end of the stick. The very least this nation owes our veterans is timely healthcare, not a litany of excuses and stonewalling from a dysfunctional and very likely corrupt bureaucracy. One like every other government bureaucracy, where self-preservation matters above all else. If there is little else Americans learn from this scandal, it should be noted that this is the true face of government-run healthcare, in all its \u2018individual be damned\u2019 glory. If the government can treat 8.57 million veterans this shabbily, imagine how they will treat Americans forced to enroll in ObamaCare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama can be mad all he wants, but the inherent problems remain.", "csrf-token": "Nlhlv9J9M+KK2RL3PRLRlwZZprbETgDLhmlvNyAnVOA=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Obama can be mad all he wants, but the inherent problems remain.", "title": "VA Delays: An ObamaCare Case Study", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/25903", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2014-05-20-2120cc1e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a disgusting disservice to our veterans, and it\u2019s virtually certain to become normal for all of us as health care becomes rationed under ObamaCare.\nAs unbelievable as it may seem, the Obama administration recycled one of its famously false refrains \u2013 that Barack Obama only just found out about the mess from media reports.\nIf the government can treat 8.57 million veterans this shabbily, imagine how they will treat Americans forced to enroll in ObamaCare.\u201d\nObama' incoming administration was warned of the VA\u2019s problems in late 2008 by George W.
