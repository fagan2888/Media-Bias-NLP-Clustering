I was a Notre Dame fan. Both of my parents went to Siena. We were an Irish Catholic family and I grew up watching Notre Dame, and I had a few friends who liked Notre Dame, so we were always talking about it at school. With the red hair, my friends were always saying, 'You look like the leprechaun, you got to do it.' I was not big enough to be playing college sports. I played every season at La Salle in high school. I played football, basketball and track and baseball\n\nQ: Were you any good?\n\nA: (smiles) I was good at track and baseball. We had a good team in football, but I was not nearly big enough to play.\n\nQ: How big are you?\n\nA: I'm 5-11 for everything but leprechaun. For that, I say I am 5-10 because you have to be shorter for that. The leprechaun is the first time I have ever been the tallest of anything in my life. The amount of times I have been told I am too tall to be the leprechaun is crazy. All the fans for the away teams say I am too tall to be a leprechaun.\n\nQ: And that bothers the leprechaun.\n\nA: Ahhh,,, it doesn't bother me that much. There is other stuff I have heard that would be a lot meaner than that. I figured when I got out to Notre Dame, I would give it a try.\n\nMore Information Contact Tim Wilkin at 518-454-5415 or email twilkin@times union. com\n\nQ: Are there tryouts to be the leprechaun or do the people at Notre Dame just go out in the woods and try to catch one?\n\nA: There are tryouts! I remember looking into it and seeing some place that you had to be a male cheerleader first. That they picked the leprechaun from the male cheerleaders. That's what I thought. I wasn't big enough to do all the stuff the male cheerleaders do. I wasn't interested in doing that, so I kind of dismissed it. But then I got out there and the tryouts for the leprechaun were open to anybody, so I thought, 'Let's give this a try.'\n\nQ: How many people tried out?\n\nA: My first year there were probably between 15 and 20 kids that went to the first meeting. The tryouts last for two weeks and then they cut it down to six guys. There is one, big final tryout and it's a mock pep rally. They give all six guys a suit and you get all your friends to go to the pep rally, which is in the practice gym for basketball. You have to give a speech. You have to do the Irish jig. They bring a local television person in to interview you and he asks you really awkward questions. They try to get you to say something stupid.\n\nQ: Like what I am trying to do?\n\nA: (smiles). I hope not. My first year, I was last of the six to go for the questions. And you can't watch what the other leprechauns do. My question was, 'You go a school that lets cheaters back in, don't you?' He was talking about Everett Golson (Notre Dame quarterback, who was suspended by the school in May 2013 for cheating on a test; he was readmitted the following December). I thought it was a bush-league question. I said something like as long as the university has his trust, he has mine, too. Obviously, it worked.\n\nQ: Are you a celebrity around campus?\n\nA: It depends. A lot of people do know who I am, yes. Our school is only 8,000 students, so, in the grand scheme of big football schools, it's really small. I could be in class with the starting quarterback, and a lot more people would care about him than me. People know who I am, but it's not like I walk into a place and people are going, \"Ooooohhhh.\"\n\nQ: Funniest thing anyone has ever said to you during a game.\n\nA: It doesn't bother me, but some people will say some cruel things. Funny things? I don't know. One time I met Ken Griffey Jr. and he asked for a picture. I said to him that this was not the way it worked. I should be asking you for a picture! We took the picture. It was amazing. You run into people on the sidelines you never think you are going to run into on the sidelines.\n\nQ: Who else?\n\nA: Alex Rodriguez was on the sidelines at Stanford this season. (New Jersey) Gov. (Chris) Christie's daughter goes to Notre Dame and he is at a bunch of games. (Former Major League Baseball player) Torii Hunter's son plays for Notre Dame; he is always there. (Former NBA All-Star) David Robinson's son plays at Notre Dame. He is at every Notre Dame game, and I have gotten to know him pretty well. He knows me as John. Bon Jovi's son is on the team, but I have never met (Bon Jovi).\n\nQ: Have you ever met Rudy?\n\nA: He's on campus a pretty decent amount. I have not ever talked to him. I have met Dick Vitale a few times. Both his daughters went to Notre Dame.\n\nQ: What do you do during a game?\n\nA: I am watching pretty intently. I am a huge Notre Dame fan. I am already so invested in a game. I run around a lot. One of the cheerleaders taught me how to do handstands, so I do that.\n\nQ: So, you have to be fairly athletic to do what you do.\n\nA: I lift three times a week with the cheerleaders.\n\nQ: You are a strong leprechaun.\n\nA: I guess. I am not as strong as the guy cheerleaders. I don't feel that strong. I am stronger than I was in high school. I'm not in bad shape.\n\nQ: You catch a leprechaun, you get three wishes. Have you ever been caught?\n\nA: Little kids try to catch me all the time. We visit schools a lot and little kids will try to catch me. Some of the kids believe I am a real leprechaun.\n\nQ: What is your favorite sport to be the leprechaun?\n\nA: Football. I like basketball too. I grew up going to a lot of Siena games.\n\nQ: If you had gone to Siena, think you would have been its mascot, the Saint Bernard?\n\nA: I don't know. I think a huge part of me wanting to be the leprechaun was that so many people said I looked like it. I don't know if I resemble a Saint Bernard.\n\nQ: Ever get into a fight with another mascot?\n\nA: No. People try to take my hat, and that gets kind of annoying. I have been doing this for two years, and I think there is a kind of bond between mascots. The mascot world is something else. We all get along pretty good.\n\nQ: What happens when the leprechaun days are gone forever and you have to take the suit off?\n\nA: It will be a sad day. I will probably shave the beard. I never had a beard before I became the mascot. The outgoing leprechaun runs the tryout for the new leprechaun. I'll be running that. And then I am moving to Chicago (after graduation) and I'll be an accountant. Where I am going to work, the guy who was the leprechaun before me, already works there. So there will be two leprechauns on the same floor.\n\nQ: After Notre Dame scores a touchdown, what are you doing?\n\nA: We all sing the fight song. I run around. I pretty much don't think. Sometimes, I will run and jump onto the wall in the student section. After the extra point, we (cheerleaders) all do pushups. A pushup for every point that we have. We have been in the 50s.\n\nQ: Do the players like the leprechaun?\n\nA: They do. A few guys will always come over. (Linebacker) Jaylon Smith, who will be a first-round draft pick, will wear my hat for the alma mater. I was on the (regional) cover of Sports Illustrated with him and (offensive tackle) Ronnie Stanley. That was a lot of fun.\n\nQ: How many copies of that did you get?\n\nA: A bunch.\n\nQ: How many people ask for pictures?\n\nA: On a game day, it's hundreds.\n\nQ: Do you get any kind of scholarship for this?\n\nA: No. When we travel, we get per diem. All my flights are paid for, and I get a ton of gear. And I get to keep the suit.\n\nQ: So, where is the gold?\n\nA: Somewhere in South Bend. It will be a secret forever.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Tim Wilkin: Q&A with Notre Dame leprechaun John Doran  How did you become the leprechaun, the mascot at Notre Dame?
