The view is from the Franics Marion Hotel. Wade Spees/Staff June 24, 2015\n\nAt least 400 people joined hands Wednesday evening and formed a large heart in Marion Square.\n\nTheir energy was electric as they waved and cheered for overhead drones taking their picture. The Holy City Heart Project was put together in about three days in an effort to show solidarity among the community.\n\nOrganizers were concerned that the city would be respond negatively after last week's shooting that left nine people dead at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\n\u201cWe were so worried that this city was going to fall apart or that something awful was going to happen because somebody tried to start a spark of madness and terror to bring us down,\u201d said Eli Latham, an organizer. \u201cBut, Charleston has laid 10,000 gallons on his spark and just continued to pour water to put any ignition out and it's been beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe event featured live music, speakers and a drum circle in a celebration meant to lift the city's spirits.\n\nNatalie Tucker of Charleston said she thought it was \u201creally awesome\u201d to see everyone come together at the event. \u201cIt's a big family,\u201d she said of Charleston. \u201cIts definitely an example that should be set for other cities.\u201d\n\nTucker and a friend said they felt like they were witnessing history.\n\n\u201cWe want to be apart of something and we want to do anything we can to support the community and come together,\u201d Tucker said.\n\nA local pastor, Philip Pinckney, spoke at the event and said while there is still anger after the shooting, Charleston will not be broken or divided.\n\n\u201cThere is a place for grieving, and if you're not in a place for forgiveness, that's OK. If you're still angry, that's OK,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cIf you don't know what to do, that's OK too. The Bible gives a place to grieve. The Bible gives us place to be angry. ... But we're going to do that in a safe, God-loving way.\u201d\n\nHe added that the event was the beginning of a journey to healing.\n\nAnthony Goff of Charleston said he took that message to heart. He said seeing everyone form the large heart was proof to him that \u201cGod is everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something to make you think,\u201d he said of the event. \u201cIt makes me feel happy. Everything is about togetherness. I wish there could be more events like this.\u201d\n\nReach Melissa Boughton at 937-5594 or at Twitter.com/mboughton.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Hundreds form 'human heart' in Marion Square in wake of church shooting, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsChurch shooting, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston,Charleston Police Department,Dylann Roof,Emanuel AME Church", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "At least 400 people joined hands Wednesday evening and formed a large heart in Marion Square.", "title": "Hundreds form 'human heart' in Marion Square in wake of church shooting", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150624/150629679/hundreds-form-human-heart-in-marion-square-in-wake-of-church-shooting", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150624/PC16/150629679/AR/0/AR-150629679.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150624/PC16/150629679/AR/0/AR-150629679.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At least 400 people joined hands Wednesday evening and formed a large heart in Marion Square.", "title": "Hundreds form 'human heart' in Marion Square in wake of church shooting", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150624/PC16/150629679/AR/0/AR-150629679.jpg?201506242311", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150629679}}, "keywords": "Hundreds form 'human heart' in Marion Square in wake of church shooting , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsChurch shooting, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Charleston,Charleston Police Department,Dylann Roof,Emanuel AME Church", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-24T11:21:51Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-24T23:11:00Z", "author": "Melissa Boughton"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "At least 400 people joined hands Wednesday evening and formed a large heart in Marion Square."}, "article_summary": "The Holy City Heart Project was put together in about three days in an effort to show solidarity among the community.\nWade Spees/Staff June 24, 2015At least 400 people joined hands Wednesday evening and formed a large heart in Marion Square.\n\u201cThere is a place for grieving, and if you're not in a place for forgiveness, that's OK.\n\u201cIf you don't know what to do, that's OK too.\nIf you're still angry, that's OK,\u201d he told the crowd."}
