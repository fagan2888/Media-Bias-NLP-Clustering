The Smithfield, Va.-based company has transitioned 54 percent of its pregnant sows to group housing so far and said in a statement this week that \"animal care is one of our core sustainability commitments, and we are proud of our employee and company efforts to meet this goal.\"\n\nTyson also said it would require by the end of the year farmers who manage company-owned sows to end the longstanding industry practice of blunt-force euthanasia in favor of alternative methods in line with American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines.\n\nThe Henryetta-area operation in the video, West Coast Farms, had raised hogs for Tyson until the company's contract was dropped by the meat producer after the footage surfaced. A number listed for the farm, located in Okfuskee County, has since been disconnected.\n\nThe animal rights group Mercy For Animals released the video in November. Founder and executive director Nathan Runkle said he was pleased with Tyson's decision to improve housing conditions for its hogs.\n\n\"We hope this announcement is more than PR hogwash and that Tyson acts quickly and diligently to implement these changes in order to spare millions of animals needless misery and suffering.\"", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "The yearslong call by animal rights groups to improve conditions on American hog farms advanced considerably this week when two of the country's biggest meat companies urged producers to change how pregnant sows are housed, and one announced it wanted to stop the practice of killing sick or injured animals by \"manual blunt force.\"", "title": "Tyson, Smithfield changing pig-treatment policies", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/agriculture/tyson-smithfield-changing-pig-treatment-policies/article_af57dd0d-30b6-52d6-b03a-e9e334d816d2.html", "image": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/app/tulsa_world_ogimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The yearslong call by animal rights groups to improve conditions on American hog farms advanced considerably this week when two of the country's biggest meat companies urged producers to change how pregnant sows are housed, and one announced it wanted to stop the practice of killing sick or injured animals by \"manual blunt force.\"", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "tyson,video,animal,gestation,housing,sows,company,crates,hog,pork,agriculture,retail,business", "news_keywords": "tyson,video,animal,gestation,housing,sows,company,crates,hog,pork,agriculture,retail,business"}, "article_summary": "Founder and executive director Nathan Runkle said he was pleased with Tyson's decision to improve housing conditions for its hogs.\nAnd Smithfield Foods Inc. announced Tuesday it would ask growers to move pregnant sows from gestation crates to group housing by 2022.\nThe animal rights group Mercy For Animals released the video in November.\nSpringdale, Ark.-based Tyson said it is urging pork producers to improve housing conditions for gestating sows enough to allow sows of all sizes to stand, turn around, lie down and stretch their legs.\nSmithfield, the world's largest pork producer, had previously said it was phasing out gestation crates at its U.S. facilities by 2017."}
