So it is reasonable to think that start-ups might have different needs when it comes to health insurance. Now, one organization istrying to profit from this distinction, real or imagined, by marketing health insurance specifically to start-ups almost anywhere in the country.\n\nOn Monday, the Young Entrepreneur Council, an invitation-only network of successful company founders, introduced StartupInsurance.com, a Web site where nascent companies can buy health insurance and supplemental policies like dental insurance. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring a level of trust and transparency to a community that we understand very well here,\u201d said Scott Gerber, founder of the Young Entrepreneur Council. \u201cWe bring the curation and the knowledge of the need of our constituency.\u201d The council has simultaneously introduced FreelancerHealthcare and SmallBusinessInsurance, Web sites that sell insurance to those segments of the market.\n\nCertainly the effort makes sense for the for-profit Young Entrepreneur Council. It has used its network of nearly a thousand entrepreneurs to build an online brand for helping small businesses and will receive a fee for every client it refers to the insurance carriers marketing the plans, principally Assurant Health. Eventually, the council plans to market other business services to small companies. The question is whether the sites and their health offerings make sense for start-ups and other entrepreneurs.\n\nMr. Gerber said start-ups wanted insurance that was affordable and transparent and that complied with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, which take effect in 2014. But desiring these would not seem to distinguish start-ups and other entrepreneurs from anybody else \u2014 what company would not want to buy insurance that is inexpensive, easy to understand, and compliant with regulations?\n\nBut in fact, some of the individual health plans the freelance and start-up sites are offering will not comply with the health care law\u2019s provisions for providing minimum value. That means that the people who buy them will be subject to the penalty of the individual mandate. Mr. Gerber said that some entrepreneurs might prefer to absorb the mandate penalty in exchange for cheaper, if less extensive, coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s important to give a choice,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what particular attributes of insurance would appeal specifically to entrepreneurs and start-ups, he said that they could count on the Young Entrepreneurs Council to represent their interests in a shifting landscape \u2014 to figure out the complexities of the changing health insurance markets for them. \u201cWe sit in the middle of an ecosystem and literally work with thousands of entrepreneurs a day, so we\u2019re hearing them, but they also trust us,\u201d Mr. Gerber said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that if you trust what Y.E.C. has been about and continues to be about, then you understand that we put a tremendous amount of time, energy and resources into putting this entire experience and package together. We\u2019ve done the homework for them.\u201d\n\nMr. Gerber described his partner, Assurant, as \u201cone of the largest specialty health care providers specifically working with self-employed individuals.\u201d Mr. Gerber said insurance was available in every state except, Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont.\n\nBut Mr. Gerber said that he could not discuss the details of the plans \u2014 including what they will cost \u2014 for legal reasons, because he is not a broker. A spokeswoman for Assurant, Mary Hinderliter, said that the plans at all three sites were the same plans Assurant already offered. Though the council is marketing the insurance through three different portals, for three different audiences, the sites appear nearly identical. Mr. Gerber said there were some small differences across the sites, but he declined to identify them, except to note that the freelancer portal would not offer group insurance.\n\nMs. Hinderliter said Assurant\u2019s major medical plans were not meaningfully different from plans that would be available in the insurance markets, known as exchanges, scheduled to begin operating in 2014 under the health care law. (Assurant will not participate in the exchanges until 2015, according to Ms. Hinderliter.) In the exchanges, both individuals and small businesses can comparison shop for insurance across carriers, and plans. Mr. Gerber\u2019s contention is that entrepreneurs have neither the time nor the interest in diving so deeply into an ancillary task. But some of the council\u2019s clients may miss out on an opportunity \u2014 individuals and businesses that are eligible for tax credits to offset the cost of health insurance will only be able to use them if they purchase insurance from an exchange.\n\nAsked to comment about this, Mr. Gerber said, \u201cWe were going to do this regardless of whether the Affordable Care Act came to be or not, regardless of the state exchanges. This is our take on how to do it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big need here whether the government\u2019s involved or not, and we\u2019re hoping to help as many people as we can.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130911070145, "BN": "boss", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "boss", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/boss/post", "per": "Gerber, Scott", "org": "Young Entrepreneur Council", "keywords": "Gerber Scott,Entrepreneurship,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Small Business,Start-ups,Young Entrepreneur Council,The Agenda", "GBLC": "The Agenda", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/boss/A Health Insurance Offer for the Busy Start-Up ( 20130911 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robb Mandelbaum", "SCG": "boss", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Robb Mandelbaum", "byl": "Robb Mandelbaum", "twitter": {"url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/an-entrepreneurs-group-offers-health-insurance-to-the-busy-start-up/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Young Entrepreneur Council says it wants to save business owners the time and effort of figuring out health insurance.
