Today\u2019s youngsters are much more sophisticated, technologically speaking, than those who grew up in the days of flip phones and CD players \u2014 let alone those whose only access to a phone growing up was a spin-dial one. This means there\u2019s a lot more texting, tweeting, and Facebooking on smartphones in your average high school or college classroom than ever before.\n\nDoes this also mean that kids today are way more distracted by the bombardment of information reaching them via their tablets and iPhones? A new study out of the National Communication Association wanted to find out whether increased smartphone and social media use in class impacted student learning \u2014 and what they found was that it had both negative and positive effects.\n\nIn the study, researchers analyzed kids who were using phones in class to respond to text messages \u2014 both relevant and irrelevant to the class material. They measured the type of messages and the frequency of them, and found that students who were texting about the material actually scored higher on multiple choice tests about the subject than those who were texting about non-class related things.\n\nTexting As Taking Notes?\n\nOne of the best ways to study and encode information in your brain is to digest and regurgitate that information to someone else. In other words, telling your friends about what you\u2019re studying (in a casual way) helps jog your memory when you\u2019re being tested on the info.\n\nThe researchers of the study thus conclude that texting about class material does something similar to students\u2019 memories. \u201c[S]ending or receiving relevant messages may allow students to engage in similar processes as those that occur during note-taking,\u201d the authors write. Ultimately, communication is a good helper to studying, as long as it remains on topic.\n\nInterestingly, some professors and schools are actually attempting to incorporate texting into their class curriculum, in the hopes of drawing their students in through something they love to do. Texting is, after all, a form of writing \u2014 and past research has shown that \u201ctexting slang\u201d doesn\u2019t always impact a kid\u2019s grammar skills negatively. In fact, it might help them: \u201cEncourage your students to write often \u2014 whether through email, instant messaging, texting, blogging, or another medium \u2014 and recognize that all writing is important,\u201d PowerUp writes on its website. \u201cRecent research has shown that students who regularly use \u2018text speak\u2019 have better word recognition, vocabulary, and phonological awareness.\u201d\n\nIn addition to student learning, texting has also been shown to be helpful in managing mental illness and remembering to take medication properly.\n\nSo there you have it: Either put your phone away and pay attention in class, or text your friends, but do so about the information you\u2019ve just learned. You\u2019ll be more likely to remember it later: just some study tips in the age of information.\n\nSource: Kuznekoff J, Titsworth S.
