While oil prices have made it difficult to gauge inflation, he said the U.S. economy is now arguably \"just a shade\" from full employment, putting the Fed in reach off one of its key goals.\n\nLockhart said he is confident inflation will rise in the coming months as the economy continues to strengthen.\n\n\"Compared to earlier in the year, we know a lot more and can shelve some concerns,\" Lockhart said. \"We are getting closer and closer to what feels like a healed state.\"\n\nRead MoreJobs report keeps Fed on track, September odds rise\n\nSince May, Lockhart has pointed to a likely September rate hike, and his comments have firmed alongside continued strong employment growth. Four of the current 10 voting members of the Fed's policy-setting committee have publicly put September in play - Lockhart, Fed Governor Jerome Powell, San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker.\n\nChicago Fed President Charles Evans is the only committee member to have taken a public stand against a September increase, though others like New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed board member Lael Brainard have cited overseas risks and other issues that they feel could slow the U.S. recovery.\n\nFed Chair Janet Yellen has said she feels a rate hike will be appropriate later this year, without indicating a preference.\n\nRead MoreFed waiting to hike is market's 'biggest fear': Expert\n\nBut Lockhart said on Monday he agreed with Yellen and many others that the rate hike path should be gradual once an initial increase is approved. The Fed's overnight lending rate has been near zero since 2008.\n\nLockhart said rates should rise slowly to nurse the U.S. recovery along.\n\n\"Policy will likely transition from being aggressively stimulative toward merely stimulative,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Economic conditions in the United States have largely returned to normal, a top Fed official said.", "news_keywords": "Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart, economy", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Economic conditions in the United States have largely returned to normal, a top Fed official said.", "title": "Lockhart: Fed 'close' to hiking interest rates", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/10/feds-lockhart.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/25/102535119-169856769.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Economic conditions in the United States have largely returned to normal, a top Fed official said.", "title": "Lockhart: Fed 'close' to hiking interest rates", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/10/feds-lockhart.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/25/102535119-169856769.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "The Fed, The Fed, US Economy, Economy, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-08-10T13:58:31-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "The Fed", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T13:58:54-0400", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 102908131, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "article_summary": "Four of the current 10 voting members of the Fed's policy-setting committee have publicly put September in play - Lockhart, Fed Governor Jerome Powell, San Francisco Fed President John Williams and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker.\nChicago Fed President Charles Evans is the only committee member to have taken a public stand against a September increase, though others like New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed board member Lael Brainard have cited overseas risks and other issues that they feel could slow the U.S. recovery.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen has said she feels a rate hike will be appropriate later this year, without indicating a preference.\nIn his prepared remarks, he made clear he feels the economy has cleared the major hurdles that he saw earlier in the year.\nLockhart said he is confident inflation will rise in the coming months as the economy continues to strengthen."}
