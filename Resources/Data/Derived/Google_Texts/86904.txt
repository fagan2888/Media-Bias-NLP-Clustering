The IRS says the first 1095-B filings are due March 31, 2016.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has decided to let itself phase in implementation of the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) coverage reporting requirement.

CMS will let its Center for Medicare division wait until the 2016 coverage year to send out 1095-B coverage reporting notices to all Medicare enrollees.
