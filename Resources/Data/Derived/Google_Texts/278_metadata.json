The palliative care industry aims to allow terminally ill patients to die at home in a familiar surrounding. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s a morbid, uncomfortable but increasingly necessary conversation nobody wants to have: what should family members do if a loved one is about to die?\n\nBut a new report says those talks often happen too late, a problem which can result in aggressive medical treatments and last-ditch efforts to keep that loved one alive, sometimes against the wishes of the family and the patient.\n\nCalled \"Dying in America: Improving Quality and Honoring Individual Preferences Near End of Life,\" the report, produced by the Institute of Medicine, says that lack of an end-of-life plan, created well in advance, typically leads to prolonged hospitalization, soaring medical bills and unnecessary pain and suffering for everyone.\n\nHowever, the palliative care industry, which encourages home and hospice care for terminally-ill patients, says its form of care for those facing death can help ease the financial and emotional burdens for patients and their families - and help hospitals lower costs.\n\nNinety percent of people say they want to die at home, but most of them don't get the opportunity, says J. Donald Shumacher, president and CEO of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.\n\n\"If you don't let your loved ones know that you don't want to be in the hospital [at the end of your life] then that is where [you] will end up being,\" he says. \"The health care system is set up now in such a way that once you're in the system it's very difficult to stop treatment.\"\n\nThe palliative-care approach, by contrast, typically allows terminally ill patients to die at home, in familiar and nurturing surroundings. The goal is to make someone comfortable, relieve the symptoms and the stress that often come with hospitalization for a grave illness: pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea and problems with sleep.\n\nHospice care, which is care at the end of life, includes elements of palliative care as well as medical, psychological and sometimes spiritual support. Hospice care can occur at home, in a hospice center, at a nursing home or in a hospital.\n\nThe Medicare Hospice Benefit, which covers most hospice care, requires that two doctors verify a patient has less than six months to live. A 2007 Duke University study published in Social Science & Medicine found that hospice care in American reduces Medicare expenditures during the last year of life by an average of $2,309 per hospice patient. In 2012 an estimated 1.5 to 1.6 million patients received hospice services.\n\nCompared to a sterile hospital, \"Home is less of a physical thing and more of an idea,\" says Ellen Goodman, founder of The Conversation Project, a group that helps educated families about end-of-life conversations. \"They want to die around family and at peace.\"\n\nEnd-of-life care has moved up the healthcare agenda because the 77 million-member baby boom generation is rapidly aging. Moreover, the first wave of baby boomers born in 1946 turned 68 this year, prompting questions about costly treatments older Americans tend to need - and whether life for the terminally ill should be medically prolonged, even if if it brings unnecessary suffering.\n\n\n\nDr. Phil Pizzo, co-chair of the IOM committee that authored the report, says conversations on death and dying must be widened and should occur throughout life, not just at the end of it. He believes they should happen at life milestones - when a loved one starts driving, gets married or has a baby - and not just when death is imminent.\n\nMore than a quarter of adults have given little or no thought to their end-of-life wishes, the IOM report found. When people reach the end of their lives, whether from aging, an accident or a severe illness, they may not be emotionally, physically or mentally capable of making their own care decisions, the report states.\n\nAnd it's not just the elderly: a young or middle-aged person could become sick or hurt and end up in a coma, for instance. And, like 70 percent of the population, he or she may not have documented or discussed with family when a ventilator or feeding tube should be removed.\n\n\"The dying process is an inevitability that everyone has to face,\" Shumacher says. \"When nothing more can be done, comfort is better than aggressive therapy.\" Anecdotally, he says, families tell him the biggest regret they have with a terminally ill loved one is not starting hospice care sooner.\n\nGreg Crist, senior vice president for public affairs at the American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes and assisted living facilities, says, \"American families today have far more choices than ever before. Yet if they lack awareness and informed places to turn, they could continue to struggle with these critical, important decisions.\"\n\nThe report recommended that clinicians be trained to have conversations with their patients about dying.\n\nOriginally the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, had included a provision in which Medicare would reimburse doctors for having conversations with patients about end-of-life care. Republicans, however, described the provision as government-mandated \"death panels,\" arguing that it gave bureaucrats the power to determine when and how someone would die.\n\nThe provision was ultimately removed and the health law passed, but some Congress members are looking to reinsert it.\n\nThe IOM report will no doubt support their cause and that of palliative care. Most physicians shy away from these conversations, Goodmans says: \"It's always too soon until it's too late.\"\n\nDoctors, however, may avoid talking about hospice or palliative care because they are afraid patients will think they are giving up on them, says Anita Brikman, senior vice president of communications for NHPCO. But the IOM's Pizzo says doctors are either not taught how to have end-of life conversations or aren't prepared to carry them out.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "picks", "title": "Study: End-Of-Life Plans Are Rare, Driving Up Costs - and Suffering", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Home care for terminally ill, industry says, can ease financial and emotional burdens.", "title": "Study: End-Of-Life Plans Are Rare, Driving Up Costs - and Suffering", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/23/study-end-of-life-plans-are-rare-driving-up-costs-and-suffering", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/fb/bd/74d052b74b699a66c9fc2df608c5/140923-palliative-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Study: End-Of-Life Plans Are Rare, Driving Up Costs - and Suffering", "description": "Home care for terminally ill, industry says, can ease financial and emotional burdens.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 23, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,death,health care,health insurance,Pulse,picks", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Home care for terminally ill, industry says, can ease financial and emotional burdens."}, "article_summary": "Hospice care can occur at home, in a hospice center, at a nursing home or in a hospital.\nThe Medicare Hospice Benefit, which covers most hospice care, requires that two doctors verify a patient has less than six months to live.\nBut the IOM's Pizzo says doctors are either not taught how to have end-of life conversations or aren't prepared to carry them out.\nHospice care, which is care at the end of life, includes elements of palliative care as well as medical, psychological and sometimes spiritual support.\nThe palliative care industry aims to allow terminally ill patients to die at home in a familiar surrounding."}
