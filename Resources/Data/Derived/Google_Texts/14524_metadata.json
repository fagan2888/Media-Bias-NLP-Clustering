The 5 to 4 decision constrained the cynical use of the Voting Rights Act to justify race-based redistricting that minimizes the voting strength of minority voters\u2014a strategy employed by several Southern states in the 2010 redistricting cycle.\n\nThe Court ruled that race predominated in the Alabama legislature\u2019s redistricting of state house and senate districts when it moved black voters into majority-minority districts in order to prevent the percentage of minority voters from declining. Justice Breyer, for the majority, wrote \u201c[t]hat Alabama expressly adopted and applied a policy of prioritizing mechanical racial targets above all other districting criteria (save one-person, one-vote) provides evidence that race motivated the drawing of particular lines in multiple districts in the State.\u201d\n\nThe Court went on to hold that such race-based redistricting must be subjected to strict scrutiny. The central legal principle in determining if such districts meet constitutional muster is the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cSection 5 [of the Voting Rights Act] does not require a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical minority percentage. It requires the jurisdiction to maintain a minority\u2019s ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice.\u201d\n\nNot a single Justice approved, defended, or found justified the Alabama Legislature\u2019s practice of packing black voters to achieve a particular numerical majority in legislative districts.\n\nPlaintiffs in the North Carolina redistricting case have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the redistricting plans drawn in this state, which, they contend, employed two race-based criteria as \u2018safe harbors\u2019 \u2013 a racial proportionality goal for the number of majority-black districts that must be drawn in each plan and a requirement that each district must have greater than 50% black voting age population. \u2018The decision in the Alabama case makes clear that the Voting Rights Act does not require, and the Constitution does not permit, the use of mechanical racial targets in redistricting, as was done in North Carolina\u2019 said Anita Earls, an attorney for some of the Plaintiffs in the North Carolina case.\n\nThe North Carolina case is Dickson v. Rucho, No. 14-839. A case raising similar issues regarding Virginia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District also pending in the Supreme Court, is Cantor v.
