It was very, very difficult on their employees.\u201d\n\nTeamsters said negotiations stopped when the company walked out earlier this week, but Rowe insists the company put a fair deal on the table.\n\nDarigold wants employees to pay up to 10 percent of their health insurance premiums \u2013- almost double what they currently pay.\n\nThe union complains the proposed pay increase doesn\u2019t come close to covering that jump in healthcare costs and would essentially force their members to take a pay cut.\n\nJensen just hopes they can keep working.\n\n\u201cIt seems like everything (is) in motion that hey did 10 years ago,\u201d Jensen said.\n\nRowe said they\u2019ve accomplished a lot in their negotiations with the union, but if they can\u2019t reach a deal soon, the Seattle and Issaquah plants will keep up production only they will do it without union employees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SEATTLE -- Darigold employs thousands of workers throughout Washington State, but now some of them are preparing for a work stoppage if the union and the company can\u2019t agree on a new labor contract.
