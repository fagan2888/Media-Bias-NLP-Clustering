He has been outspoken in his history in a book that he published, wanting single payer universal health care system, and much of the conservative base, they know it, they just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t know. They just don\u2019t care. Trump was, as I understand it \u2014 this dates back to 2000, the year 2000, he\u2019s toying around with the Reform Party ticket. There have been 16, 15 years go by. A lot more is known about it. Trump\u2019s not talking about it now.\n\nBut beyond that, the Republican Party nominated somebody that essentially gave us Obamacare. You know, you can sit there and say, \u201cBut Trump is for single payer!\u201d Well, the Republican Party didn\u2019t stop Obama from doing Obamacare. I mean, what are these people supposed to do? Yeah, in the first term they didn\u2019t have the votes to stop Obama, but then they ran for office in 2010, they ran for office in 2014 promising us that they would use the power of the purse, they would defund it, they would try to repeal it, and every effort they made was phony.\n\nThese people are not stupid. Why continue to invest in a Republican Party which has openly said it\u2019s not gonna stop Obama? You can talk about Trump all you want. It\u2019s not Trump that\u2019s sidling up with the Democrats on amnesty. And if you don\u2019t think that\u2019s the number one issue that\u2019s animating all of this, then you\u2019ve got something really big to learn. That issue pretty much encompasses everything else people are supporting in Trump. It defines the massive change, the rejection of the two party status quo on all of this.\n\nSo at this stage, you know, whether somebody\u2019s conservative or not conservative enough, we\u2019re so far beyond that right now. I\u2019m talking about Trump\u2019s supporters. I\u2019ve got my analyst hat here on, folks. I could be wrong. But this is what fascinates me, trying to understand why people do what they do. My whole career has been devoted to understanding the left and telling you who they are and passing it on to you so you\u2019ll recognize it, be able to stop it. I have said for I don\u2019t know how long, I don\u2019t know how many years I\u2019ve been saying, the single best thing we could do is educate everybody to ideology so they can spot liberalism \u2019cause it\u2019s openly destructive.\n\nWe\u2019re living seven years of the destruction of liberalism, undiluted, concentrated liberal destruction. We don\u2019t have to speak theoretically. We don\u2019t have to issue warnings. All we\u2019ve got to do is explain to people why they can\u2019t get a job, explain to people why open borders are happening, explain to people why the Iranians are getting a nuke, explain to people why 94 million Americans are not working and can\u2019t find a job. There are demonstrative reasons, and you can trace every damn one of them to the Democrat Party and the American left, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, John Kerry, all of them. And we don\u2019t get one syllable of that from the Republican Party.\n\nSo what are these people supposed to do? They understand immigration; it\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s called the law and people are breaking it, and the people breaking it are being rewarded and given things that the people who are not breaking the law are having to pay for. It\u2019s not hard to understand this. \u201cBut Donald Trump, Donald Trump, he wants single payer.\u201d Sorry, we\u2019ve already got it, if you haven\u2019t noticed. We\u2019ve got Obamacare, and we\u2019re heading down that road already. And who gave it to us? Barack Hussein Obama and the Democrats, not Donald Trump. And who didn\u2019t try to singularly stop it or repeal it when they told us they would? GOP. What are people supposed to do?\n\n\u201cWell, Trump\u2019s not a conservative. I don\u2019t know.\u201d They\u2019re not even thinking about that. This is serious stuff to these people. In addition to their livelihood and their careers being destroyed, they\u2019re being blamed for everything because they\u2019re racist. They\u2019re being told they\u2019re bigots. They\u2019re being told they\u2019re sexists. They\u2019re being told that they are the problem. They are being told by the Democrat Party and the American media that they have been the problem since the founding of this country, and they are openly told, \u201cWe\u2019re taking it back from you. We\u2019re taking it away from you.\u201d\n\nAnd so college educations are being perverted with this wacko studies and that wacko studies. This has been, for seven years, a sitting duck of an opponent waiting to be blown to smithereens for all time. American and worldwide liberalism. We\u2019re living it. We don\u2019t have to warn people. We don\u2019t have to say: \u201cif you\u2019re not careful, we\u2019re gonna end up,\u201d \u2019cause it\u2019s happening. So somebody comes along, gonna put the brakes on all of it or seems to, and massive change in direction. It\u2019s not hard to understand this. But if your livelihood depends on \u2014 ah, never mind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Limbaugh: \u2018Undiluted, Concentrated Liberal Destruction\u2019 and GOP Failure to Respond Led to Trump", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Limbaugh: \u2018Undiluted, Concentrated Liberal Destruction\u2019 and GOP Failure to Respond Led to Trump", "title": "Limbaugh: \u2018Undiluted, Concentrated Liberal Destruction\u2019 and GOP Failure to Respond Led to Trump - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 532, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Limbaugh1126.jpg", "height": 399}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/01/22/limbaugh-undiluted-concentrated-liberal-destruction-and-gop-failure-to-respond-led-to-trump/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Limbaugh: \u2018Undiluted, Concentrated Liberal Destruction\u2019 and GOP Failure to Respond Led to Trump", "title": "Limbaugh: \u2018Undiluted, Concentrated Liberal Destruction\u2019 and GOP Failure to Respond Led to Trump - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Limbaugh1126.jpg", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Republican Party, Rush Limbaugh,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Limbaugh", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rush Limbaugh", "published_time": "2016-01-22T15:10:13-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I have said for I don\u2019t know how long, I don\u2019t know how many years I\u2019ve been saying, the single best thing we could do is educate everybody to ideology so they can spot liberalism \u2019cause it\u2019s openly destructive.\nThey\u2019re being told they\u2019re sexists.\nThey\u2019re being told they\u2019re bigots.\nWhy continue to invest in a Republican Party which has openly said it\u2019s not gonna stop Obama?\nBut beyond that, the Republican Party nominated somebody that essentially gave us Obamacare."}
