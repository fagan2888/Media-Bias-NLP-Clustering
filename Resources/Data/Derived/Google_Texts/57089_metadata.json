About 1,000 children were expected to participate this year.\n\nWaukegan resident Marizol Mercado brought her children Noemi Flores, 10, and Yael Flores, 9, to the fair. She was particularly concerned about their dental health.\n\n\"(Cavity) prevention is extremely important,\" Mercado said through an interpreter.\n\nGavyn's mom, Emily Baker, brought Gavyn and his 5-year-old brother, Andy, for exams Wednesday.\n\nBaker said she was disappointed the program has been canceled.\n\n\"It's convenient, especially if you have more than one kid,\" she said.\n\nGavyn's shots weren't so bad. They were done in a matter of seconds, and he laughed off the momentary pain.\n\n\"It was better than last time,\" the incoming Wauconda Middle School sixth-grader said.\n\nThe fair entailed more than injections and dental checks. A podiatric team from Rosalind Franklin University offered foot and shoe assessments, and nutritionists told families about eating healthy.\n\nRepresentatives of local medical providers also were available to talk with parents about getting services under the new health care law.\n\nAdditionally, as families left the school, volunteers offered each child a bag filled with granola bars, crackers, peanuts, an apple and other nutritious items.\n\n\"These are items that they might not be able to buy at a grocery store,\" said Northern Illinois Food Bank staffer Jacqui Hebein, whose employer provided the sacks of snacks. \"Especially the produce.\"\n\nHebein said she hopes some of the nonmedical services offered at the fair will continue in a different form in Lake County.\n\nThe rise in juvenile diabetes and allergies and the proliferation of poor communities without grocery stores -- called food deserts -- indicates a continued need for nutrition education.\n\n\"It's still really important,\" said Hebein, of Ingleside.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 1,000 kids were expected to participate in Lake County's final Kids 1st Health Fair on Wednesday in Waukegan.
