Marco Rubio (R-FL) repeated several times that President Barack Obama\u2019s policies are no accident but instead he knows exactly what he is doing.\n\nSunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Rubio doubled down saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep saying it because it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats are circulating that video from last night, Senator Marco Rubio joins us live right now. What went wrong?\n\nRUBIO: Well, actually, I would pay them to keep running that clip because that\u2019s what I believe passionately. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m not running for reelection to the Senate and I\u2019m running for president. This notion and this idea that somehow, oh, this is an accident \u2014 ObamaCare was not an accident. Dodd-Frank was not an accident. The deal with Iran was not an accident \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But you\u2019re getting pounded for repeating that speech.\n\nRUBIO: Well, look, we raised more money last night in the first hour that debate than any other debate. As far as that message, I hope they keep running it and I\u2019m going to keep saying it because it\u2019s true. Barack Obama \u2014 yes, has he hired incompetent people to implement laws and run agencies? Absolutely. But when it comes to the \u2014 what he\u2019s trying to do to America, it\u2019s part of a plan. He has said he wanted to change the country; he\u2019s doing it in a way that is robbing us of everything that makes us special. I\u2019m going to keep saying that because that not only is it the truth, it is at the core of our \u2014\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But even after Chris Christie called you out for what he called canned speeches, 25-second canned speeches, you repeated again, he says, there you go again. That was not a good moment for you, was it?\n\nRUBIO: It\u2019s what I believe. And it\u2019s what I\u2019m going to continue to say because it happens to be one of the main reasons why I am running. I \u2014 this is the greatest country in the history of mankind because of a certain set of principles. Barack Obama wants us to abandon those principles that he has spent seven years putting in place policies that rip them from us: undermining the Constitution, undermining free enterprise, undermining our standing in the world, weakening America, apologizing for us on the global stage. The reason why I\u2019m running is if we elect someone like that for the next four years, I think it may be too late for American to turn around.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rubio Responds to Repetition Criticism, 'I\u2019m Going To Keep Saying Because It\u2019s True'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rubio Responds to Repetition Criticism, 'I\u2019m Going To Keep Saying Because It\u2019s True'", "title": "Rubio Responds to Repetition Criticism, 'I\u2019m Going To Keep Saying Because It\u2019s True' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/rubio1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/07/marco-rubio-responds-to-repetition-criticism/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rubio Responds to Repetition Criticism, 'I\u2019m Going To Keep Saying Because It\u2019s True'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/rubio1.jpg", "title": "Rubio Responds to Repetition Criticism, 'I\u2019m Going To Keep Saying Because It\u2019s True' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Rubio Responds to Repetition Criticism, 'I\u2019m Going To Keep Saying Because It\u2019s True'", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Marco Rubio", "published_time": "2016-02-07T08:57:18-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m not running for reelection to the Senate and I\u2019m running for president.\nSunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Rubio doubled down saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep saying it because it\u2019s true.\u201dPartial transcript as follows:STEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats are circulating that video from last night, Senator Marco Rubio joins us live right now.\nAs far as that message, I hope they keep running it and I\u2019m going to keep saying it because it\u2019s true.\nAnd it\u2019s what I\u2019m going to continue to say because it happens to be one of the main reasons why I am running.\nThe deal with Iran was not an accident \u2014STEPHANOPOULOS: But you\u2019re getting pounded for repeating that speech."}
