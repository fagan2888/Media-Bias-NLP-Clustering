The meeting is set for 4 PM Monday at the union\u2019s offices in Los Angeles.\n\nMany older career actors who\u2019d been unable to work or to find enough work to qualify for regular SAG health benefits had opted for early retirement \u2013 and reduced pensions \u2013 based on the promise that they\u2019d be eligible to receive the extended self-pay health benefits until they turn 65, when they\u2019d be eligible for Medicare. Now they\u2019re scrambling to find insurance companies that will cover them.\n\nThe health Plan also is jettisoning the spouses and dependent children of these early retirees who died while receiving the extended benefits. Many disabled actors who\u2019d been receiving the extended health benefits also are being dropped from the rolls.\n\nSources say that the Plan\u2019s office has been inundated with phone calls and emails from the affected members and their beneficiaries, and it\u2019s not going over well with some members of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s board of directors, which technically is a separate entity from the SAG Pension & Health Plans.\n\n\u201cI find it unconscionable that the Plan would turn on its seniors like this,\u201d said Los Angeles SAG-AFTRA board member Michael Bell. \u201cThis program was not a contractual mandate, so they have the right to break their promise anytime they want to, and they did. But just because it may be legal doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not patently immoral.\u201d\n\nUntil now, participants and their qualified dependents who were receiving an early retirement or disability pension were eligible to self-pay until they reach age 65, provided they have at least 15 pension credits \u2013 meaning that they\u2019d earned enough in 15 different years to qualify for a SAG pension. Early retirement and disability pensioners with fewer than 15 pension credits who lost earned eligibility were eligible to self-pay for either 18 or 36 months, depending on their years of Health Plan earned eligibility.\n\nThe early retirement self-pay Plan was put into place before Obamacare went into effect, and the Plan now believes that the affected members should be able to find affordable health care on their own.\n\n\u201cFor years the Health Plan\u2019s self-pay coverage provided a much more generous benefit than required under federal COBRA law,\u201d the Plan said in its latest newsletter. \u201cThe Health Plan began offering extended self-pay through its early retiree and extended spousal programs in an effort to give participants and their families a way to bridge the gap between retirement and eligibility for Medicare. \u2026 The benefit also provided a safety net to those with preexisting conditions who might not have been able to buy individual insurance policies. Now that high-quality, affordable coverage is offered to everyone through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, protection is in place for those with pre-existing conditions and this extended coverage safety net is no longer necessary,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always about money,\u201d said a union source, who added that it\u2019s \u201cunfortunate\u201d that so little advance notice was given to the affected members about this \u201cdrastic\u201d move. \u201cThey got blindsided by the short turnaround.\u201d\n\nSaid Bell: \u201cMany of these actors have been aged out of the industry, and rather than protecting them, the Plans are turning on them. All these members, at the very least, should have been grandfathered in and a warning sent out about the change in the Plan to those who are considering early retirement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Deadline", "twitter": {"site": "@Deadline", "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/sagaftralogo1.png", "description": "SAG-AFTRA will host a meeting to discuss cost-cutting plans to dump hundreds of older actors from the SAG Health Plan\u2019s early retirement program.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "SAG Health Plan Officials Set Meeting To Answer Questions About Dumping Hundreds Of Seniors"}, "published_at": "2015-11-18 14:16:10", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://deadline.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0d8531262d92570876b84bba1cbad7f7?s=16", "news_keywords": "SAG AFTRA, SAG Health Plan", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "SAG Health Plan Officials Set Meeting To Answer Questions About Dumping Hundreds Of Seniors", "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/sagaftralogo1.png?w=300", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613", "comment_count": 38, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "topics": "TV", "body": "After being flooded with complaints, SAG-AFTRA will host an informational meeting next week to discuss cost-cutting plans to dump more than 200 older actors from the SAG Health Plan\u2019s early retirement self-pay program on\u00a0January 1.
