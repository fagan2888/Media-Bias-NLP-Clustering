Vinyl sales of the album accounted for 28.9 percent of those first-week sales, nearly beating the 41,000 CDs sold, which accounted for 30 percent. Digital sales still trump both those older formats, though, as 57,000 downloads of the album accounted for 41.1 percent of sales.\n\nThis is obviously a win for Black, who\u2019s managed to make his vinyl appealing to listeners by counting on more than the simple nostalgia factor. The vinyl version of \u201cLazaretto\u201d offers extra features, including hidden tracks, the ability to play the LP at three different speeds, and the possibility to play side A from the inside to the outside of the record. The record also has a hologram.\n\nEven so, big wins when it comes to album sales just aren\u2019t what they used to be: As Rolling Stone concluded, \u201c138,000 is sparse for one of the year\u2019s biggest rock albums.\u201d\n\nTop Reads of The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Jack White\u2019s latest album \u201cLazaretto\u201d broke the record for the largest sales week for a vinyl album, since NielsenSoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.", "title": "Rocker Jack White Takes Vinyl Revival to the Next Level", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/19/Rocker-Jack-White-Takes-Vinyl-Revival-Next-Level", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06192014_Jack_White_Drums.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/19/Rocker-Jack-White-Takes-Vinyl-Revival-Next-Level", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06192014_Jack_White_Drums.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Jack White\u2019s latest album \u201cLazaretto\u201d broke the record for the largest sales week for a vinyl album, since NielsenSoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd753\"", "article_summary": "His latest album \u201cLazaretto\u201d broke the record for the largest first-week sales for a vinyl album since NielsenSoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.\nVinyl sales of the album accounted for 28.9 percent of those first-week sales, nearly beating the 41,000 CDs sold, which accounted for 30 percent.\nWe already know there\u2019s a vinyl revival going on, with new record shops popping up in cities from London to New York, but rocker Jack White, previously of The White Stripes, is taking it to the next level.\nDigital sales still trump both those older formats, though, as 57,000 downloads of the album accounted for 41.1 percent of sales.\nBillboard also noted that the album sold a grand total of 138,000 copies during the week ended June 15."}
