Marco Rubio said that the United States must reform our tax code to keep businesses in the United States.\n\nRubio, speaking at the RedState Gathering along with several other Republican presidential candidates, said that America should be \u201cthe best place in the world to create jobs.\u201d\n\nHe said that taxes should be lowered on \u201call business, especially small businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we want to have a tax code that says the more people you hire, and the more you invest in your company, the less you\u2019ll owe the IRS,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we want a tax code that says if you\u2019re an American company, and you\u2019ve got millions of dollars overseas that you\u2019ve made in another country, we want you to bring that money back and we won\u2019t double tax you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we want tax reform,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cBecause it makes us the best place in the world to create those jobs.\u201d\n\nRubio added that \u201cdevastating\u201d regulations also stifle job creation and entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we want regulatory reform,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cBecause we know that the more regulations, the less innovation. The more regulations there are, the harder it is for someone to start a new business out of the spare bedroom in their home.\u201d\n\nRubio said that in order to foster job growth \u201cwe have to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cReplace it with a system that empowers the individual,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cReplace it with a system that says from now on, every American will be able to use tax-free money \u2013 whether it\u2019s a tax credit, or your own money or money your employer gives you \u2013 and you will be able to use it to buy health insurance across state lines, of the kind you want, from any company in America that will sell it to you.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the federal budget must be balanced.\n\nHe called the federal deficit \u201cthe most predictable crisis in American history.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Sen.
