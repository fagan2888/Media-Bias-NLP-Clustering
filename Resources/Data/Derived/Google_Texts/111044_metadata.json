Chenoweth and Holly's Ryan Nordyke took to the mats on Saturday night at the Pepsi Center in their quest for a state championship and the gold medal that goes along with it.\n\nNordyke already had one state championship under his belt after winning the 138-pound title last year as a junior.\n\nChenoweth, a senior, was hoping to cap his career on top of the podium but had his work cut out for him against a formidable opponent in undefeated junior Bob Piper of Paonia.\n\nPipher won the 132-pound state title last year beating Chance Randolph of Dove Creek by a 6-3 decision.\n\nIronically, Randolph was the wrestler that Chenoweth beat in the championship semifinals on Thursday night by a 7-3 decision to advance to the finals.\n\nIn the 138-pound final, Chenoweth fell by a pin in 1:47 as Pipher capped his senior season with a perfect 47-0 record.\n\nChenoweth finished his senior year with a 34-6 record.\n\nIn the 145-pound championship, Nordyke (28-2) faced senior Anthony Watt of Meeker (30-9).\n\nThe match was tied at 2-2 when Nordyke scored a reverse near the end of the first quarter.\n\nHolly's Ryan Nordyke celebrates his pin in 4:19 over senior Anthony Watt of Meeker in their Class 2A 145-pound state championship match in the 2015 Colorado State Wrestling Championships on Saturday night at the Pepsi Center.

(Rhonda Uhland/Courtesy photo)\n\nIn the second period, Nordyke chose the top position and was able to ride out Watt as the match was still deadlocked at 2-all.\n\nWatts then chose the top position to start the third period.\n\nNordyke went to work and scored a reverse and then put Watt on his back to register two near fall points for a 6-2 lead. Then the Holly wrestler registered a pin in 4:19 to lock up his second state championship.\n\nIn the Region 2 Tournament just last week, Nordyke was beaten by senior Blake Denton of Swink by a 1-0 decision for the regional championship.\n\nThe match featured a showdown of defending state champions.\n\nIn a twist of events, Denton stumbled in the state quarterfinals on Thursday night when he was pinned by Watt in 4:30.\n\nFor Nordyke, this was a season where he had to deal with several injuries that kept him off the mat for parts of the season.\n\nHe's been competing with a torn ACL in his right leg that he sustained in December but pushed through the pain.\n\nNow with his journey complete, Nordyke will have surgery on his knee in March and will get a chance to rest on his laurels.\n\nIn the Class 2A team race, Rocky Ford won the champions to end a three-year reign by Paonia.\n\nIt came down to the last match for Rocky Ford to determine the team championship.\n\nSenior Nate Finnell had the weight of his entire team on his shoulders.\n\nFinnell came into the 220-pound title match with the Meloneers trailing Meeker in the standings by one point.\n\nA victory would send Rocky Ford to its first championship in 25 years \u2013 a loss would hand the Cowboys the title.\n\nFinnell came through with a 4-2 decision and a state title for the Meloners \u2013 the first since the AA crown in 1990.\n\nRocky Ford finished the three-day tournament with 134 points and two individual champions.\n\nMeeker placed second with 131 points, followed by Paonia (125.5), Centauri (109.5) and Norwood/Nucla (98).\n\nFinnell and sophomore Jacob Rodriguez claimed their first state titles for the Meloneers.\n\nRodriguez won the 106-pound title with a 5-3 decision over Akron's Tanner Watson.\n\nFinnell competed for 195 state title last year but lost by a 7-3 decision to Johnny Loflin of Baca County.\n\nIn all, it was a record-setting night in the 2A ranks.\n\nPaonia's Jesse Reed became the 18th Colorado wrestler to win four state titles with a victory at 126 pounds.\n\nEagles junior Bo Pipher (138 pounds) and senior Zach Milner (160) each took home a second consecutive title.\n\nMeeker junior T.J. Shelton and Centauri senior Jareb Aziz joined the three-time state champion club.\n\nShelton pinned Centennial's Jose Cisneros in 50 seconds to claim the 170-pound crown and set himself up for a shot at a fourth title next season.\n\nSwink senior Austin Coy capped a prep career that saw four trips to the state finals finally end with his first championship.\n\nCoy withstood a late reversal for a 3-2 decision at 132 over Highland's Jake Trujillo, who almost took it home with a near fall before time ran out.\n\nTrujillo lost his bid for the 120 state title last year when he lost by a 7-6 decision to Stetson Loader of Baca County.\n\nBuena Vista junior Keegan Wentz landed the 182 title. He lost in the finals a year ago to Aziz of Centauri by an 8-3 decision.\n\nCrowley County senior Bryce McCracken posted a 4-1 decision at 152 over Meeker's Casey Turner, and Limon junior Jayden Hilferty also earned his first state title with a 3-1 victory over Crowley County's Keith Dunnagan in double overtime at heavyweight.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-02-22T08:55:57-0700", "modificationDate": "2015-02-22T14:47:47-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site27/2015/0222/20150222_024653_Ryan Nordyke works on_300.jpg", "endDate": "2016-02-22T08:55:57-0700", "description": "Holly's Ryan Nordkye wins second state championship to cap his career", "ag": {"canon": "LamarLedger:article:27576275:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site27/2015/0222/20150222_024653_Ryan Nordyke works on.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Holly's Ryan Nordkye wins second state championship to cap his career", "title": "Holly's Ryan Nordkye  wins second state championship to cap his career"}, "twitter": {"domain": "lamarledger.com", "description": "Holly's Ryan Nordkye wins second state championship to cap his career", "title": "Holly's Ryan Nordkye  wins second state championship to cap his career", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site27/2015/0222/20150222_024653_Ryan Nordyke works on.jpg", "site": "@LamarLedger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-22T08:55:57-0700", "sailthru.site": "lamarledger.com", "sailthru.title": "Holly's Ryan Nordkye  wins second state championship to cap his career", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "dwZWaDbhMYUksDm0K7xt1mgbsv6lfVAKuKocpuLcmuY", "verify-v1": "gkZxF5Rqz6RCli51oGpeRilrAJVc08sr0KkWNUI4ESY=", "y_key": "e5e4de4bfee0070f", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site27/2015/0222/20150222_024653_Ryan Nordyke works on.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-02-22T09:04:10-0700", "news_keywords": "Lamar, Colorado, news, world, national, local, business, sports, entertainment, US, Lamar Ledger"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a2d\"", "article_summary": "Then the Holly wrestler registered a pin in 4:19 to lock up his second state championship.\nThe Holly senior captured his second state title after he won the 138-pound title in 2014.\nThe Holly senior registered a pin in 4:19 to capture his second state title.\nNordyke already had one state championship under his belt after winning the 138-pound title last year as a junior.\nPipher won the 132-pound state title last year beating Chance Randolph of Dove Creek by a 6-3 decision."}
