× Six states, including Wisconsin, sue Obama administration over Affordable Care Act

MADISON— Six states have filed a new lawsuit against the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act.

The complaint that Texas, Wisconsin, Kansas, Louisiana, Indiana and Nebraska filed Wednesday in the Northern District of Texas takes issue with the Health Insurance Providers Fee assessed to health insurers to cover federal subsidies.

The lawsuit says nothing in the Affordable Care Act’s language provided clear notice that states would have to pay the fee.

The suit seeks an injunction against the federal rules that say states are responsible for the fee. It also asks for states to be refunded for what they’ve already paid.

The suit says the fee is projected to allow the federal government to collect between $13 billion and $15 billion from states over the next decade.
