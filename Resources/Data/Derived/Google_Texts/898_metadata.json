He leads the Predators, and all NHL rookies, with 40 points. He\u2019s also first among rookies with a plus-24 rating, which is third-best in the league.\n\nBackground: From Ostervala, Sweden, Forsberg was selected No. 11 by the Washington Capitals in the 2012 draft, with the pick the Caps acquired from the Avalanche in the Semyon Varlamov trade. In a 2013 trade-deadline move that general manager George McPhee felt would bolster Washington\u2019s playoff run, the Caps sent Forsberg to Nashville for Martin Erat and minor-leaguer Michael Latta. In hindsight, the trade might have cost McPhee his job, and the Predators ridded themselves of a 31-year-old veteran making $4.5 million for one of the world\u2019s top young prospects.\n\nChambers\u2019 take: Forsberg is not related to Peter Forsberg, the Hall of Famer and former Avalanche star, but they are similar in that both were traded by the NHL team that drafted them, and that team will never hear the end of it. The Flyers traded Peter to the Quebec Nordiques in the Eric Lindros deal. Filip was traded for a guy who is 33 and playing out what likely will be the final year of his last NHL contract.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Spotlight on Filip Forsberg, a forward for the Nashville Predators.", "title": "Filip Forsberg: Spotlight on the Nashville Predators forward", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/01/25/filip-forsberg-spotlight-nashville-predators-forward/20680/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Spotlight on Filip Forsberg, a forward for the Nashville Predators.", "creator": "@mikechambers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/01/25/filip-forsberg-spotlight-nashville-predators-forward/20680/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "title": "Filip Forsberg: Spotlight on the Nashville Predators forward", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "All-Star Game,Eric Lindros,Filip Forsberg,Hall of Fame,Nashville Predators,Peter Forsberg,Quebec Nordiques,Semyon Varlamov,Washington Capitals", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Spotlight on Filip Forsberg, a forward for the Nashville Predators."}, "article_summary": "He leads the Predators, and all NHL rookies, with 40 points.\nThe Flyers traded Peter to the Quebec Nordiques in the Eric Lindros deal.\nSpotlight on \u2026 Filip Forsberg, F, PredatorsWhen: The Avalanche\u2019s next two games are against Forsberg and the Predators, beginning Tuesday in Nashville, Tenn.What\u2019s up: Forsberg, 20, will be the only rookie playing Sunday in the NHL All-Star Game in Columbus, Ohio.\nIn a 2013 trade-deadline move that general manager George McPhee felt would bolster Washington\u2019s playoff run, the Caps sent Forsberg to Nashville for Martin Erat and minor-leaguer Michael Latta.\nFilip was traded for a guy who is 33 and playing out what likely will be the final year of his last NHL contract."}
