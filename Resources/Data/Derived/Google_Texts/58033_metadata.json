Gene Beresin and Steve Schlozman\n\nThere\u2019s this guy, Sisyphus.\n\nI feel like he invented the New Year\u2019s resolution.\n\nYou know Sisyphus \u2014 he\u2019s the guy who works so hard to push that stupid boulder up the hill, only to have it roll down again at the end of his hard work. You\u2019d think he (and we) would have learned after all these years, but there he is, at the bottom of the hill, trying again and again.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot like so many of us. \u201cToday,\u201d you may be saying with resolve, \u201cwill be different.\u201d \u201cToday I will get that boulder to the top of the hill.\u201d Or: \u201cThis year I\u2019ll lose weight. Drink less. Exercise more.\u201d Fill in the blank.\n\nBut how many times do we fail in these New Year\u2019s resolutions?\n\nResearchers note that New Year\u2019s resolutions are typically grounded in motivations to change our perceived vices: our addictions, our \u201cbad\u201d behaviors, our so-called \u201cdestructive flaws.\u201d We know what\u2019s good for us, we just can\u2019t get it right.\n\nLuckily for us, we do a little better than Sisyphus. It turns out that almost half of us succeed in our goals. We don\u2019t hear about those successes so much but it\u2019s true: We manage to keep about 50 percent of our self-improvement mandates. Of course that means that about 50 percent of the time we lose our momentum before the year is over. Hence, those same darn resolutions return to us each December.\n\nThis exercise in at least partial futility begs a fundamental question: Why is \u201cbad\u201d behavior so hard to change? We try to raise our kids to correct misbehavior; why can\u2019t we do it ourselves?\n\nThis query is, understandably, the focus of a lot of research. We harbor false or exaggerated predictions. We assume (and we all know the dangers of assumptions) that change will be easier this year, or more predictable this year, or that we\u2019ll somehow have changed enough that the resolution will finally be within our grasp.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, though, and it\u2019s an important one: We truly believe that we\u2019ll succeed. We\u2019re not actively lying to ourselves.\n\nPsychologists Janet Polivy and Peter Herman call this a \u201cfalse-hope syndrome,\u201d an exaggeration of our expectations for change, inevitably followed by the forlorn shutting down of our previously high aspirations.\n\nBut there is controversy as well. John Norcross and his associates suggest that the process of making a resolution is perhaps the most important step in behavioral change. Sprinkle this process with some select and admirable behavioral traits \u2014 self-efficacy, maintaining a course of action and readiness to change \u2014 and we stand a good chance of achieving our goals.\n\nTypically, he notes, we meet these goals through positive reinforcement from others, and avoidance of past behaviors.\n\nBeing human is hard, though. Avoiding past behaviors is like learning to swim. It doesn\u2019t really come naturally to anyone, though some of us are quicker to learn than others.\n\nSo, how about we look at resolutions in an entirely different way? What if we take note of our already-achieved positive traits, and focus on making them better? This seems a more productive recipe for success than our yearly tendencies towards self-flagellation.\n\nTry these resolutions on for size, and see if they fit:\n\n\u201cI will take greater pleasure in my partner, children, parents and friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will increase my caring of and sensitivity toward others.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will further my dedication to social and individual justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will emphasize my gratitude for the blessings in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201c I will celebrate the times that I make a positive difference in my life and in the lives of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will spend more time and energy on the things that make me happy.\u201d\n\nWe all have positive attitudes and activities that promote our health and well-being, and that foster the same in others. Positive thinking enhances relationships. Optimism promotes resilience. We have within us the capacity for creative thinking and personal fulfillment; these processes are hardwired into one big anti-Sisyphean feedback loop. Positive emotions promote positive thinking, and vice versa.\n\nThis is, of course, easier said than done. It can be a trap to resolve that we must simply work harder to think positively. Lots of the time, that approach by itself allows Sisyphus to win.\n\nLook: These are scary times. But perhaps this time around, New Year\u2019s resolutions can emerge from a reflection on the year gone by, and a sincere desire to make things better for ourselves and others.\n\nThis year, let\u2019s focus on the brightness within us. Let\u2019s resolve to enhance and build on what is good, fair and admirable.\n\nAt the end of the day, we\u2019re much more likely to approach something positive than we are to walk away from something negative. We see this all the time as parents. Let\u2019s parent ourselves this year.\n\nDr. Gene Beresin is executive director of The MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
