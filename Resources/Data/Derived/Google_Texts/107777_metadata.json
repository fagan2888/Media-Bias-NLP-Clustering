Hartford bought The Penny Post in 1886 and changed its name to the Portsmouth Herald. Hartford and his descendants published the Herald for 82 years, selling to Thompson Newspapers of Canada in 1968. Dow Jones\u2019 Ottaway Newspapers, which already owned The Exeter News-Letter and The Hampton Union, bought the daily paper from Thomson in 1997 and created a new company, Seacoast Newspapers.\n\nIn 2001, Seacoast Newspapers added the York County Coast Star and The York Weekly to its portfolio of publications. Recognizing the growing importance of digital publishing, Seacoast Newspapers became Seacoast Media Group in 2002. The company was bought by News Corp. in 2007, as part of its acquisition of Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Star got its start in 1876 in Biddeford as The Daily Evening Star. It moved to Kennebunk in 1878, and was re-named the Kennebunk Star in 1921. The paper was finally christened the York County Coast Star in 1965.\n\nOver that time, the Star has had 10 owners.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be a part of a company that understands the importance of strong community newspapers,\u201d said Star Editor Laura Dolce. \u201cAs an award-winning community newspaper with a 137-year history, we have seen many changes in ownership over the years, yet our commitment to strong local journalism has not changed. We plan to continue to do what we have always done at the Star: tell the stories of our communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "News Corp., parent company of Seacoast Media Group and the York County Coast Star, announced Tuesday that it has sold the Dow Jones Local Media Group \u2014 which operates 33 publications, including eight daily and 15 weekly newspapers, in seven states \u2014 to an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group.Fortress Investment [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "News Corp., parent company of Seacoast Media Group and the York County Coast Star, announced Tuesday that it has sold the Dow Jones Local Media Group \u2014 which operates 33 publications, including eight daily and 15 weekly newspapers, in seven states \u2014 to an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group.
