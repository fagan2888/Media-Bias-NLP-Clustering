Employers complain that colleges are not producing graduates who can solve problems and connect the dots on complex issues, but bosses stumble when pressed to describe exactly what skills make critical thinkers. That leaves job seekers wondering what employers really want and, once on the job, unsure of whether they\u2019re supposed to follow the rules or break them.\n\nMentions of critical thinking in job postings have doubled since 2009, according to an analysis by career-search site Indeed.com. The site, which combs job ads from several sources, found last week that more than 21,000 health-care and 6,700 management postings contained some reference to the skill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those words\u2014like diversity was, like big data is\u2014where everyone talks about it but there are 50 different ways to define it,\u201d says Dan Black, Americas director of recruiting at the accounting firm and consultancy EY.\n\nSome Definitions of Critical Thinking \u201cThe ability to cross-examine evidence and logical argument. To sift through all the noise.\u201d\n\n-Richard Arum, New York University sociology professor\n\n-Richard Arum, New York University sociology professor \u201cThinking about your thinking, while you\u2019re thinking, in order to improve your thinking.\u201d\n\n- Linda Elder , educational psychologist; president, Foundation for Critical Thinking\n\n- , educational psychologist; president, Foundation for Critical Thinking \u201cDo they make use of information that\u2019s available in their journey to arrive at a conclusion or decision? How do they make use of that?\u201d\n\n- Michael Desmarais , global head of recruiting, Goldman Sachs Group\n\nBrittany Holloway, a music-business major who graduated last spring from New York University, says critical thinking appeared in so many postings during her job search that it, along with traits like \u201cdetail-oriented\u201d and \u201corganized,\u201d was nearly meaningless. Only in interviews could she tell what a company meant when it sought those traits.\n\nMs. Holloway, who now works as a content-review and fraud specialist at Brooklyn-based digital-music distributor TuneCore, defines the skill as \u201cforming your own opinion from a variety of different sources.\u201d\n\nMs. Holloway, 21 years old, says her current job requires her to think critically when screening music releases before they\u2019re sent to digital stores like Apple Inc.\u2019s iTunes.\n\nBehavioral interview prompts, such as \u201cTalk about how you handled working with a difficult person,\u201d help EY bosses assess critical-thinking skills, says Mr. Black. (His definition: \u201cThe ability to work with data, to accumulate it, analyze it [and] synthesize it, in order to make balanced assessments and smart decisions.\u201d)\n\nIn late-round interviews, candidates must show how they would tackle business problems, such as whether it makes more sense for a company to make or buy a product, and why.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. GS 2.32 % asks investment-banking and sales-and-trading candidates to assess company valuations and stock pitches and then to explain how they arrived at their conclusions.\n\nBy the end of one of those exercises, \u201cthe candidates should have displayed whether they possess critical thinking,\u201d says Michael Desmarais, global head of recruiting for the bank.\n\nCritical thinking may be similar to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart\u2019s famous threshold for obscenity: You know it when you see it, says Jerry Houser, associate dean and director of career services at Willamette University in Salem, Ore.\n\nWhen recruiters tell Mr. Houser they want students with problem-solving skills, \u201cthat usually has something to do with critical thinking,\u201d he says. His office encourages students to prepare stories to illustrate their critical-thinking prowess, detailing, for example, the steps a club president took to improve attendance at weekly meetings.\n\nColleges\u2019 capacity to mold thinkers has been a topic of heated debate. Richard Arum, co-author of \u201cAcademically Adrift\u201d and \u201cAspiring Adults Adrift\u201d as well as an NYU sociology professor, is a prominent critic of how schools are faring on that front.\n\n\u201cSchools have institutionally supported and encouraged [a] retreat from academic standards and rigor,\u201d he says, adding that he thinks colleges have allowed students to focus on their social lives at the expense of academic pursuits.\n\nAccording to research detailed in those books, students rarely study on their own for more than an hour a day, and most don\u2019t write in-depth papers that require sustained analysis.\n\nFor their part, students seem to think they are ready for the office. But their future bosses tend to disagree. A Harris Interactive survey of 2,001 U.S. college students and 1,000 hiring managers last fall found that 69% of students felt they were \u201cvery or completely prepared\u201d for problem-solving tasks in the workplace, while fewer than half of the employers agreed.\n\nJudy Nagengast, CEO of Continental Inc., an Anderson, Ind., staffing firm, says she has come across young graduates who \u201ccan memorize and they can regurgitate\u201d but who struggle to turn book learning into problem solving at work.\n\nMs. Nagengast says she grew frustrated with young accountants who didn\u2019t understand the importance of accuracy on tax forms and filed \u201cB-minus financial statements.\u201d She wants and needs to recruit young workers, though, and she is testing the waters with a fresh graduate who\u2019s handling the firm\u2019s compliance with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLinda Elder, an educational psychologist and the president of the Foundation for Critical Thinking, which promotes educational reform, says employers really want well-trained problem solvers and not critical thinkers, especially in the lower ranks. Critical thinkers, she says, tend to challenge the status quo, which isn\u2019t always what a boss is after.\n\nAt Goldman, \u201cwe don\u2019t expect new hires to propose changes to our chairman or board on a firm-wide strategy level on Day One,\u201d says Mr. Desmarais. But the bank\u2019s entry-level hires are expected to do more than just fulfill orders, he adds. \u201cWe do encourage our junior people to recommend changes.\u201d\n\nWrite to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-10-21T20:35:00.000Z", "article.section": "Careers", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Critical thinking is a critical skill for young workers these days, but what bosses mean by that and how to measure it is less clear.", "creator": "@melissakorn", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CQ192A_CRITI_G_20141021171917.jpg", "alt": "Bosses seek to hire \u2018critical thinkers,\u2019 but what does that mean they want?", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CQ192A_CRITI_D_20141021171917.jpg"}, "title": "Bosses Seek \u2018Critical Thinking,\u2019 but What Is That?", "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB12483389912594473586204580228373641221834&headline=Bosses%20seek%20to%20hire%20%u2018critical%20thinkers%2C%u2019%20but%20what%20does%20that%20mean%20they%20want%3F&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB12483389912594473586204580228373641221834"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "Holloway%2C%20Brittany,Desmarais%2C%20Michael,political,general news,society,community,work,career planning,general labor issues,banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities", "news_keywords": "Holloway%2C%20Brittany,Desmarais%2C%20Michael,political,general news,society,community,work,career planning,general labor issues,banking", "article.headline": "Bosses seek to hire \u2018critical thinkers,\u2019 but what does that mean they want?", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CQ192A_CRITI_E_20141021171917.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CQ192A_CRITI_D_20141021171917.jpg"}}, "description": "Critical thinking is a critical skill for young workers these days, but what bosses mean by that and how to measure it is less clear.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB12483389912594473586204580228373641221834&headline=Bosses%20seek%20to%20hire%20%u2018critical%20thinkers%2C%u2019%20but%20what%20does%20that%20mean%20they%20want%3F&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB12483389912594473586204580228373641221834", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "News", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "Critical thinking is a critical skill for young workers these days, but what bosses mean by that and how to measure it is less clear.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-21T20:35:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-f977", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/melissashirakorn", "embed_count": 2, "word_count": 862, "internal_link_count": 2, "image_count": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Critical thinking is a critical skill for young workers these days, but what bosses mean by that and how to measure it is less clear.", "title": "Bosses Seek \u2018Critical Thinking,\u2019 but What Is That?", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bosses-seek-critical-thinking-but-what-is-that-1413923730", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CQ192A_CRITI_G_20141021171917.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Melissa Korn", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Bosses Seek \u2018Critical Thinking,\u2019 but What Is That?", "article.type": "Careers", "article.id": "SB12483389912594473586204580228373641221834", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-21T20:35:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf90\"", "article_summary": "To sift through all the noise.\u201d-Richard Arum, New York University sociology professor-Richard Arum, New York University sociology professor \u201cThinking about your thinking, while you\u2019re thinking, in order to improve your thinking.\u201d- Linda Elder , educational psychologist;
