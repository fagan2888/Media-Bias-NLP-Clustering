And then go ahead and take another deep breath, because overreactions do nothing but cause trouble.\n\nAfter the Sooners\u2019 Red River Rivalry loss to Texas on Saturday, our News 9 social media accounts were flooded with steaming hot OU fans that were in shock after the debacle they\u2019d just witnessed.\n\n\u201cBob Stoops once again can't get the job done against a lesser team. Welcome to another 3 to 4 loss season\u201d said William Marsh on the comment section of the post-game recap.\n\nMarsh was just one of many frustrated fans. Michael F Kirk got straight to the point in his assessment of the OU loss.\n\n\u201cStoops reign has been over for years, time for a new head coach. This is a blow out noone was expecting.. First time i didnt bet on the game and thank god i didnt.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember these comments came immediately after the OU loss, and the wounds were still fresh, but firing Stoops definitely isn\u2019t the fix to Oklahoma\u2019s current problem.\n\nThe Sooners were beat on Saturday because they were outplayed, but let me remind you that Bob Stoops didn\u2019t play a single snap. I know the coach is responsible for getting his guys ready to play, but one could argue that if Alex Ross doesn\u2019t fumble a first quarter kick return, than the entire trajectory of the game could\u2019ve been different. And if you\u2019re pointing the finger at Stoops, then you should be shining a spotlight at the OU offensive line.\n\nNo team I ever played on needed coaches to get us fired up to play Texas. At some point the responsibility lies w/in the team & leaders. #OU \u2014 Dean Blevins (@DeanBlevins) October 12, 2015\n\nWe could talk \u201cwhat ifs\u201d all day, so let\u2019s go ahead and look at the facts.\n\nStoops is the winningest coach in Oklahoma history with a 172-45 overall record, and has won more games in his first 16 years than any other coach at the collegiate level. He\u2019s led OU to the second highest winning percentage of any Power Five program since 1999.\n\n\u201cBig Game Bob\u201d has won eight Big 12 championships, more than twice as many as any other school, and he didn\u2019t get that nickname for nothing. Stoops has led OU to more wins against AP Top 25 teams than any other Big 12 team over the last five years (15-11). Oh, and did I mention he\u2019s talked the talk and walked the walk against SEC opponents?\n\nAlso, elite coaches come at a premium these days, and they definitely don\u2019t grow on trees. Legendary programs such as USC, Texas, Nebraska and Florida have had trouble finding a coach that can set the ship straight and bring their program back to prominence.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be upset about a loss, especially to a rival, but it\u2019s important to sit back and look at the big picture before fans overreact and wish for something that could hurt the program even more.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Some OU fans were angry with Stoops after the loss to Texas, but let's\u00a0pump the brakes with\u00a0the overreactions.", "author": "Brett Coppenbarger", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30263969/firing-stoops-is-not-the-answer", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9018983_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some OU fans were angry with Stoops after the loss to Texas, but let's\u00a0pump the brakes with\u00a0the overreactions.", "title": "Firing Stoops Is Not The Answer"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9018983_G.jpg", "description": "Some OU fans were angry with Stoops after the loss to Texas, but let's\u00a0pump the brakes with\u00a0the overreactions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Firing Stoops Is Not The Answer"}, "wnreadableurl": "firing-stoops-is-not-the-answer", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/10/14", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,ou,sooners,bob stoops,fire,football,texas,ut", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS21", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,ou,sooners,bob stoops,fire,football,texas,ut"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2996\"", "article_summary": "Michael F Kirk got straight to the point in his assessment of the OU loss.\nNo team I ever played on needed coaches to get us fired up to play Texas.\nThe Sooners were beat on Saturday because they were outplayed, but let me remind you that Bob Stoops didn\u2019t play a single snap.\nAnd if you\u2019re pointing the finger at Stoops, then you should be shining a spotlight at the OU offensive line.\n\u201cBob Stoops once again can't get the job done against a lesser team."}
