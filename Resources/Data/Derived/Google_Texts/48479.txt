WASHINGTON (AP) — Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill says she has breast cancer.

The Democratic senator said in a blog post Monday that the cancer was detected through a regular mammogram and she will be in St. Louis for the next three weeks receiving treatment. She said “it’s a little scary” but her prognosis is good and she expects a full recovery.
