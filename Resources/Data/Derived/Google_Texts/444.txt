Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has revealed another celebrity impression in his repertoire, reenacting a scene from Rob Reiner’s 1987 classic “The Princess Bride” while in New Hampshire Thursday.

“One of my favorite scenes is when Westley, the Dread Pirate Roberts, is brought in to Billy Crystal, and he’s dead. And Billy Crystal says ‘Ah, he’s only mostly dead,’” the Texas senator said while filming a “Candidate Cafe” segment with WMUR-TV, Mediaite reported.

Mr. Cruz acted out the famous scene where Billy Crystal explains that true love “is the greatest thing in the world, except for a nice MLT — mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich.”

The roomful of journalists applauded following the impression.

“My media team is now having a heart attack,” Mr. Cruz joked.

Mr. Cruz is no stranger to showing off his impersonations. In June, he unveiled his Mr. Burns and Ned Flanders impressions from “The Simpsons.” And in 2014, the senator gave a Winston Churchill impersonation while receiving his Claremont Institute’s Winston Churchill Award, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
