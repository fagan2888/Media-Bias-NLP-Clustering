That hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nTomasky was addressing a rhetorical and political problem: Democrats\u2019 failure \u201cto mount a stronger case\u201d for activist government. One the eve of the 2014 midterm elections, however, the failure to vindicate activist government is more basic. The problem is what Democrats, especially those in the Obama administration, are doing, rather than what they are or are not saying.\n\nAs recently as June 2013, more Americans approved than disapproved of\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s job performance, according to the Real Clear Politics average of the major polls on the question. But by December of last year he was more than 15 percentage points \u201cunder water,\u201d with disapproval ratings above 55% and approval ratings just over 40%. It has now been more than a year since Obama\u2019s disapproval number was less than 50% at any time, or his approval rating above 45%. With less than two weeks until Election Day, the average is 41.4% approve and 53.6% disapprove.\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Restoring trust in government and proving it could solve problems has been undermined by one fiasco after another. First, and most\n\nconsequentially, was the dysfunctional healthcare.gov website\u2019s debut, which\n\nled to the resignation of Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen\n\nSebelius. It seemed beyond belief that the Obama administration, given three years to prepare for the launch of its most important domestic program,\n\nwould be so inept. Along with the incompetence was the dissembling:\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s repeated assurances that if you liked your health plan you\n\ncould keep it also turned out to be beyond belief.\n\n\n\nAny hopes that Obamacare was an outlier was dashed by subsequent debacles.\n\nSubstandard care and dishonest reporting at Veterans Health Administration\n\nhospitals forced the resignation of Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki. News stories about an armed civilian riding an elevator with the president, and another running across the White House lawn and through its unlocked doors brought about the resignation of Secret Service director Julia Pierson.\n\n\n\nNow comes the Ebola virus, and another shaky performance by Team Obama. Last month the president said that \u201cin the unlikely event that someone with Ebola\n\ndoes reach our shores, we\u2019ve taken new measures so that we\u2019re prepared here\n\nat home.\u201d But the unlikely event occurred, and it shortly proved that we were unprepared despite any new measures.\n\nDr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control, has not yet\n\nbeen forced to resign. But he manages to sound alarming when speaking\n\ncautiously about Ebola: \u201cThere will not be a large outbreak here barring a\n\nmutation,\u201d he told a congressional committee last week.\n\n\n\nFrieden also sounds alarming (and incoherent) when speaking incautiously\n\nabout it. At a press conference he was asked about the president\u2019s statement\n\nthat Ebola cannot be contracted \u201cthrough casual contact, like sitting next to someone on a bus.\u201d By way of clarification, Frieden said that a \u201cmember\n\nof the traveling public\u201d should not be worried that he might have gotten Ebola by \u201csitting next to someone.\u201d On the other hand, if you think you might have Ebola you should not get on a bus because, \u201cYou might become ill, you might have a problem that exposes someone around you.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2006, as the George W. Bush administration was lurching toward\n\nrepudiation in the midterm elections, political scientist Alan Wolfe blamed\n\nconservatism itself for Bush\u2019s failures. His widely discussed essay, \u201cWhy\n\nConservatives Can\u2019t Govern,\u201d argued that conservatives fail at governance\n\nbecause they are in \u201cthe awkward position of managing government agencies\n\nwhose missions\u2014indeed, whose very existence\u2014they believe to be\n\nillegitimate.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis argument, whether sound or dubious, does invite us to generalize from\n\nObama\u2019s failures to the broader liberal project. In the wake of the\n\nObamacare\u2019s website belly flop, columnist E.J. Dionne wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s a\n\nlesson here that liberals apparently need to learn over and over: Good\n\nintentions without proper administration can undermine even the most noble\n\nof goals.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow is it possible that grownups, ostensibly dedicated to the proposition\n\nthat government can solve problems, must learn such an elementary lesson\n\nover and over? One explanation for this anomaly is that liberals are,\n\nregarding any social ill, adamant that government do something, but\n\nunconcerned about whether it accomplishes anything.\n\nNoble goals remain noble whether they\u2019re attained or not. And liberals can easily demonstrate their own nobility by demanding new programs and bigger budgets, as opposed to the hard work of making sure existing programs are effective, or are abandoned if they can\u2019t be made effective. If, as Georges Clemenceau said, war is too important to be entrusted to soldiers, the Obama administration may end up demonstrating that social problems are too important to be remedied by\n\nliberals.\n\n\n\nWilliam Voegeli, a senior editor of the Claremont Review of Books, is author\n\nof \u201cThe Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against Liberal Compassion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The failures of activist government are destroying liberalism.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The failures of activist government are destroying liberalism.", "title": "VOEGELI: Why liberals can\u2019t govern", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/27/voegeli-why-liberals-cant-govern/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/24/8425e9dfd6417129630f6a7067000615.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/24/8425e9dfd6417129630f6a7067000615.jpg", "description": "The failures of activist government are destroying liberalism.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "VOEGELI: Why liberals can\u2019t govern"}, "Author": "William Voegeli", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7e2\"", "article_summary": "Restoring trust in government and proving it could solve problems has been undermined by one fiasco after another.\nThe problem is what Democrats, especially those in the Obama administration, are doing, rather than what they are or are not saying.\nIt seemed beyond belief that the Obama administration, given three years to prepare for the launch of its most important domestic program,would be so inept.\nWilliam Voegeli, a senior editor of the Claremont Review of Books, is authorof \u201cThe Pity Party: A Mean-Spirited Diatribe Against Liberal Compassion.\u201d\nOne explanation for this anomaly is that liberals are,regarding any social ill, adamant that government do something, butunconcerned about whether it accomplishes anything."}
