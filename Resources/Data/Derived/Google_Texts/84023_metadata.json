Photos Courtesy of The Planter's Palette\n\nKale is a nutritional dynamo. It is packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and glucosinolates, believed to help combat many types of cancer, alleviate allergies and inflammation, fight heart disease, promote digestive health, and prevent premature aging of the skin.\n\nWith all the health benefits kale has to offer, why not grow some this year and have access to fresh kale every day? It is so easy to grow. Start it from seed or purchase small plants at your local garden center to transplant in your garden.\n\nGrowing kale\n\nStart seed either indoors about eight weeks before the expected last frost date, or outdoors directly in the garden a month before the expected last frost date. Plant seeds one-quarter to one-half inch deep and a few inches apart. As seedlings emerge, thin plants to at least a foot apart.\n\nPlant transplants a month before the anticipated last frost date. Set them at the same depth they were growing in their pots, and space them about 18 inches apart. The more distance between plants, the larger the leaves. In containers, plant kale as snug as 8 inches apart. I tuck my plants in a little tighter because I prefer smaller, tenderer leaves.\n\nKale grows best in full sun, but performs satisfactorily in part shade. It requires fertile soil amended with organic matter. Work nitrogen-rich amendments like blood meal, cottonseed meal, peat moss or leaf mold in the soil before planting.\n\nConsistent moisture is vital for best growth. The quality and flavor of leaves is compromised in drought conditions. Applying a layer of mulch keeps the soil moist longer.\n\nAs summer heat sets in, plants begin to produce flower stalks topped with small yellow flowers. Remove these before they develop and plants continue to produce new leaves.\n\nHarvesting and storing kale\n\nBegin harvesting kale soon after plants begin producing leaves about the size of your hand. Gather a few leaves from the outside of plants at each harvest. Avoid cutting center buds -- these are needed to keep leaves growing.\n\nI favor the lighter taste of kale and pick leaves when they are quite young. If you prefer the bold, zesty flavor of kale, wait to harvest until leaves are larger and more mature. In hot weather, leaves may become bitter.\n\nThoroughly wash leaves, put them in a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator. They should last at least a week.\n\nCooking with kale\n\nKale has garnered the attention of many chefs, and there are thousands of kale recipes online. My favorite ways to eat kale is fresh in salads and baked into kale chips. Most people prefer kale served hot -- boiled, steamed just long enough to make it tender, or stir-fried with other vegetables.\n\nUse kale in soups or saute it in a pan with garlic and onions, sprinkled with extra-virgin olive oil. No matter how you fancy it, remove the stalks and leaf ribs before cooking.\n\nRecipe for Kale Chips\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Use parchment paper to cover a baking sheet.\n\nWash and dry kale leaves thoroughly.\n\nUsing a knife, remove the stems and leaf ribs from kale leaves.\n\nChop or tear leaves into snack-sized pieces.\n\nDrizzle leaves with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt.\n\nBake until edges just start to brown (about 10 minutes).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\u2022 Diana Stoll is a horticulturist and the garden center manager at The Planter's Palette, 28W571 Roosevelt Road, Winfield.
