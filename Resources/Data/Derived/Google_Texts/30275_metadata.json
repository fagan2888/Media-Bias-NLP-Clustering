The hospital also must cover the added cost of operating the new facility.\n\n\u201cThe issue for us is that we have a lot of pent-up demand with a patient population that is wholly uninsured or on Medicaid,\u201d said Dr. Fred Cerise, Parkland\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cWe may see more people with insurance or Medicare, who chose to stay with us, but our overall payer mix is not going to change dramatically.\u201d\n\nAs it moves, Parkland is hiring about 300 new employees, who will be needed to clean the larger building, handle the technology and help the staff adjust to the work flow in a new setting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll probably err on the conservative side and get in there and adjust,\u201d Cerise said of future staff. The hospital\u2019s utility costs also are expected to decline, even though it will have twice as many bathrooms and more space to heat and cool.\n\nAnd there are other ways Parkland faces greater financial strain.\n\nDallas County\u2019s public hospital must write down the value of its new campus, taking a $40 million depreciation in the first year. The hospital is then required to set aside funds, some in cash, for replacement of those assets, Cerise said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new cost for us.\u201d\n\nDallas County\u2019s public hospital also must rebuild its operating reserves, which stood at $250 million before the new hospital was built. Typically, that money is used to pay bills when other sources of income are low, such as when the annual infusion of Dallas County taxes runs out.\n\nAll the hospital\u2019s operating reserve funds, however, were spent on new Parkland. Last January, the board of managers approved the use of unspent designated funds when Parkland\u2019s cash runs low. Such short-term borrowing \u201cworks well for Parkland,\u201d as long as the funds are \u201cultimately replaced and used for their stated purposes,\u201d the board decided.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we will evaluate on a situation-by-situation basis and look at all our options,\u201d John G. Moore, Parkland\u2019s new chief financial officer, said of the practice of tapping into designated funds to pay bills and draw down federal dollars.\n\nShrinking pool\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act comes into focus, it\u2019s also obvious that Parkland won\u2019t benefit as much financially as was hoped when the federal law passed in 2010. The county hospital took in about $30 million last year from newly insured patients.\n\nWhile a positive sign, it was a rather small contribution toward Parkland\u2019s nearly $1.4 billion budget for 2015. The county taxpayer\u2019s share was $496 million.\n\nParkland had expected more of its patients to qualify for Medicaid coverage, until Texas political leaders rejected an expansion of the state-federal program that came with 90 percent federal funding.\n\nParkland has scrambled to get more supplemental Medicaid dollars, but the pool of money is shrinking and more private hospitals that provide charity care are asking for a share. Parkland was informed it would qualify for about $5 million less of those funds next year.\n\n\u2018Unmet demand\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge,\u201d said John Hawkins, the Texas Hospital Association\u2019s senior vice president for government relations.\n\nParkland is among about 200 public hospitals in Texas that depend on Medicaid as their primary income, he said. Most are in rural areas, where uninsured residents have one option for care.\n\n\u201cPrivate hospitals get more private health insurance as a cushion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping these hospitals don\u2019t get in a poor financial situation and start cutting certain community investments. That\u2019s a bigger concern in an urban area.\u201d\n\nAbout 1.1 million Texas residents were expected to qualify for the expanded Medicaid coverage. That includes thousands of Parkland patients, who are uninsured and living on poverty-level wages.\n\n\u201cA Medicaid expansion would fix a lot for us,\u201d Cerise said. \u201cIt would free up resources for us to create more specialty clinics and more primary care access points. With Texas having the highest uninsured rate in the country, we know there\u2019s a lot of unmet demand.\u201d\n\nAbout 2.5 million Texas residents don\u2019t qualify for coverage under the new federal law. Many are undocumented immigrants, who depend largely on their county-operated health systems. Without it, they must seek care at emergency rooms, public and private, which are prohibited by federal law from turning them away.\n\n\u201cAs long as we have a federal law allowing people to present at hospitals and be stabilized, we\u2019re going to have a safety net supported by the government,\u201d Hawkins said.\n\nFunding questions\n\nBeyond these financial challenges, Parkland also could face questions about its growing dependency on local taxpayers. A former Parkland board member wants a public debate over how much Parkland costs and why county residents must automatically foot the bills.\n\n\u201cThe big issue is the financial structure of Parkland as a public safety-net hospital,\u201d said Richard Kneipper, a former Parkland board member who co-founded a health care technology services company in Dallas.\n\n\u201cThere ought to be a public discussion in Dallas County as to whether it is appropriate for taxpayers to continue to support Parkland\u2019s operating budget to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars each year,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen taxpayers around the country no longer provide major funding to their public hospitals.\u201d\n\nKneipper was known to keep a close eye on Parkland\u2019s spending during his four-year tenure on the board, which ended in 2008. He often questioned the hospital\u2019s spending habits and whether they followed sound business practices.\n\n\u201cYou have to question the stewardship of the taxpayers\u2019 dollars, especially when they submit budgets to the Commissioners Court that show a deficit,\u201d Kneipper said of the Parkland budget, which was approved last year with a $34 million shortage.\n\nHospital officials said they have balanced the current budget, but haven\u2019t specified exactly where the money came from and whether any services were cut.\n\nParkland spokesman Mike Malaise said the deficit was eliminated \u201centirely through improving efficiencies, improving collections and accessing programs that help improve patient care while adding funding to the system.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, Dallas County taxpayers will likely see a 7.5 percent increase in hospital taxes in 2016, due to rising property values. Although Parkland once lowered its tax rate when the hospital didn\u2019t need the money, it is willing to accept next year\u2019s higher payments because it does need the money.\n\n\u201cIt is simply a statement of increasing home values unrelated to Parkland,\u201d Malaise said. \u201cParkland is not asking for any tax increase.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dallas County\u2019s public hospital faces rising demand and expenses for its new home while Medicaid funds decline.", "og": {"description": "Dallas County\u2019s public hospital faces rising demand and expenses for its new home while Medicaid funds decline.", "title": "As financial strain grows at Parkland, local taxpayers footing more of bill", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150814-as-financial-strain-grows-at-parkland-local-taxpayers-footing-more-of-bill.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150814-fred_cerise.ece/BINARY/original/FRED_CERISE", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-08-17T02:57:50Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-08-14T16:47:42Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"As financial strain grows at Parkland, local taxpayers footing more of bill\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150814-as-financial-strain-grows-at-parkland-local-taxpayers-footing-more-of-bill.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150814-fred_cerise.ece/BINARY/original/FRED_CERISE\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2395971\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-08-14T16:47:42Z\", \"section\": \"General News\", \"author\": \"SHERRY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-news/20150814-fred_cerise.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/FRED_CERISE", "publishtime": "2015-08-14T16:47:42Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb851\"", "article_summary": "\u2018Unmet demand\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge,\u201d said John Hawkins, the Texas Hospital Association\u2019s senior vice president for government relations.\nDallas County\u2019s public hospital must write down the value of its new campus, taking a $40 million depreciation in the first year.\nParkland is among about 200 public hospitals in Texas that depend on Medicaid as their primary income, he said.\nFunding questionsBeyond these financial challenges, Parkland also could face questions about its growing dependency on local taxpayers.\nIt\u2019s not easy running a public hospital in 21st-century Texas, especially a new, more expensive one."}
