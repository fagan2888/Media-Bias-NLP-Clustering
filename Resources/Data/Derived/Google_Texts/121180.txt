QUINCY Â— The first meeting of a newly seated Quincy City Council on Monday quickly brought the first split vote over procedure. Mayor Kyle Moore cast the tie-breaking vote after aldermen were split 7-7 on a motion to table a recommendation from the Plan Commission.

The commission recommended allowing the expansion of a garage east of the city but within the 1.5-mile zoning jurisdiction.



Brian Terstegge, 6221 Church Hill Road, is seeking a special permit for a planned development to build a 2,450-square-foot addition onto the west side of an existing 2,800-square-foot garage.



While Director of Planning and Development Chuck Bevelheimer was being questioned on the proposal by 5th Ward Aldermen Mike Rein and Jennifer Lepper, Moore said they needed a make motion on what course the council should take before continuing.



"Your honor, we're just trying to get this straight, because we weren't aware of all the details," Lepper said.



Corporation Counsel Lonnie Dunn reiterated that a motion was needed to discuss the proposal as required by Robert's Rules of Order. Lepper then made the motion to table for one week.

This is the second time Terstegge has sought approval to construct a garage addition to support his hobby of collecting cars. Construction of an addition started months ago on the south side of his garage, but it would have violated the city's 50-foot front yard setback requirement. A variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals was denied.

If allowed to build on the west side of his garage, Terstegge would be required to remove the walls of the unfinished addition and would not be allowed to store any unlicensed or inoperable vehicles outside.



David Barnard, who lives across the street, asked aldermen to reduce the total square footage of the addition and enforce a number of cars allowed.

"If we don't do it to code, there's no sense of having a code," Barnard said.



Newly-elected Aldermen Eric Entrup, R-1, Jeff Bergman, R-2, and Jeff VanCamp, I-6, were sworn in before the start of the meeting. Also taking the oath of office for new terms were Aldermen Paul Havermale, R-3, Mike Farha, R-4, Lepper, R-5, and Terri Heinecke, R-7.



In other business, aldermen approved the low bid of $349,108 from Rees Construction Co. for the reconstruction on North Second between Maine and Hampshire.



Half the cost will be covered by a grant the city received last year from the Illinois Department of Transportation's economic development program. The remainder will come from the city's two tax increment financing districts in downtown Quincy.



As part of the project, Kohl Wholesale agreed to contribute about $20,000 for lighting and the company will also hire 22 new full-time employees.



Director of Utilities and Engineering Jeffrey Conte said he expects construction could start in a few weeks.



"I believe the contractor would like to get started as soon as possible," he said. "They ordered some materials (for the project), and they took delivery on Friday."



On Monday afternoon, the council approved an ordinance to increase several line items in the budget before closing out the 2015 fiscal year.



Comptroller Sheri Ray said while the money had been spent, it needed to be reflected in the budget. Increased line items were health clinic by $40,000, group health claims by $77,000, group health fixed costs by $87,000 and Affordable Care Act costs by $28,000.



Ray said while the city projected to end the year with a balance of $1.5 million in its self-insurance fund, it ended the fiscal year with more than $700,000.
