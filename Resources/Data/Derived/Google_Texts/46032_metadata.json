Apparently, it was too bold for The New Republic.\n\nThe original, provocative headline has now been watered down to the anodyne, \u201cIf We Want Feminism to Have a Real Impact, Then Let\u2019s Stop Teaching So Much Theory.\u201d See the difference here.\n\nThe original headline caught my eye Monday, but then I noticed the different headline when I returned to the article later this week. Was criticizing Women\u2019s Studies Departments too politically incorrect?\n\nThe author is Elizabeth Segran, who taught \u201cfeminist theory\u201d to undergraduates at the University of California, Berkeley. She doesn\u2019t attack Women\u2019s Studies Departments from the Right. She wants Women\u2019s Studies courses to become more effective conduits for feminist activists. This is what might make it all the more frustrating in the eyes of Women\u2019s Studies supporters. One of their own is publicly criticizing Women\u2019s Studies Departments. Segran calls out these courses for being \u201cweighed down by theory and jargon\u201d and longs for their early \u201cconsciousness-raising\u201d days:\n\nWhen the first Women\u2019s Studies programs were created in the late sixties, \u201cthe personal is political\u201d was the rallying cry. \u201cConsciousness-raising\u201d led to the realization that problems women assumed were personal could, in fact, be the result of systematic patterns of oppression.\n\nSegran advocates for a more activist and less academic direction for these programs:\n\nThe turn toward abstraction is not unique to Women\u2019s Studies. Across the humanities, there has been a widespread shift to theory and jargon, rendering many fields inaccessible to those outside academia. While many critics have pointed out how problematic this is, it is particularly tragic for departments\u2014like Women\u2019s Studies, African American Studies, Native American Studies, and Latino Studies\u2014that were born out of student activism. In the late 1960s and early \u201970s, universities created these departments to respond to student demands for courses that would give them the knowledge and skills to tackle problems in their communities. Without their activist spark, these fields lose their purpose.\n\nI, too, have pointed out some of the problems with Women\u2019s Studies Departments, but I have a different take on the activism component of these programs. Here is a link to my online course, Deconstructing \u201cWomen\u2019s Studies.\u201d\n\nSuch discussion of the purpose of these programs should be welcomed by academia. The New Republic did itself, and Women\u2019s Studies, no favors by watering down the criticism.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "\u201cWomen's Studies Departments Are Failing Feminism\u201d \u2014 this is a bold headline.
