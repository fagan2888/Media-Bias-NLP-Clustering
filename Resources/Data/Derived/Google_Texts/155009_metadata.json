Richard Blumenthal Richard BlumenthalSenate amendments could sink email privacy compromise Groups urge Senate to oppose defense language on for-profit colleges Lawmakers push to elevate Cyber Command in Senate defense bill MORE (D-Conn.) warned of the \u201cincalculable harm to consumers\u201d that can come from the types of data breaches like the one suffered by Target late last year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter the Target breach was made public, Blumenthal urged the FTC to investigate the company\u2019s security practices.\n\n\u201cCustomers of companies have a right to expect that their private information will be properly safeguarded and secured,\u201d he told The Hill on Friday. \u201cThe failure to take those steps is not only a violation of trust but also potentially of law.\"\n\nOver the last decade, the FTC has brought dozens of cases against companies for failing to safeguard consumers\u2019 data.\n\nAccording to the commission, companies have a responsibility to live up to their promises about data security. Allowing firms to be hacked, regulators have said, is a breach of trust and a violation of companies\u2019 pledges.\n\nBut not everyone agrees that the FTC is in the right.\n\nThe hotel and resort company Wyndham Worldwide and medical testing company LabMD are both suing the agency, challenging its authority to bring data security cases.\n\nReed Rubinstein, senior vice president at Cause of Action, which is representing LabMD in its case against the agency, said that the FTC does not have the legal authority to penalize companies who have suffered data breaches.\n\nSection 5 of the FTC Act \u2014 which the agency cites when defending its authority in this area \u2014 \u201cis absolutely silent on data security,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand how the FTC lawfully gives itself this authority.\u201d\n\nIf the FTC wants the authority to bring data breach penalties, he said it needs to give better guidance on what companies should do to protect consumer data.\n\nCritics say that the FTC\u2019s practice amounts to penalizing companies that are themselves victims.\n\n\u201cShould the primary function of the U.S. government to be to come in and attack Target, which was the victim of this hack, or should the primary function of the U.S. government to be to turn around and ask the question of where the hack came from?\u201d said Jeffrey Eisenach, a former FTC official who is now a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cWhat is it we\u2019re doing with all of the resources available to us to stop Target from being hacked and the next Target and the next Target and the next Target in the future?\u201d\n\nSome privacy advocates say Congress needs to get involved to clear up any ambiguity about the FTC\u2019s power to hold companies to high cybersecurity standards.\n\nBlumenthal said that he would \u201cconsider drafting and introducing new legislative authority to keep pace with advancing technology, even though I believe that consumers have a right under existing law to expect companies to safeguard their data.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Sen. Ed Markey Ed MarkeyHonor Frank Lautenberg by protecting our kids Sanders pans chemical safety reform deal Feds fault pipeline company in California oil spill MORE (D-Mass.) called on Congress to act in the wake of breaches that have \u201cput millions of consumers at risk for identity theft and damaging fraud.\u201d\n\nHe said Congress should \u201chold hearings on these serious breaches to determine what companies are doing to fix their security weaknesses exploited by data thieves and the steps consumers can take to protect their sensitive information.\"\n\nDemocratic Sens. Robert Menendez (N.J.), Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Mark Warner (Va.) have also called for a hearing on the Target breach.\n\nFTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen said the recent high-profile breaches could fuel a national conversation.\n\n\u201cAny time that there is a data breach from a well-known company that impacts a lot of consumers, it brings more attention and more energy to the issue,\u201d the Republican commissioner said.\n\n\u201cWith Target being so well known and the number of consumers that can possibly be affected [being so high], it certainly has gotten lots of attention, including Congressional attention.\u201d\n\nData security \u201cseems to have the level of bipartisan interest that would help\u201d get a bill passed in Congress, she added.\n\nOhlhausen supports a federal data breach and notification law \u2014 especially if the FTC loses either of the cases challenging its authority \u2014 but defends the agency\u2019s authority to bring cases against companies that fail to protect their users\u2019 data.\n\n\u201cA uniform federal law for data security and breach notification would make sense\u201d to give consumers consistent protection and to give businesses one set of guidance \u201crather than a patchwork of state laws,\u201d she said, speaking broadly about data security and not about specific pending litigation.\n\nHigh-profile breaches like Target\u2019s mean that \u201ceveryone is going to feel this,\u201d according to Ross Schulman, public policy and regulatory counsel at the Computer and Communications Industry Association. That can help move the ball forward in the ongoing debate.\n\nSchulman\u2019s group \u2014 which includes Google, Facebook and Microsoft \u2014 recently released polling data which found that 75 percent of Internet users are worried about their information being stolen through security breaches, and 74 percent think the federal government should do more to protect against identity theft made possibly by those breaches.\n\nOhlhausen defended the FTC against critics who say the agency hasn\u2019t provided guidance on data security requirements.\n\nThe agency has provided \u201ca fair amount of guidance in this area through our enforcement and our educational efforts,\u201d she said, pointing to published guides and past data security actions brought by the FTC.\n\n\u201cEverybody is better off \u2026 if we give a clear idea of where the lines are and let companies know.\u201d\n\nAnalysts on both sides of the issue agree that government officials should be chasing hackers and that companies should have some base level of responsibility to safeguard consumers.\n\nBut privacy advocates say the FTC has a responsibility to act where it can.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t go after the Nigerian spammer or the hacker in Eastern Europe who did this,\u201d said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology. \u201cOn behalf of consumers, they\u2019re saying that failure to use reasonable security practices is unfair. It\u2019s bad for consumers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Demands for regulators or Congress to get involved are growing.", "description": "Demands for regulators or Congress to get involved are growing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kate Tummarello and Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Demands for regulators or Congress to get involved are growing.", "title": "Target's data breach sparks calls for action", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/194414-targets-data-breach-sparks-calls-for-fed-action", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/targetdatabreach_010514.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-05T06:29:22-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/194414-targets-data-breach-sparks-calls-for-fed-action", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Demands for regulators or Congress to get involved are growing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Target's data breach sparks calls for action"}, "dcterms.modified": "2014-01-05T06:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/194414-targets-data-breach-sparks-calls-for-fed-action", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-05T06:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rachel Huggins", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Data,Richard Blumenthal, Ed Markey,Federal Trade Commission", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-05T06:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-05T06:29:22-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Target's data breach sparks calls for action"}, "article_summary": "Robert Menendez (N.J.), Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Mark Warner (Va.) have also called for a hearing on the Target breach.\nThe government is facing increased pressure to institute data security protections after the high-profile breaches of Target and social networking app Snapchat.\nAccording to the commission, companies have a responsibility to live up to their promises about data security.\nADVERTISEMENTAfter the Target breach was made public, Blumenthal urged the FTC to investigate the company\u2019s security practices.\nOver the last decade, the FTC has brought dozens of cases against companies for failing to safeguard consumers\u2019 data."}
