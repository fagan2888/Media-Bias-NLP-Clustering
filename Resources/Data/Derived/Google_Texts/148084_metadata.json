The group\u2019s new model should let advocates help more people during a 2015 enrollment season that is two months shorter than the health care act\u2019s inaugural season.\n\nAdvocates nationwide say face-to-face help for Spanish-speaking Americans is the most effective tool they have.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard from our community partners. There\u2019s a sense of reassurance and trust that people have when they\u2019re able to sit down and talk through what questions they might have,\u201d said Steven Lopez, a health care policy specialist for the National Council of La Raza, an umbrella group for Hispanic advocacy organizations.\n\nTrust is paramount because many Hispanic-Americans live in families with relatives who are in the country illegally and are afraid of revealing their relatives to the federal government, despite Mr. Obama\u2019s personal assurance that information provided for health care coverage would not be used for deportation.\n\n\u201cThe message is coming through, but there\u2019s still going to be doubts for even the most educated person on this topic,\u201d said George Escobar, director of health and human services for Casa de Maryland.\n\nChallenges remain, particularly in Texas and Florida, where Republican leaders have refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. That has kept government coverage out reach for roughly 800,000 Hispanics who otherwise would qualify, advocates say.\n\nObamacare advocates say that kind of opposition creates an outsized burden on the state\u2019s Hispanic population.\n\n\u201cThis is not anything new for Texas,\u201d said Ramiro Cavazos, president and CEO of the San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. \u201cFor many, many years, the Hispanic community has arguably been disconnected from access to health care benefits and the traditional health systems that other states, especially in the Northeast, have really depended upon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A map in Angela Franco's office highlights the D.C. streets most likely to have Hispanic business owners, and it serves as a blueprint for foot soldiers who have been pounding the pavement to get people covered through the city's Obamacare exchange.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A map in Angela Franco\u2019s office highlights the D.C. streets most likely to have Hispanic business owners, and it serves as a blueprint for foot soldiers who have been pounding the pavement to get people covered through the city\u2019s Obamacare exchange.", "title": "Obamacare advocates target Hispanics in health care enrollment push", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/1/obamacare-advocates-target-hispanics-in-health-car/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/24/8314c929b3355e0b4f0f6a706700ee13.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/24/8314c929b3355e0b4f0f6a706700ee13.jpg", "description": "A map in Angela Franco's office highlights the D.C. streets most likely to have Hispanic business owners, and it serves as a blueprint for foot soldiers who have been pounding the pavement to get peop", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare advocates target Hispanics in health care enrollment push"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma"}, "article_summary": "The group\u2019s new model should let advocates help more people during a 2015 enrollment season that is two months shorter than the health care act\u2019s inaugural season.\nMuch of the success or failure of President Obama\u2019s health care law hinges on Hispanics, who account for about a quarter of the uninsured who are eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cFor many, many years, the Hispanic community has arguably been disconnected from access to health care benefits and the traditional health systems that other states, especially in the Northeast, have really depended upon.\u201d\nObamacare advocates say that kind of opposition creates an outsized burden on the state\u2019s Hispanic population.\nThat has kept government coverage out reach for roughly 800,000 Hispanics who otherwise would qualify, advocates say."}
