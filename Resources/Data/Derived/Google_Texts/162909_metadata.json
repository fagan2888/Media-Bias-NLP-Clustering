The court is expected to rule on several high-profile cases in the coming months on issues such as affirmative action, abortion and unionization.\n\nDespite a full year ahead for the Supreme Court, DePaul political science professor Joseph Mello expressed the impact of these decisions could not have an impact on this year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cI think it is unlikely, however, that any one of these cases will have a dramatic impact on the presidential race,\u201d Mello said. \u201cThe American public has not historically been all that interested in, or aware of, most Supreme Court decisions.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mello said that occasionally a case has the ability to capture the public\u2019s attention, noting last summer\u2019s decision on Obergefell v. Hodges, which resulted in the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nAs for 2016\u2019s most high profile case, Mello said a decision on affirmative action could result in changes, particularly during this election year.\n\n\u201cI think the Fisher case on affirmative action might have the most potential to grab public attention, if the justices decide to overturn the policy. Ending affirmative action in higher education would be big news, and could help mobilize African-Americans and Latinos who are typical Democratic constituencies with a history of low voter turnout,\u201d Mello said.\n\nAffirmative action\n\nOne case the Court will reach a decision on is Fisher v. University of Texas, dealing with the practice of asking for a student\u2019s race on college admissions applications. Abigail Fisher, a white student, was denied admission to the University of Texas in 2008. Fisher filed the lawsuit alleging the university violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by using race as part of the application process.\n\nDePaul education professor Andrea Kayne Kaufman outlined the implications the case could have on affirmative action at the collegiate level.\n\n\u201cIf the court does rule for Fisher, it could have a major impact on how universities recruit and admit racial minority groups to create diverse classes,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cThere has been a lot of research about the efficacy of affirmative action policies on expanding the number of African-American and Latino students at universities.\u201d\n\nPrevious decisions on cases have led some schools to the practice of navigating around race in the admissions process.\n\n\u201cSchools have had to move away from considering race as a primary factor in admissions, even as they attempt to balance the racial diversity of their student body. So they\u2019ve looked to other factors such as economic class, and where students come from, as proxies for racial or ethnic background,\u201d Christina Rivers, a DePaul political science professor, said.\n\nAbortion\n\nAt the heart of a case against the Affordable Care Act is whether certain nonprofit religious groups opposed to abortion and contraception can be exempt from laws under the act.\n\nThe Catholic elderly care group Little Sisters of the Poor is challenging a mandate in the Affordable Care Act that requires employers and organizations to offer plans with coverage of some contraceptive methods and early abortion drugs.\n\nDePaul philosophy professor Bill Martin expressed concern for the case.\n\n\u201cIn no way should the solution entail restriction on women\u2019s access to abortion or any other form of reproductive health care,\u201d Martin said.\n\nUnions\n\nGovernment employee unionization is also being put to the test. Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association is a case against the mandatory payment of union dues from government employees, or in this case, public school teachers.\n\n\u201cThis is an age-old question for unions, although with a bit of a twist because of the government employee aspect thrown in,\u201d James Wolfinger, a DePaul education professor, said.\n\nUnder the current system, some teachers may be paying union dues to fund union activities, whether or not they agree with the union\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cEmployers have long argued that unions unfairly force everyone to contribute to the organization, even if they disagree with their union\u2019s stance,\u201d Wolfinger said.\n\nA decision on the case would set a precedent for how union dues can be collected within groups representing government employees.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 1.14.3", "og": {"site_name": "The DePaulia", "description": "The year 2016 is shaping up to be a busy one for the Supreme Court.
