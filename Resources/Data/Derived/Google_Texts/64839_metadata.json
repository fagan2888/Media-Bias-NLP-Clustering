What it says to me is that networks will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid real news. Got to be a sense of pride around the network news rooms that they can fritter away extremely valuable network air time on less than trivia and get highly paid for it. Maybe they could replace the network news with another edition of Jeopardy. At least we might learn something.\n\nSpeaking of trivia, were you paying attention last week?\n\n1) So the first question just has to be \u2013 what is the proscribed inflation for NFL game balls?\n\n2) By how much was New England accused of under-inflating game balls?\n\n3) Wednesday the US Senate voted on whether human activity caused climate change. \u201cYES\u201d won by a vote of 50 \u2013 49. How did Iowa\u2019s senators vote?\n\n4) According to the United Nations the US, Oman and Papua New Guinea are the only 3 nations in the world that do not offer what?\n\n5) Speaker of the House Boehner committed a major diplomatic blunder (some say treason) when he invited what Head of State to speak before congress without informing the White House?\n\n6) In Cincinnati, one worker was killed and a semi driver injured when what happened?\n\n7) Up in Montana, Gov. Steve Bullock declared a state of emergency when what happened to the Yellowstone River?\n\n8) Doing the math on her age, Joni Ernst was probably using bread bags for shoes during what presidential and Iowa gubernatorial administrations?\n\n9) Disneyland was the epicenter of an outbreak of what childhood disease?\n\n10) Controversy is already swirling in the Iowa legislature concerning schools on at least two issues. Can you give us one of them?\n\n11) In her response to the State of the Union address, Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst erroneously portrayed the Keystone Pipeline project as what?\n\n12) After Mike Huckabee criticized Pres. Obama for allowing his children to listen to Beyonce, Daily Show star Jon Stewart asked Huckabee how he (Huckabee) could justify playing with what sexually oriented rocker?\n\n13) Republican senators voted down an amendment to the Keystone Pipeline that would have required materials for the pipeline be made where?\n\n14) Good old Steve King just had to show what an embarrassment he can be to Iowa right before the SOTU, when he called a guest of the First Lady a what?\n\n15) The mayor of Paris, France announced her intention to sue what \u201cnews\u201d organization after they continued to broadcast false reports that Paris had \u201cneighborhoods that were off limits to non-Muslims\u201d?\n\nOne thing about Ernst\u2019s bread bag story. Most every kid I knew used the bread bag trick in the winter, rich or poor. Unlike the kids she apparently knew, we wore ours over our shoes but under the overshoes. Overshoes (or buckle boots) were leaky. So the bread bags served to keep feet dry while also acting as a lubricant to get the shoes and feet into the boot. If you wore the bags on the outside, your would either slip on your butt in the snow or wear the bag out if the sidewalks were clear. Wearing bags the right way you couldn\u2019t see who was wearing bags and who wasn\u2019t.\n\nAnswers:\n\n1) 12.5 to 13.5 PSI (pounds/square inch)\n\n2) 2 PSI 0r 15%\n\n3) Grassley NO and Ernst NO \u2013 climate change is not caused by human activity\n\n4) paid maternity leave\n\n5) Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu\n\n6) an overpass on I75 that was being demolished collapsed on the road below\n\n7) oil from a pipeline leaked into the river.\n\n8) Reagan and Branstad. Seems like many folks go through tough times with Republican administrations\n\n9) Measles \u2013 Blame for the outbreak was pointed at the anti-vaxers.\n\n10) 1) Branstad called for a very low increase in spending for education and 2) Schools will be expected to start after Sept. 1 next year.\n\n11) a jobs bill\n\n12) Ted Nugent\n\n13) in America \u2013 whoops \u2013 there goes a bunch of jobs.\n\n14) \u201ca deportable\u201d The First Lady had a Dreamer as her guest.\n\n15) Fox News\n\nKeep your bread bags dry and warm all!", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4dc\"", "article_summary": "Most every kid I knew used the bread bag trick in the winter, rich or poor.\n15) Fox NewsKeep your bread bags dry and warm all!\nOne thing about Ernst\u2019s bread bag story.\n1) So the first question just has to be \u2013 what is the proscribed inflation for NFL game balls?\nSo the bread bags served to keep feet dry while also acting as a lubricant to get the shoes and feet into the boot."}
