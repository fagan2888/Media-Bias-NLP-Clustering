Posted Monday through Friday right here at www.abcnews.com\n\nCompiled by ABC News' Jayce Henderson, Will Cantine and Jordan Mazza\n\nJANET YELLEN CONFIRMED AS FED CHIEF ABC News' Devin Dwyer: \" Janet Yellen Confirmed As First Woman To Lead Fed\" For the first time ever, a woman will lead the nation's powerful central bank, the Federal Reserve. The Senate today confirmed Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Fed's Board of Governors, a role she'll assume on Feb. 1. The vote of 56 to 26, including 11 Republicans in favor, was a history-making first order of business for the Senate after returning from a three-week holiday recess. More than a dozen senators were not present for the vote because of weather-related travel delays. Yellen, 67, who was nominated by President Obama in October, will become the first Democrat to head the central bank since 1987. She succeeds Ben Bernanke, a George W. Bush appointee who is stepping down after eight years at the helm. LINK\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Kristina Peterson and Pedro Nicolaci Da Costa: \" Yellen Confirmed As Fed Chief\" Janet Yellen will join the ranks of the most powerful economic policy makers in the world next month, taking the helm of the Federal Reserve at a time when the central bank is assessing its unprecedented steps to buoy the U.S. economy. The 67-year-old Ms. Yellen, currently the vice chairwoman of the Fed's board of governors, will become the first woman to lead the central bank in its 100-year history after the Senate voted to confirm her Monday night in a 56-26 vote. Eleven Republicans joined 45 Democrats to support her; no Democrats opposed her. Weather-related travel problems caused some lawmakers to miss the vote. LINK\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM'S EMERGENCY LANDING ABC News' Arlette Saenz: \" Sen. Lindsey Graham Tweets About Emergency Landing\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was aboard a flight from Greenville, S.C. to Washington, D.C. today that was forced to make an emergency landing. Graham chronicled the emergency landing in a series of tweets posted after the plane touched down on the runway. The South Carolina senator, who is up for re-election this year, said he and other passengers noticed a strange sound coming from the engine. Shortly after, the pilot announced they would make an emergency landing. A spokesman for Graham had no other details about what caused the flight problem. LINK\n\nUSA Today's Catalina Camia: \" Sen. Graham Tweets About Plane's Emergency Landing\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says he and his fellow passengers are safe after an emergency landing at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. Graham posted a series of messages on his campaign's Twitter account about Monday's incident, starting with the low-key observation that he had been having an \"interesting day.\" Graham, who is up for re-election this year, said he and his fellow passengers heard a \"strange sound\" coming from the engine about five minutes into the flight to Washington. After the pilot declared an emergency, Graham said the airplane went back to the Greenville-Spartanburg airport and landed safely. LINK\n\nHEALTH CARE The Hill's Elise Viebeck and Jonathan Easley: \" WH credits ObamaCare for slow growth in healthcare spending\" The White House on Monday said ObamaCare was partly responsible for slowing the growth of healthcare spending, even as the agency tasked with implementing the law said the impact was \"minimal.\" The new report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) found healthcare spending rose by 3.7 percent in 2012, the fourth year in a row that the increase was at a near-record low. \"For years, healthcare costs in America skyrocketed, with brutal consequences for our country,\" wrote White House deputy assistant for health policy Jeanne Lambrew in a blog post. \"The Affordable Care Act, for the first time in decades, has helped to stop that trend.\" LINK\n\nThe Washington Times' Tom Howell Jr.: \" GOP senator sues over Obamacare subsidies for Congress\" Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday he will ask the courts to make sure that Congress is treated the same way regular Americans are treated in the Obamacare marketplace, even if it means taking away his colleagues' health care subsidies, because the financial aid is not in the Obamacare law they passed in 2010 and forces taxpayers to pay for part of lawmakers' premiums. Mr. Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, filed suit against the Office of Personnel Management, the agency that months ago said members of Congress and their staffs could keep the subsidy that paid for up to 75 percent of their premiums under the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan, even though they must obtain coverage from the Obamacare marketplace. LINK\n\nJOBLESS AID / INCOME GAP The Los Angeles Times' Lisa Mascaro: \" Senate vote on jobless aid postponed; bad weather strands senators\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) abruptly postponed Monday evening's planned vote on extending unemployment benefits after a Republican complained that proceeding would be unfair because weather-related airline delays had prevented as many as 17 senators from returning to Washington in time for the roll call. Though Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) challenged Reid's plan to hold the vote, Democratic leaders thought Republicans were bluffing. Many of the absent senators were Republicans from the South and Midwest. LINK\n\nThe Washington Post's Philip Rucker and Robert Costa: \" Income gap takes shape as central issue for both parties ahead of 2014 midterms\" On Tuesday morning, Senate Republicans are expected to block an emergency measure to extend unemployment insurance. Soon after, President Obama will stand before a handful of the 1.3 million Americans who have begun to lose their benefits and try to shame Republicans for failing to help the nation's neediest. LINK\n\nHILLARY CLINTON New York Daily News' Adam Edelman: \" Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign rents email list to Super PAC pushing her to run in 2016: Report\" Hillary Clinton's 2008 defunct presidential campaign has rented out its email database to the most prominent group that is pushing her to run - the clearest sign yet that the popular former Secretary of State is gearing up for another bid at the White House. Ready for Hillary, a \"Super PAC\" that has actively been laying the groundwork for a 2016 Clinton run, gained access to the valuable email list put together by the former first lady's 2008 campaign, Time magazine reported Sunday night, allowing the group to send emails to a vast network of Clinton supporters. LINK\n\nLIZ CHENEY The New York Times' Jonathan Martin: \" For Cheney, Realities of a Race Outweighed Family Edge\" Liz Cheney's short-lived Wyoming Senate campaign shows the perils of personal ambition outpacing a rationale for candidacy. Ms. Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney's elder daughter, on Monday morning cited \"serious health issues\" in her family when she withdrew from her primary challenge of Senator Michael B. Enzi.
