Not because hardcore conservatives don\u2019t trust his position on immigration; not because he lacks the fire in his belly to be president; and not because he doesn\u2019t have a ground game in place to compete with Ben Carson and Donald Trump.\n\nNo, Bush\u2019s fundamental problem is two-pronged. He has shown poor judgment in creating a solid, strategic campaign to compete with other Republican candidates, and like his father and brother he has a problem articulating ideas and reactions to events and questions. Call him verbally challenged.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Unbridled Ambition Trips Her Up Again\u200b\u200b\n\nExamples of Bush\u2019s ill-spoken comments are growing.\n\nOn gun control: After a shooting on the campus of Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, he said, \u201cLook, stuff happens \u2026\u201d\n\nOn health care: Answering a question about Medicare, he said, \u201cWe need to figure out a way to phase out this program \u2026\u201d Yikes! Regarding Planned Parenthood, he declared, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars in funding for women\u2019s health programs.\u201d So much for the women\u2019s vote.\n\nOn getting to 4 percent GDP: \u201cIt means that people need to work longer hours.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more, of course. None of these comments is as bad as they are in isolation, but a savvy, strategic politician would know that any word or phrase can make or break a political career or legacy \u2014 see \u201cRead my lips,\u201d \u201cthe 47 percent,\u201d \u201cMission Accomplished,\u201d and \u201cYou Can Keep Your Doctor\u201d\n\nRelated: The Art of the Troll \u2014 How Donald Trump Sent Jeb Bush into a Tailspin\u200b\n\nThat brings us to tonight\u2019s debate and the potential Bush vs. Rubio face-off. The New York Times reported Monday night that Bush\u2019s backers are preparing an ad campaign of \u201cscathing attacks\u201d in an effort to stem Rubio\u2019s rise. But leaking campaign strategy to The Times might go down as another Bush misstep: Rubio made a preemptive strike by releasing an amazing ad of Jeb Bush endorsing him enthusiastically in four separate clips. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the most articulate conservative on the scene today,\u201d Bush is shown saying, \u201cand the fortitude to be a good president.\u201d\n\nRubio got the better of Bush at the last debate after Bush attacked his voting record. Rubio shot back, \u201cI don\u2019t remember you ever complaining about John McCain\u2019s vote record. The only reason why you\u2019re doing it now is because we\u2019re running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you. My campaign is going to be about the future of America, it\u2019s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.\u201d\n\nBam! It took about one minute for Rubio to demolish Bush, who never saw it coming.\n\nIf nothing else, Rubio has shown he knows how to be strategic.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "From the beginning of his campaign, Jeb Bush has been a disappointment.", "title": "Marco Rubio Unleashes a Devastating New Ad Against Jeb Bush", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/Marco-Rubio-Unleashes-Devastating-New-Ad-Against-Jeb-Bush", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/rubio_bush_republican_debate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/Marco-Rubio-Unleashes-Devastating-New-Ad-Against-Jeb-Bush", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/rubio_bush_republican_debate.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "From the beginning of his campaign, Jeb Bush has been a disappointment.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27ef\"", "article_summary": "From the beginning of his campaign, Jeb Bush has been a disappointment.\nBut leaking campaign strategy to The Times might go down as another Bush misstep: Rubio made a preemptive strike by releasing an amazing ad of Jeb Bush endorsing him enthusiastically in four separate clips.\nIt took about one minute for Rubio to demolish Bush, who never saw it coming.\nIf nothing else, Rubio has shown he knows how to be strategic.\nMy campaign is going to be about the future of America, it\u2019s not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.\u201dBam!"}
