Neither the Food and Drug Administration nor any other federal agency examines these shipments.\n\nThe cosmetic industry and operators of the nine commercial talc mines in the United States and scores of suppliers overseas insist there is no asbestos in their talc, nor products made from it.\n\nBut the recently published experiments confirmed that using contaminated talcum powder in closed spaces \u2014 like a small bathroom \u2014 increases the likelihood of inhaling the asbestos fibers.\n\n\u201cWe have traced the asbestos in the talc to the mines from which it originated, into the milled grades, into the product, and finally into the lung and lymph nodes of the users of those products, including one woman who developed mesothelioma,\u201d the study reported.\n\nDuring their testing, they found that the talcum powder used by the victim \u2014 Cashmere Bouquet \u2014 \u201ccontained identifiable asbestos fibers with the potential to be released into the air and inhaled during normal personal talcum powder application.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly this is not a situation where asbestos-contaminated talc is just harming a few people from any one place,\u201d said pathologist Gordon, a research professor at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai School of Medicine. \u201cThe volume of new samples is increasing from around the world.\u201d\n\nMargie Kelly, spokeswoman for the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, added, \u201cWhen it comes to cosmetics regulation it\u2019s the Wild West. The FDA doesn\u2019t have the authority to do much of anything to protect consumers because it is working with a 75-year-old law that has never been substantially updated. So consumers end up with unsafe cosmetics staying on store shelves even after harm has been proven.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Andrew Schneider, Hearst Newspapers", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/hfqa11.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8732\"", "article_summary": "Q: Is talcum powder dangerous to use?\nBut the recently published experiments confirmed that using contaminated talcum powder in closed spaces \u2014 like a small bathroom \u2014 increases the likelihood of inhaling the asbestos fibers.\nWhile many old talc products have been removed from the market, shiploads of others arrive daily.\nLaboratory analysis and court documents show asbestos is often found in cosmetics, body and baby powder, and even the talc used by barbers.\nSo consumers end up with unsafe cosmetics staying on store shelves even after harm has been proven.\u201d\u2013 Andrew Schneider, Hearst Newspapers"}
