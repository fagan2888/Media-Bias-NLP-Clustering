It's got a company that has money to help them. And to help them develop better products. I honestly believe that it's in the best interest for all the folks.\"\n\nHe doesn't expect any workforce reductions in the bargaining unit due to the Textron purchase. Molina also believes this Textron purchase could lead to more work coming to Wichita.\n\n\u201cThis transaction represents an important step forward in the evolution of Beechcraft\u2019s business. The team at Beechcraft has worked tirelessly to strengthen our core business and to maintain our position as a leader in a highly competitive environment,\" Beechcraft CEO Bill Boisture said in a news release. \"Textron\u2019s experience in the industry and its willingness to invest in and maintain the iconic Beechcraft brand make it an ideal parent company, one that will help us continue to satisfy our customers and meet our business objectives at a faster pace.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the transaction, Textron will acquire the Hawker 4000 and Premier IA type certificates. Maintenance services for the aircraft will continue through Beechcraft\u2019s factory-owned service center network, Hawker Beechcraft Services, and Authorized Service Centers around the world with Hawker 4000 and Premier ratings. Beechcraft will continue to provide uninterrupted service and support for all Hawker 4000 and Premier aircraft.\n\nTextron leaders say they plan to hold on to the Beechcraft name, the name coming from Walter Beech when he formed the company in the 1930's.\n\nTextron notes that the Beechcraft's strong brand identity and product line, including the King Air, will allow the company to extend its general aviation business.\n\n\"From our customers' perspective, this creates a broader selection of aircraft and a larger service footprint -- all sharing the same high standards of quality and innovation,\" Textron Chairman and CEO Scott Donnelly said in a release.\n\nThe transaction was unanimously supported by Beechcraft\u2019s board of directors and is expected to close during the first half of 2014 after government approvals.\n\nAnalysts have said this deal is likely a good one for Wichita.\n\n\"In order to have any long term future with investment and new product development, Beechcraft had to be part of a bigger company. It's better to be a part of a company with a serious commitment to aerospace,\" Richard Aboulafia said. \"Textron is definitely a good move in terms of stabilizing (Beechcraft's) presence.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Beechcraft Corporation announced today that Textron has agreed to acquire Beech Holdings, LLC, the parent of Beechcraft Corporation, for approximately $1.4 billion in cash.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "Beechcraft Corporation announced today that Textron has agreed to acquire Beech Holdings, LLC, the parent of Beechcraft Corporation, for approximately $1.4 billion in cash.", "title": "UPDATE: Beechcraft to be bought by Cessna parent company", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Textron-to-acquire-Beechcraft-237378501.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/A42/C83/A42C838FEA96464C9C3A369CA812506A", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/BAA/3AE/BAA3AE96850345C5B4ABBA4D34767CB5.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Beechcraft Corporation announced today that Textron has agreed to acquire Beech Holdings, LLC, the parent of Beechcraft Corporation, for approximately $1.4 billion in cash.", "title": "UPDATE: Beechcraft to be bought by Cessna parent company", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Textron-to-acquire-Beechcraft-237378501.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Beechcraft-NEW-LOGO.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Beechcraft to be bought by Cessna parent company", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Beechcraft to be bought"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93e9\"", "article_summary": "After weeks of rumors, Cessna's parent company, Textron, is the new owner of Beechcraft.\nLast year then Hawker Beechcraft was in discussions with Superior Aviation of China to be purchased.\nBeechcraft Corporation announced Thursday night that Textron has agreed to acquire Beech Holdings, LLC, the parent of Beechcraft Corporation, for approximately $1.4 billion in cash.\n\"In order to have any long term future with investment and new product development, Beechcraft had to be part of a bigger company.\nTextron, based in Providence, R.I., is a strong New York Stock Exchange company that is also known for Bell Helicopter."}
