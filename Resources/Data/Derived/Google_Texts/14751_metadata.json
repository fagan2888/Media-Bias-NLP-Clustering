Well, there were 19 references to God, while the economy rated only 10 mentions. Republicans in Congress have voted dozens of times to repeal all or part of Obamacare, but the candidates only named President Obama\u2019s signature policy nine times over the course of two hours. And energy, another erstwhile G.O.P. favorite, came up only four times.\n\nStrange, isn\u2019t it? The shared premise of everyone on the Republican side is that the Obama years have been a time of policy disaster on every front. Yet the candidates on that stage had almost nothing to say about any of the supposed disaster areas.\n\nAnd there was a good reason they seemed so tongue-tied: Out there in the real world, none of the disasters their party predicted have actually come to pass. President Obama just keeps failing to fail. And that\u2019s a big problem for the G.O.P. \u2014 even bigger than Donald Trump.\n\nStart with health reform. Talk to right-wingers, and they will inevitably assert that it has been a disaster. But ask exactly what form this disaster has taken, and at best you get unverified anecdotes about rate hikes and declining quality.\n\nMeanwhile, actual numbers show that the Affordable Care Act has sharply reduced the number of uninsured Americans \u2014 especially in blue states that have been willing to expand Medicaid \u2014 while costing substantially less than expected. The newly insured are, by and large, pleased with their coverage, and the law has clearly improved access to care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNeedless to say, right-wing think tanks are still cranking out \u201cstudies\u201d purporting to show that health reform is a failure. But it\u2019s a losing game, and judging from last week\u2019s debate Republican politicians know it.\n\nBut what about side effects? Obamacare was supposed to be a job-killer \u2014 in fact, when Marco Rubio was asked how he would boost the economy, pretty much all he had to suggest was repealing health and financial reforms. But in the year and a half since Obamacare went fully into effect, the U.S. economy has added an average of 237,000 private-sector jobs per month. That\u2019s pretty good. In fact, it\u2019s better than anything we\u2019ve seen since the 1990s.\n\nWhich brings us to the economy.\n\nThere was remarkably little economic discussion at the debate, although Jeb Bush is still boasting about his record in Florida \u2014 that is, his experience in presiding over a gigantic housing bubble, and providentially leaving office before the bubble burst. Why didn\u2019t the other candidates say more? Probably because at this point the Obama economy doesn\u2019t look too bad. Put it this way: if you compare unemployment rates over the course of the Obama administration with unemployment rates under Reagan, Mr. Obama ends up looking better \u2013 unemployment was higher when he took office, and it\u2019s now lower than it was at this point under Reagan.\n\nO.K., there are many reasons to qualify that assessment, notably the fact that measured unemployment is low in part because of a decline in the percentage of Americans in the labor force. Still, the Obama economy has utterly failed to deliver the disasters \u2014 hyperinflation! a plunging dollar! fiscal crisis! \u2014 that just about everyone on the right predicted. And this has evidently left the Republican presidential field with nothing much to say.\n\nOne last point: traditionally, Republicans love to talk about how liberals with their environmentalism and war on coal are standing in the way of America\u2019s energy future. But there was only a bit of that last week \u2014 perhaps because domestic oil production has soared and oil imports have plunged since Mr. Obama took office.\n\nWhat\u2019s the common theme linking all the disasters that Republicans predicted, but which failed to materialize? If I had to summarize the G.O.P.\u2019s attitude on domestic policy, it would be that no good deed goes unpunished. Try to help the unfortunate, support the economy in hard times, or limit pollution, and you will face the wrath of the invisible hand. The only way to thrive, the right insists, is to be nice to the rich and cruel to the poor, while letting corporations do as they please.\n\nAccording to this worldview, a leader like President Obama who raises taxes on the 1 percent while subsidizing health care for lower-income families, who provides stimulus in a recession, who regulates banks and expands environmental protection, will surely preside over disaster in every direction.\n\nBut he hasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying that America is in great shape, because it isn\u2019t. Economic recovery has come too slowly, and is still incomplete; Obamacare isn\u2019t the system anyone would have designed from scratch; and we\u2019re nowhere close to doing enough on climate change. But we\u2019re doing far better than any of those guys in Cleveland will ever admit.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150810032003, "twitter": {"description": "Despite their overall condemnation of the Obama record, Republican candidates are oddly short on specifics.", "creator": "PaulKrugman", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/10/opinion/paul-krugman-gop-candidates-and-obamas-failure-to-fail.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003842662"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "G.O.P.
