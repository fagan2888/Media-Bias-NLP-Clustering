He stated bluntly of the current turmoil in the Middle East caused by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants, \u201cWell, I believe if [the Bush administration] hadn\u2019t gone to war in Iraq, none of this would be happening.\u201d\n\nGregory asked him to clarify whether or not he meant the entire current conflict, which is affecting other nations like Syria in addition to Iraq.\n\n\u201cWell, it might be happening in Syria,\u201d Clinton backtracked. \u201cBut what happened in Syria wouldn\u2019t have happened in Iraq. Iraq would not have been in effect drastically altered as it has been.\u201d\n\nHe came down hard on Cheney, placing the responsibility for the \u201cmess\u201d in Iraq solely on the former vice president\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cMr. Cheney has been incredibly adroit for the last six years or so attacking the administration for not doing an adequate job of cleaning up the mess that he made, and I think it\u2019s unseemly,\u201d asserted Clinton.\n\nHe made sure not to insult former President Bush, though, with whom Clinton is known to have a friendly relationship.\n\n\u201cI give President Bush, by the way, a lot of credit for trying to stay out of this debate and letting other people work through it,\u201d he added.\n\nWatch the full NBC segment below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "In an interview with NBC's David Gregory on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday, former President Bill Clinton slammed Dick Cheney and the Bush administration for their decision to go to war with Iraq.", "title": "Bill Clinton laughs at Dick Cheney's criticism of Obama's choices...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/06/clinton-cheney-600x333.jpg", "height": 333}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/06/29/bill-clinton-laughs-dick-cheneys-criticism-obamas-choices-iraq/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "nbc-bill-clinton-iraq", "published_time": "2014-06-29T14:50:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-29T14:50:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9db7\"", "article_summary": "He made sure not to insult former President Bush, though, with whom Clinton is known to have a friendly relationship.\n\u201cWell, it might be happening in Syria,\u201d Clinton backtracked.\nWhen asked about a recent op-ed written by Cheney criticizing President Obama\u2019s foreign policy, Clinton laughed.\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s David Gregory on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday, former President Bill Clinton slammed Dick Cheney and the Bush administration for their decision to go to war with Iraq.\n\u201cI give President Bush, by the way, a lot of credit for trying to stay out of this debate and letting other people work through it,\u201d he added."}
