John Kasich told a standing-room only crowd on Tuesday that he was starting to gain traction in his presidential bid.\n\n\u201cWe did not rise in the polls based on somebody else\u2019s terms,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cOur campaign is rising in the polls based on a vision and a positive message.\u201d\n\nKasich, who is battling three other rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, held his rally at the Caterpillar factory in Broadview Heights after returning from Michigan, where he had hoped to win his first primary. He is also hoping to win Ohio\u2019s primary next week as he and other Republicans try to halt current front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s momentum.\n\nAt one point, Kasich argued that he is best positioned among his Republican brethren to face Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, who held her own Cleveland campaign event Tuesday. He said he was beating Clinton by 11 points in some polls.\n\nWearing a homemade Kasich shirt, Sarah Rish, 32, of Westlake, also mentioned Kasich\u2019s possible crossover appeal after the candidate left the stage.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s got the most experience,\u201d Rish said. \u201cI like his positive message. I think he can appeal to a wide variety of voters, including Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you going to trump Trump?\u201d one man called out as Kasich began a question-and-answer session.\n\nKasich said he thought it was fair to compare records, but he didn\u2019t like the attacks that have dominated the Republican campaign.\n\n\u201cPersonal attacks, I think, are just not acceptable and getting into a personal attack game, especially with (Trump) in particular, I don\u2019t believe works,\u201d Kasich said, but he also added that many of Trump\u2019s supporters have legitimate concerns.\n\n\u201cThis anxiety is real,\u201d Kasich had said earlier in the event.\n\nLater a woman called out that the other three Republican candidates \u201call need their mouth washed out with soap,\u201d drawing laughs from Kasich and the crowd.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to look for lots of opportunities to make sure everybody in America feels as though they have a chance, because if they don\u2019t, we\u2019re a divided country,\u201d Kasich responded when dealing with a question about empowering minorities.\n\nKasich touted his record as governor, pointing out that since he defeated Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland in 2010 there have been 420,000 new jobs created in the state. He also said the state has balanced its budget and now has a $2 billion surplus.\n\nMany in local government have been critical of the Kasich administration for slashing state funding to cities, villages and counties as he balanced the budget.\n\nKasich didn\u2019t shy away from controversies that have hit Cleveland and the nation. He praised protesters for remaining peaceful despite their concerns about police. It was a reference to the decision not to charge two Cleveland police officers in the fatal 2014 shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.\n\nHe said people in the city and state came together to deal with those concerns.\n\n\u201c(That) allowed us to go through some very difficult times without violence in the great city of Cleveland because people were united here, and what they said is, we\u2019re not going backwards, we\u2019re going forward,\u201d Kasich said to applause from the crowd.\n\nKasich also tackled a question from Jenna Bing of Willoughby Hills, who said that pre-existing conditions had prevented her from getting health insurance until Obamacare. Although she said she wasn\u2019t fond of the controversial program, Bing appreciated being able to get covered.\n\nKasich said he wouldn\u2019t allow people to lose health care coverage because of pre-existing conditions, but also criticized Obamacare for having too many regulations. He said he would take federal resources and combine it with Medicaid and create an exchange that allowed people to purchase health insurance at reasonable rates.\n\nHe also said steps need to be taken to control the costs of health care, something he argued Obamacare failed to address. Kasich warned that if something isn\u2019t done to rein in those rising costs, medical care would end up being \u201crationed.\u201d\n\nAfter Kasich wrapped up his roughly 40-minute appearance, Bing said she had been impressed with Kasich, who took her question seriously and wasn\u2019t looking for the next person to call on.\n\n\u201cHe kept eye contact and spoke to me,\u201d Bing said.\n\nHealth care wasn\u2019t the only issue where Kasich said he\u2019d like to give more power to the states on issues ranging from welfare to education.\n\nKasich also talked compromise when asked about reforming Social Security, saying that some problems won\u2019t be able to be solved without working with at least some Democrats. He said he would start working on Social Security reform.\n\nNot everyone who showed up at the event was a Kasich supporter.\n\nTommy Menyes, 21, said he\u2019s an independent voter still making up his mind about whom to support next week, but left the event with a positive impression of the governor.\n\n\u201cI liked what Kasich had to say, but I\u2019m not 100 percent sure I\u2019m going to vote for him,\u201d said Menyes, of Medina.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chronicle-Telegram", "description": "BROADVIEW HTS. \u2014 Surrounded by hulking CAT heavy equipment, Gov.
