And it helps explain why Obama is talking to Buzzfeed and Vox and YouTubers and a podcast run out of some guy\u2019s garage (where he famously cited the N-word).\n\nBut it also means that this president, widely dismissed by the press as a lame duck, is outlasting his opposition on a whole series of issues.\n\nThere was conservative outrage when Obama issued an executive order on illegal immigration that unilaterally halted more deportations. Although it\u2019s now tied up in the courts, this is no longer a front-burner issue in the media.\n\nThere was conservative outrage when Obama normalized relations with Cuba\u2019s Castro regime. But when the embassy opened in Washington the other day, this was no longer a front-burner issue for the media.\n\nThere was liberal outrage when Obama tried to ram through the Pacific trade deal, which the Democrats temporarily delayed. But now that he has passed the measure with Republican support, this is no longer a front-burner issue for the media.\n\nThere was conservative outrage when the president got two big wins in the Supreme Court, on ObamaCare and same-sex marriage. But while Republicans still talk about overturning the health care law, and the most conservative 2016 candidates are still talking about overturning gay marriage, neither is going to happen\u2014and neither is a front-burner issue for the media.\n\nThe greatest conservative outrage of all surrounds the Iran deal, which critics see as a terrible agreement that rewards a terrorist-supporting regime and could actually hasten Tehran\u2019s goal of building nuclear weapons. But two days after the deal was announced, I noticed that the coverage was being eclipsed by\u2026Donald Trump.\n\nOh, and remember ISIS?\n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing about today\u2019s hyperspeed news cycles. Believe it or not, the media actually used to spend weeks, sometimes months, on policy debates.\n\nNow there\u2019s always new outrages to vent about: The Planned Parenthood videos. The killing of Kate Steinle by a much-deported immigration. The suicide of Sandra Bland after being jailed following a minor traffic violation.\n\nAll this affects any national leader trying to build a movement. But I\u2019d say Obama has recently been the biggest beneficiary.\n\nI\u2019d dwell further on this, but I have to go rewatch the video of Lindsey Graham destroying his cell phone.\n\nClick for more Media Buzz\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
