But Stutzman picked up an endorsement from the right, as the political action committee of FreedomWorks gave its endorsement to Stutzman. FreedomWorks is generally aligned with the tea party wing of the Republican Party.\n\nStutzman was one of 25 House Republicans who voted against John Boehner remaining Speaker in January 2015, and he has been on the outs with the Republican rank-and-file in Washington ever since. Young has a conservative voting record, but he supported Boehner even up until his resignation as Speaker last September.\n\nFreedomWorks was never a fan of Boehner, and the group also says Young voted against a bill that would have limited the National Security Agency's ability to conduct surveillance. \u201cMarlin Stutzman is a proven conservative who has fought to reduce regulations, restore the constitutional separation of powers, and repeal ObamaCare,\u201d said Adam Brandon, chairman of the FreedomWorks PAC in a statement announcing the endorsement.\n\nOther conservative groups outside the establishment have also endorsed Stutzman to replace the retiring Sen. Dan Coats, such as the Club for Growth.\n\n@WIBCRaySteele", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.wibc.com/news/local-news/tea-party-group-endorses-stutzman-dan-coats-senate-seat", "type": "article", "image": {"width": 690, "identifier": "http://www.wibc.com/sites/g/files/exi441/f/article-images-featured/486171-286666.jpg", "height": 510}, "site_name": "93.1 WIBC", "title": "Tea Party Group Endorses Stutzman For Dan Coats' Senate Seat"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It's establishment vs. tea party in the Republican U.S. Senate race in Indiana.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "FreedomWorks is generally aligned with the tea party wing of the Republican Party.\nIt's establishment vs. tea party in the Republican U.S. Senate race in Indiana.\nBut Stutzman picked up an endorsement from the right, as the political action committee of FreedomWorks gave its endorsement to Stutzman.\nOther conservative groups outside the establishment have also endorsed Stutzman to replace the retiring Sen.
