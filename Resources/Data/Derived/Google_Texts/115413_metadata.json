Charles Schumer Charles SchumerOvernight Healthcare: House, Senate on collision course over Zika funding Ryan goes all-in on Puerto Rico Cruz's dad: Trump 'would be worse than Hillary Clinton' MORE (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cThis common sense legislation closes the dangerous loophole and holds rental companies to the same standard as auto dealers.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople who rent cars should do so with the confidence that the vehicles they are driving are safe to drive,\" Rep. Lois Capps (D-Calif.) added.\n\nThe bill bars the rental or sale of cars that are \u201csubject to a safety recall\u201d and authorizes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate and oversee rental car companies\u2019 procedures for safety concerning recalled cars.\n\nThe car rental industry initially resisted calls from lawmakers to abide by the legislation before it was passed, but eventually, the major U.S. car rental companies signed on.\n\nAuto manufacturers have opposed previous versions of the measure because they say it will have unintended consequences, such as pushing car rental companies to the front of the repair line when auto models are recalled.\n\nThe Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act is named after sisters who were killed in a 2004 crash involving a rental car that had been recalled. Their mother, Carol Houck, said lawmakers should approve the ban to prevent future accidents like the one that killed her daughters.\n\n\u201cIt's been over ten years since my beautiful, precious daughters Raechel and Jacqueline were killed by an unsafe, recalled rental car,\u201d Houck said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAll of the major rental car companies, and many of the smaller ones, have been working on our side to make the federal legislation named after them the law of the land,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey have also adopted responsible policies and are grounding recalled cars until they are repaired. It's time for Congress to act, to protect all families from suffering our devastating loss.\u201d\n\nThe bill is being sponsored by Schumer and Sens.
