She was admitted with kidney failure, abdominal pain and other symptoms.\n\nSocial workers tried to transfer Huaman to Jackson Memorial so she could receive a lung transplant. Huaman's family says Jackson Health requested a $350,000 deposit for her admittance. She died Wednesday.\n\nJackson Memorial wouldn't comment, citing patient privacy laws.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A woman needing a lung transplant has died after her family says they tried to have her transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital and were denied.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Patient-Needing-Lung-Transplant-Hospital-Transfer-Dies-365560051.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/Medical+Injury+Illness+Hospital++Doctor.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A woman needing a lung transplant has died after her family says they tried to have her transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital and were denied.", "title": "Patient Needing Lung Transplant, Hospital Transfer Dies"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wctv.tv", "description": "A woman needing a lung transplant has died after her family says they tried to have her transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital and were denied.", "title": "Patient Needing Lung Transplant, Hospital Transfer Dies", "url": "http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Patient-Needing-Lung-Transplant-Hospital-Transfer-Dies-365560051.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Medical+Injury+Illness+Hospital++Doctor.jpg", "creator": "@wctv", "site": "@wctv", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Patient Needing Lung Transplant, Hospital Transfer Dies", "google-site-verification": "VLpGbxCsgs1871fd1G59F0FVrlUu5DfthTQ8LrtSaNQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Patient Needing Lung Transplant"}, "article_summary": "Social workers tried to transfer Huaman to Jackson Memorial so she could receive a lung transplant.\nBy: Associated PressJanuary 16, 2016MIAMI (AP) -- A woman needing a lung transplant has died after her family says they tried to have her transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital and were denied.\nJackson Memorial wouldn't comment, citing patient privacy laws.\nMedical records show Huaman had accidentally drank from a cup containing weed killer the day before going to West Kendall Baptist Hospital in mid-December.\nHuaman's family says Jackson Health requested a $350,000 deposit for her admittance."}
