Haven\u2019t you learned, Ferguson?\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, these documents could be given away free of charge if officials deemed that the material was in the public\u2019s interest. As Brown\u2019s death and the subsequent protests in the St. Louis suburb have been in the public eye for months, any related documents pretty clearly qualify.\n\nThe AP\u2019s Jack Gillum reports:\n\nIt billed The Associated Press $135 an hour \u2014 for nearly a day\u2019s work \u2014 merely to retrieve a handful of email accounts since the shooting.

Open records laws are designed to give the public access to government records at little or no cost, and have historically exposed waste, wrongdoing and corruption. \u201cThe first line of defense is to make the requester go away,\u201d said Rick Blum, who coordinates the Sunshine in Government Initiative, a coalition of media groups that advocates for open government. \u201cCharging exorbitant fees to simply cut and paste is a popular tactic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The move is a blatant effort to discourage journalists and civil rights groups from accessing information", "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The move is a blatant effort to discourage journalists and civil rights groups from accessing information", "title": "Ferguson officials charge exorbitant, unnecessary fees for information related to Michael Brown\u2019s death", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/29/ferguson_officials_charge_exorbitant_unnecessary_fees_for_information_related_to_michael_browns_death/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/police-shooting-missouri.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The move is a blatant effort to discourage journalists and civil rights groups from accessing information", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/police-shooting-missouri.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Ferguson officials charge exorbitant, unnecessary fees for information related to Michael Brown\u2019s death", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ferguson officials charge exorbitant, unnecessary fees for information related to Michael Brown\u2019s death", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bureaucracy, Ferguson, michael brown, sunshine act, Transparency", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddce1\"", "article_summary": "Open records laws are designed to give the public access to government records at little or no cost, and have historically exposed waste, wrongdoing and corruption.\nAs Brown\u2019s death and the subsequent protests in the St. Louis suburb have been in the public eye for months, any related documents pretty clearly qualify.\nAccording to the Associated Press, these documents could be given away free of charge if officials deemed that the material was in the public\u2019s interest.\nTopics: bureaucracy, Ferguson, michael brown, sunshine act, Transparency, Social News, Media News, News, Politics NewsFerguson, Missouri, officials are reportedly charging exorbitant fees for access to certain government files related to 18-year-old Michael Brown\u2019s death \u2014 that, mind you, they are legally required to release as part of the the Sunshine Act.\n\u201cCharging exorbitant fees to simply cut and paste is a popular tactic.\u201d"}
