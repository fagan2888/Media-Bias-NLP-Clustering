The survey's Material Cost Index is at its best since July 2012 and third highest since the survey was started nearly a decade ago.\n\nThe October 2013 Overall Survey Index is 54.35, which dipped slightly from July 2013\u2019s Index of 55.07. The average overall index is 54.30 since the survey started in August 2004.\n\nDunlap characterizes the decline as minimal, adding the industry is doing better than any time since the 2008-2009 recession.\n\n\u201cWe described it as \u2018flat\u2019 six months ago and it\u2019s better described now as still \u2018climbing',\" said Dunlap.\n\nHe said the drop was heavily influenced by declines in order backlog and personal outlook.\n\nThe survey, designed to measure the current business activity of the office furniture industry and its suppliers, was completed in October.\n\nDunlap says he is sticking with his six-month-old forecast that the industry will continue to experience modest growth in the fourth quarter of 2013, and then accelerate during first and second quarters 2014.\n\n\u201cI still think that 2014 will be one of the industry\u2019s best in a decade,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cIt will be a good year for the industry. I remain optimistic that 2013 will be the industry\u2019s best year since the 2008-2009 recession and that 2014 will offer us solid growth in most markets.\u201d\n\nThe survey results showed gross shipments declined slightly while order backlog was significantly higher. Employment fell but remained above average as hours worked rose but still remained below average. Capital expenditures remained steady, while tooling expenditures rose. Raw material costs improved as employee costs dropped.\n\n\u201cThe improvements are reflections in the quarterly performance of some of the major manufacturers, but the major improvements are in the mid sized manufacturers,\u201d Dunlap said.\n\nShandra Martinez covers business for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.
