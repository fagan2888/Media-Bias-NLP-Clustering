And they\u2019re interested in health insurance. A recent analysis of healthcare.gov\u2019s first month shows that one in five visitors to the website were ages 19 to 29.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t they buying insurance?\n\n\u2018I Wish My Health Came First, And Not My Debt\u2019\n\nJess Marie, an administrator at Seattle Pacific University\u2019s art department, doesn\u2019t have health insurance. Marie, 27, looked into getting on her husband\u2019s health plan through his work. But that would cost $800 a month.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was definitely a shock,\u201d she said.\n\nMarie is an artist. She works part time at the university, so she doesn\u2019t qualify for full coverage. She could buy a health plan through the school, but it\u2019s too expensive.\n\nShe checked out the state\u2019s health exchange but was disappointed to learn the premiums were still expensive, and that she wouldn\u2019t get qualify for subsidies.\n\n\u201cSince my husband\u2019s income is taken into account, that also makes it harder,\u201d she said. \u201cThat his employer offers insurance \u2013 I didn\u2019t know that rule would also not qualify me for a subsidy.\u201d\n\nMarie said she worries that if something were to happen, it would wipe out their finances. Like many of her peers, she has big school loans to pay off. And the thought of getting into medical debt stresses her out\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s affected almost every decision I\u2019ve made since graduating school,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad it affects my health. I wish my health came first, and not my debt.\u201d\n\nMarie\u2019s financial situation is the story of her generation. Many feel stuck; they\u2019re saddled with student loan debts and are unable to move ahead in life, or even afford health insurance.\n\nTamika Butler is California director of Young Invincibles, a nonprofit group created to include voices of young adults on issues \u2014 including health care. She said young adults are uninsured at a higher rate than the rest of the population \u2014 20 percent nationally.\n\n\u201cWe know those numbers are higher for African-Americans and Latinos,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIn Washington, one in three young African-Americans are currently uninsured, and one in four young Latinos.\u201d\n\nButler said that as a result, young people are one of the highest users of emergency rooms. That\u2019s costly, both for the system and for the individual.\n\nChris Jacob, 21, knows this firsthand. He was in the hospital two years ago for a stomach problem that took a while to diagnose.\n\n\u201cEverything I ate, I threw up. I was losing weight,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was bad.\u201d\n\nJacob, who attends Seattle Central Community College, recently looked at fliers for the state\u2019s health exchange, hoping to buy insurance after that hospital experience.\n\n\u201cAnd now I have all the bills because I don\u2019t have insurance so, yeah, I learned my lesson,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m still paying it off.\u201d\n\nHealth exchanges are counting on people like Jacob to sign up. Their participation in the marketplace is crucial for the Affordable Care Act to work. It helps spread the risk.\n\nThe Young Undecided\n\nJess Marie may not need much convincing to buy a health plan, but her decision hinges on cost. Not having health insurance is already affecting other parts of her life.\n\n\u201cIf someone asks me if I want to go snowshoeing, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Gosh, I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI consciously avoid risky things like that because I\u2019m clumsy and I know something might happen, and it would cause us to go bankrupt if I broke a leg or something. It\u2019s something I think about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "When you think of young invincibles, as the government calls those who haven\u2019t signed up for health insurance, you may think of the dude recklessly riding", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuow.org/post/young-invincibles-more-still-unable-afford-health-insurance", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuow/files/styles/medium/public/201311/mariej-cat-portrait.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When you think of young invincibles, as the government calls those who haven\u2019t signed up for health insurance, you may think of the dude recklessly riding", "title": "Young Invincibles?
