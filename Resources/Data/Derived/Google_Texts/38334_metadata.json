An equally troubling tendency perhaps even more familiar to community banks is the way governments often apply a cookie-cutter approach to their policies.\n\nRegulations are inherently rigid and often fail to account for the unique circumstances of individuals and businesses. That often means a one-size-fits-all approach to a community banking model based on individual relationships and one-on-one service. Think Basel III\u2014a capital framework designed for global financial institutions that nevertheless applies uniform standards on Main Street community banks.\n\nWhile ICBA and community bankers have given everything they\u2019ve got on Capitol Hill and at the regulatory agencies to institute a system of tiered regulation based on size and risk, a radical change to financial accounting due out as soon as this year threatens to deal yet another blow to locally based banking.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board is expected to release its updated accounting standards on credit losses in the fourth quarter. These new standards would require complex modeling and compel banks to recognize losses much earlier than necessary in the credit-loss cycle, penalizing community banks for investing in loans and securities.\n\nWhat does this mean for community banks and their customers? For one, it will mean fewer loans. Currently, community banks don\u2019t make an allowance for loan losses unless they have evidence that they\u2019ll incur a default. Under the FASB\u2019s \u201cexpected loss\u201d model, banks would instead take a hit the moment they make a loan. Not only would banks have to recognize a loss on day one, but the proposal requires complex and expensive modeling tools that will inhibit the ability of local banks to make localized financial decisions. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency estimates that the proposal will increase loan-loss reserves by an average of 30 to 50 percent.\n\nFurther, this plan will only add to the regulatory burdens overwhelming the community banking industry. Forecasting inputs used to predict potential loan losses will never be strong enough to satisfy the scrutiny of bank examiners. There will always be another rock to look under as examiners try to ensure a more precise model. So what we have is an approach to loan losses that is at once expensive, burdensome, time consuming\u2014and yet never enough to satisfy examiners. Bottom line, this proposal is a double whammy of decreased lending and increased regulatory scrutiny for community banks and the customers they serve.\n\nBut there is one other saying that this whole deal brings to mind, which is that you should never try to out-stubborn a cat.\n\nCommunity bankers are a stubborn lot and aren\u2019t about to back down from this radical policy change. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve come up with an alternative proposal for institutions with less than $10 billion in assets that bases loan-loss provisions on historical losses for similar assets. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve met repeatedly with the FASB, including several times at the board\u2019s headquarters in Norwalk, Conn. And it\u2019s why nearly 5,000 community bankers signed a petition advocating ICBA\u2019s simpler approach.\n\nOur nation\u2019s hometown banks have fought and clawed so they can continue serving their communities amid a raft of new regulatory burdens. We\u2019re not about to let yet another cookie-cutter government regulation take hold without a fight.\n\nCamden R.
