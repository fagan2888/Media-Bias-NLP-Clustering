Of all the issues raised by President Obama\u2019s conduct toward Syria, that is the most worrisome. He\u2019s had a year \u2014 a year \u2014 to think this through, to consider the options, to consult his advisers, to make plans. And when the moment came, he froze.\n\nHis decision over the weekend to seek congressional authorization is a sideshow. Yes, it may prove an instructive sideshow, in that it will force legislators out of the peanut gallery and into the arena where high-stakes decisions are truly made; it will create divisions among Republicans and force Democrats to choose between their anti-war leanings and the president who helped change their fortunes for the better.\n\nStill, the move is indicative not of Obama\u2019s purpose, but rather of his paralysis.\n\nThere is an argument that he backed down from unilateral executive action for political reasons. Perhaps \u2014 but that would suggest he is a bad politician, and we know he isn\u2019t.\n\nFirst of all, Obama knows he\u2019ll never again run for president, so the poll numbers showing a distinct lack of enthusiasm for US strikes against the Syrian regime surely don\u2019t concern him as they would\u2019ve in past years, when he was trying to pass ObamaCare or get re-elected.\n\nSecond, his case for action, as stated in his remarks over the weekend, is primarily a moral one against the use of weapons of mass destruction. A solid effort to make that case to the American people, which is not so easy to argue with, would surely carry the day.\n\nAnd when it comes to standing with him or standing with some members of the wildly unpopular Congress demanding he get their say-so first, Obama must know he\u2019d have a greater call on the public\u2019s sympathy. Even more important, Americans may be \u201cwar-weary,\u201d as he said on Saturday, but they also rally behind the flag when the nation acts.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t the politics that made him blink. He blinked because he\u2019s uncertain.\n\nOnce he induced the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to say it didn\u2019t matter whether he acted tomorrow or months from now, he was surely relieved by the opportunity to delay. (If he hadn\u2019t been, he could have called Congress back into session early, instead of waiting until next week for it to return on schedule.)\n\nIn his voice-over prologue to his 1948 film version of \u201cHamlet,\u201d Laurence Olivier says, \u201cThis is the tragedy of a man who could not make up his mind.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s by no means shameful to be likened to Hamlet; after all, Hamlet spoke the greatest poetry ever written in the English language, and his existential torments speak to the deepest truths of human nature. But Hamlet is 20 years old, a college student in shock from his father\u2019s sudden death and his mother\u2019s marriage to his uncle.\n\nHe is not a 52-year-old president of the United States, twice elected to that office to lead the nation. And Hamlet didn\u2019t choose to be the vessel of his father\u2019s vengeance; that task was thrust upon him.\n\nBut Barack Obama chose twice to seek the presidency \u2014 a position that is all about making difficult decisions, especially in the realm of foreign and military policy. The president is tasked by the constitutional structure of the government to think about the national interest in a manner wholly different from the nakedly political calculations of senators and congressmen who are elected not by the country as a whole but by individual states and districts.\n\nThey are not suited to make the kinds of calls the president must make. They can\u2019t sift through the options when it comes to the scope of action, the possible targets and the kinds of countermeasures that might need to be taken afterward to negate a response.\n\nIt\u2019s hard.
