John Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion promotional tour made a pit stop in Ohio when Kasich visited for his annual State of the State speech Wednesday.\n\nKasich, a Republican, unilaterally expanded Medicaid after vetoing a legislative ban on doing so. He says he would repeal the 2010 federal health law that created and funds the expansion, but his presidential campaign is built around its success.\n\nSince announcing his support for Obamacare expansion in February 2013, Kasich has stuck with a short list of easily refuted pro-expansion talking points. Wednesday\u2019s speech in Marietta was no exception.\n\n\u201cThe formula is working: fiscal responsibility, commonsense regulations, and of course always looking to cut taxes,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cAnd with the prosperity that comes from job creation and economic growth, we have the resources to go further and reach out to those who might otherwise be ignored.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we should also take into account the fact that because of the prosperity and the additional resources, we\u2019ve been helping the mentally ill, giving hope to the drug-addicted, the disabled and the working poor, and we should all be proud of that,\u201d he continued.\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion is in no way a product of Ohio\u2019s economic growth: benefits are 100 percent funded by the feds until the end of this year, and expansion enrollment has grown four times faster than private-sector employment.\n\nThe governor didn\u2019t mention his $14 billion 2014-20 cost projection during his State of the State speech, but Obamacare expansion is on track to double that estimate by 2020. Through February, Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion cost federal taxpayers more than $7 billion.\n\nAsserting that Medicaid expansion is \u201cmaking a difference,\u201d Kasich said \u201cmore than 330,000 more women in Ohio now have access to health care\u201d because he accepted federal deficit spending to put working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities on welfare.\n\n\u201cThis means they can get healthy, stay healthy and better participate in the workforce, and expansion has also delivered new resources to help our communities address mental health issues and addiction,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIt is working for our people.\u201d\n\nLast spring, Kasich tried to cut Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and women seeking tests or treatment for breast or cervical cancer. The governor\u2019s attempt to cut the pre-Obamacare programs to match Obamacare expansion\u2019s eligibility limit was blocked by state legislators.\n\nKasich uses drug addicts and the mentally ill to justify his embrace of Obamacare, but Medicaid expansion is not in any way targeted at drug addiction or mental illness \u2014 and an Oregon study of Medicaid expansion found that expansion did not improve health outcomes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
