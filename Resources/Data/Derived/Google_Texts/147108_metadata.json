Cannon - February 4, 2015\n\nGood morning, it\u2019s Wednesday, February 4, 2015. No history parable today, loyal readers, as I\u2019m actually on a fishing trip, but I would mention that on this date in 1941, the USO was created.\n\nI\u2019d also be remiss if I didn\u2019t point you to RealClearPolitics\u2019 front page, which aggregates a host of compelling material this morning. Among them are pieces by S.E.

The idea belonged to Franklin Roosevelt, and on February 4, 1941, it came into being. Six existing social service organizations (Jewish Welfare Board, National Catholic Community Service, Salvation Army, Travelers Aid Association of America, Young Men\u2019s Christian Association [YMCA] and the Young Women\u2019s Christian Organization) lent their expertise and leading officials to the cause of creating the entity.\n\nLess than a year later, the U.S. was plunged into world war, and some 3,000 existing recreational clubs and organizations -- supplemented by 1 million civilian volunteers -- organized USO clubs and functions for the nation\u2019s military personnel.\n\nThese events, notes the Library of Congress, facilitated lively social activity and quiet contemplation alike: \u201cSome soldiers came to dance and watch movies, others to pursue traveler\u2019s information or assistance, still others to write letters, lounge, eat, or seek religious counsel.\u201d\n\nThe USO is most famous today for a subsidiary organization, Camp Shows Inc., created to produce performances with volunteers from the entertainment world. The stars who answered their country\u2019s call included Katharine Hepburn, Edgar Bergen, Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich, and of course, the great Bob Hope.\n\nCarl M.
