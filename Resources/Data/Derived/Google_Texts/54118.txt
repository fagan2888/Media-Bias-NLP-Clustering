Nuns join runners on trek through South Elgin

hello

A contingent of nuns and about 150 other runners took to the streets of South Elgin on Sunday for the second annual Run for the Nuns 5K to help raise money for the Imagine Sisters Movement.

To help warm up and keep up fellow runners' spirits, the nuns took to dancing in the parking lot of the Thornwood Community Center as music poured out nearby speakers.

The 5K course meandered through the Thornwood subdivision, taking advantage of the roads that ring the lake at the center of the neighborhood. The runners were blessed with mild early March weather free of rain, snow, strong winds and cold temperatures, which was noted by race director Christine Kmeic.

"We are so happy with the weather, it is what increased day of registrations," she said.

The annual running event is held in conjunction with the Here I am Lord Vocation Conference at St. Patrick Catholic Church in St. Charles. The Imagine Sisters Movement works to make the public aware of religious life for women and inspire vocations.
