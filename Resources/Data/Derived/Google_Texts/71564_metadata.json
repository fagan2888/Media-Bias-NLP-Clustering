(AP) - Safety Weston Steelhammer had three interceptions and Air Force handed Boise State its worst loss since joining the Mountain West Conference in 2011, beating the Broncos 28-14 Saturday night behind seven takeaways.\n\nQuarterback Kale Pearson rushed for a career-best 127 yards and a TD and threw a touchdown pass as the Falcons (3-1, 1-1) beat Boise State for the first time in three tries.\n\nSteelhammer had two of the four interceptions thrown by Grant Hedrick before he was yanked late in the third quarter. Conference scoring leader Jay Ajayi fumbled twice.\n\nThe last time Air Force forced seven turnovers was in 1992 against Wyoming.\n\nBoise State (3-2, 1-1) had lost just four league games - by a combined seven points - since joining the MWC. Its biggest loss before this was by three points - 34-31 on an overtime field goal against San Diego State last season.\n\nRedshirt freshman Ryan Finley replaced Hedrick late in the third quarter after linebacker Jordan Pierce's 56-yard interception return set up Will Conant's short field goal that made it 20-0. Pierce also blocked a field goal attempt.\n\nJacobi Owens' 10-yard TD run and Garrett Brown's conversion catch made it 28-0 with 11:35 remaining. Owens finished with 108 yards on 24 carries, but fumbled it away twice in the fourth quarter.\n\nFinley's 2-yard pass to Alec Dhaenens with just less than 10 minutes left allowed the Broncos to avoid their first shutout since a 58-0 washout against Washington State in 1997.\n\nThen, the Broncos made it interesting.\n\nTanner Vallejo recovered Owens' fumble at the Air Force 39, and on fourth-and-goal from the 10, Finley found Shane Williams-Rhodes for the score.\n\nWilliams-Rhodes dodged a tackle at the 5 and dived into the end zone, pulling Boise State to 28-14 with 6:21 remaining.\n\nSteelhammer intercepted Finley's fourth-down pass at midfield with 1:38 left.\n\nOn the Broncos' first drive of the night, Steelhammer sacked Hedrick and one play later intercepted him.\n\nAjayi fumbled the ball on Boise State's second possession and Troy Timmerman recovered for Air Force. That led to Pearson's 4-yard TD pass to Brown. Pearson's 5-yard keeper made it 14-0 before Conant kicked a 25-yard field goal as the first half expired.\n\nThe Broncos' only big play of the first half came on Williams-Rhodes' 37-yard punt return to the 15. But Hedrick rolled right and was picked off by Steelhammer a second time, at the 5.\n\nGavin McHenry, whose first-half interception was overturned on replay, picked off Hedrick on the opening drive of the second half, and Connor Healey recovered Ajayi's second fumble on Boise State's next drive.\n\nThe Broncos finally got something going when Hedrick hooked up with Ajayi for 34-yard gain but Jordan Pierce sliced through the line and blocked Dan Goodale's 46-yard field goal attempt.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Safety Weston Steelhammer had three interceptions and Air Force handed Boise State its worst loss since joining the Mountain West Conference in 2011, beating the Broncos 28-14", "language": "english", "author": "AFA Media Relations", "og": {"description": "Safety Weston Steelhammer had three interceptions and Air Force handed Boise State its worst loss since joining the Mountain West Conference in 2011, beating the Broncos 28-14", "title": "Air Force Tops Boise State, 28-14", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Air-Force-Tops-Boise-State-28-14-277354311.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E5C/6C2/E5C6C2329D094075BEFBD507E16F3627", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/73E/93C/73E93C4666D449E3950CB58D575F8B5D.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "Safety Weston Steelhammer had three interceptions and Air Force handed Boise State its worst loss since joining the Mountain West Conference in 2011, beating the Broncos 28-14", "title": "Air Force Tops Boise State, 28-14", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Air-Force-Tops-Boise-State-28-14-277354311.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/affootball.jpg", "creator": "@kktv11news", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Air Force Tops Boise State, 28-14", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Air Force Tops Boise State"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ace\"", "article_summary": "AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo.
