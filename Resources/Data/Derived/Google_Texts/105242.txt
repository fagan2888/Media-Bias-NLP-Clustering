One woman was airlifted from the scene of a plane crash in Alcorn County this morning.

Investigators say the plane had taken off from Roscoe Turner Airport around 8:30 this morning. The pilot apparently noticed the flap on one of the wings was stuck and attempted to return to the airport. The plane landed in the yard of a home southeast of the airport.

One person from the airplane sustained serious injuries and was flown to a Memphis hospital.
