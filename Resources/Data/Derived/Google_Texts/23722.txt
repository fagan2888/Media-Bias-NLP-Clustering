PEETZ — On Sept. 10, Taive Cox, Josh Fiscus, and Megan Gillham of Peetz High School attended the “You are Here, Celebration for Young Entrepreneurs” event in Denver.

There the students showcased their business, Peetz Perks, talking to several business people mainly from the Denver area.

After showcasing the business, there was an award ceremony and celebratory dinner, during which Cox gave an acceptance speech in front 650 people to accept a $1,500 grant that Peetz Perks received.

Peetz Perks is a coffee and smoothie operation that is run out of the Peetz School's Library. Junior and seniors who are enrolled in Tammy Fehringer's entrepreneurship class operate the cart. In the spring of 2013, Fehringer and Cox applied for the grant that was offered by the Young Americans Center for Financial Education.

Currently the operation only sells to staff and students, but is hoping to expand the business to community members as well. The cart is operated from 9:45 to 11 a.m. Monday through Friday.
