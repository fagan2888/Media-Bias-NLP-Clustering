Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens), the \u201cHealth For All\u201d bill due to come before the Senate Committee on Appropriations tomorrow.\n\nThe study, a joint effort of the UC-Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, found that the roughly 700,000 undocumented people living in California could get preventive health coverage next year at a cost to the state of just over $350 million.\n\nThat represents a 2% bump in Medi-Cal spending, according to the researchers.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, undocumented are excluded from coverage. The Lara bill would extend benefits to the uninsured, theoretically balancing the books to some degree by saving the state money on emergency department and hospitalization costs.\n\n\u201cThe proposed Medi-Cal expansion would involve new state spending, but the cost is modest in comparison to the impact on health and coverage, and the policy also produces savings,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe study made four main points:\n\nNet spending increase for the state would be equivalent to 2% of its Medi-Cal spending, compared to an enrollment increase of 7% in 2015;\n\nNew spending would be \u201csubstantially offset\u201d by an increase in state sales tax revenue from health care insurers and a reduction in county spending on the uninsured population;\n\nSpending would increase from between $353 and $369 million in 2015, and eventually grow to between $424 and $436 million by 2019; and\n\nMedi-Cal enrollment would add up to 730,000 individuals in 2015, eventually growing to as many as 790,000 people in 2019.\n\n\u201cCalifornia would be the first in the nation to make its health insurance program inclusive of all low-income residents and their families, including those who are undocumented,\u201d said Laurel Lucia, policy analyst at the UCB Labor Center in a written statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>A new study released two days before related legislation is due to be heard in committee suggests costs of providing health insurance for all Californians -- including undocumented individuals -- would be relatively low and the payoff relatively high. </p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "A new study released two days before related legislation is due to be heard in committee suggests costs of providing health insurance for all Californians \u2014 including undocumented individuals\u2026", "title": "UC-Berkeley Study Validates Legislation To Insure Undocumented in California", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/ucberkeley-study-validates-legislation-to-insure-the-undocumented-in-state/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-05-22T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A study released yesterday shows modest cost and potentially strong benefit for insuring the undocumented in California.\nThat represents a 2% bump in Medi-Cal spending, according to the researchers.\n\u201cThe proposed Medi-Cal expansion would involve new state spending, but the cost is modest in comparison to the impact on health and coverage, and the policy also produces savings,\u201d the study said.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, undocumented are excluded from coverage.\nThe study, a joint effort of the UC-Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, found that the roughly 700,000 undocumented people living in California could get preventive health coverage next year at a cost to the state of just over $350 million."}
