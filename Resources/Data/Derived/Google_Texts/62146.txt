President Obama resumed fund-raising for the Democrats, his first event since his party took a beating in the midterm elections.

The President headlined a ritzy roundtable event at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington on Tuesday night to benefit the Democratic National Committee.

The DNC said approximately 30 attendees were present, for the price of $32,400 each.

Before the party's searing loss on Nov. 4 Obama and the First Lady traveled the country in full force to drum up support among the base.

But many Democrats blamed the party's poor showing at the polls on Obamacare and the President's unpopularity.
