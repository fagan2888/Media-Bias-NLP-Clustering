Ron Johnson (R\u2014Wisc.) filed the suit related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provision that members of Congress and their staff may only receive health plans created under the healthcare law, or offered through a online exchange established under the law. The lawsuit claimed that the federal Office of Personnel Management \u201ccreated a loophole that allowed congressional staff an exemption from the ACA\u2019s provisions,\u201d according to the decision.\n\nThe so-called loophole allowed some junior staffers not considered part of the official office of a member of Congress to continue receiving employee benefits, rather than having to buy insurance under the law.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration violated its own signature health care law by giving special treatment to members of Congress and their staffs,\u201d Johnson said in a statement Monday.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Griesbach dismissed the lawsuit on Monday. Griesbach said Senator Johnson failed to show he\u2019d been harmed by the healthcare law, Reuters reports.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court affirmed in 2012 the law\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d that requires most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A U.S. Senator's claim against an Obamacare subsidy for members of Congress and their staffs was dismissed Monday", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Sen.
