"It worked out pretty good."

That's how Victoria Quarterback Brady Dinkel summed up the final play of the 8-man Division II State Championship game. A massive understatement considering the implications. Dinkel just needed to pick up one yard to move the sticks with time running out in a tied game with just seconds left. Instead he broke loose for a 55 yard game winning touchdown.

"I don't know. It was open so I ran," Dinkel recalled after the game. "I didn't know I had it until I crossed the goal line. I knew we needed to get something done there so I figured I would try and make something happen I guess."

It was truly a storybook ending for the Senior. He missed a large portion of the season with serious injuries to his liver and pancreas. Dinkel was rushed to the emergency room after Victoria's week one win over Claflin-Central Plains and eventually flown to Wichita for treatment. But when he returned to the field in week nine, he did so with vengeance.

"He's had a rough year. I know his year didn't go the way he wanted it to go in terms of being on the field. I think he made up for it today, obviously. Phenomenal day by him," exclaimed Victoria Head Coach Doug Oberle.

Dinkel accounted for 173 rushing yards, 70 passing yards and four total touchdowns. No one could stop him... Except for KAKE Sports Rachel Kilmer. Rachel took a big hit from Dinkel on the sidelines after a rushing touchdown.

After the game, the two about the collision and she tried to get him to talk about his triumphant return from injury, to no avail. Dinkel is as humble as they come.

On his return he said simply, "I'm just here to help the team out and whatever I can do, I'm fine with that."

Dinkel told KAKE Sports he does hope to play football in college, although he is still awaiting his first offer.
