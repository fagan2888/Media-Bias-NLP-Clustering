Simultaneously, the country defunded public mental health services. A ballooning criminal justice system came in to fill that vacuum. Now the Florida Legislature is poised to reform the way mental illness is handled in that system.\n\nMany call America\u2019s criminal justice system a de facto mental health care system. And Florida is no different. On any given day in the Sunshine State, there are 40,000 people with serious mental illness involved in the criminal justice system. And many of those offenses directly result from untreated mental illness. Mark Mahon, chief judge of the state\u2019s 4th judicial district, says the system has to change.\n\n\u201cThe present system, with so many people with mental health illnesses, that the present system is ineffective, and expensive and frankly inhumane,\u201d he said.\n\nNow some state lawmakers are offering proposals that could stem the flow of these people into the correctional system, and help them once they\u2019re there. Representative Charles McBurney of Jacksonville and Senator Miguel Diaz de la Portilla of Miami want to divert people with mental illness away from incarceration and towards care. McBurney says his eyes were first opened to the issue during his time as an assistant state attorney.\n\n\u201cAnd it seemed that case after case that I dealt with usually were one of two matters: there was substance abuse or mental illness. And quite often it was both. It was substance abuse because of mental illness. And there simply wasn\u2019t anything we could do for most instances except incarcerate,\u201d he said.\n\nMcBurney\u2019s bill would pave the way for mental health courts, which offer an alternative to incarceration, and emphasize the importance of treatment and therapy. McBurney says the aim of these and other diversion programs is to reduce recidivism.\n\n\u201cSo the mental health court structure is similar to for example and patterned upon drug courts, which have been very successful. In addition, this bill expands veterans\u2019 courts, particularly in those situations in which the criminal justice system intersects such as probation and community control,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator John Legg of Lutz and Representative Kathleen Peters of St. Pete want to support people with mental illness once they have entered the criminal justice system. Their reforms focus specifically on defendants who are incompetent to stand trial because of mental illness or disability. These defendants are then transferred from jails into therapy programs. This bill would keep defendants on the same medications when they make that transition. John Bryant is an assistant secretary for mental health at the Department of Children and Families.\n\n\u201cThey arrive with mediation from the jail, yet once they arrive at out facility refuse to take that medication,\u201d he said.\n\nWith medication and therapy, some regain the ability to stand trial, and a hearing may be scheduled. The bill would set a timeline for these hearings to take place. Here\u2019s Bryant again.\n\n\u201cAlthough 85% of the courts basically have scheduled the hearing, and have that court hearing scheduled within 30 days, there\u2019s about 15% of the individuals that we have residing within our facilities who have not had that hearing scheduled. We believe that it\u2019s important to ensure that those individuals have the same rights as everybody else,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some may not recover, may never stand trial, and may ultimately be released. Dan Hendrickson served as an assistant public defender for 25 years, and now works for the Big Bend Mental Health Coalition. Hendrickson wants the system to do more for people re-entering society.\n\n\u201cThe issue for people being in the hospital is not just to solve the competency but to figure out what\u2019s going to happen when they get back home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe House has passed both bills unanimously, and a full Senate vote is expected before the end of session.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Since the 1970s, the hard on crime ethos has fueled the era of mass incarceration.
