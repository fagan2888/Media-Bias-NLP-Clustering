It said federal regulators approved California's process for verification.\n\nThe exchange also said its efforts were hampered by the federal data hub frequently being offline in the fall.\n\nDuring open enrollment, Covered California often needed to resolve inconsistencies on customer applications and get further documentation.\n\nThe audit found that in 19 of 25 applications it reviewed, Covered California didn't resolve those discrepancies.\n\nFor instance, the exchange told an applicant in November there was a discrepancy in their household income and asked for additional documents. But the exchange never resolved the issue and allowed the person to remain enrolled with a premium subsidy, according to the audit.\n\nCovered California told auditors it \"did not have the resources to resolve all inconsistencies as required\" and in some cases reviews weren't being completed within the normal 90-day period.\n\nIn one case, Covered California understated an applicant's monthly income when processing a paper application. That could lead to the person receiving too much premium assistance and having to repay it later.\n\nCovered California said it was developing a more extensive quality control process for paper applications.\n\nThe state exchange is taking applications now during a special enrollment period for people who have a qualifying event, such as losing employer insurance or moving. The next open enrollment begins in November.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Federal audit faults California exchange for lax enrollment practices", "date": "2014-07-01", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Federal auditors found that California's health insurance exchange was lax at times in verifying consumers' eligibility for Obamacare coverage.", "title": "Federal audit faults California exchange for lax enrollment practices", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-covered-california-federal-audit-20140701-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53b2ec37/turbine/la-fi-covered-california-federal-audit-20140701", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obamacare, Covered California, Affordable Care Act", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80691221", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Covered California, Affordable Care Act", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Federal auditors found that California's health insurance exchange was lax at times in verifying consumers' eligibility for Obamacare coverage.
