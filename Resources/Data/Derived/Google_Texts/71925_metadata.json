Mark Dayton is seeking $500,000 for a task force that would consider future options for MNsure including a possible switch to the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov website.\n\nDayton made the pitch in a letter to lawmakers released Monday. It said the task force would also review options for changing the state\u2019s public health insurance programs.\n\nReverting to the federal exchange is just one of several MNsure reforms being put forward by Republicans at the Capitol, and DFL lawmakers have said the proposal brings new costs without solving problems for the portion of MNsure used in public health insurance programs.\n\n\u201cThe launch of MNsure created serious problems for many consumers,\u201d Dayton wrote. \u201cAlthough we have seen significant improvements, there are still important unresolved issues.\u201d\n\nRep. Kurt Daudt, a Republican from Crown and Speaker of the House, said he was skeptical of Dayton\u2019s proposal because the task force wouldn\u2019t provide recommendations until Jan. 1, 2016. The Legislature needs to act more quickly, Daudt said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve really seen the governor suggest that maybe we need to look at going to the federal exchange,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in session right now. \u2026 We can do all of that without spending $500,000 on a task force, and waiting another 10 months.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, said lawmakers don\u2019t have time and information for making an informed decision about going to the federal website during the current session.\n\nOn Monday evening, House Republicans held their first committee hearing on a bill for scrapping MNsure and reverting to HealthCare.gov by Jan. 1, 2017. More than 30 states use the federal website for their health exchange, which individuals use to purchase non-group coverage.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have pricing, to the best of my knowledge, for what their ideas cost,\u201d Lourey said in an interview. \u201cTo talk about it in the construct of a task force is fine. There are a lot of reasons why we decided to go with a state-based exchange.\u201d\n\nThe task force proposal is part of Dayton\u2019s supplemental budget, which is scheduled for full release on Tuesday. If the Legislature provides the funding, it would go toward policy, financial and actuarial reports to help craft recommendations.\n\nThe task force would consider MNsure\u2019s long-term viability, Dayton wrote, as well as \u201copportunities for federal waivers\u201d \u2014 both apparent references to recent Capitol debates over MNsure.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s financial viability has been questioned because MNsure has fallen short of projections for enrollment in private coverage through the exchange.\n\nOn waivers, Rep. Tara Mack, R-Apple Valley, has a bill for seeking a federal waiver so that Minnesotans could receive tax credits to buy private policies directly from insurance companies. Those subsidies currently are available only to MNsure customers, and some MNsure supporters have said they oppose making tax credits available outside the exchange.\n\nIn his letter, Dayton said the task force also would consider \u201cpost-ACA options,\u201d using the abbreviation for the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nPeople use MNsure not only to buy non-group private policies, but also MinnesotaCare and Medical Assistance \u2014 the state\u2019s health insurance programs for lower income residents. Between Nov. 15 and March 8, more than 183,000 people enrolled in coverage through MNsure, including about 122,000 in public health insurance programs and roughly 61,000 in private plans.\n\n\u201cWe need to undertake a comprehensive review of our future options to provide high-quality, affordable health coverage for all Minnesotans,\u201d Dayton wrote.\n\nMNsure critics have had a field day at the Capitol recently, with a lengthy audit in February concluding that failures outweighs achievements during MNsure\u2019s first year of operations. Subsequent hearings have detailed how problems with the MNsure system persist.\n\nEven so, Dayton\u2019s letter notes progress in recent years.\n\n\u201cToday, more Minnesotans have health insurance than ever before, preventive services are available at no cost to insured patients, and sick people can no longer be charged more for their coverage,\u201d Dayton wrote.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The governor wants the task force to consider options including reverting to the federal government's HealthCare.gov website.", "title": "Dayton proposes task force to consider MNsure options", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/dayton-proposes-task-force-to-consider-mnsure-options/296486211/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142439742330573.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142439742330573.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The governor wants the task force to consider options including reverting to the federal government's HealthCare.gov website.", "title": "Dayton proposes task force to consider MNsure options", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/dayton-proposes-task-force-to-consider-mnsure-options/296486211/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142439742330573.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_142439742330573.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The governor wants the task force to consider options including reverting to the federal government's HealthCare.gov website."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1ca\"", "article_summary": "Mark Dayton is seeking $500,000 for a task force that would consider future options for MNsure including a possible switch to the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov website.\nIt said the task force would also review options for changing the state\u2019s public health insurance programs.\nIn his letter, Dayton said the task force also would consider \u201cpost-ACA options,\u201d using the abbreviation for the federal Affordable Care Act.\nThe task force would consider MNsure\u2019s long-term viability, Dayton wrote, as well as \u201copportunities for federal waivers\u201d \u2014 both apparent references to recent Capitol debates over MNsure.\n\u201cTo talk about it in the construct of a task force is fine."}
