Together, officials say the group made more than $100 million in profits off illegal trades.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile investigators and prosecutors say they\u2019ve been attuned to the threat for years, most thought the incidents were unaffiliated outliers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it wasn\u2019t a huge concern,\u201d said Andre McGregor, a former FBI special agent in the Cyber Division who\u2019s now with Tanium, a security firm that works with top U.S. banks. \u201cI think it was more that everyone thought that it was isolated to one particular incident for a company.\u201d\n\nBut experts now say the global enterprise revealed this week is likely one of multiple cyber crime groups digitally pilfering information to illegally play the stock market in a way that is barely perceptible to authorities.\n\n\u201cClearly there\u2019s concern that if the government was unable to uncover this crime how many more are there?\u201d said Austin Berglas, former head of the FBI\u2019s New York Cyber Branch and a lead investigator into last fall\u2019s breach at JPMorgan Chase.\n\nFormer federal officials like McGregor and Berglas recounted coming across early hints of what hackers were doing as far back as 2006, with things picking up around 2010.\n\n\u201cWe had cases where people were using cyber techniques to hack into accounts and send out massive amounts of spam to artificially inflate the price of penny stocks, and then dump it and make their money,\u201d Berglas said.\n\nMost recently, the four people arrested in relation to the JPMorgan hack were accused of using these tactics on at least five stocks between 2011 and 2012.\n\nMatthew Schwartz, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York from 2005 to 2015 and senior member of the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, recalled recently prosecuting an IT staffer at major law firm that did corporate work for Silicon Valley companies.\n\n\u201cHe used his access to the law firm\u2019s computer systems and exceeded his authorized access to get access to all sorts of pending mergers activity and traded ahead of it,\u201d Schwartz said.\n\nBut the indictment unsealed Tuesday is staggering in comparison.\n\n\u201cSomething that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Berglas, now head of U.S. cyber investigations for security firm K2 Intelligence.\n\nAccording to authorities, the Ukrainian-based group regularly cracked computer networks at three of the top business newswire services, which publish earnings reports and press releases on mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe hackers would grab releases after they were uploaded but before they had been published. The information was then quickly fed to various traders and hedge fund managers, who would make tidy but conservative profits off advance trading, avoiding detection.\n\nThe scheme was anything but haphazard, according to the indictment.\n\nThe hackers had glossy videos of their digital break-ins that they used to impress and recruit traders. The organizers sent detailed tutorials to traders on how to clandestinely access a secret, overseas server that held the purloined releases.\n\nTraders could even create \u201cshopping lists\u201d or \u201cwish lists\u201d for the hackers, the FBI said.\n\n\u201cThe hackers were running a business,\u201d said Schwartz, now a partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner. \u201cThey were selling that information, they were taking orders.\u201d\n\nResearchers have also seen evidence the criminal ring as a harbinger of things to come.\n\nSecurity firm FireEye last December published a report with the first public evidence of a coordinated hacking group working to exploit the market.\n\nThat team, known as FIN4, posed as outside consultants, tricking employees into giving up confidential information or granting access to a company\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cFIN4 was the first time we really got a good glimpse into how these types of operations might work,\u201d said Jen Weedon, FireEye threat intelligence manager.\n\nThe hackers were so skilled at using industry jargon that Weedon suspects they had recruited people within these companies, or at least were \u201cworking with people who understood the market,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI do think that these more creative and multifaceted attacks will continue,\u201d Weedon added. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of what\u2019s to come.\u201d\n\nThe two examples reveal how hackers can slowly gather data over time to subtly exploit the stock market. The operation broken up this week has allegedly been in business since at least 2010. FIN4 has existed since at least 2013, according to FireEye.\n\nThis slow burn \u201cis incredibly difficult to identify,\u201d Berglas explained.\n\nFor years, insider trading was relatively easy to spot: it often involved a big bet on a single stock, former federal officials said. But in a digital era, spotting insider trading involves mapping and detailing activity over several years to see if an individual or company is consistently beating the market.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of analysis,\u201d Berglas said. \u201cDevoting the resources to do that is significant.\u201d\n\nBerglas worries foreign adversaries may use shell companies as fronts to play the market with stolen data. China, Russia and Iran are all widely believed to have strong digital footholds in many major American companies.\n\nThe practice, he said, could go undetected for years.\n\n\u201cThat would be very, very difficult to uncover.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "An international hacking ring made over $100 million in illegal trades.", "description": "An international hacking ring made over $100 million in illegal trades.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "An international hacking ring made over $100 million in illegal trades.", "title": "Hackers cash in with insider trading", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/251174-hackers-cash-in-with-insider-trading", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/stockmarket_082914getty2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/251174-hackers-cash-in-with-insider-trading", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-16T09:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Meghashyam Mali", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-16T09:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/251174-hackers-cash-in-with-insider-trading", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "An international hacking ring made over $100 million in illegal trades.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hackers cash in with insider trading"}, "dcterms.title": "Hackers cash in with insider trading"}, "article_summary": "The bust of an international hacking ring that spent years manipulating the stock market has many proclaiming a new, insidious era of insider trading.\nFor years, insider trading was relatively easy to spot: it often involved a big bet on a single stock, former federal officials said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of what\u2019s to come.\u201dThe two examples reveal how hackers can slowly gather data over time to subtly exploit the stock market.\nBut in a digital era, spotting insider trading involves mapping and detailing activity over several years to see if an individual or company is consistently beating the market.\nThe hackers had glossy videos of their digital break-ins that they used to impress and recruit traders."}
