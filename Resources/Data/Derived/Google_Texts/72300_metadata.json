preparing a Thanksgiving Day meal for those in need within the community, where people gained good food and fellowship with others on this Thanksgiving Day.\n\n\u201cWe try to be a family,\u201d explained Fannie Johnson, Executive Director of Love\u2019s Kitchen, \u201cthat community kitchen like at home, your kitchen is where a lot of stuff happens, where the family meetings happen, where everybody gets together, so we sort of have a kitchen like that too.\u201d\n\nThe Thanksgiving Day Meal had all the fixings, from turkey and dressing to cranberry sauce, rolls, mac-n-cheese, greens, sweet potatoes, desserts and more, with the meal being provided by donations from those within the community.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely wonderful, everything we needed came in and we have extra, we have extra turkeys already, we have canned goods all over the place, this community is really coming through,\u201d explained Johnson, \u201cI have been here 8 years and it seems like every year just gets bigger and better and the community keeps taking care of us,\u201d\n\nVolunteers prepared nearly 300 plates so visitors could return for seconds, there was also a widescreen TV showing a football game to help those eating feel comfortable and there was a lot to be thankful for by all at Love Kitchen.\n\n\u201cOur clients get to be thankful every day,\u201d stated Johnson, \u201cbut today is a little special because breakfast we had pancakes, eggs, bacon, juice, milk, coffee, it was a little over the top for us, because we usually serve a basic breakfast and the same thing at lunch, so today they know they get to come and get a good hot meal but today is a little extra, they feel like home, they get to eat too much and act like they are at home with their mom and dad.\u201d\n\nJohnson says they had plenty of volunteers to help make Thanksgiving Day happen, who were all happy to help give back to the community.\n\n\u201cThey do so many good things, you give different things that people can use and not use and everybody has to have food and like the name says Love\u2019s Kitchen, they do a lot of good things for a lot of people,\u201d explained Dave Owen, Volunteer at Loves Kitchen\n\nIf you would like to donate to Love's Kitchen you can call them at (601)693-1409, they are open Monday through Saturday serving Breakfast and Lunch.", "article_metadata":
