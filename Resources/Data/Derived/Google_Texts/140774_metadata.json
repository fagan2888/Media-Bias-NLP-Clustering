At a hearing in December, a three-judge panel asked tough questions of lawyers on both sides of that case.\n\nMoreover, lawyers say, even if the birth control policy is ultimately upheld in court, the government could face practical problems lining up third parties to pay for contraceptives over an employer\u2019s objections.\n\nSister Constance Veit, a spokeswoman for the Little Sisters of the Poor, said: \u201cWe live our lives very far from the public eye. We are not political activists at all. But we fear that the mandate could set a precedent for greater government intrusion into our ministry.\n\n\u201cOur health plans have never included contraceptives, and we\u2019ve never had any complaints,\u201d Sister Constance said. \u201cIt has never been an issue for our staff.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe appeals court decisions, in favor of the government, involve a wide range of nonprofit religious organizations that are eligible for a dispensation from rules requiring employers to cover birth control for women. On Friday, the administration offered similar relief to certain closely held for-profit corporations that oppose covering contraceptives because of the owners\u2019 religious beliefs.\n\nSome nonprofit religious groups are still battling the administration in court, and some for-profit employers might do so, but the appeals court decisions will bolster the government\u2019s position.\n\nIn a typical opinion, Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, wrote this month, \u201cWhen Wheaton College tells us that it is being \u2018forced\u2019 to allow \u2018use\u2019 of its health plans to cover emergency contraceptives, it is wrong.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn fact, Judge Posner wrote, the college \u2014 a Christian school in Illinois \u2014 is required only to inform its insurers or the government \u201cthat it will not use its health plans to cover emergency contraception, that it is out of the loop.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more full-time employees are generally required to offer health coverage or pay substantial penalties. Under federal rules, the insurance must cover preventive services, including all forms of contraception approved for women by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nHouses of worship, including churches, temples and mosques, are automatically exempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement and do not have to file any paperwork.\n\nAnother group of employers \u2014 nonprofit religious organizations that object to such coverage on religious grounds \u2014 are eligible for an \u201caccommodation\u201d: They are deemed to comply with the requirement if they report their objections to their health insurance companies and the administrators of their health plans, or to the secretary of health and human services.\n\nThis arrangement, which some judges call an opt-out mechanism, is available to certain schools and universities, hospitals and charities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany Roman Catholic, Baptist and other religious groups have challenged the opt-out procedure, saying it makes them complicit in providing contraceptive coverage. But so far they have lost in federal appeals courts in the District of Columbia, Philadelphia, Chicago and New Orleans.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs have not shown a substantial burden on their religious exercise,\u201d Judge Jerry E. Smith wrote last month in an opinion for a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans.\n\nPlaintiffs in that case, led by East Texas Baptist University, argued that the opt-out procedure violated a federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, because it forced them to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the coverage of contraceptives.\n\nWhen an employer objects to providing contraceptive coverage for religious reasons, the insurer or administrator of its group health plan is supposed to pay for the contraceptives, at no cost to women or the employer. The insurer must make clear to women that their employer does not provide or pay for contraceptive benefits. The federal government has several ways to reimburse insurers.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter analyzing these requirements, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected challenges by Priests for Life, Catholic University of America and other Roman Catholic groups.\n\n\u201cReligious nonprofits that opt out are excused from playing any role in the provision of contraceptive services, and they remain free to condemn contraception in the clearest terms,\u201d wrote Judge Cornelia T. L. Pillard of the appeals court here. The Affordable Care Act, she wrote, \u201cimposes an independent obligation\u201d on insurers and third-party administrators to provide coverage.\n\nAdam C. Jed, a Justice Department lawyer, explained that when a nonprofit religious group refuses to provide contraceptive coverage, \u201cthe government then steps in and fills the gap.\u201d\n\nBut that arrangement is abhorrent to some religious groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, because the government can rely on information provided by the employer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe action of the religious employer is the trigger for contraceptive coverage,\u201d said Mark L. Rienzi, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who represents the nuns. \u201cThe government wants to use our plan and our plan\u2019s information to provide this coverage.\u201d\n\nSome judges disagree.\n\n\u201cFar from \u2018triggering\u2019 the provision of contraceptive coverage,\u201d the opt-out is a way for employers to declare that they \u201cwill not be complicit\u201d in providing such coverage, wrote Judge Marjorie O. Rendell of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia.\n\nCritics of the contraceptive coverage requirement won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled last year in favor of Hobby Lobby Stores and two other closely held family-owned corporations that objected to certain forms of birth control. Forcing those companies to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees violates the 1993 law protecting religious freedom, the court said.\n\nJustices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Anthony M. Kennedy praised the opt-out procedure for nonprofit groups as an alternative to the all-or-nothing mandate imposed on companies like Hobby Lobby.\n\nThe opt-out \u201cachieves all of the government\u2019s aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty,\u201d Justice Alito wrote.\n\nFederal appeals courts have cited those comments as a reason to uphold the administration\u2019s latest effort to guarantee access to contraceptive coverage for women insured by Roman Catholic hospitals, universities and charities.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news",
