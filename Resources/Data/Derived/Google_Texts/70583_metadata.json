The song can be downloaded for free above, and a stream of it, along with a letter from Marc about the song, can be found below.\n\nMarc just did some local dates with John Zorn, and though he\u2019s over in Europe for some shows there as we speak, when he\u2019s back he\u2019ll do a 6-night run at the Village Vanguard from November 5-10. Those shows will be with his Marc Ribot trio which also includes Henry Grimes on bass and Chad Taylor on drums.\n\nAll dates are listed, along with the song stream and letter, below\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\nCeramic Dog \u2013 Aint Gonna Let Them Turn Us Round (aka Affordable Health Care Act song)\n\n\n\n\n\nI never thought that much about \u2018health care systems\u2019 until my daughter was born on England\u2019s National Health Service. My partner and I had been living in NYC, but lacked health insurance, and couldn\u2019t get any because pregnancy was a \u2018pre-existing condition\u2019. The cost- not including (pre-post natal care) at NYC hospitals was $16,000 \u201cif everything went perfectly\u201d: we didn\u2019t have it. My partner was from England, and her mom lived in South London, so off we went. Lewisham Hospital isn\u2019t in a rich area, and it wasn\u2019t as squeaky and new as some in the US- but the care was great: they had a better licensed mid-wives program than any I\u2019ve seen. both midwives, nurses, (and even the doctor!!!) visited us at home both before and after the birth. And it was all free. My daughter was born at around 2am after a difficult labor, and the next day my partner was having trouble sleeping in a room with other moms and babies. So, I asked if it would be possible to get a private room. I misinterpreted the nurse\u2019s quizzical expression, and quickly added, \u2018oh don\u2019t worry, we can pay for it\u2019\u2026 At which point she stiffened her back and raised her chin in the way only an English nurse can, and, looking at me with a combination of pity and disgust, replied: \u201d sir, we have no private rooms. We have single rooms, and they\u2019re available based on need, not ability to pay. If your wife needs a single room, i\u2019ll make sure your she gets one.\u201d\n\nWhen I thought about it, something clicked in my brain. How could we have ever even thought of doing things differently? The National Affordable Health Care Act is, unfortunately, no NHS. But I wonder if any of the Republicans ranting about \u2018socialism\u2019 have any idea of what it is that they\u2019re willing to blow up the economy in order to avoid. And so I wrote this little tune.
