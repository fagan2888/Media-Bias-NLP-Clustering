US healthcare spending on track to hit $10k per person in 2015

CMS' National Health Expenditure Projections 2013-2023 show healthcare spending growth over the next several years, with expenditure projected to hit $3.21 trillion in 2015.

The U.S. population is about 320 million, which makes 2015 "the first year healthcare spending will reach $10,000 per person," according to a Forbes report.

Other notable findings for 2015 from CMS' projections include the following:

Health spending is projected to grow 6 percent annually from 2015 through 2023. The growth is largely due to "continued implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act coverage expansions, faster projected economic growth, and the aging of the population."

In 2015, Medicare growth is projected to slow 2.7 percent due to lower payments to Medicare Advantage plans.

Medicaid spending is expected to grow by 6.7 percent in 2015.
