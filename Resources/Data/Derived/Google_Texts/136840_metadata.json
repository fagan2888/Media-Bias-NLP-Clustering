If they live in a particular school district, they are supposed to go schools in that district. However, even if they can\u2019t prove they live in the district \u2013 say, no parent or guardian shows up with them at the school or they don\u2019t have valid identification \u2013 school officials have been directed to treat them as homeless students, meaning they are to be allowed to go to that school without providing a home address.\n\nThis is not just another executive order by the Obama administration. It\u2019s federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that children, regardless of whether they are here legally or not, must have access to public elementary and secondary education.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. spends approximately $12,000 per year to educate each child in public school. And the influx of children who are in the country illegally further increases those costs. That\u2019s because more regular teachers have to be hired, and \u2013 because many students don\u2019t speak English \u2013 more bilingual teachers and resources have to be brought in as well.\n\nAccording to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, as of 2009, taxpayers have spent over $440 million on English instruction classes for children \u2013 some of whom are here legally, some not \u2013 whose parents are in the U.S. illegally. Houston is one of several cities where a local school district has created schools specifically for such children \u2013 and all these children are eligible for free or reduced lunches under the federal school lunch program.\n\nNeedless to say, this puts a huge burden on local districts and states \u2013 many of which are already struggling to provide a good education for the children who live there legally. As Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin puts it: \u201cAlready one in four Oklahoma children struggle(s) with hunger. One in four will drop out of high school before graduating. It is wrong for the president to ask Oklahomans to divert their attention and limited resources away from our own children.\u201d\n\nCongressional staffers in Washington who closely follow this issue have told me that, while the flow of border crossings has slowed over the past month, they expect it to pick up again in early fall as the weather cools, making the 1,000-plus mile journey from Central America less dangerous. That means we will likely see more children coming this fall.\n\nAnd, if President Barack Obama follows through on his vow to issue an executive order granting amnesty to millions more immigrants already in the country illegally, that will only encourage even more people of all ages to risk getting across the border.\n\nObama\u2019s proposal wouldn\u2019t be a popular move. Opinion surveys find opposition to illegal immigration is growing. And on this specific issue, a recent Rasmussen poll found that 53 percent of likely U.S. voters said immigrants who are in the country illegally should not be allowed to attend public schools.\n\nOf course, the answer here is not to show up at schools and protest the children. The answer is to send a message to public officials who are all for enforcing laws that reward immigrants who are in the U.S. without proper documents (like the law requiring they be allowed to go to public schools), but have little use for securing our borders and enforcing the laws that would have sent those who enter illegally back home.\n\nThat message can be sent now and through Election Day, simply by asking every politician running for governor and the U.S. House and Senate where they stand on border security and illegal immigration.\n\nOriginally appeared in the Houston Chronicle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We spend approximately $12,000 per year to educate each child in public school.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "We spend approximately $12,000 per year to educate each child in public school.", "title": "How the Unaccompanied Children Crisis Is Affecting Public Schools", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polspphotos052904.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-13T13:22:01+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1rZEn3G"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "We spend approximately $12,000 per year to educate each child in public school.", "title": "How the Unaccompanied Children Crisis Is Affecting Public Schools", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polspphotos052904.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2014-09-13T03:01:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-13T13:22:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If you\u2019re wondering where they\u2019ve gone, you may need to look no further than the classrooms of your local public school.\nIf they live in a particular school district, they are supposed to go schools in that district.\nCurrently, the U.S. spends approximately $12,000 per year to educate each child in public school.\nAnd the influx of children who are in the country illegally further increases those costs.\nHouston is one of several cities where a local school district has created schools specifically for such children \u2013 and all these children are eligible for free or reduced lunches under the federal school lunch program."}
