The exact share of plans affected would depend greatly on the path of health care inflation \u2014 and the tax itself would be one of the key tools aiming to contain that inflation.\n\nThe reduction in spending that would result from effectively limiting the tax benefits for health insurance would be material, even if few health plans would be affected directly: According to an August report from the Congressional Research Service, the tax can be expected to result in between $40 billion and $60 billion less in health care spending per year by 2024. That\u2019s about a 3 percent reduction, and it\u2019s several times larger than the direct impact of the Cadillac tax on government revenues.\n\nThe reduction in health care costs due to the Cadillac tax would also flow back, in significant part, as lower government spending on health care. Medicare and Medicaid would benefit from a lower price environment, and it would be less expensive to subsidize private health plans brought though the A.C.A. exchanges. That is, if retained, the tax will help contain costs on the spending side of the federal budget, in addition to providing $87 billion of revenue through 2025.\n\nEven if Mrs. Clinton finds a new source for the revenues the Cadillac Tax was supposed to generate, it\u2019s not clear what she would to do provide the cost discipline that\u2019s expected to flow from the tax, though her campaign says she is focused on the issue.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton strongly supports the goal of aggressively bending the cost curve,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign. \u201cIn the weeks ahead she will be presenting her ideas to continue to exert downward pressure on systemwide health expenditures, but in doing so she will be deliberate about ensuring that we are truly holding down costs, and not just shifting them to middle-class households in the form of higher premiums.\u201d\n\nSome people would indeed face higher premiums as a result of the tax, because the tax would effectively get built into the cost of the highest-cost employer-provided plans. But Peter Orszag, a proponent of the tax who served as President Obama\u2019s budget director when the law was signed, rejected the idea that the Cadillac tax is \u201cjust\u201d cost-shifting, saying employers and insurers would be motivated by the tax to find more cost-effective ways to provide care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to succeed over the long term if all you\u2019re doing is shifting the laundry from under the bed into the closet,\u201d he said. \u201cA far more promising path is to recognize that costs are very concentrated in a small number of beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nWhile the Clinton campaign statement focused on the issue of premiums for plans subject to the tax, some Cadillac tax opponents have also worried about what employers will do to get plan premiums below the tax threshold. They could, for example, raise co-payments and deductibles, shifting costs toward beneficiaries.\n\nMr. Orszag argued that cost-shifting changes like that would be \u201csecondary or tertiary,\u201d and that employers seeking to keep their health plan costs below the Cadillac tax threshold would have to focus most on managing costs for the sickest beneficiaries, whose behavior isn\u2019t even influenced by co-payments or deductibles, since their health spending exceeds their plans\u2019 out-of-pocket spending caps. To reduce the cost of caring for these patients, he said insurers would need to avoid high-cost, low-value care that is currently common.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why a beneficiary would want to be put in a high-cost skilled nursing facility that has worse outcomes than an alternative,\u201d he said.\n\nEzekiel Emanuel, a key architect of the health care law, argued that the tax is already having a \u201cpsychological\u201d impact on employers and insurers, motivating them to control expenditures and helping generate several years of the lowest health care cost inflation in decades. He worried that an expectation that the tax would be repealed would encourage health costs to rise.\n\nA White House spokeswoman also defended the tax, saying a repeal \u201cwould hurt our economy by increasing the deficit, raising health care cost growth, and cutting workers\u2019 paychecks.\u201d While people often think of their wages and health benefits as separate issues, economists are generally convinced that the two trade off against each other directly, and that a faster pace of health care inflation would dampen wage growth.\n\nStill, it\u2019s easy to see why the politics of the Cadillac tax are terrible. The tax exclusion for health insurance is a longstanding feature of the American tax code, dating to World War II, and a politically dear one. People are simply not happy about paying taxes on their health insurance benefits when they never have before. In 2008, when John McCain ran for president on a platform that included converting the exclusion into a tax credit (meaning that the tax savings available from health insurance would be capped), Barack Obama called his plan \u201cradical\u201d because it \u201ctaxes health care benefits for the first time in history.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have been long been seeking to repeal Obamacare, wholesale if possible or piece-by-piece if necessary. While Democrats have generally defended the law, there are key Democratic constituencies that hate the Cadillac tax, especially labor unions, which have often negotiated very hard to obtain the sort of high-cost health plans the tax seeks to discourage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps most important, the tax sounds punitive. We don\u2019t impose a 40 percent excise tax on expensive cars or expensive hobbies in an effort to control consumption. (Of course, we don\u2019t generally let companies pay their employees in tax-free cars either.)\n\nThat may be why the tax\u2019s main constituency seems to be health policy experts: Over 100 of them signed a letter last week urging lawmakers to keep the tax. Mr. Emanuel emphasized they\u2019re not just doing this out of a love of new taxes.\n\n\u201cAs a policy matter it\u2019s very important to keep health care costs under control,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone benefits from that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151005102953, "twitter": {"description": "The tax is appealing to those who want to control health care spending, but not to those who have comprehensive, high-cost health insurance plans.", "title": "The Cadillac Tax: Why Economists, but Few Others, Love It", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/upshot/the-cadillac-tax-loved-by-economists-and-few-others.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003948757"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jbarro", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/upshot/06UP-Cadillac/06UP-Cadillac-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/upshot/the-cadillac-tax-loved-by-economists-and-few-others.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003948757", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/upshot/the-cadillac-tax-loved-by-economists-and-few-others.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 5, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Federal Taxes (US),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Presidential Election of 2016,Clinton  Hillary Rodham", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Josh Barro", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/upshot/06UP-Cadillac/06UP-Cadillac-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JOSH BARRO", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The tax is appealing to those who want to control health care spending, but not to those who have comprehensive, high-cost health insurance plans.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/upshot/06UP-Cadillac/06UP-Cadillac-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The tax is appealing to those who want to control health care spending, but not to those who have comprehensive, high-cost health insurance plans.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 5, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/josh_barro/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-10-05", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham", "published": "2015-10-05", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "06up-cadillac", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151005113349, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/upshot/the-cadillac-tax-loved-by-economists-and-few-others.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/upshot/06UP-Cadillac/06UP-Cadillac-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The tax is appealing to those who want to control health care spending, but not to those who have comprehensive, high-cost health insurance plans.", "title": "The Cadillac Tax: Why Economists, but Few Others, Love It"}, "pdate": 20151005, "des": "Presidential Election of 2016", "articleid": 100000003948757, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The Cadillac Tax: Why Economists, but Few Others, Love It", "col": "Health Policy", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf30a\"", "article_summary": "The reduction in health care costs due to the Cadillac tax would also flow back, in significant part, as lower government spending on health care.\nThat\u2019s about a 3 percent reduction, and it\u2019s several times larger than the direct impact of the Cadillac tax on government revenues.\nOver time, if health insurance premiums continued to rise faster than inflation, more plans would pass over the Cadillac tax threshold.\nStill, it\u2019s easy to see why the politics of the Cadillac tax are terrible.\nThe tax exclusion for health insurance is a longstanding feature of the American tax code, dating to World War II, and a politically dear one."}
