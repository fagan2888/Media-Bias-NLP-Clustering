A House Democrat on Wednesday compared the GOP's latest vote to repeal ObamaCare to eating junk food instead of exercising.

Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) employed an analogy of building muscle during exercise with repeated movements, noting Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) affinity for the P90X workout routine.

“Normally doing additional reps builds muscle mass. But the one muscle Republicans aren’t exercising is their brain,” she said during House floor debate on the legislation.

“Put down the political equivalent of that giant plate of nachos and exercise the hard job of governing,” Speier said.

The House has voted more than 60 times since 2011 to undo the healthcare law. But Wednesday’s vote will be the first time that Republicans will be able to send repeal legislation — which also defunds Planned Parenthood — to President Obama’s desk.

Republicans are further expected to conduct votes to attempt to override the president’s likely veto in the coming weeks.
