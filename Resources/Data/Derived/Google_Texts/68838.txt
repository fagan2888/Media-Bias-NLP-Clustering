During the seventh inning, the man moved toward the field from the seats behind third base, jumped a short fence and ran onto the grass in front of the Rays’ dugout at McKechnie Field.

According to players and Bradenton police, the man shouted obscenities about the Castro regime in Cuba. He threw a can of beer that smashed into the back wall of the Rays’ dugout.

MOSCOW (AP) - Russia’s sports minister plans to make it illegal for officials to report that an athlete has failed a drug test.

Vitaly Mutko tells Russia’s state sports broadcaster that leaking the name of an athlete who has failed a drug test causes “noise and uproar” and violates the presumption of innocence.

Athletes provide an “A” and “B” sample when they are tested, and if the “A” sample is positive, can request the “B” sample is tested, too. While some athletes have been cleared of doping when a “B” sample comes back negative, such instances are rare.

Mutko accused Russian sports federations of routinely leaking drug test results before “B” samples are tested, adding “we’re now going to administratively and criminally forbid it.”

Russia has faced numerous doping scandals in recent years.
