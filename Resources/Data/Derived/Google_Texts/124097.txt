Excessive speed and possible marijuana use left a driver and his passenger dead during an early Saturday morning rollover crash that ended down an Arapahoe County embankment.

The crash happened around 2:30 a.m. Saturday near Gun Club Road and Hampden Avenue, said Trooper Tim Sutherland of the Colorado State Patrol.

Road evidence suggested the driver was headed east on Hampden in a 2006 Toyota Camry when he found himself drifting on to the westbound lane, according to investigators.

He overcorrected but lost control and the car slid down the embankment, rolling over a few times. Both driver and passenger were ejected, Sutherland said.

The 20-year-old male driver was pronounced dead at the scene. The female passenger was transported to Swedish Medical Center but died almost nine hours later at 11:54 a.m.

Drugs may have played a role, but Sutherland said that is still under investigation.

“It’s suspected there was marijuana involved because the vehicle rolled and there was still marijuana in the car,” he said.

Authorities have not yet identified the two people.
