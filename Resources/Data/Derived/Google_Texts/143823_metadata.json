There are even fewer manufacturing jobs today. The once huge manufacturing plant owned by E.J. Brach employed thousands of Chicagoans. Most Americans have seen it, and their headquarters building across the street, only as a movie set for The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nThe thuggish behavior exhibited by students at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) hearkens back to an earlier era. Given that the median age of Americans is 37.6 years, well over half of all Americans have no personal memory of the events of the late 1960s: the Democratic National Convention in 1968 and before that the April 1968 riots on the West Side of Chicago. Black neighborhoods burned.\n\nBelieve it or not, those words were spoken by an American president, a Democrat. You will not find many politicians today talking about doing anything hard. Part of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal may lie in the word \u201cagain.\u201d\n\nWe choose to go to the moon.

Back in the summer of 1969, I worked as a young thermodynamicist for Grumman Aerospace, when the company\u2019s Lunar Excursion Module, Eagle, carried Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the \u201c surface of the Moon \u201d and then returned them \u201csafely to Earth.\u201d\n\nThe thuggish behavior exhibited by students at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) hearkens back to an earlier era.
