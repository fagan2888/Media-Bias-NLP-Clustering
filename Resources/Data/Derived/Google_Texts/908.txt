The Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce expects the population in downtown Oklahoma City to double from 7,000 to 14,000 people in the next 10 years.

“Downtown OKC”, President Jane Jenkins said, her organization is doing their best to set the table to attract new residents and tenants.

Developer Richard McKown is finishing up his second large-scaled downtown apartment complex in the past three years. McKown said he wouldn't be surprised if the downtown population triples in the next ten years.

He said the staggering growth is a product of Oklahoma's now legendary “MAPS” Project that started 20 years ago. “Some fantastic pioneers came down and did the heavy lifting, placing big bets.”

Jenkins said things that are working in downtown's favor are more than 50% of folks who work downtown now live downtown. She said the fact 87% of downtown residents are single is also a factor.
