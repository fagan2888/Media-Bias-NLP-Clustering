Mark Udall, D-Colo., had asked the Colorado Division of Insurance to revise its estimate that 249,000 state residents had their policies cancelled, according to The Complete Colorado.\n\nUdall voted for the Affordable Care Act and is up for re-election this year.\n\nThe internal Insurance Division email, sent by Director of External Affairs Jo Donlin and obtained by The Complete Colorado, said:\n\nSen. Udall says our numbers were wrong. They are not wrong. Cancellation notices affected 249,199 people. They want to trash our numbers. I\u2019m holding strong while we get more details. Many have already done early renewals. Regardless, they received cancellation notices.\n\nDonlin explained the Division of Insurance numbers to members of Udall\u2019s staff the following day, and less than two hours later, she emailed the following message to her colleagues and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s office:\n\n\u201cFollowing my e-mail, I received a very hostile phone call from Udall\u2019s deputy chief of staff. [Insurance Commissioner] Marguerite [Salazar] is on the phone with [Udall\u2019s] chief of staff right now. Happy Friday!\u201d\n\nUdall\u2019s request that the state agency essentially cook the books on cancellations came one day after President Obama signed an executive order allowing policyholders to keep their health plans.\n\nAn email from Udall staffer Joe Britton, also dated Nov. 15, elevated the senator\u2019s request to an act of desperate browbeating, saying:\n\n\u201dWe need to move on this ASAP \u2013 or we\u2019ll be forced to challenge the 249K number ourselves. It is wildly off or at least very misleading and reporters keep repeating it.\u201d\n\nThen Udall\u2019s office did exactly that, fudging the Insurance Division\u2019s numbers and issuing a statement to The Denver Post, which reported that afternoon:\n\nMore than two-thirds of the 250,000 people whose health policies the state Division of Insurance said last week were \u201cterminated\u201d have actually been offered renewals of existing plans through 2014, according to research by U.S. Sen. Mark Udall\u2019s office.\n\nPoliticians often say, \u201cI don\u2019t need this job \u2014 I only want to serve.\u201d But when push comes to shove, they\u2019ll resort to almost anything to keep it \u2014 including intimidation.\n\nH/T Townhall", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Trying to temper the Obamacare rollout disaster, a U.S. senator pressured his state insurance division to either fudge the number of people who lost their insurance plans after the rollout or to redefine the term \u201ccancellation.\u201d In a Nov. 14 email, a state official said U.S. Sen.
