Writer, comedian and “Daily Show” correspondent John Hodgman — who is perhaps best-known for playing the “PC guy” in Mac’s famous advertising campaign — proved today that he is just as fluent in other uses of the term “PC” as well. In a lengthy Twitter essay, the humorist offered an elegant rebuttal to Jonathan Chait’s New York Magazine piece decrying political correctness as a threat to the left. Read the full argument below:

1 I acknowledge the phenomena he is describing is an actual thing. I was on a campus in the 90s and am on the Internet now. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

2 I've seen and occasionally been confronted by principled passion and vitriol in response to what I thought was a mild opinion — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

3 I have flustered at the suggestion that my opinion is simply invalid due to my privilege. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

4 I have watched sides entrench, circular arguments tighten into sanctimonious death spirals and jockeying for grievance status — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

5 sometimes I conclude that some people just want to fight for its own sake. It offers them something. The other is not important. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

6 it was ever thus online, however, as it was ever thus in every smelly college coffee house ever. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

8 there are toxic, pointless arguments all over the Internet since internet began. Social justice is just one flavor of contentiousness. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

9 but I will say that the "PC" critiques, even at their most infuriating to me, almost always make me think and yes check my privilege — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

10 I'd never heard of cis-gender until it had been hurled at me as an invalidating insult on Twitter. I bet it's true for @jonathanchait too — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

11 but I am glad I know it now. I am glad to give these issues thought. It enlarges me — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

12 it enlarges me to be called out, even when I conclude the caller is a troll, and especially when it's by a person I respect. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

13 and @jonathanchait offers very little evidence against this form of contentiousness other than anxiety/hurt feelings of some colleagues — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

14 to suggest that somehow this discourse is hurting its own side has a name: concern trolling. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

15 but I don't want to invalidate @jonathanchait's argument but to make a counter argument of my own. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

16 if @jonathanchait and heroes of mine like @sullydish want to make common cause against "SJW"s with gamergate that's fine. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015

17 but that's the first time I've ever typed gamergate into a tweet ever. — John Hodgman (@hodgman) January 27, 2015
