Colusa Regional Medical Center in Colusa, California will shutter its doors on April 22 due to financial struggles. The closure will include its clinics in Arbuckle, Colusa and Williams.

"During the last three years, it has become increasingly more difficult for a small community hospital to financially survive," the hospital posted recently on its website.

The 48-bed hospital is just the latest rural facility to close in the United States.

The hospital was unable to meet its payroll during the first full week of April, according to the Appeal Democrat. Staff learned in a company-wide letter that they would not be paid until this Friday.

Staff was also notified that they would not immediately be receiving payment for accrued paid time off, representing around $500,000 in total.

A plan has been established to transfer the facility's patients to neighboring providers, and CEO Wayne Allen said in a message on Colusa Regional's website that the hospital will be enacting an "orderly shutdown."

"This is a very sad time for our hospital family," he said.

Over the next three to six months, hospital management will seek potential buyers for the building.

Colusa Regional had been attempting to reduce costs in recent months and closed its birthing center on April 1. The birthing center delivered approximately 140 babies each year, with most mothers covered by Medi-Cal. The hospital had hoped to save up to $1 million per year.

A recent report by iVantage Analytics claims 673 rural facilities are at risk of closing due to financial hardship.
