No, the answer isn\u2019t today \u2014 taxes this year are just due on April 18. You finish paying them on April 21.\n\nThat\u2019s when Nevada taxpayers finally earn enough to pay what they\u2019ll owe for 2016. Put another way: You work 112 days before you actually start to see your hard-earned money. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation calls this \u201cTax Freedom Day,\u201d although you probably won\u2019t feel like celebrating when you consider that you\u2019re likely spending more on taxes than on food, clothing and housing combined.\n\nYou\u2019re also losing more to the tax collector with every passing year. Nationally, Tax Freedom Day is the same day it was last year, but it\u2019s still 11 days later than just four years ago. When you stack Nevada up against other states, it\u2019s in the middle of the pack, with the 30th Tax Freedom Day in the nation.\n\nAnd expect things to keep getting worse.\n\nTax Freedom Day keeps getting pushed back because the government keeps taking more of our money. This year, Washington, D.C., is expected to rake in a record-breaking $3.36 trillion in tax revenue, $115 billion more than it did last year.\n\nThat still won\u2019t be enough to satisfy D.C.\u2019s spending addiction. Washington will once again spend more than it brings in this fiscal year, adding $534 billion to the already massive federal debt. Over the past two decades, both Republicans and Democrats have made countless promises while leaving you and me with the bill. The result has been out-of-control federal spending, which has fueled an unprecedented rise in the national debt from just over $5 trillion in 1996 to nearly $20 trillion today.\n\nThe wasteful spending is getting worse, too. Last month, the federal government\u2019s fiscal watchdog \u2014 the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 estimated that D.C. deficits will grow every year for the foreseeable future. The annual shortfall will surpass $1 trillion within six years.\n\nTax Freedom Day will keep getting later so long as overspending persists. So what can Nevada lawmakers in D.C. due to avert this deepening crisis?\n\nThe obvious answer is to cut federal spending. But just as important as spending reform is tax reform.\n\nAmerica\u2019s tax code is an absolute mess. We spend a staggering 1.35 billion hours and $20 billion every year trying to comply with it. Why? Because the code is riddled with countless special-interest carve-outs, which force up individual tax rates for the rest of us. We\u2019re also one of the only countries in the world that double-taxes everything businesses make overseas. Finally, our business tax rate at home is the highest in the developed world.\n\nThe results are predictable \u2014 businesses fleeing America and less money in your pocket. Perversely, America\u2019s high tax rates actually lead to less tax revenue over time, meaning Tax Freedom Day will keep getting later.\n\nReal tax reform would simplify the code, eliminating corporate carve-outs and loopholes. It would end the double taxation on business\u2019 foreign earnings, giving companies a reason to stay in America and create jobs. And it would lower business tax rates to spur the economic growth that leads to more tax revenue in the years ahead.\n\nThat\u2019s preferable to forcing Nevadans to spend ever more of their year working for the tax man. It\u2019s bad enough that Nevada\u2019s Tax Freedom Day fell on April 21 this year. You can\u2019t afford for it to get any later.\n\nAndy Koenig is senior policy advisor at Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Commentary", "parsely-tags": "Opinion,Opinion", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/tax-day-s-even-worse-nevada", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2180251"}, "author": "ANDY KOENIG SPECIAL TO THE REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "A tax day that\u2019s even worse for Nevada", "twitter": {"description": "Commentary", "title": "A tax day that\u2019s even worse for Nevada", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/tax-day-s-even-worse-nevada", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_mon-twit-3.jpeg_2.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=6197568", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=6197568", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "ANDY KOENIG SPECIAL TO THE REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Opinion,Opinion,", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-17T21:00:24-07:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Commentary", "title": "A tax day that\u2019s even worse for Nevada", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/tax-day-s-even-worse-nevada", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_mon-twit-3.jpeg_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_mon-twit-3.jpeg_2.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-04-18T04:00:24Z"}, "article_summary": "Perversely, America\u2019s high tax rates actually lead to less tax revenue over time, meaning Tax Freedom Day will keep getting later.\nNationally, Tax Freedom Day is the same day it was last year, but it\u2019s still 11 days later than just four years ago.\nWhen you stack Nevada up against other states, it\u2019s in the middle of the pack, with the 30th Tax Freedom Day in the nation.\nIt\u2019s bad enough that Nevada\u2019s Tax Freedom Day fell on April 21 this year.\nTax Freedom Day keeps getting pushed back because the government keeps taking more of our money."}
