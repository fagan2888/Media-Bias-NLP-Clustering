They shouldn't be treated so lightly by our lawmakers that they get a quick-glance rating system. We'd urge them to work on a solution that builds schools and kids up instead of slapping a grade on them.\n\nThe bigger issue is that the school report cards leave a lot to be desired. We don't want to unfairly oversimplify things, but the schools with higher poverty rates tend to score more poorly than schools with a higher tax base.\n\nTo us, that means the formula needs to be tweaked to get a better measure of what's really happening with instruction.\n\nSo there's a lot to work on, and in an ideal world parents, teachers, administrators, taxpayers and lawmakers will work together to improve our schools and create a nuanced rating system that makes sense.\n\nWisconsin taxpayers can handle lots of details and process that information to come to our own conclusions.\n\nWe learned great analytical skills in Wisconsin schools, after all.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1Cb2mAc", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We're guessing that if you heard your kid's school got a \"C\" grade \u2014 or worse \u2014 you'd be searching for a new place to send them for an education.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "We're guessing that if you heard your kid's school got a \"C\" grade \u2014 or worse \u2014 you'd be searching for a new place to send them for an education.", "title": "The more detail the better on schools", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/2015/03/21/detail-better-schools/25158315/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We're guessing that if you heard your kid's school got a \"C\" grade \u2014 or worse \u2014 you'd be searching for a new place to send them for an education.", "title": "The more detail the better on schools", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/156092a17d494224f344c8349da1cedfc95e2b6f/c=515-0-2824-2309&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2015/03/21/B9316688007Z.1_20150321190239_000_G8LA9LMT8.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "editorial,  Wisconsin taxpayers,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe266d\"", "article_summary": "We don't want to unfairly oversimplify things, but the schools with higher poverty rates tend to score more poorly than schools with a higher tax base.\nThe report cards measure the effectiveness of Wisconsin's public schools based on achievement, student growth, closing achievement gaps and post-secondary readiness.\nBuy Photo Roosevelt Middle School student ZaKoria Walker and teacher Marisa Ewing chat during an eighth-grade science class on Feb.12 in Appleton.\nWe'd urge them to work on a solution that builds schools and kids up instead of slapping a grade on them.\nThey shouldn't be treated so lightly by our lawmakers that they get a quick-glance rating system."}
