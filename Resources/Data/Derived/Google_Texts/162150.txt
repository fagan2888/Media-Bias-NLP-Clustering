On Sunday night the streets of downtown Tucson came alive for the 26th celebration of the All Souls Procession. Organizers say over 100,000 people showed up for the procession. It was a special evening to remember lost loved ones.



The Procession kicked off at 6:30 p.m. Many people created signs to honor their loved one, while others wore elaborate costumes and face paint. The two-mile procession ended at El Mercado. That’s where the ceremonial burning of the urn took place. Participants used prayers cards to write a special

message about their loved one and then it was set on fire.



“I’m here on behalf of the loved ones and for our memory of loved ones,” Natalie Islas said.



“I love it. It makes me feel good and I know it would make him feel good too,” Evangelie Dominguez said. She lost her father-in-law a few years ago. Dominguez has walked in Tucson's All Souls Procession for 20 years. She's spent days creating a colorful wagon in her father-in-law's honor.



Many people said the event is a great way to come together because it makes the loss of a loved one feel less lonely.
