× Deadlines approach for enrollment in coverage under the Affordable Care Act

If you enroll in coverage under the Affordable Care Act, the deadline to enroll or change plans is December 15. That date is the “last day to enroll in or change plans for new coverage to start January 1, 2016,” according to HeathCare.gov.

If you want coverage to begin February 1, 2016, the deadline to enroll or change plans is January 15, 2016. Enrollments or changes made between January 16 and January 31 will take effect March 1, 2016.

Open enrollment for 2016 ends January 31. If you don’t enroll by then, you cannot enroll in health insurance under the ACA for 2016 unless you qualify for a special enrollment period.

“There’s no limited enrollment period for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). You can apply any time,” according to HealthCare.gov.
