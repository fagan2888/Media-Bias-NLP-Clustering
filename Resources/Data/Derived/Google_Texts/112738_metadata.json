In \u201cRage for Fame,\u201d published in 1997, Sylvia Jukes Morris traced how a beautiful and intelligent girl, born of humble origins, married a millionaire decades her senior; transformed herself as managing editor at Vanity Fair, wrote her hit play, \u201cThe Women,\u201d married again, to Henry Luce of Time Inc.\n\n\u201cPrice of Fame\u201d continues the second half of this amazing story, clearly capturing the successes and pathos of a narcissist infused with shame and self-hate. (\u201cNobody could love me who really knew me.\u201d)\n\nFame Clare now has, but with it came personal loss: the death of her only child; of her brother; the suicide of a close friend; the disappointment in her dysfunctional marriage to Luce, her love and enemy. Their extramarital affairs, along with Clare\u2019s schemes to extract millions, is told without censure. Those millions, later bequested to institutions and charities, also significantly benefited women entering the field of mathematics, science and engineering.\n\nThe book opens with Clare\u2019s election in 1942 as a Republican congressman from Connecticut. The only female member of the House Military Affairs Committee, she traveled to Europe, visiting liberated Nazi concentration camps. She crossed the aisle to work with Democrats, and is credited with advancing 18 initiatives, including human rights, equal pay, and the rehabilitation of veterans, and the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission. No fan of FDR, she said he had created a nation of \u201chypochondriacs, introverts and psychotics.\u201d Nonetheless, she was a friend of his wife, Eleanor (both were advocates for civil rights). After Clare\u2019s conversion to Roman Catholicism, she was appointed ambassador to Italy, the first woman ever appointed ambassador to a major foreign power, playing a role in negotiating a peaceful resolution to the Trieste Crisis.\n\nWorking in a man\u2019s world, she easily vanquished dullards with \u201clawyerly logic,\u201d eliciting the admiration of statesmen, among them Bernard Baruch, Winston Churchill, Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, who thought her a \u201ccinch to become the first woman president.\u201d Clare left Congress in 1946, convinced that politics was \u201cthe refuge of second-class minds.\u201d She remained an active member of 26 boards, dealing with issues ranging from arms control and counterintelligence to accuracy in the media. Under Presidents Nixon and Reagan, she served on the President\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. In 1983, Reagan awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nA running theme throughout Clare\u2019s life is her shimmering sexuality \u2014 a lethal cocktail of luminosity, charm, intelligence and wit. One of her bon mots was \u201cNo good deed goes unpunished.\u201d Her seductions were legendary; the editor Fleur Cowles joked that she slept with every general on the Western front. There were those who resented Clare\u2019s \u201cconceited assumption\u201d that \u201cshe has everybody eating out of her hands in a few minute\u2019s time.\u201d Perhaps she can be forgiven when so many letters to her are filled with the yearning fantasies of countless males. Well into her 60s, she captivated men decades her junior.\n\nNightfall found her suffering \u201ca terrible attack of the dismals.\u201d Bravely, Clare kept repeated bouts of depression at bay with a roster of interests that included her major art collection, scuba diving, the theater and screenwriting. Her energy flagged only at the end, at her death of brain cancer in 1987, at age 84.\n\nClare attempted her own autobiography, but got no further than: \u201cOne gets born. From there on, it\u2019s hell, or a little better, with a rare touch of heaven, all the way to the grave.\u201d A better self-portrait was a haunting picture she painted of a woman in utter despair. Reluctant to revisit tragedy and secrets, Clare repeatedly tried to dissuade Sylvia Jukes Morris from writing her life, saying it didn\u2019t \u201cstack up.\u201d\n\nPlowing her way through 460,000 items of Clare\u2019s restricted papers at the Library of Congress, a collection bigger than that of most presidents, Ms. Morris was the only author given complete access. She has also uncovered rich sources elsewhere, among them the diary entries of Time Inc. employees and the tape-recordings of Clare\u2019s reactions as she tripped on LSD in a pioneering experiment. It is the author\u2019s steady, sensitive handling of the material, told with humor and objectivity, that makes this biography so poignant and profound.\n\nThe author\u2019s skill at delving deep into sources was eventually rewarded by Clare herself, who confessed she felt closest to Ms. Morris \u201cbecause you know everything.\u201d However, it is the late Librarian of Congress, Daniel Boorstin, who said it best: \u201cHow often does it happen,\u201d he asked, \u201cthis coming together of a great subject and an ideal biographer?\u201d That observation beautifully applies to \u201cPrice of Fame,\u201d and it is nothing short of a triumph.\n\nMarion Elizabeth Rodgers is the editor of the forthcoming \u201cMencken: The Days Trilogy, Expanded Edition\u201d to be published by The Library of America.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Throughout her life, playwright and diplomat Clare Boothe Luce insatiably aimed for the top.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Throughout her life, playwright and diplomat Clare Boothe Luce insatiably aimed for the top.", "title": "BOOK REVIEW: \u2018Price of Fame\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/17/book-review-how-clare-boothe-luce-thrived/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/17/7_172014_a78c4b26a96f45d76db8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/17/7_172014_a78c4b26a96f45d76db8201.jpg", "description": "Throughout her life, playwright and diplomat Clare Boothe Luce insatiably aimed for the top.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "BOOK REVIEW: \u2018Price of Fame\u2019"}, "Author": "Marion Elizabeth Rodgers - Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Clare Boothe, Sylvia Jukes Morris, Time Inc"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddeba\"", "article_summary": "A running theme throughout Clare\u2019s life is her shimmering sexuality \u2014 a lethal cocktail of luminosity, charm, intelligence and wit.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:PRICE OF FAME: THE HONORABLE CLARE BOOTHE LUCEBy Sylvia Jukes MorrisRandom House, $35, 752 pagesThroughout her life, playwright and diplomat Clare Boothe Luce insatiably aimed for the top.\nThe book opens with Clare\u2019s election in 1942 as a Republican congressman from Connecticut.\nThose millions, later bequested to institutions and charities, also significantly benefited women entering the field of mathematics, science and engineering.\nThe only female member of the House Military Affairs Committee, she traveled to Europe, visiting liberated Nazi concentration camps."}
