The plan would have no out-of-pocket cost-sharing from specified providers in various regions around the state.\n\nIt was described as a voluntary pilot program for non-Medicare members and their dependents who are enrolled in a non-HMO SHBP plan. The initial participation rate goal was 10,000 members within the first 12 months, and it would be handled by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and Aetna.\n\nA similar program is taking place on the state\u2019s western border in Camden County.\n\nR-Health, based in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, is reaching across state lines to develop a primary care contracting model within New Jersey.\n\nThe organization began with a small employer, but couldn\u2019t continue the contract due to the financial burden of providing benefits for the less-than-50-employee business.\n\n\u201cWe are bullish on New Jersey,\u201d said Mason Reiner, co-founder and CEO of R-Health, in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey is going to be a big growth area because the state has come out in favor of direct primary care,\u201d Reiner said, citing the pilot program.\n\nThe biggest challenge for employers in New Jersey looking to switch to this model is the lack of available supplementary insurance plans to cover the remainder of health care needs, Reiner said. But that will slowly change.\n\nCurrently, if three to five cents of every health care dollar is spent on primary care, the cost would increase to about seven to nine cents for the direct care plan, Reiner said. This is because the model focuses on relationships with primary care physicians to lower utilization of higher-cost specialists and redundant hospital visits.\n\n\u201cPrimary care is best positioned for the big picture. Patients can disappear into the health system once they get referred to a hospital or specialist \u2026 and are bouncing around from specialist to specialist,\u201d Reiner said.\n\nThe direct care model allows physicians to take charge of their patients\u2019 care and reduces the need to care for a large volume of patients. The optimal number of patients is between 800 and 1,000, according to Reiner. The current number for fee-for-value service is about 2,500 patients.\n\nBut this model relies on the insurance providers to administer the plan and add wrap-around coverage for other health care needs. An alternative of the same model extends beyond primary care and into care for chronic conditions.\n\nGet our e-newsletters Click here to subscribe to the NJBIZ Daily and other newsletters\n\nThis is beneficial for larger employers or a band of smaller employers, according to EBG\u2019s Solander.\n\n\u201cThere are ways to harness economies of scale to buying power for providers,\u201d Solander said. An employer of, for example, 5,000, can say, \u201cLook, I have a hard time controlling diabetes and asthma. Let me push that market share to you and, in return, we get better health.\u201d\n\nThis allows for accountability directly from the health system for care.\n\n\u201cThere is no insurance and risk other than losing the contract if a provider can\u2019t demonstrate saving (the employer) about 20 percent or more, compared to insurance costs,\u201d Solander said.\n\n\u201cEmployers always have the top three to four conditions that drive 60 to 70 percent of their cost,\u201d Solander said. \u201cIf you have all millennials or it\u2019s a tech startup where the oldest person is 32, then this isn\u2019t great for you.\u201d\n\nSolander\u2019s firm has discussed and advised some clients to really look into the direct care contract option.\n\nHerschman said he has told clients across the spectrum about the model, but has most recently worked with manufacturers in the Southeast who have a large number of employees with back pain and musculoskeletal issues.\n\nWard Sanders, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, said the idea of direct contracting is not new.\n\nAnd not necessarily a good idea.\n\n\"Providers get excited about this stuff, and they have for years, but who has really made it work?\" Sanders said. \"At the end of the day ... the middle man does something. Somebody needs to collect premiums, someone needs to pay claims, someone needs to ferret out fraud, and somebody needs to do HIPAA compliance with all this information. Someone has to do case management and someone has to do care management, someone has to have fraud investigative units, somebody has to do all those pieces.\n\n\"So, yeah, you can cut the insurance company out, but somebody still needs to do all those pieces, and, respectfully, the plans \u2014 since this is what their businesses are \u2014 are pretty good at doing it.\"\n\nHerschman is undeterred.\n\n\u201cWe see an uptick of employers moving into this model,\" he said. \"Employers see success elsewhere and are starting to dip their toes in the water.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of talk about it. The talk is growing and it\u2019s \u2026 (that) this is going to be one of the next big things. Word is going to get out of saving money and then it\u2019s going to snowball. It\u2019s going to happen more in local markets with health systems (merging) and word is going to start getting around. How soon that will happen, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe model especially benefits employers whose employees are centrally located in one region, served by one or two hospital systems, Solander said.\n\nWith employers keeping their eye on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Cadillac tax in 2020, which will penalize high-cost health care, Herschman said, \u201cThis is the next frontier and it\u2019s starting behind the scenes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20160217/NJBIZ01/160219815/update-cutting-out-the-middle-man--direct-provider-contracts-bypass-insurers-to-link-employers-hospitals", "site_name": "NJBIZ", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20160217/NJBIZ01/160219815/AR/0/AR-160219815.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Update: Cutting out the middle man - Direct provider contracts bypass insurers to link employers, hospitals | NJBIZ"}, "twitter": {"site": "@njbiz", "domain": "njbiz.com", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20160217/NJBIZ01/160219815/AR/0/AR-160219815.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Update: Cutting out the middle man - Direct provider contracts bypass insurers to link employers, hospitals | NJBIZ"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The direct care model allows physicians to take charge of their patients\u2019 care and reduces the need to care for a large volume of patients.\n\u201cNew Jersey is going to be a big growth area because the state has come out in favor of direct primary care,\u201d Reiner said, citing the pilot program.\nLast July, among the other pilot programs listed, SHBP listed the Direct Primary Care Medical Home program, which would allow a practice to assume contractual responsibility for providing primary care services and collect a monthly per-member fee for delivering and coordinating patient care.\nR-Health, based in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, is reaching across state lines to develop a primary care contracting model within New Jersey.\nBut this model relies on the insurance providers to administer the plan and add wrap-around coverage for other health care needs."}
