Two were adult women, one adult man and a 3-year-old boy.\n\nA state fire marshal says there are no signs foul play.\n\nDead are Connie Pitchett, Becky Hooper, Frosty Chase and 3-year-old Jeremiah Henson.\n\n\n\nThe Cherokee County Sheriff's Office says four others in the home escaped the fire.\n\nThe home is located in the 21100 block of South Keeler in the South Breeze Mobile Manor park.\n\nVictoria James said it was her sister, 3-year-old nephew, the sister's boyfriend and her sister's friend who all died in the fire. James said the home's owner, his wife and daughter got out alive. She still can barely find words to say how she feels after losing her family, especially her nephew.\n\n\"He didn't deserve this. He didn't deserve this at all,\" she said. \"This little boy, he was full of life, you know. He always had a smile on his face. There was never anything wrong with him.\"\n\n\n\nThe Tahlequah Fire Department said the home caught fire at about 2:15 a.m. Firefighters had the fire out in about 20 minutes then found four bodies inside.\n\nNeighbors reported hearing an explosion at the time the fire started.\n\nIsaac Collins tried to save the victims.\n\n\"It got real big, and someone opened the door and yelled, 'fire, fire someone get the baby,'\" Collins said.\n\n\"I tried to run down the hallway, and I couldn't even run down the hallway because something had dropped and just busted. Like fell from the roof.\"\n\nWhen the home started collapsing around him, Collins said he got out and tried to get the victims out a window, but the opening was too small.\n\n\n\nInvestigators say the fire doesn't look suspicious, but they will be bringing dogs to the scene to look for accelerants.\n\nThere were no smoke detectors present.\n\n\n\nAn investigator from the state Fire Marshal's Office is on scene trying to determine the cause of the fire.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Authorities say four people are dead after a mobile home caught fire at a mobile home park in the Park Hill area south of Tahlequah early Friday.", "author": "Dave Davis", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25886360/four-people-dead-in-cherokee-county-mobile-home-fire", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25886360_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Authorities say four people are dead after a mobile home caught fire at a mobile home park in the Park Hill area south of Tahlequah early Friday.", "title": "Four People Dead In Cherokee County Mobile Home Fire"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25886360_SA.jpg", "description": "Authorities say four people are dead after a mobile home caught fire at a mobile home park in the Park Hill area south of Tahlequah early Friday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Four People Dead In Cherokee County Mobile Home Fire"}, "wnreadableurl": "four-people-dead-in-cherokee-county-mobile-home-fire", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/06/27", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KOTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda71\"", "article_summary": "Authorities say four people are dead after a mobile home caught fire in the Park Hill area south of Tahlequah early Friday.\nThe home is located in the 21100 block of South Keeler in the South Breeze Mobile Manor park.\nIsaac Collins tried to save the victims.\nAn investigator from the state Fire Marshal's Office is on scene trying to determine the cause of the fire.\nThe home is located in the South Breeze Mobile Manor park."}
