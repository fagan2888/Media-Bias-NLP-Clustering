Volunteers with the organization are distributing flyers through door-to-door canvassing, attending committee hearings, and according to one lawmaker who has become a target of the campaign, intimidating constituents.\n\nAs many as 400,000 Virginians could qualify for coverage if the state expands the Medicaid program, but AFP is warning Virginians that the system \u201cwill cost Virginia taxpayers billions,\u201d require \u201cfuture tax hikes and budget cuts to vital services like schools, police and fire departments,\u201d undermine the \u201cdoctor-patient relationship,\u201d increase wait times and even endanger lives. \u201cMedicaid patients are almost twice as likely to die during surgery than individuals with private insurance,\u201d the group writes on its website.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government will pick up 100 percent of the cost of growing the program from 2014 to 2016 and states would contribute 10 percent thereafter. Analysis from the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis in Richmond finds that \u201cnet savings from Medicaid expansion would average about $135 million per year in the upcoming budget cycle,\u201d since expanding Medicaid \u201cwould allow the state to use federal funds instead of state dollars for these programs that already provide care to the uninsured in Virginia.\u201d\n\nSeventy-six percent of Virginia doctors treat new Medicaid patients, and the \u201cshare of doctors accepting new Medicaid patients is nearly the same as the share who are accepting new patients with private insurance or Medicare,\u201d the Institute reports. While Medicaid beneficiaries tend to be less healthy than the general uninsured population, people who do enroll in the program \u201care 25 percent more likely to report that their health is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018excellent.'\u201d\n\nThe GOP\u2019s refusal to fully implement the Affordable Care Act will leave more than half of the nation\u2019s uninsured working poor, approximately 8 million people, without access to health insurance. The 26 GOP-controlled states not participating in the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion are home to a disproportionate share of low-income Americans who aren\u2019t poor enough to qualify for the existing Medicaid program and make too much to be eligible for subsidies in the ACA\u2019s insurance marketplaces.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity has spent millions \u201cin states around the country, including Arkansas, Florida, Ohio, Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania, to run the kind of aggressive campaign that it is now waging here in Virginia, where much will depend on the governor\u2019s race,\u201d the New York Times notes. Democrat Terry McAuliffe favors expansion, while his Republican opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, does not. The Virginia panel weighing in on the matter will decide the question after the Nov. 5 election.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Volunteers with the conservative organization are distributing misleading flyers, attending committee hearings, and intimidating constituents.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Volunteers with the conservative organization are distributing misleading flyers, attending committee hearings, and intimidating constituents.", "title": "Billionaire Koch Brothers Spending Millions To Deny Health Coverage To Low-Income Americans", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/19/2806521/billionaire-koch-brothers-spending-millions-deny-health-coverage-income-americans/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/koch-bros.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Volunteers with the conservative organization are distributing misleading flyers, attending committee hearings, and intimidating constituents.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/koch-bros-320x213.jpg", "title": "Billionaire Koch Brothers Spending Millions To Deny Health Coverage To Low-Income Americans", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/koch-bros.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/koch-bros.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-19T12:00:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Billionaire Koch Brothers Spending Millions To Deny Health Coverage To Low-Income Americans CREDIT: AP ImagesCREDIT: AP ImagesConservative advocates funded by the billionaire industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch have launched a massive campaign pressuring states to deny health care coverage to lower income Americans through the Medicaid expansion contained in the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cMedicaid patients are almost twice as likely to die during surgery than individuals with private insurance,\u201d the group writes on its website.\n'\u201dThe GOP\u2019s refusal to fully implement the Affordable Care Act will leave more than half of the nation\u2019s uninsured working poor, approximately 8 million people, without access to health insurance.\nThe Virginia panel weighing in on the matter will decide the question after the Nov. 5 election.\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe favors expansion, while his Republican opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, does not."}
