SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — President Obama sat down with 3 YouTube personalities Thursday in a rare Internet-only appearance to talk about issues facing them and their audiences. Viewers were able to follow along via social media using the hashtag #YouTubeAsksObama.

Just 2 days after his well-received State of the Union address, the President appeared relaxed as the trio took turns asking questions on everything from student loans, cyber security, and health care, to Cuba/U.S. relations and Boko Haram.

President Obama joked with Hank Green that “his lease was up” at the White House in 2 years, adding “I hope I’ll get my security deposit back.”

Social media lit up at two points. First, when GloZell Green referred to the police as “the po-po” and when she told the President that Fidel Castro put the “dick in dictatorship.” Then, when she mistakenly referred to Mrs. Obama as the “first wife.” The President asked her, “Do you know something I don’t?” He graciously accepted her gift of 3 neon hunter green lipsticks for the First Lady, Sasha and Malia.

Bethany Mota wrapped up her interview with a few random questions. Here they are, along with his answers:

What’s your favorite TV show? SportsCenter, basketball and football games. When you were little what did you want to be when you grew up? An architect, or an NBA player, but I gave that up when I realized I didn’t have the talent. If you could have a superpower what would it be? Flying, as long as I could stay warm. Invisibility seems a little sneaky, so I guess the flying thing… I’d love to be able to speak any language… but as a superpower, it might be boring.”
