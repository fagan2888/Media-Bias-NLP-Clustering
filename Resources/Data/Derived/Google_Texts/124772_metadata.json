But Yanukovich was hardly more popular in the Russian-oriented eastern and southern areas of Ukraine than in the capital and other European-leaning cities like Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk.\n\nUkraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, announced Tuesday that the country was organizing a national guard force of 20,000 and mobilizing all active-duty soldiers and reservists \"to protect the country and citizens against all criminals, external and internal aggression.\"\n\nThe United States and European Union have warned Russia against carrying out the Crimean referendum on secession, which international legal experts say violates Ukraine's Constitution and international law in hijacking decisions on the control of national territory and borders, an authority that rests with the country as a whole.\n\nSome of Crimea's new Russian-allied leaders revised their position on their post-referendum plans Tuesday, saying that a majority vote in favor of the secession initiative would make Crimea an independent country. They had earlier said the vote would lead to reunion with Russia.\n\nBut their long-term intent is clearly to rejoin Russia, which ruled Crimea for centuries before Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made the territory part of Ukraine in 1954. That was a move of little strategic consequence until the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union marooned Russia's naval fleet in what is now part of independent Ukraine.\n\nThe rewording of the referendum question to seek voter approval for \"declaration of independence of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea\" may have been done under pressure from Moscow, if the Western threats of economic sanctions are giving the Kremlin pause to reflect on the potential losses that could be incurred for openly encouraging the annexation of another country's territory.\n\n\"Having adopted the declaration, we will have voiced ourselves as a republic, and as a republic we will be joining Russia,\" the Interfax news agency quoted Crimean parliament Speaker Vladimir Konstantinov as saying.\n\nThe European Union has threatened economic sanctions against Russia if it persists in supporting the Sunday referendum and welcoming the breakaway region of Ukraine into its territory. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier gave Moscow an ultimatum on Tuesday that it faces trade, travel and economic sanctions unless it moves to de-escalate the Crimean conflict.\n\n\"We continue to urge Russia to use the last possibilities that are still there for a diplomatic solution against such an escalation,\" Steinmeier told reporters during a visit to the Estonian capital, Tallinn. \"Otherwise, relations between Europe and Russia won\u2019t improve.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @cjwilliamslat\n\ncarol.williams@latimes.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Crimea bars 'nationalists' from secession vote; EU warns of sanctions", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Crimea 's Russian-controlled parliament voted Tuesday to bar what it considers \"nationalist political organizations\" involved in the recent leadership turmoil in Kiev from taking part in Sunday's vote on whether to separate from Ukraine and become an independent country with aspirations of joining Russia, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.", "title": "Crimea bars 'nationalists' from secession vote; EU warns of sanctions", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-ukraine-crimea-russia-europe-20140311-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-531f85d3/turbine/la-fg-wn-ukraine-crimea-russia-europe-20140311", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Russia, Crimea, secession vote, Ukraine", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/79590641", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-03-11", "Description": "Russia and West posture ahead of Crimea's Sunday vote to secede from Ukraine, eventually join Russia", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Russia, Crimea, secession vote, Ukraine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4165\"", "article_summary": "Some of Crimea's new Russian-allied leaders revised their position on their post-referendum plans Tuesday, saying that a majority vote in favor of the secession initiative would make Crimea an independent country.\nThey had earlier said the vote would lead to reunion with Russia.\nGerman Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier gave Moscow an ultimatum on Tuesday that it faces trade, travel and economic sanctions unless it moves to de-escalate the Crimean conflict.\nThe European Union has threatened economic sanctions against Russia if it persists in supporting the Sunday referendum and welcoming the breakaway region of Ukraine into its territory.\nBut their long-term intent is clearly to rejoin Russia, which ruled Crimea for centuries before Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made the territory part of Ukraine in 1954."}
