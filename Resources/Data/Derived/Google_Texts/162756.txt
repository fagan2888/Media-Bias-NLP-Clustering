A new CVS/pharmacy in Van Buren, which began business Sunday at 2015 Fayetteville Road, will hold a grand opening event starting 9 a.m. Friday.

Officials from CVS/pharmacy and the Van Buren Chamber of Commerce will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony followed by product giveaways and samples throughout the day. Weekday hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Pharmacy hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday.

The store on the northwest corner of Rena Road and Arkansas 59 features drive-through pharmacy window service, a digital photo cafe, health, beauty and personal care products, and general merchandise and food.

CVS/pharmacy is providing flu shots seven days a week with no appointment needed. CVS/pharmacy can directly bill many national and regional health insurance plans that cover all or part of the cost of a flu shot. Flu shots are considered a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, and are fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.

The Van Buren CVS/pharmacy is its third store to open in Arkansas. Two more CVS/pharmacy locations will open later this fall in Bella Vista and Fayetteville, according to a news release.

CVS/pharmacy, the retail division of CVS Health, has more than 7,700 locations and was the first national pharmacy to end the sale of tobacco, the release states.
