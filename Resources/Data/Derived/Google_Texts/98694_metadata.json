Partially because of the weakened VRA, 10 states passed harsh new voting restrictions that will be in full force for 2016, including seven new voter ID laws. New studies suggest that the motivation of these laws is suppressing non-white voters, and worryingly, that they will be successful at doing so. As I\u2019ve noted before, laws that shift the composition of the electorate have the impact of shifting resources away from low-turnout communities towards higher turnout communities. That makes these laws all the more worrying as 2016 approaches.\n\nWhy states pass laws:\n\nA number of earlier studies have already suggested that voter ID laws are motivated by voter suppression. Political scientists Keith Bentele and Erin O\u2019Brien found the laws were, \u201chighly partisan, strategic, and racialized affairs.\u201d Later, Bentele and Ian Vandewalker found that, anti-Black stereotyping is \u201cstrongly associated\u201d with the proposal of voter ID laws, though share of the population that are Black and turnout among people of color predict the passage of such laws. In an early study, political scientists Daniel Smith and Seth Mckee found that, \u201cwhere elections are competitive, the furtherance of restrictive voter ID laws is a means of maintaining Republican support while curtailing Democratic electoral gains.\u201d\n\nIn their new study, with political scientist William Hicks, they instead examine what predicts support for voter ID laws among individual legislators. They find, unsurprisingly, that partisan identification is the strongest predictor. However, the also find that, \u201cDemocratic lawmakers representing substantial black district populations are more opposed to restrictive voter ID laws, whereas Republican legislators with substantial black district populations are more supportive.\u201d This is powerful evidence that voter suppression is at heart of support for voter ID.\n\nAnother strand of studies examine what leads individuals to support voter ID laws. A study by McKee and other scholars finds that, \u201cracial resentment appears to have the strongest impact on attitudes toward strict photo ID laws, and the effect is seen among both Republicans and Democrats.\u201d An earlier study by political scientists David Wilson and Paul Brewer finds that racial resentment increases support for voter ID laws (see chart), as does regular Fox News viewership and believes that fraud is widespread. A more recent study by nearly half a dozen scholars finds that, \u201cracial resentment appears to have the strongest impact on attitudes toward strict photo ID laws, and the effect is seen among both Republicans and Democrats.\u201d\n\nThere are also questions of racial bias in implementation. A 2014 study by Ariel White, Noah Nathan and Julie Faller finds that when election officials are queried about voter ID laws, they are more likely to respond to emails from a white sounding name than a Latino sounding one (see chart). A 2008 study of New Mexico finds that Hispanic voters are more likely to be asked to show voter ID at the polls. Data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study show that voters report being asked to show ID in states without voter ID laws, raising further concerns.\n\nAlthough the study is still in the working paper stage, an important study by Avidit Acharya, Matthew Blackwell and Maya Sen finds that, \u201cthose parts of the American South where slavery was more prevalent in the 1860s are today areas with lower average black voter turnout, larger numbers of election lawsuits alleging race-related constitutional violations, and more racial polarization in terms of party identification.\u201d Their work suggests that slavery created \u201cincentives to to reinforce existing racist norms and institutions to maintain control over the newly free African-American population\u201d which persist to this day. Given that the right to vote is still very contested, and the huge stakes of 2016, the impact of these laws is all the more important.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a presidential election year where much is at stake, the ability to vote matters more than ever", "title": "American elections enter a dangerous new era: Here\u2019s what you need to know about Voter ID laws in 2016", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a presidential election year where much is at stake, the ability to vote matters more than ever", "title": "American elections enter a dangerous new era: Here\u2019s what you need to know about Voter ID laws in 2016", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/20/american_elections_enter_a_dangerous_new_era_heres_what_you_need_to_know_about_voter_id_laws_in_2016/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/voting_booth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a presidential election year where much is at stake, the ability to vote matters more than ever", "title": "American elections enter a dangerous new era: Here\u2019s what you need to know about Voter ID laws in 2016", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/voting_booth.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, election reform, Research, Voter ID", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14c2\"", "article_summary": "Why states pass laws:A number of earlier studies have already suggested that voter ID laws are motivated by voter suppression.\nPartially because of the weakened VRA, 10 states passed harsh new voting restrictions that will be in full force for 2016, including seven new voter ID laws.\nAnother strand of studies examine what leads individuals to support voter ID laws.\nData from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study show that voters report being asked to show ID in states without voter ID laws, raising further concerns.\nHowever, the also find that, \u201cDemocratic lawmakers representing substantial black district populations are more opposed to restrictive voter ID laws, whereas Republican legislators with substantial black district populations are more supportive.\u201d This is powerful evidence that voter suppression is at heart of support for voter ID."}
