Health Link officials said that Cusack was one of many people not completing the process, and in November the system was changed to automatically forward applications to the Department of Welfare and Supportive Services regardless of whether the process was completed or not.\n\nAs was the case with Cusack, a Health Link spokesperson told KTNV that the exact amount of people\u2019s information automatically forwarded to the state welfare office is unknown, but that it is likely in the thousands.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how it happened, they just need to be aware that it did happen so they can fix it,\u201d Cusack told KTNV.\n\nCusack\u2019s unwanted Medicaid cards arrived in his mailbox as countless Nevada residents continue to complain that they have not received their cards even months after completing their applications for Medicaid \u2013 a program that has grown by one-third, or 118,000 participants, since expanded eligibility under the federal health care reform law took effect in Nevada.\n\nFigures released last Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services show Nevada\u2019s Medicaid caseload was 434,819 as of March 31, an increase of 117, 635 from the same month a year before, reports The Associated Press.\n\nThat increase includes nearly 64,000 people who were first-time qualifiers for Medicaid as of Jan. 1, when Nevada expanded eligibility to include childless adults with an income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe Division of Welfare and Supportive Services currently has a backlog of 66,000 applications waiting processing.\n\nAs Cusack works with the Department of Health and Human Services to correct the Medicaid mistake, the state welfare office said it has tried to contact many of the people who had incomplete applications that were forwarded to the Department of Welfare and Supportive Services.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, officials said that some applications may have been processed that were not intended for completion.\n\nCusack says that part of his motivation is simply to follow the law, noting that the paperwork explicitly states that it is fraud to use a Medicaid card someone is not qualified to receive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Nevada resident mistakenly received multiple Medicaid cards for himself and his son months after his information was automatically
