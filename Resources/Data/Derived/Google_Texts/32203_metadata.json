The hospital had previously served as an affiliate of North Shore from 2000 through 2006.\n\nTerry Lynam, spokesman for North Shore-LIJ, told the News-Review last fall that consolidations such as the PBMC-North Shore-LIJ merger have \u201cmuch to do with the [insurance] reimbursement model.\u201d\n\nThe organization\u2019s North Shore-LIJ CareConnect Insurance Company, Inc. is offered on the New York State of Health insurance marketplace, which was put in place by the Affordable Care Act \u2014 more commonly known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI think, in healthcare, the whole delivery model nationally is clearly changing,\u201d he said last fall. \u201cThere is much greater focus on managing the overall health of an individual, as opposed to simply treating them when they get sick.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is to be able to improve care coordination,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a health system, we offer this whole range of different services\u2026 and we are trying keep all of the services within the network.\u201d\n\nNearly a year ago, Andrew Mitchell, PBMC Health\u2019s president and CEO, told the News-Review that the Riverhead hospital was feeling that change \u2014 and reported experiencing a shift in demand from inpatient services, provided in a hospital setting, to a greater demand in outpatient services, provided at clinics and doctor\u2019s offices.\n\nDemetrios Kadenas, chief development officer at PBMC Health, pointed not only to North Shore\u2019s health insurance program that will benefit PBMC patients, but other things such as an economy of scale in the large organization, the system\u2019s Feinstein Institute of Medical Research, as well as their commitment to supporting community hospitals. PBMC will be North Shore\u2019s fourth system hospital in Suffolk County, joining Huntington Hospital, Southside Hospital in Bay Shore and South Oaks Hospital in Amityville\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the CareConnect,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a number of things going on academically and clinically at North Shore that will allow us to greatly expand PBMC.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "peconic bay medical center, north shore lij, healthcare, affordable care act,affordable care act,healthcare,north shore lij", "og": {"url": "http://riverheadnewsreview.timesreview.com/2015/03/63475/peconic-bay-medical-center-votes-to-join-north-shore-lij/", "image": "http://media.timesreview.com.s3.amazonaws.com/riverheadnewsreview/files/PBMC2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Peconic Bay Medical Center will be joining forces with one of the country's largest integrated healthcare systems, North Shore-LIJ.", "title": "Peconic Bay Medical Center votes to join North Shore-LIJ"}, "fb": {"admins": "64401241,16320909,508876025,591622321,114502230", "app_id": 115179118576729}, "description": "Peconic Bay Medical Center will be joining forces with one of the country's largest integrated healthcare systems, North Shore-LIJ.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb29\"", "article_summary": "Peconic Bay Medical Center will be joining forces with one of the country\u2019s largest integrated healthcare systems, North Shore-LIJ.\nPBMC will be North Shore\u2019s fourth system hospital in Suffolk County, joining Huntington Hospital, Southside Hospital in Bay Shore and South Oaks Hospital in Amityville\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the CareConnect,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere are a number of things going on academically and clinically at North Shore that will allow us to greatly expand PBMC.\u201dCommentscomments\nTerry Lynam, spokesman for North Shore-LIJ, told the News-Review last fall that consolidations such as the PBMC-North Shore-LIJ merger have \u201cmuch to do with the [insurance] reimbursement model.\u201dThe organization\u2019s North Shore-LIJ CareConnect Insurance Company, Inc. is offered on the New York State of Health insurance marketplace, which was put in place by the Affordable Care Act \u2014 more commonly known as Obamacare.\nThe merger comes after months of extended negotiations between the two organizations, which will add another 1,300 employees to North Shore-LIJ\u2019s staff of over 54,000."}
