The federal government picks up 100 percent of the expansion\u2019s cost in 2014-2016, before scaling back its contribution to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond.\n\nBut the Supreme Court made expansion optional, so only 28 states and the District of Columbia have augmented their programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just seeing some stubbornness that\u2019s really based on ideology, not on wise public health policy, that is preventing most people in most states from getting the Medicaid that would save the state money in the long term,\u201d Mr. Obama told ABC.\n\nThe overall health law remains a key target for the Republican-majority Congress, which is hoping to leverage a budget tool known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to pass a filibuster-proof repeal bill, forcing Mr. Obama to veto their will.\n\nAlso, the Supreme Court will rule by June whether the administration is unlawfully paying out exchange subsidies to at least 34 states that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov portal. Without the subsidies, the law would be much less attractive in those states, giving the GOP daylight to push their own health reforms.\n\nMr. Obama has said he is open to changes to his law \u2014 he\u2019s signed some measures and delayed part of the law \u2014 but not the type of Republican-led bills that would scrap its mandates or otherwise hobble it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama gives his signature health law an \"8\" on a scale from 1 to 10, saying there is still room to improve the 2010 overhaul that's been a political flashpoint since passage.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama gives his signature health law an \u201c8\u201d on a scale from 1 to 10, saying there is still room to improve the 2010 overhaul that\u2019s been a political flashpoint since passage.", "title": "Obama: Health law deserves an \u20188\u2019 out of 10", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/8/obama-health-law-deserves-8-out-10/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/07/d650f8dba099040f730f6a7067004f66.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/07/d650f8dba099040f730f6a7067004f66.jpg", "title": "Obama: Health law deserves an \u20188\u2019 out of 10", "description": "President Obama gives his signature health law an \"8\" on a scale from 1 to 10, saying there is still room to improve the 2010 overhaul that's been a political flashpoint since passage.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Abc News"}, "article_summary": "In an ABC News interview published Wednesday, Mr. Obama touted the Affordable Care Act\u2019s progress in cutting the uninsured rate.\nThe overall health law remains a key target for the Republican-majority Congress, which is hoping to leverage a budget tool known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to pass a filibuster-proof repeal bill, forcing Mr. Obama to veto their will.\nPresident Obama gives his signature health law an \u201c8\u201d on a scale from 1 to 10, saying there is still room to improve the 2010 overhaul that\u2019s been a political flashpoint since passage.\nWithout the subsidies, the law would be much less attractive in those states, giving the GOP daylight to push their own health reforms.\nMr. Obama has said he is open to changes to his law \u2014 he\u2019s signed some measures and delayed part of the law \u2014 but not the type of Republican-led bills that would scrap its mandates or otherwise hobble it."}
