We will not bring hundreds of thousands into a system that is broken and buckling.\u201d\n\n2015: \u201cWe are looking at that (expanding Medicaid).\u201d\n\nAfter spending the first four years of his governorship refusing to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare, Governor Robert Bentley (R-AL) told a group of lawyers in Montgomery Thursday that, though final decisions have not been made, his administration is working toward that goal.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office has been in negotiations with Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell in an attempt to secure waivers from certain requirements, allowing Alabama to set up a \u201cprivate option\u201d plan similar to those in Arkansas and Pennsylvania.\n\nUntil 2020 the federal government has pledged to cover 90 percent of the costs of expansion incurred by the state. Alabama\u2019s ailing General Fund, which scrambled to cover a $250 million hole this past year with a combination of tax increases and cuts, would be responsible for coming up with the other 10 percent\u2014an amount the governor\u2019s office conservatively estimates to be more than $100 million a year for the next 6 years.\n\n\u201cIf we were to accept (federal dollars to expand Medicaid) you have to realize it is going to cost the state of Alabama over the next six years $710 million in the General Fund,\u201d Bentley admitted. \u201cNow folks, I can\u2019t even get them to raise a hundred million dollars. So we\u2019ve got to look at a funding stream if we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d\n\nThat $100 million would need to come in the form of either taxes or cuts\u2014a heavy lift for conservative lawmakers who just spent the past year fighting other tax increases.\n\nMedicaid expansion would require the state to accept into the program Alabamians making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $32,253 a year for a family of 4.\n\nMedicaid is currently the largest line item in Alabama\u2019s budget, comprising 37 percent of the General Fund budget. According to the Alabama Policy Institute, the state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures increased by 53% between 2001 and 2013, and as the state\u2019s senior population increases, costs are expected to grow even further.\n\nThe compromise Bentley is pursuing with the Obama administration would most likely come in the form of using the Medicaid reforms Alabama passed in 2013, which allow Regional Care Organizations (RCOs) to contract with Medicaid in a system where health care providers will be given a set dollar amount to treat each patient in their care.\n\nBentley spokeswoman Jennifer Ardis told Yellowhammer the governor\u2019s comments are simply a reflection of his work to strengthen those RCOs.\n\n\u201cThe Governor didn\u2019t say anything new today that he hasn\u2019t already publicly said,\u201d said Ardis. \u201cThe Governor\u2019s total focus is on making the current Medicaid RCO program a success. We have made great strides in Medicaid transformation, but the process isn\u2019t complete.\u201d\n\nLike this article? Hate it?
