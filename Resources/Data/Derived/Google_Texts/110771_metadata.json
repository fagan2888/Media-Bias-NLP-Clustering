For example, while a year's supply of Yasmin birth control would normally have cost women $744, it's now free for those with insurance under Obamacare. Nerdwallet estimated the value of some of the more common health screenings and services for women across five cities. Because the cost of doctors' visits vary regionally, an insured woman in Houston would save about $1,215 a year, while one in New York would save roughly $1,247:\n\nFor the analysis, Nerdwallet used HHS data to calculate average premiums, AMA and Medicare data for the out-of-pocket costs, and GoodRX data for the cost of Yasmin. You can see the full methodology here.\n\nOf course, if you're not on birth control and don't get pap smears, because \"Extreme Private-Parts Danger\" is your middle name, you would probably not reap these rewards. And it's worth noting that a 27-year-old who makes more than the cutoff for the federal subsidies, or about $46,680, would actually pay considerably more for a silver plan: about $2,500 per year.\n\nBut remember, that price includes all medical care. It covers all of the free women's services listed above and all of your fell-off-my-bike, what-is-this-rash, why-won't-this-migraine-go-away medical concerns.\n\nYou can't put a price on knowing it's not herpes\u2014but if you did it would be $214 a month for the second-lowest price mid-tier plan without a subsidy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The value of the free birth control, pap smears, and screenings women would get for free is more than the price of a mid-range plan, a new study finds.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The value of the free birth control, pap smears, and screenings women would get for free is more than the price of a mid-range plan, a new study finds.", "title": "For Women, the Benefits of Insurance Outweigh Its Costs", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/03/4576095423_b4d1bb79db_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/for-women-the-benefits-of-insurance-outweigh-its-costs/284500/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29b8\"", "article_summary": "For example, while a year's supply of Yasmin birth control would normally have cost women $744, it's now free for those with insurance under Obamacare.\nBut that cost is cancelled out by the range of women's preventative health services that all insurance plans must now cover.\nThe so-called \"Young Invincibles\" get their name from the fact that many under-30s say they won't sign up for health insurance by the March 31 deadline because they're already healthy.\nFor young women who qualify for subsidies, the free benefits of insurance offset the cost of paying for it, according to a new analysis from Nerdwallet, a consumer financial education site.\nNerdwallet estimated the value of some of the more common health screenings and services for women across five cities."}
