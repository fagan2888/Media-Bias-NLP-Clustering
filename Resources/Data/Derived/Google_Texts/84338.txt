The quarter brought the third consecutive decline in cross-border bank credit, which saw its outstanding stock decline to $26.4 trillion as of the end of December.

Overall, cross-border lending fell by $650 billion for the quarter, of which $267 billion of that was a decline in lending to banks in the euro area, the BIS said. Lending also declined to emerging market economies, which saw a $160 billion fall, for a year-over-year contraction of 8 percent, according to the BIS.

Cross-border lending can fall in a number of ways, ranging from a reduction in traditional loans to companies and banks paying back bond market debt.

Lending to residents of mainland China fell by $114 billion, and is down 25 percent year-over-year.
