Randy Hodges has worked in education for over 40 years, and has served as superintendent for roughly 10 years, although not consecutively. Hodges says his decision isn't because he doesn't enjoy his position.\n\n\"I love my job,\" he says. \"I feel very fortunate to be the superintendent of education of Lauderdale County. I feel very humbled by this position.\"\n\nHe says it's challenging to try to properly fill his role as superintendent, while also enduring the chaos of elections.\n\n\"I'm not going through another election. My family and I have been through five. It's very, very demanding. It's extremely hard to do your job as superintendent and run an election. Extremely hard,\" Hodges explains.\n\nHodges did mention that there has been talk of moving to a system in which the superintendent would be appointed rather than elected- a system widely used by most school districts. In fact, the Mississippi Parents Campaign sites that only 1 percent of school districts in the United States hold elections for their superintendents.\n\n\"If, in fact, they do pass that this year in legislation that it's appointed and the board still would want me to be around, then I would consider continuing to work,\" Hodges says.\n\nIn the meantime, the superintendent says he's happy to complete the remainder of his term in Lauderdale County.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Lauderdale County Superintendent of Education has announced he will not be running for re-election.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "The Lauderdale County Superintendent of Education has announced he will not be running for re-election.", "title": "Lauderdale County Superintendent Not Seeking Re-election", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Lauderdale-County-Superintendent-Not-Seeking-Re-election-241981491.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/153/5A2/1535A2EC2F9F4CD99A7AD3FD1CCA32F4", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0DC/AB2/0DCAB22FBBF24C8F801FEC4C1DFDE5C8.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The Lauderdale County Superintendent of Education has announced he will not be running for re-election.", "title": "Lauderdale County Superintendent Not Seeking Re-election", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Lauderdale-County-Superintendent-Not-Seeking-Re-election-241981491.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/hodges2.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Lauderdale County Superintendent Not Seeking Re-election", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Lauderdale County Superintendent Not Seeking"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c48\"", "article_summary": "The Superintendent of Education for Lauderdale County has announced he will not be running for re-election.\nIn the meantime, the superintendent says he's happy to complete the remainder of his term in Lauderdale County.\n\"I feel very fortunate to be the superintendent of education of Lauderdale County.\nExtremely hard,\" Hodges explains.\nRandy Hodges has worked in education for over 40 years, and has served as superintendent for roughly 10 years, although not consecutively."}
