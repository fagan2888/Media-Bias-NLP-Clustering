Virtually all types of healthcare providers, health plans, and drug manufacturers would be impacted by the budget provisions if adopted as proposed \u2013 an unlikely scenario given the Republican House leadership\u2019s reaction to the document.\n\nHospitals will not be altogether pleased with many of the budget proposals. \"Today\u2019s budget proposal includes some problematic policies that would undermine the ability of hospitals to improve the healthcare system and, ultimately, puts access to services at risk for the patients and communities we serve,\" said AHA President and CEO Rich Umbdenstock, in a statement.\n\nThe Medicare and Medicaid savings proposals (many of which are carry-overs from prior budgets) could resurface as spending offsets in the pending negotiations on Medicare physician fee schedule reform legislation or in future budget negotiations. Below are some highlights (or lowlights, if you're so inclined) of the Administration\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid legislative proposals (all savings estimates are for the 10-year period of FYs 2015-2024):\n\nMajor Medicare Provider Payment Provisions\n\nThe proposed FY 2015 budget includes a package of Medicare legislative proposals estimated to save $407.2 billion over 10 years. They include:\n\nReduce Medicare coverage of bad debts from 65 percent in most cases to 25 percent over three years starting in 2015 ($30.8 billion/10 years).\n\nReduce Medicare indirect medical education add-on payments by $14.6 billion (although a new targeted grant program would reinvest $5.2 billion of these savings).\n\nReduce critical access hospital (CAH) reimbursement to 100 percent of costs ($1.7 billion) and limit CAH designation eligibility for hospitals within 10 miles of another hospital ($720 million).\n\nReduce payment updates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), long-term care hospitals (LTCHs), skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and home health agencies (HHAs) by 1.1 percentage points each year from 2015 through 2024 (the update could not fall below 0 percent). The SNF reduction would be accelerated, beginning with a -2.5 percent update in FY 2015, tapering down to a -0.97 percent update in FY 2022. These provisions would save $97.9 billion over 10 years.\n\nImplement bundled payment for post-acute care providers, including LTCHs, IRFs, SNFs, and HHAs beginning in 2019, with rates set to produce a permanent and total cumulative adjustment of 2.85 permanent by 2021, and beneficiary coinsurance equal to current levels ($8.7 billion).\n\nAdjust the standard for classifying a facility as an IRF (at least 75% of patient cases admitted to an IRF must meet one or more of 13 designated conditions), saving $2.4 billion.\n\nReduce by up to 3 percent payments to SNFs with high rates of care-sensitive, preventable hospital readmissions, beginning in 2018 ($1.9 billion).\n\nEqualize IRF and SNF payments for certain conditions involving hips and knees, pulmonary conditions, and other conditions selected by the Secretary ($1.6 billion).\n\nImplement a budget neutral value-based purchasing program for additional provider types, including SNFs, HHAs, ambulatory surgical centers, and hospital outpatient departments beginning in 2016. At least 2 percent of payments must be tied to the quality and efficiency of care.\n\nAlign Medicare payment for clinical laboratory services with private sector rates and encourage electronic reporting of laboratory results ($7.9 billion).\n\nStrengthen the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) by reducing the target rate of Medicare cost growth from gross domestic product plus one percentage point to plus 0.5 percentage point, which would make it easier to trigger ACA provisions requiring reductions to Medicare provider reimbursement ($12.9 billion).\n\nThe budget endorses reform of the sustainable growth rate formula used to update Medicare physician fee schedule payments, including a period of predictable payments followed by reimbursement tied to alternative payment models and value-based purchasing, along the lines of pending Congressional reform legislation.\n\nPrescription Drug Provisions\n\nReduce payment for physician-administered Medicare Part B drugs from 106 percent to 103 percent of average sales price (ASP). If a physician\u2019s cost for purchasing the drug exceeds 103 percent of ASP, the drug manufacturer would be required to provide a rebate to ensure that the provider\u2019s net cost to acquire the drug equals 103 percent of ASP minus an overhead fee to be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary would be authorized to pay a portion of the entire amount above ASP as a flat fee rather than a percentage in a budget-neutral manner. This proposal is estimated to result in $6.8 billion in savings.\n\nProvide Medicaid-level drug rebates for brand name and generic drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries who receive Part D low-income subsidies, beginning in 2016 ($117.3 billion).\n\nEffectively close the Medicare Part D coverage gap by 2016, rather than 2020, by increasing manufacturer \u201ccoverage gap\u201d discounts from 50 percent to 75 percent beginning in plan year 2016 ($7.9 billion).\n\nAllow the Secretary to suspend coverage and payment for Part D drugs (1) prescribed by providers who have misprescribed or overprescribed drugs with abuse potential, and (2) that pose an imminent risk to patients. The Secretary also could require additional information on certain Part D prescriptions, such as diagnosis and incident codes, as a condition of coverage.\n\nEncourage the use of generic drugs by Part D low-income subsidy beneficiaries by modifying copayments ($8.5 billion).\n\nLower Medicaid drug costs by clarifying the definition of brand drugs, collecting an additional rebate for generic drugs when prices grow faster than inflation, and including certain prenatal vitamins and fluorides in the rebate program. The plan also would make a technical correction to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) alternative rebate for new drug formulations, limit to 12 quarters the timeframe for which manufacturers can dispute drug rebate amounts, exclude authorized generic drugs from average manufacturer price calculations for determining rebate obligations for brand drugs, and calculate Medicaid federal upper limits based only on generic drug prices. These proposals are projected to save $8.6 billion over 10 years.\n\nDirect states to track high prescribers and utilizers of Medicaid prescription drugs ($540 million).\n\nRequire manufacturers to pay Medicaid rebate equal to the entire amount that the state has paid for the drugs in cases where the state improperly reported non-drug products as covered outpatient drugs, or where the state improperly reported drugs that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has found to be less than effective. In addition, the budget would allow more regular audits and surveys of manufacturers to ensure compliance with Medicaid drug rebate agreement requirements; require drugs to be electronically listed with the FDA to receive Medicaid coverage; and increase penalties for reporting false information for the calculation of Medicaid rebates.\n\nIncrease the availability of generic drugs and biologics by authorizing the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to stop companies from entering into \u201cpay for delay\u201d agreements ($9.1 billion) and modifying the length of exclusivity on brand name biologics ($4 billion).\n\nMajor Program Integrity/Efficiency Provisions\n\nExpand funding for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program, the Medicaid Integrity Program, and Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and other Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) program integrity efforts.\n\nExpand the current authority to exclude individuals and entities from federal health programs if they are affiliated with a sanctioned entity by closing a \u201cloophole\u201d that allows an officer, managing employee, or owner of a sanctioned entity to avoid exclusion by resigning his or her position or divesting his or her ownership; and extending the exclusion authority to entities affiliated with a sanctioned entity ($60 million in savings).\n\nAuthorize civil monetary penalties or other intermediate sanctions for providers who do not update enrollment records ($90 million).\n\nExpand authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse or neglect of Medicaid beneficiaries in non-institutional settings.\n\nExclude radiation therapy, therapy services, advanced imaging, and anatomic pathology services from the in-office ancillary services exception to the prohibition against physician self-referrals ( Stark law ), except in cases where a practice meets certain accountability standards, as defined by the Secretary effective for calendar year 2016 ($6 billion).\n\nExpand the authority of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to require prior authorization for all Medicare fee-for-service items, and mandate prior authorization of advance imaging services and power mobility devices ($90 million).\n\nAllow the Secretary to create a system to validate practitioners\u2019 orders for certain high-risk items and services.\n\nIncrease reporting and review of so-called \u201chigher-risk\u201d banking arrangements to receive Medicare payments (such as \u201csweep accounts\u201d that immediately transfer funds from a financial account to an investment account in another jurisdiction, preventing Medicare from recovering improper payments).\n\nOther Medicare & Medicaid Provisions", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/reimbursement-provisions-fy15-budget-400-billion-cuts", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Obama Administration released its proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2015 this week.
