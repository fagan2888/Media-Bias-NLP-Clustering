Shocked. But I'm so happy.\n\n\u201cI thought it (proposal) might be coming here at some point. I mean, we have been together for seven years. But I never imagined something like this. What an incredible day.''\n\nUSF brought back 14 members of its inaugural team from 1997 and introduced them on the field during the second quarter. Right after that, Grothe (2006-09 at USF) was introduced and his proposal was shown on the video board.\n\n\u201cI've been planning this for a few weeks and I'm glad I was able to do it this way,'' said Grothe, a former Lake Gibson High School standout who works in sales for a beer distributor. \u201cI told Alyssa I was being called to the field because they wanted to recognize me for being the Big East's all-time leading passer. She had no idea.\n\n\u201cThen I whispered in her ear, 'This really isn't for me. This is for you.' I got on my knee and asked her to marry me. I guess we'll always remember this one, right?''\n\nRight.\n\n\u201cI think I'm still shaking,'' said Ashley, a former USF cheerleader who is from Palm Harbor. \u201cI don't even remember what he told me. I think I said yes. The whole thing was kind of overwhelming.''", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 26 Oct 2013 14:10:44 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA - On the field where he made a name for himself as the University of South Florida's all-time leading passer, former quarterback Matt Grothe called the biggest play of his life.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA - On the field where he made a name for himself as the University of South Florida's all-time leading passer, former quarterback Matt Grothe called the biggest play of his life.", "title": "Ex-USF QB surprises girlfriend with proposal", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/colleges/usf-bulls/former-usf-qb-grothe-surprises-girlfriend-with-proposal-during-game-20131026/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131026/ARTICLE/131029387/EP/1/1/EP-131029387.jpg", "height": 519}, "updated_time": "2013-10-26T16:48:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA - On the field where he made a name for himself as the University of South Florida's all-time leading passer, former quarterback Matt Grothe called the biggest play of his life.", "title": "Ex-USF QB surprises girlfriend with proposal", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131026/ARTICLE/131029387/AR/0/AR-131029387.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-26T14:10:44Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-26T16:48:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c53\"", "article_summary": "Right after that, Grothe (2006-09 at USF) was introduced and his proposal was shown on the video board.\n\u201cI think I'm still shaking,'' said Ashley, a former USF cheerleader who is from Palm Harbor.\nUSF brought back 14 members of its inaugural team from 1997 and introduced them on the field during the second quarter.\n\u201cI thought it (proposal) might be coming here at some point.\n\u201cI told Alyssa I was being called to the field because they wanted to recognize me for being the Big East's all-time leading passer."}
