They are labeled children to promote political agendas, even though most are teens and adults, according to those willing to break down a White House-imposed wall of secrecy.\n\nIf we had such a formidable wall at the border, we wouldn\u2019t have this mess.\n\nThese are not toddlers or grade-schoolers who miraculously traveled more than 1,600 miles. These are persons of working age who are ready to displace Americans who want jobs. Being in their late teens and early 20s, they\u2019re a direct challenge to Americans of those ages, a group whose unemployment rates are two to three times higher than the official national average.\n\nBut the Obama administration won\u2019t reveal the truth about the ages of the illegal immigrants.\n\nThat information is instantly available from the extensive computer system used to enter copious data about every person picked up at the border. There are NO privacy laws that prevent the release of the total numbers, statistics or overviews about them, nor about where they are being held, transferred or being released. Privacy laws protect details about individuals but don\u2019t apply to the big picture that the public wants to know, deserves to know and needs to know.\n\nYet White House press secretary Josh Earnest gives only lip service to disclosure before instantly yanking it away: \u201cThe public does have a right to know what\u2019s happening \u2026 [but] at the same time, there are privacy rights that are included in the law that this administration is committed to enforcing and following.\u201d\n\nHe distorts privacy laws totally out of recognition. Conveniently, he recited no specific law and was not immediately asked for one by the press. There isn\u2019t one that applies.\n\nIf they were willing, federal officials could issue a daily update of persons arrested crossing our border illegally; instead we have been stuck for weeks using an obviously outdated figure of \u201c57,000 juveniles since October.\u201d\n\nThis secrecy is a repeat of last fall\u2019s playing-dumb about the Obamacare rollout. On opening day, President Barack Obama told us that \u201cmore than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov\u201d that morning. It took the country forever to learn that only six people were able to enroll in Obamacare on that first day.\n\nIt\u2019s an insult to label someone a child when they\u2019re 16 or older. Every parent has learned this lesson, as have relatives, teachers, friends and neighbors. They\u2019re being labeled children for a political purpose, namely to drum up sympathy. Yet we should find it suspicious that news reports that describe \u201cunaccompanied children\u201d also talk about buses filled with \u201cmothers with children.\u201d That\u2019s in addition to avoiding the word \u201cillegal\u201d and substituting terms like \u201cmigrant\u201d and \u201crefugee.\u201d\n\nHow do we know about the ages, since the White House has silenced the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, banned photo-taking and question-asking by media and congressional tours of facilities? It\u2019s been leaking out through Congress \u2014 and citizen-journalists who have smuggled out photos remark that most of the \u201cchildren\u201d appear to be \u201cworking-age men.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike McCaul, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, told Fox News: \u201cAbout 80 percent of these so-called children are about 16 to 17 years old, mostly male. That, from a security standpoint, greatly concerns me. What are they going to be doing in the United States of America with no education \u2014 can\u2019t speak English? That\u2019s the threat that I think a lot of people are concerned about.\u201d\n\nOn my Ernest Istook radio show, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican and chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, told me \u201cthe sizable majority of the unaccompanied minors are teenage boys.\u201d Rep. Steve Stockman, Texas Republican and freshly returned from a trip to the border, agreed it is \u201cabsolutely true\u201d that most are teenagers. He said officials even call them \u201cadult children\u201d who are as old as 27.\n\nRep. Jim Bridenstine, Oklahoma Repblican, toured the facility at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and said the ages were officially recorded as 12 to 17. But \u201cIt struck me how many folks were there that looked like they were in their upper teens if not early 20s,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing orders, border officials let detainees self-report their age, despite federal statutes that require medical tests also to be used. Being well-informed about Obama administration policies, individuals know not to admit being over 17. Many claim to be a few weeks away from turning 18, so that after admission into the U.S., their federal guardianship will end quickly, yet they can remain in the country pending years-away deportation hearings.\n\nA determined media would pound away daily at the wall of secrecy and concealment erected by the Obama White House about immigration, forcing that wall to topple. The only thing transparent about this presidency is that its deceit is so obvious that you can see right through it. If you simply open your eyes.\n\nErnest Istook is a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma.\n\nListen online to his daily talk radio show at KZLSam.com, noon to 3 p.m. ET.
