I'd like to be here reporting that equal opportunity is abundant and flowing. I'd like to be able to say that racism is dead and gone forever and ever from American life,\" Morial said at an event to roll out the report. \"But the reality is that we cannot. And the reality is we have this obligation, this duty, this essential role to report the facts and the truth and how it is today even if those facts and that truth are extremely painful.\"\n\nThere were some increases in the equality index in the areas of social justice (from 56 percent to 60.6 percent) and health (78.2 percent to 79.8 percent), the latter of which Morial attributes to the success of the Affordable Care Act. The report also features a new section that compares educational proficiency on a state-by-state basis, but overall, the education index fell from 76.7 percent to 76.1 percent. Civic engagement also decreased from 104.7 percent to 104 percent.\n\nFollow Joyce Jones on Twitter: @BETpolitichick.\n\nBET National News \u2014 Keep up to date with breaking news stories from around the nation, including headlines from the hip hop and entertainment world.
