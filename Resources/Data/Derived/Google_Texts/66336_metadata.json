By now it eats up 25% of the budget. Will it really be 50% two decades hence?\n\nThe words of the late economist Herbert Stein come to mind: \u201cIf something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\u201d\n\nObamacare? It\u2019s a contributing factor to the metastasis, but not a big one. Even after Obamacare is fully in place, the CBO says most of the growth in health care spending will come from Medicare. In a 2009 study, pre-Obamacare, the Mercatus Center furnished the helpful chart below showing not only that Medicare spending is projected to grow\u2026 but the CBO\u2019s projections of future Medicare spending keep growing too.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s latest report offers a few suggestions to tame the monster. \u201cAmong those,\u201d writes J.D. Tuccille at Reason, \u201care taxing, bribing and nagging people into healthier behavior, capping federal Medicaid payments (an approach that would kneecap the current push to expand Medicaid rolls), and paying less to medical providers.\u201d\n\nThose are all distinct possibilities. But our mind keeps coming back to a number we reported in early 2012.\n\nAll that money Uncle Sam spends on health care? One out of every six dollars is spent on the final year of life.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a new number we\u2019ve run across: A quarter of Medicare\u2019s budget is spent on the final year of life. And 10% of Medicare\u2019s spending goes toward the final 30 days.\n\nEnd-of-life health care is one of only two things that genuinely threaten Uncle Sam\u2019s solvency\u2026\n\nEnd-of-life health care is one of only two things that genuinely threaten Uncle Sam\u2019s solvency, according to our friend David Walker, the former U.S. comptroller general. (The home mortgage interest deduction is the other.) \u201cBut we can\u2019t have an honest conversation about it,\u201d he said.\n\nAs we wrote 2\u00bd years ago, all that spending is the result of a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach to forestalling the Grim Reaper\u2019s inevitable appearance. That approach remains standard operating procedure, according to a new study from Stanford surveying nearly 1,100 doctors. It finds medical science has \u201cits default set to maximal interventions for all patients, irrespective of the effectiveness of doing so.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s impossible to have that \u201chonest conversation.\u201d Remember \u201cdeath panels\u201d when Obamacare was being debated in Congress five years ago? That was a clause in the bill \u2014 ultimately dropped \u2014 providing for government-paid counseling to plan for end-of-life care.\n\nRepublicans objected that government would end up deciding who would live and who would die. It was a fair objection. But it also skirted an \u201chonest conversation\u201d confronting this question: Is it fair for doctors to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d\u2026 and push off the costs onto a dead-broke Medicare program, to be paid for by the next generation?\n\nThe Stanford study finds many doctors questioning the \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach\u2026 when it comes to their own care. That\u2019s because doctors, in the words of the research paper, \u201crecurrently witness the tremendous suffering their terminally ill patients experience as they undergo ineffective, high-intensity treatments at the end of life.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to the care of their patients, it\u2019s still full speed ahead. The study says upfront the \u201ccurrent fiscal system rewards hospitals and doctors for medical procedures and providing high-intensity care to terminally ill persons.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the number of Medicare patients who saw 10 or more doctors in the final six months of life grew 12% from 2003-07, the most recent figures available. The number of days those patients spent in intensive care also grew.\n\nWe don\u2019t know when the cost curve will reach the breaking point. But we know it will. When the flow of \u201cfree\u201d money is shut off, maybe doctors will start having an \u201chonest conversation\u201d with patients about treatments that reach \u201ca tipping point where the treatment becomes more burdensome than the illness itself,\u201d as the Stanford study puts it.\n\nIt\u2019s uncomfortable to think about. But we figure it\u2019s better if you hear about it from us now than from a doctor a few years hence when someone you love is approaching his or her final days.\n\nRegards,\n\nAddison Wiggin\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nEd. Note: It\u2019s been six years since we traveled cross-country with David Walker, the nation\u2019s longest-serving top accountant or comptroller general, then president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and protagonist of our I.O.U.S.A documentary we filmed at the time.\n\nWe interviewed financial luminaries such as Alan Greenspan, Warren Buffett, Paul Volcker and Paul O\u2019Neill to help Walker sound the alarm about the truth behind the nexus between Washington and Wall Street.\n\nAt the time, the true national debt combined with unfunded obligations and promises tallied $53 trillion, a number reckless enough to \u201csink our ship of state,\u201d in Walker\u2019s words\u2026unless we the people rose to action. A scant eight weeks after our film of the Fiscal Wake-Up Tour premiered, Lehman Bros. filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, and the Great Recession followed.\n\nThat $53 trillion hole caved in on itself and is now nearly twice as deep. Ultimately, it will be your spending power that erodes. We remember, all too well, the breezy air with which the luminaries in our film assured us the U.S. economy was \u201cdynamic\u201d enough to \u201cgrow\u201d the federal government out of its debt crisis.
