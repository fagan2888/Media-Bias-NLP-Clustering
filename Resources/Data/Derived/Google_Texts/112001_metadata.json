Ron Johnson in 2010, it\u2019s clear that ultra-liberal Russ Feingold hasn\u2019t had an epiphany-driven conversion on slowing growth of government.\n\nDuring his tenure, from 1993 to 2011, Feingold voted to raise taxes nearly 290 times, costing American taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nHe cast votes for two of the bigger tax hikes in U.S. history.\n\nAs a freshman senator in 1993, Feingold voted for the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which raised taxes by $241 billion over five years.\n\nThere\u2019s some argument over just how big the President Bill Clinton-backed tax increase was. Republicans have labeled it the \u201clargest in U.S. history.\u201d It may be, based on raw dollar amount, but it falls down the list a few notches when measured in inflationary terms and against percentage of Gross Domestic Product. FDR\u2019s tax hikes to pay for World War II win that contest.\n\nFeingold at the time argued that he supported the tax hike in large part for its goal of pushing down the national deficit. Indeed, proponents billed Clinton\u2019s first budget as the Deficit Reduction Act. It was supposed to cut federal spending, too. But the proposal included lots of spending on government programs, from education to infrastructure.\n\nThe budget called for boosting the corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 36 percent for corporations with income greater than $10 million, taxes on Social Security benefits for higher income earners and earned income tax credits for earnings under $30,000.\n\nUltimately, the act launched a new 36 percent tax bracket for taxpayers who earned more than $115,000, and 39.6 percent for those who making more than $250,000.\n\nIt narrowly passed the Senate, 50-49.\n\nFeingold cast a vote \u2014 and arguably the deciding vote \u2014 for another massive tax increase: Obamacare. President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care initiative, also known as the Affordable Care Act, will cost taxpayers, conservatively, north of a half-trillion dollars through 2019.\n\nFeingold, who billed himself as a debt fighter, along with his colleagues, lost the battle of the bulge. The U.S. debt exploded over his tenure, climbing nearly $10 trillion \u2014 from $3.66 trillion in 1991 to $13.56 trillion in 2010.\n\nIn fairness, the debt has soared more than $3.5 trillion over the past five years, to $18.15 trillion while Johnson, Feingold\u2019s opponent in the 2016 rematch, has been in office.\n\nWhile Johnson voted for the so-called fiscal cliff compromise, which raised tax rates on the highest income levels, the agreement did make permanent most of the tax cuts under President George W. Bush.\n\nJohnson has called for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget and mandating a two-thirds majority for any tax hike.\n\nAnd the conservative supports imposing a statutory cap limiting the annual increase in federal spending to the sum of the inflation rate plus the percentage of population growth.\n\nDuring their 2010 Senate debate, Feingold blasted Johnson for not having specific plans on debt and deficit reduction. Johnson shot back that Feingold\u2019s so-called 41-point plan to curb federal spending would trim $25 billion per year, a fragment of the $1.4 trillion federal deficit at the time.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nRELATED: Feingold\u2019s legacy is leaving veterans \u2018high and dry,\u2019 says Afghanistan war vet\n\nFeingold has routinely voted for spending increases, helping to fuel the crippling U.S. debt. Exhibit A: his support of the $814 billion stimulus bill.\n\nAmong other proposed budget cuts, Feingold voted against slicing $40 billion in overall federal spending. The measure called for cutting funding for Medicaid, Medicare, agriculture, employee pensions, conservation and student loans.\n\nFeingold\u2019s voting record includes nay votes for spending initiatives but, in the case of his vote against Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for fiscal 2010, he did so because the proposal took funds from his prized American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nIn many cases, he voted against tax cuts, as he did just before leaving office in 2010. He voted against extending tax cuts for those earning less than $250,000 annually.\n\nDuring the opening years of the great recession, Feingold voted with then-Sen. Hillary Clinton 89 percent of the time.\n\nFeingold\u2019s campaign did not return Wisconsin Watchdog\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe Wisconsin GOP this week has focused on an anniversary of sorts, noting it has been 24 years since Feingold began his run for U.S. Senate. While much has changed over the past quarter century, the Republican Party asserts Feingold remains the \u201cconsummate Washington insider.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike many Washington insiders, Senator Feingold would rather raise taxes on hardworking Wisconsin families than make the tough decisions to keep government fiscally responsible,\u201d Pat Garrett, spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said in a statement. \u201cFeingold\u2019s record on taxes hurts working-class families here in Wisconsin \u2014 their money belongs in Wisconsin not Washington DC.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A review of Russ Feingold\u2019s voting record shows a politician who built his U.S. Senate career on raising taxes and growing government.", "title": "What would another Russ Feingold U.S. Senate term look like?
