Mike Pence also expanded healthcare for low-income people using Medicaid money through the Affordable Care Act\u2014though the program is different here in that it requires more personal responsibility and offers different coverage than Medicaid.

On Monday, it paid $61,400 more for another 117 spots on two channels\u2014WTRV and WTTV.\n\n\"We compete for all voters, [including] those that are undecided or who are unaware that Gov. Kasich has pulled up stakes in the state,\u201d a spokeswoman for Trusted Leadership told IBJ when asked about the ad.\n\nHere's the ad:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The move is a little ironic because Indiana also expanded health care for poor Hoosiers using Medicaid money available through Obamacare.", "csrf-token": "adDvDbfD5R5sHnO1DSH4ZKl2p7YNb19VYTsUooGZbV8=", "twitter": {"description": "The move is a little ironic because Indiana also expanded health care for poor Hoosiers using Medicaid money available through Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Amid candidates' cooperation in Indiana, pro-Cruz PAC slams Kasich for Medicaid expansion"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "The move is a little ironic because Indiana also expanded health care for poor Hoosiers using Medicaid money available through Obamacare.", "title": "Amid candidates' cooperation in Indiana, pro-Cruz PAC slams Kasich for Medicaid expansion"}, "keywords": "campaign finance,campaign spending,Ted Cruz,John Kasich,Trusted Leadership PAC,Indiana presidential primary", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A pro-Cruz super PAC called Trusted Leadership on Monday released new ads in Indiana called \u201cKasich BFF,\u201d which bash the Ohio governor by implying that he and President Barack Obama are best buds.\nKasich has pulled up stakes in the state,\u201d a spokeswoman for Trusted Leadership told IBJ when asked about the ad.\nThat deal Kasich suspend campaigning in Indiana, leaving it to Cruz, while Cruz said he will \"clear the path\" for Kasich in New Mexico and Oregon.\nThe ad uses Fox News clips to point out that Kasich expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and says that Kasich \u201cexpanded Obamacare,\u201d which it says is \u201cwrong for Indiana.\u201dIt appears that the \"Kasich BFF\" ad is an attempt to tamp down any existing Kasich support here and send those votes to Cruz.\nA new TV ad circulating in Indiana is here to remind us that Ted Cruz and John Kasich are definitely not BFFs, though they may have teamed up ahead of Indiana\u2019s presidential primary contest in hopes of stopping Donald Trump."}
