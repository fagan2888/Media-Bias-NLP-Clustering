Empowered with the Faith Equality Index, they represent an economic power block significant enough to create big winners in the marketplace,\u201d said Chris Stone, a certified brand strategist and founder of Faith Driven Consumer. \u201cA BUYcott offers our community a positive, proactive way to affect change, and we will absolutely use this opportunity to make progress toward our goal of achieving equality for Faith Driven Consumers.\u201d\n\nAs part of the national #ChristmasBUYcott campaign, the organization is asking participants to do four things:\n\nSTEP 1: PETITION \u2014 Sign the petition asking brands to engage Faith Driven Consumers\n\nSTEP 2: ENGAGE \u2014 Contact \u201cBest in Class\u201d brands in a show of support\n\nSTEP 3: RECRUIT \u2014 Recruit family and friends to do the same\n\nSTEP 4: LEAD \u2014 Gain Faith Driven Consumer Plus Points and compete in leaderboards\n\nTo learn more about the campaign, visit ChristmasBuycott.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Christian-based consumer group hopes to have a major impact on where people spend their money this holiday season.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Christian-based consumer group hopes to have a major impact on where people spend their money this holiday season.", "title": "26 \u2018Faith-Friendly\u2019 Companies to Shop This Christmas", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/walmart-110815.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-09T20:47:57+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QqaH9U"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Christian-based consumer group hopes to have a major impact on where people spend their money this holiday season.", "title": "26 \u2018Faith-Friendly\u2019 Companies to Shop This Christmas", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/walmart-110815.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2015-11-09T16:45:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-09T20:47:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "religious liberty, religious freedom, faith companies, faith based consumer, faith friendly companies, walmart, Chikc-fil-A, Dillards, Hobby Lobby, JetBlue, Pepsi, Wal-Mart."}, "article_summary": "\u201cFaith Driven Consumers are one of the largest minority market segments in the U.S. and have $30 billion to spend this Christmas.\nThe organization behind the campaign, Faith Driven Consumer, coined the effort a Christmas \u201cbuycott\u201d instead of a \u201cboycott,\u201d hoping to positively reward companies that they believe have friendly policies towards people of faith, instead of punishing those that don\u2019t.\nEmpowered with the Faith Equality Index, they represent an economic power block significant enough to create big winners in the marketplace,\u201d said Chris Stone, a certified brand strategist and founder of Faith Driven Consumer.\nA new Christian-based consumer organization that ranks companies based on their friendliness toward people of faith released a Christmas \u201cBest in Class\u201d list, hoping to have a major impact on where people spend their money this holiday season.\nTopping the list are brands like Chick-fil-A, Dillards, Hobby Lobby, JetBlue, Pepsi, and Wal-Mart."}
