Laura Ingraham’s obsession with the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi has become so comically extreme that even the Washington Post’s usually mild-mannered Bob Woodward is winning laughs by mocking her — and on a Fox News panel, no less.

Appearing on Fox News on Sunday morning, Ingraham was asked by host Chris Wallace to respond to President Obama’s recent speech at West Point, in which Obama laid out a foreign policy doctrine of sorts, one that strongly emphasized using military force and unilateral action as a last resort.

While she granted that the president was channeling the war-weary sentiments of many if not most Americans, Ingraham didn’t like the speech, describing it as weird and uninspiring. “I thought it was a very odd speech,” Ingraham said, “and it was not well received, and that didn’t surprise me at all given its tenor and its tone.”

Asked for his take, Woodward noted that Obama shouldn’t focus so much on giving an explanation for his policies, because his problem is not that he hasn’t talked enough.

“There’s so much talk,” Woodward complained before arguing that the goal of foreign policy is to “comfort your friends and scare the hell out of your enemies or your potential enemies,” neither of which was accomplished by Obama’s speech.
