In the ad, Rutledge, then a Republican candidate for attorney general, spoke into the camera and vowed to \u201cstand up to Obama and fight for Arkansas values.\u201d\n\nThe ad also featured a phone number for Rutledge and urged viewers to call her and \u201ctell her to keep fighting Obamacare.\u201d\n\nCampbell alleged that the ad constituted an illegal campaign contribution because its value exceeded the $2,000 limit and that it was made by a political action committee that was prohibited from coordinating activities with candidates.\n\nAfter a closed-door hearing, the commission on Friday decided 4-0 that there was no probable cause to find that Rutledge had violated state campaign finance laws.\n\nA letter explaining the decision will be released in a few days, said Graham Sloan, the commission\u2019s executive director.\n\nRutledge did not attend the hearing but was represented by attorneys Kevin Crass and Rex Terry. Rutledge said in a statement Friday, \u201cI am pleased with today\u2019s decision from the Ethics Commission. From day one, my campaign proactively sought guidance from the commission. This matter can now be put to rest.\u201d\n\nCampbell said he was curious to see what the commission\u2019s letter would contain.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s just, \u2018This wasn\u2019t an improper contribution,\u2019 then there\u2019s a road map for however much money you want to get in outside ads,\u201d he said.\n\nSloan said that in general terms, without specific reference to Rutledge\u2019s case, an Arkansas candidate is not allowed to coordinate activities with an independent expenditure group if express advocacy of the candidate is involved, or the functional equivalent of express advocacy.\n\nCampbell said he believed that although Rutledge did not say \u201cvote for me\u201d in the ad, the ad clearly advocated for her election.\n\n\u201cThere is no point to \u2018Call Leslie Rutledge and tell her to fight Washington\u2019 other than the implied, \u2018Support her campaign to be attorney general,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nRutledge defeated Democrat Nate Steel and Libertarian Aaron Cash in November to with the attorney general\u2019s office. She was sworn in last week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The state Ethics Commission on Friday dismissed a complaint against Attorney General Leslie Rutledge that alleged she violated state campaign finance laws by appearing in an outside group\u2019s ad.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau &#8226; jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The state Ethics Commission on Friday dismissed a complaint against Attorney General Leslie Rutledge that alleged she violated state campaign finance laws by appearing in an outside group\u2019s ad.", "title": "Ethics Complaint Against Arkansas Attorney General Dismissed", "url": "http://swtimes.com/news/state-news/ethics-complaint-against-arkansas-attorney-general-dismissed", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_matt-campbell-1.23.15.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/news/state-news/ethics-complaint-against-arkansas-attorney-general-dismissed", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_matt-campbell-1.23.15.jpg"}, "title": "Ethics Complaint Against Arkansas Attorney General Dismissed", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The state Ethics Commission on Friday dismissed a complaint against Attorney General Leslie Rutledge that alleged she violated state campaign finance laws by appearing in an outside group\u2019s ad.", "creator": "@timesrecord"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1431255", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1431255", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "State News,Politics,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-24T04:07:16-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7ca\"", "article_summary": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The state Ethics Commission on Friday dismissed a complaint against Attorney General Leslie Rutledge that alleged she violated state campaign finance laws by appearing in an outside group\u2019s ad.\n\u201cThere is no point to \u2018Call Leslie Rutledge and tell her to fight Washington\u2019 other than the implied, \u2018Support her campaign to be attorney general,\u2019\u201d he said.\nAttorney and liberal blogger Matt Campbell of Little Rock filed the complaint over Rutledge\u2019s participation last year in a 30-second television ad by the Republican Attorneys General Association.\nAfter a closed-door hearing, the commission on Friday decided 4-0 that there was no probable cause to find that Rutledge had violated state campaign finance laws.\nRutledge defeated Democrat Nate Steel and Libertarian Aaron Cash in November to with the attorney general\u2019s office."}
