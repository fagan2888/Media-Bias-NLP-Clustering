Morneau, 34, also said he\u2019s not thinking about retiring from baseball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my plan all along (to return),\u201d Morneau said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be going through everything if it wasn\u2019t for the purpose of trying getting back on the field. When that is, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m hopeful and that\u2019s my goal.\u201d\n\nMorneau has been hitting off a tee in the batting cage over the last few days.\n\n\u201cI hope I make a little faster progress now,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling better for the most part.\u201d\n\nMorneau has been out of action since sustaining a concussion and a cervical neck sprain in a May 13 game against the Los Angeles Angels.\n\n\u201cThe neck is more the issue than anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I swing \u2014 how violent the torque is on it \u2014 (discomfort) is still there a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies put Morneau on the 60-day disabled list on July 7.\n\nMorneau missed substantial time in 2010 and 2011 after sustaining a concussion when he slid into the knee of Toronto Blue Jays infielder John McDonald during a game on July 7, 2010.\n\nIn 27 games before going on the disabled list this season, Morneau hit .290 with three home runs and nine RBIs. Last year, he was the National League batting champion when he hit .319 for the Rockies. Morneau is in the final year of a two-year, $12.5 million contract.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Justin Morneau still hopeful of returning to Rockies this season", "title": "Justin Morneau still hopeful of returning to Rockies this season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/20/justin-morneau-still-hopeful-of-returning-to-rockies-this-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150720__justin-morneaup1-1.jpg", "height": 485}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150720__justin-morneaup1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-20T17:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T19:28:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 27 games before going on the disabled list this season, Morneau hit .290 with three home runs and nine RBIs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my plan all along (to return),\u201d Morneau said.\nJustin Morneau is making slow progress as he attempts to return from a neck injury and concussion symptoms, but the Rockies\u2019 veteran first baseman said Monday that he still hopes to return this season.\n\u201cWhen I swing \u2014 how violent the torque is on it \u2014 (discomfort) is still there a little bit.\u201dThe Rockies put Morneau on the 60-day disabled list on July 7.\n\u201cI hope I make a little faster progress now,\u201d Morneau said."}
