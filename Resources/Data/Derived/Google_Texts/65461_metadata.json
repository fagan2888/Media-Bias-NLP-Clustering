Any comprehensive tax overhaul proposal also would qualify for dynamic scoring, as would some smaller tax proposals. A plan to pay for a highway bill with revenue from the repatriation of foreign earnings might qualify, depending on how it was structured.\n\nIn contrast to standard scoring, dynamic analysis seeks to estimate how much a proposal would expand the economy or the tax base as a result of changes in labor supply or investment. It also calculates secondary \u201cfeedback effects,\u201d or how those changes in the economy would affect the federal budget. The CBO and tax committee conduct the analysis with the help of several macroeconomic models.\n\nDynamic scoring remains controversial. Many Democrats object to it being incorporated in official scores because of its uncertainty. Republicans argue that macroeconomic analysis is a potentially more accurate way to measure the impact of major tax or spending proposals, which they say may create incentives to work or invest.\n\nVermont Independent Bernard Sanders, the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, criticized the dynamic scoring requirements of the budget resolution during a recent hearing.\n\n\u201cI would like to be clear that several of these new requirements, I believe, are nothing more than a back-handed way to make it easier to cut taxes for those who are benefiting greatly over the past several years, and to make it harder to assist those who have not,\u201d he said.\n\nShifting Resources\n\nEven advocates of dynamic scoring acknowledge it is challenging and difficult to do. But some also say the greater focus on the practice will contribute to more sophisticated and improved analysis.\n\nCBO Director Keith Hall told the Senate Budget Committee his agency already has shifted resources to strengthen its ability to conduct macroeconomic analysis, and is hiring additional analysts for the task.\n\nHall said one of his priorities is to make dynamic scoring more transparent to lawmakers, economists and the public.\n\n\u201cWith respect to something like dynamic scoring, CBO\u2019s already been using dynamic scoring,\u201d Hall said. \u201cYou can sort of see how it\u2019s been implemented. But that\u2019s a big part, to me, of transparency, is making clear how we\u2019re going to do the dynamic scoring, what models we\u2019re going to use, what estimates we\u2019re going to use.\u201d\n\nHall said the agency will \u201coffer ourselves up to criticism and comments if we\u2019re not doing a fair job.\u201d He added that the CBO would produce macroeconomic analysis \u201cin a way that represents sort of the state of economic science\u201d and seek consensus in doing so.\n\nUnder the definition in the budget resolution, the CBO and tax committee are required to produce a dynamic score of any spending or revenue proposal that would have a budgetary effect, such as a change in revenue, spending or the deficit, equal to at least 0.25 percent of projected gross domestic product in a year. If the GDP were, say, $18 trillion, the legislation would have to show, through initial standard scoring, a budgetary effect of $45 billion.\n\nThe agencies also are required, to the extent practicable, to prepare a \u201cqualitative\u201d assessment of the dynamic effects of legislation for the 20-year period following the budget period, which is typically the 10 years covered by the budget resolution.\n\nThe budget resolution offers additional guidance to the agencies, saying the committees intend that discrete provisions within a bill also can qualify for macroeconomic analysis even if the legislation as a whole does not equal or exceed the threshold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "", "title": "For CBO, Dynamic Scoring Is the Battle of Evermore", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/for_cbo_dynamic_scoring_is_the_battle_of_evermore-242118-1.html", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-06-01T17:12:05Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "iProCategory,iProStoryType,iProProductCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSDMID", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-01T17:12:05Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-01T17:12:05Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/for_cbo_dynamic_scoring_is_the_battle_of_evermore-242118-1.html", "description": "", "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "For CBO, Dynamic Scoring Is the Battle of Evermore"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3458\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWith respect to something like dynamic scoring, CBO\u2019s already been using dynamic scoring,\u201d Hall said.\nHall said one of his priorities is to make dynamic scoring more transparent to lawmakers, economists and the public.\nShifting ResourcesEven advocates of dynamic scoring acknowledge it is challenging and difficult to do.\nAny comprehensive tax overhaul proposal also would qualify for dynamic scoring, as would some smaller tax proposals.\nVermont Independent Bernard Sanders, the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, criticized the dynamic scoring requirements of the budget resolution during a recent hearing."}
