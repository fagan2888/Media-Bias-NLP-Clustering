For three fun-filled months in 2012, they were inseparable.\n\nThey visited museums, went for boat rides and long walks and stayed up late talking about their futures.\n\nBy the end of the summer, they realized life was taking them in different directions. But they promised to remain good friends, a pact they kept. They stayed close, just not romantically.\n\n\u201cWe loved each other rather than being in love,\u201d Tafuro said. \u201cWe said we'd always be part of each other's lives.\u201d\n\nToday, keeping that promise is more important than ever for Tafuro.\n\nStreet fell into a coma in January. A week later, she passed into what brain trauma experts call a persistent vegetative state \u2014 a wakened dream world in which enough of the brain is functioning to allow response to certain stimuli while not fully aware of surroundings or in control of the body.\n\nStill, her family says, when Tafuro visits, she seems fully aware he is there.\n\n\u201cHe gets more out of her than even me or her father can,\u201d said Street's mother, Robin Street. \u201cHe asks her to wiggle a finger and she does. Move a leg and she does. He has this influence over her that no one else does. It's amazing.\u201d\n\nNew brain imaging technology shows that some people in a persistent vegetative state do indeed respond better to certain voices than others, said Brent Masel, national medical director of the Brain Injury Association of America and president of the Transitional Learning Center at Galveston, Texas.\n\n\u201cIt's like when you're in a loud crowded room and your kids yell out to you,\u201d Masel said. \u201cSomehow you hear them. Why is your brain attuned to certain voices? That we cannot explain.\u201d\n\nIt's not hard for Street's mother to explain. It's love, she said, even if it's not the romantic type.\n\n\u201cShe sometimes instantly smiles when he enters the room,\u201d Robin Street said. \u201cShe loves her friend for sure.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nStephanie Street was inundated with visiting friends during the first few weeks she was in a coma. But the number waned. Tafuro has never given up on her. He makes the hour drive to the hospital at least twice a week.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to believe someone can be that dedicated to a friend,\u201d her mother said. \u201cIt's hard to believe someone that nice exists.\u201d\n\nTafuro, 37, is among those who refuse to believe that nice guys finish last.\n\nHe had a corner office as a website designer for Sykes Enterprises in his early 20s. He was treated and paid well before he left to form his own Web design business.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to be my own boss and help others,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I can do both.\u201d\n\nTafuro Communications primarily serves nonprofits. American Victory Ship and Toys for Tots are among his clients. And he volunteers time to other organizations.\n\nIn his travels from networking event to networking event, he became displeased with the attitudes of some young entrepreneurs he met. They saw the bottom line as more important than treating employees well.\n\n\u201cIt is an attitude that is groomed in them. I'm not going to change Wall Street right now. But maybe if I get my message out there to the younger generation in as many doses as I can that people are more important than dollars and cents, I can change that thinking.\u201d\n\nHe self-published a book, \u201cCorporate Empathy,\u201d that argues corporate America has lost its way by focusing more on money than people.\n\nHe started a blog that builds on his book by showcasing companies he believes operate unethically.\n\nAnd he created T-shirts and buttons with slogans like \u201cIf corporations are people shouldn't they act like adults?\u201d and \u201cBeing a sociopath is not cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a sound bite nation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I sell 1,000 shirts and 1,000 people read it, that's a lot of people I reached.\u201d\n\nHis merchandise is available at wwwcorporate empathy.com.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\n\u201cHe never stops giving to others,\u201d said Mike Compton, president of American Advertising Federation of Tampa Bay, which Tafuro also led. \u201cI joke that Vinny doesn't actually make a living because he is too busy volunteering. He puts himself last.\u201d\n\nIt's a difficult journey, Tafuro admitted. Sometimes he thinks about giving up trying to save the world and returning to the normal life of working to acquire shiny objects. But whenever he is tempted, he thinks of Street.\n\n\u201cShe believed in what my Corporate Empathy brand was trying to do,\u201d he said.\n\nThey knew each other as kids. She is six years younger than he is. He was friends with her older brother.\n\n\u201cShe was always just the kid sister to me. I never thought we'd become close.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship began in early June 2012, when they attended the same wedding. Tafuro was six months into writing his book. Street was set to attend the University of Pennsylvania to study anthropology. They bonded over excitement about their adventures ahead, as well as common personality traits.\n\n\u201cShe is like Vinny,\u201d said Street's mother Robin. \u201cShe is mellow and hates confrontation. She always wants to help others.\u201d\n\nThey were together almost every day that summer and she pushed him to complete his book.\n\nWhen he had writer's block, she would brainstorm with him. As he finished chapters, she edited them.\n\n\u201cShe inspired me to keep going. And we fell in love. But at the end of the summer she started college.\u201d\n\nStreet returned home after a semester. The bitter cold of Philadelphia and the separation from her family proved too much.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nNeither Street nor Tafuro pushed to renew their romantic relationship.\n\nBut they hung out \u2014 a lot. Their Facebook pages are filled with photos and check-ins together \u2014 the Thai Temple for Sunday brunch, the Tampa Museum of Art on a weekend afternoon, and a friend's apartment to watch \u201cThe Shining.\u201d\n\nThen in January, a somber photo appeared on Tafuro's Facebook page \u2014 prayer candles with a message that Street had fallen into a coma from a brain hemorrhage.\n\nNo one knows what caused it. Her mother said Street simply did not wake up one morning.\n\n\u201cShe is only 31,\u201d Tafuro said. \u201cI thought I lost her.\u201d\n\nThe first weeks were bleak. Street needed help breathing and eating. There was little life to her.\n\nToday, she breathes on her own, swallows juice and reacts to others.\n\nHer mother said Tafuro deserves some of the credit for the improvement. Even when Street is having a bad day and it appears her recovery has taken a step back, she responds to Tafuro in any way he asks.\n\n\u201cI think I bore her,\u201d Tafuro quipped. \u201cSometimes she squeezes my hand harder like she is asking me to shut up.\u201d\n\nIt's a delicate balance, he said, to help his friend without allowing it to consume his life.\n\n\u201cI don't think she'd want me to put my life on hold for her. But I also do not want to leave her behind.\u201d\n\nDespite the improvements, no one knows if Street will ever wake up.\n\nStill, when Tafuro discusses his life 10 years from now, he imagines she will be a part of it.\n\n\u201cShe'll be teaching anthropology in a big city somewhere. And I'll visit her whenever my business takes me there.\u201d\n\nMasel said there is no scientific proof a friend's visitations can help bring a patient out of a vegetative state, but he said it cannot hurt.\n\n\u201cMedicine is all about a bell-shaped curve,\u201d he said. \u201cMiracles can happen.\u201d\n\nTafuro remains upbeat.\n\n\u201cHer personality is still there beneath that coma. She is there. I feel her energy and I know she is trying to come out of it. I have to believe that one day she will be telling me about her day again.\u201d\n\npguzzo@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7606", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 13 Jul 2014 17:22:16 -0400", "Description": "Vinny Tafuro and Stephanie Street were in love once but even though it became a friendship their devotion didn't weaken.
