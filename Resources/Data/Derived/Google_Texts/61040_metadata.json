We\u2019re not allowed to see it! We can\u2019t get the commissioner that we pay to go and testify on the contents of what\u2019s in that proposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSound like the way the government is supposed to run?\u201d Beck demanded. \u201cDoes that sound like net neutrality? Does that sound like these big, evil corporations don\u2019t have anything to do with anything? I mean, it\u2019s being written by the big evil corporations and special interest groups! Your whole point is, we don\u2019t want special interest groups and we don\u2019t want big, evil corporations to have special access! They just wrote it, you nincompoop!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou morons! You useful idiots!\u201d Beck added heatedly, addressing supporters of net neutrality. \u201cThat\u2019s all you are. You\u2019re a useful idiot. Read Joe Stalin you moron.\u201d\n\nBeck said America\u2019s \u201centire educational system\u201d has failed and is \u201cchurning out morons.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like Obamacare \u2014 you won\u2019t root it out now,\u201d Beck said of the proposal, which passed in a straight party-line vote after Beck\u2019s radio program ended. \u201cIt started the ball rolling. So they\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, we need something. We need some sort of regulation.\u2019 And you morons, you morons on the left, do you realize what you\u2019ve just done? The next president that gets in \u2014 you put me into the Oval Office, you want me running your Internet?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truthful answer to that is yes, because I\u2019ll disband all the regulation on it,\u201d Beck continued. \u201cBut the monster that you think I am, you want me running it? \u2026 I\u2019ll make your life a living, stinking hell. That\u2019s the monster you think I am. And I have news for you, that monster is out there on the right. And there\u2019s a monster out there right now on the left that will do the same damn thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t let unelected officials control things,\u201d Beck concluded. \u201cYou don\u2019t let a bureaucracy do this.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
