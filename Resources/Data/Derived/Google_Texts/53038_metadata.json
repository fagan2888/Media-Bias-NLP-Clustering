The New York Fire Department did just that, allowing women who had failed their physical fitness tests to graduate from the academy.\n\nNow a woman who was allowed to become a New York firefighter despite her failing to meet physical standards has injured herself after only ten days on the job.\n\nChoeurlyne Doirin-Holder broke her foot during a routine equipment check and is not out on paid medical leave. Doirin-Holder made headlines last summer, when her classmates publicly criticized her, claiming she was unfit for the job. However, a judge ruled her a \u201cpriority hire\u201d despite her physical limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York Post reports:\n\nA firefighter who was allowed to graduate the Fire Academy despite failing physical tests has already gone out on medical leave \u2014 just 10 days into the job, The Post has learned. Probationary firefighter Choeurlyne Doirin-Holder injured herself Monday while conducting a routine check of equipment at Queens\u2019 Engine 308 in South Richmond Hill. Getting off the truck, Doirin-Holder missed a step and landed on her left foot, suffering a fracture, sources said. It was her second shift after a transfer from Engine 301. In training for a hazmat assignment, officers found her struggling to perform the required tasks. Firefighters called the tripping incident embarrassing \u2014 and alarming. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get hurt in the firehouse checking a rig, what would happen at a fire?\u201d an insider asked.\n\nPC attitudes and rhetoric about equality do not make women physically equal to men. Putting them into positions like this when they do not qualify will only put theirs and other\u2019s safety at risk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A woman who was allowed to become a New York firefighter despite her failing to meet physical standards has injured herself after only ten days on the job.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "A woman who was allowed to become a New York firefighter despite her failing to meet physical standards has injured herself after only ten days on the job.", "title": "Firefighter Who Failed Fitness Tests Injures Herself 10 Days Into Job", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fdny.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-27T09:20:04+00:00", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/firefighter-who-failed-fitness-tests-injures-herself-10-days-into-job/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fdny.jpg", "description": "A woman who was allowed to become a New York firefighter despite her failing to meet physical standards has injured herself after only ten days on the job.", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Firefighter Who Failed Fitness Tests Injures Herself 10 Days Into Job"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "published_time": "2015-11-27T09:18:23+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/keithfarrellpublic", "section": "Free Style", "modified_time": "2015-11-27T09:20:04+00:00", "tag": "physical"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now a woman who was allowed to become a New York firefighter despite her failing to meet physical standards has injured herself after only ten days on the job.\nThe New York Fire Department did just that, allowing women who had failed their physical fitness tests to graduate from the academy.\nThe New York Post reports:A firefighter who was allowed to graduate the Fire Academy despite failing physical tests has already gone out on medical leave \u2014 just 10 days into the job, The Post has learned.\nProbationary firefighter Choeurlyne Doirin-Holder injured herself Monday while conducting a routine check of equipment at Queens\u2019 Engine 308 in South Richmond Hill.\nDoirin-Holder made headlines last summer, when her classmates publicly criticized her, claiming she was unfit for the job."}
