Not having health insurance is crazier. Don\u2019t tap into your beer money to cover those medical bills.\u201d\n\nSome of the other Colorado promos target active, younger consumers as well as mothers \u2014 who may well be single though it is not stated \u2014 who want to make sure they have insurance for their teen, toddler and even unborn children.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, a report from CNBC.com issued Monday says the House Committee on Energy and Commerce consulted tech legend and one-time murder suspect John McAfee on possibly helping to fix the distraught web site HealthCare.gov that has become an embarrassment for Obamacare proponents.\n\nMcAfee, whose company was responsible for the antivirus software that bears his name, took a $100 million buyout from the sale of his company in 2004. He also was a one-time fugitive, suspected at one time of shooting his neighbor in Belize, Greg Faull, but was later deported back to the U.S. without being charged and he denies any involvement in the killing.\n\nStill House Energy staffers emailed McAfee, CNBC says, asking for an \u201cinformal discussion\u201d to go over what might be the troubled with the glitch-ridden web site.\n\nYouTube A still from McAfee\u2019s controversial video\n\n\u201cIt would be an informal discussion: We would take notes but these would not be for attribution, it would mainly guide our oversight and review of the program,\u201d the email from staff counsel Sean Hayes said, according to CNBC.\n\nYou may remember McAfee made a controversial video for YouTube earlier this year alluding to complaints with his former company\u2019s antivirus program. Entitled \u201cHow to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus,\u201d it features a frustrated McAfee cursing over the software he originated but points out he has not been involved with the company for years. The video features McAfee giving up and starting up a bacchanalian ritual with a bevy of women before he pulls out a handgun and shoots his computer.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-10-22T14:58:50-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Obamacare takes a turn for the bizarre in strange ads designed to promote it, and a report that says a House panel asked for help from a one-time fugitive on fixing the troubled HealthCare.gov web site.", "title": "Of \u2018Brosurance\u2019 and ex-fugitives: The bizarre twists of Obamacare", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/22/of-brosurance-and-ex-fugitives-the-bizarre-twists-of-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN597_brosur_MG_20131022124740.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Brosurance,Colorado,John McAfee,Obamacare", "article.headline": "Of \u2018Brosurance\u2019 and ex-fugitives: The bizarre twists of Obamacare", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Brosurance,Colorado,John McAfee,Obamacare", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Obamacare takes a turn for the bizarre in strange ads designed to promote it, and a report that says a House panel asked for help from a one-time fugitive on fixing the troubled HealthCare.gov web site.", "article.published": "2013-10-22T14:58:50-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/22/of-brosurance-and-ex-fugitives-the-bizarre-twists-of-obamacare/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Obamacare takes a turn for the bizarre in strange ads designed to promote it, and a report that says a House panel asked for help from a one-time fugitive on fixing the troubled HealthCare.gov web site.", "title": "Of \u2018Brosurance\u2019 and ex-fugitives: The bizarre twists of Obamacare", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/22/of-brosurance-and-ex-fugitives-the-bizarre-twists-of-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN597_brosur_MG_20131022124740.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1386", "article.updated": "2013-10-22T14:58:50-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd436d\"", "article_summary": "The video features McAfee giving up and starting up a bacchanalian ritual with a bevy of women before he pulls out a handgun and shoots his computer.\nObamacare may be taking a turn for the bizarre, if a couple of recent developments are any indication.\nEntitled \u201cHow to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus,\u201d it features a frustrated McAfee cursing over the software he originated but points out he has not been involved with the company for years.\nYou may remember McAfee made a controversial video for YouTube earlier this year alluding to complaints with his former company\u2019s antivirus program.\nMcAfee, whose company was responsible for the antivirus software that bears his name, took a $100 million buyout from the sale of his company in 2004."}
