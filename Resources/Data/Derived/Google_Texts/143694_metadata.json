The former Arkansas governor withdrew from the race after a dismal showing the caucuses, an event he won in 2008.\n\nHuckabee earned less than 2 percent of the vote Monday night, compared to the 34.4 percent he received eight years ago. Evangelical voters, the core of Huckabee\u2019s support in 2008, simply had too many choices this time around and went mostly for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and the other top finishers, Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).\n\nRelated: How Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Both Won the Iowa Caucuses\n\nHuckabee took to Twitter to announce he was dropping out.\n\nI am officially suspending my campaign. Thank you for all your loyal support. #ImWithHucK \u2014 Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) February 2, 2016\n\nRick Santorum. The former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, who won the 2012 caucuses, earned even fewer votes than Huckabee, coming in at around 1 percent.\n\nSantorum didn\u2019t hide the fact that he was staking his candidacy on winning Iowa, which makes his decision to push ahead to the GOP primary in South Carolina on Feb. 20 all the more unusual. He\u2019s probably hoping lightning will strike as it did for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who upset Romney, the presumptive nominee, in the Palmetto State in 2012.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Big Advantage Ted Cruz Has as Voting Begins\n\nSantorum shouldn\u2019t hold his breath though: He\u2019s at 0.3 percent in South Carolina, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls.\n\nBen Carson. The retired neurosurgeon, who was once leading in some Iowa polls, came in fourth Monday night, garnering just over 9 percent.\n\nBut before the polls closed, a spokesman for Carson\u2019s campaign announced he was going back to his home in Florida to take a break from the campaign trail.\n\n.@RealBenCarson leaving Des Moines later tonight to avoid storm. Not suspending -- getting fresh clothes then back out Wednesday \u2014 Jason Osborne (@Jmrhosborne) February 2, 2016\n\n#iacaucus Skipping NH & SC is the equivalent of suspending. Too bad this information won't get to all caucus goers. https://t.co/lW5Js50EMA \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) February 2, 2016\n\nThe news prompted Rep. Steve King (R-IA), a major Cruz supporter, to declare Carson had dropped out of the race.\n\nCarson looks like he is out. Iowans need to know before they vote. Most will go to Cruz, I hope. https://t.co/lW5Js50EMA \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) February 2, 2016\n\nThe finger-pointing carried into Tuesday, with Carson accusing other campaigns of \u201cdirty tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor months, my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from my opponents who profess to detest the games of the political class, but in reality are masters of it,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cEven tonight, my opponents resorted to political tricks by tweeting, texting and telling precinct captains that I had suspended my campaign \u2013 in some cases asking caucus goers to change their votes.\u201d\n\nThat charge is \u201cjust false,\u201d Rick Tyler, the Cruz campaign\u2019s communications director, said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \"We simply as a campaign repeated what Ben Carson had said in his own words. That\u2019s not a dirty trick.\u201d\n\nBut later the caucus winner issued a statement apologizing to Carson.\n\n\n\n\u201cLast night when our political team saw the CNN post saying Dr. Carson was not carrying on to New Hampshire and South Carolina, our campaign updated the grassroots leaders just as we would with any breaking news story. That\u2019s fair game.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the team should have done is send around the follow-up statement from the Carson campaign clarifying that he was indeed staying in the race when that came out,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cThat was a mistake from our end, and for that I apologize to Dr. Carson.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina.
