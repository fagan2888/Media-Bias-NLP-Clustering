It\u2019s a tiny (half the size of Indiana), Buddhist democracy nestled between India and Tibet. It\u2019s beautiful and as un-Western as it can be. Check out this amazing photo of Tiger\u2019s Nest, a Bhutanese monastery that clings to a side of cliff.\n\nFun facts: The wellbeing of the country is measured not by its GDP but by its GNH: Gross National Happiness. It\u2019s a biodiverse wonderland that is home to the rare Himalayan bear, the very rare golden langur and the exceedingly rare black-necked crane. National law specifies that 60 percent of the country maintain its forest cover. There are no stoplights in its capital, Thimpu. There is no internal air or rail service. If you want to see the country you pay a licensed tour operator a minimum $200 -$250 per person per day. The daily fee provides a guide, a driver, a vehicle, your lodging and meals.\n\nFor more information on traveling to Bhutan, go to the government\u2019s official tourism site.\n\nMolly Mettler (@mollykmettler) is senior vice president of mission at Healthwise Inc., a nonprofit founded in 1975 with a mission to help people make better health decisions.
