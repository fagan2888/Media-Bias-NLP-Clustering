(WEAU) \u2013 It\u2019s been nearly a week since the health exchange opened under the Affordable Care Act, but that doesn\u2019t mean the need for free health clinics simply diminish.\n\nFree clinics have been around since the 1960s and through those years, the clinics have had to adapt and change to the needs of the country much like the Chippewa Valley Free Clinic.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s the presumption that the ACA would provide coverage to millions who have no insurance, the Chippewa Valley Free Clinic is still working to fill the gaps that will likely remain, even with Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe know there will be some changes in the free clinic but we'll not be going away,\u201d said executive director of CVFC Maribeth Woodford.\n\nThe CVFC serves around 800 people who are uninsured each year. Woodford said one of the goals is to keep people with basic health care needs out of emergency rooms and hospitals.\n\nShe said the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t affordable for everyone and not everyone qualifies for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe still think there are going to be people stuck in the cracks,\u201d said Woodford. \u201cSo there will still be things like dental care, mental health, those that fall through the cracks of both the Medicaid program that we have and the subsidies in the federal health care act.\u201d\n\nThe Chippewa Valley Free Clinic is a Certified Application Counselor organization and will soon have three counselors available to help patients apply for health care on the exchange.\n\nDr. Ken Adler, the founder of CVFC, is training to be a certified application counselor. He\u2019s already been through more than 20 hours of reading and training and will go through federal testing soon. After that, Adler will be able to help individuals and families at the free clinic apply for insurance in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cIf our patients aren't able to afford the Affordable Care Act insurance or they're not eligible for Medicaid and things aren\u2019t working out for them, the free clinic will still be open. We're planning on being here until the need for our service no longer exists,\u201d said Adler.\n\nThere are also those who aren't eligible for government programs, like undocumented citizens. Woodford said medication costs can still be extremely high for patients with complex needs.\n\nBut still, health care workers say the ACA will likely help many uninsured patients.\n\n\u201cThe vast, vast majority of our patients make less than 185 percent of the federal poverty level and that\u2019s important because the affordable care act will give assistance to people with up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level,\u201d said Adler.\n\nAdler said his hope is that every patient that comes to the free clinic would at least try getting into the federal marketplace because a large percentage of patients will be eligible for care outside of the free clinic.\n\n\u201cSome will find that they will get a federal exemption so they will not need to get the insurance. If you choose not receive the insurance, in general, you'd have to pay a fine to the federal government come income tax time so that would be motivator for you to think long and hard before you decide,\u201d said Adler.\n\nWoodford said free clinics like CVFC serve the purpose of meeting unmet needs of the community and will continue to operate business as usual as people approach the clinic for questions on applying for insurance or continue to receive care through the free clinic.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if we could legislate away poverty and it'd be nice if free clinics went away but as long as there's a need, we are the safety net clinic in the community,\u201d said Woodford.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "It\u2019s been nearly a week since the health exchange opened under the Affordable Care Act, but that doesn\u2019t mean the need for free health clinics simply diminish.", "language": "english", "author": "Jenny You", "og": {"description": "It\u2019s been nearly a week since the health exchange opened under the Affordable Care Act, but that doesn\u2019t mean the need for free health clinics simply diminish.", "title": "Free clinics fill gaps of Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Free-clinics-fill-gaps-of-Affordable-Care-Act-226818081.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/D48/BC3/D48BC35AF961405E8F9597839783EA8B", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/058/D6B/058D6B90844E4806AC2C4EBF141D6E1C.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.weau.com", "description": "It\u2019s been nearly a week since the health exchange opened under the Affordable Care Act, but that doesn\u2019t mean the need for free health clinics simply diminish.", "creator": "@weau13news", "url": "http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Free-clinics-fill-gaps-of-Affordable-Care-Act-226818081.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/cvfc.jpg", "title": "Free clinics fill gaps of Affordable Care Act", "site": "@weau13news", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Free clinics fill gaps of Affordable Care Act", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "XOlDnT88nYfAApmBC8lwbpWN4wAY0URAWE7v44TsGWU", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Free clinics fill gaps of"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf011\"", "article_summary": "She said the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t affordable for everyone and not everyone qualifies for Medicaid.\nPhone: 715-839-8477EAU CLAIRE, Wis.
