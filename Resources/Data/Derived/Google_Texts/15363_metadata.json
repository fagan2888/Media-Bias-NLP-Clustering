We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go to http://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered ,Because w/o it, youre naked.\u201d\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, Dobrev isn\u2019t the only celebrity standing behind the president\u2019s healthcare law (although she is the only one who posed topless to show her support). Rosario Dawson, Connie Britton, Kerry Washington and Kate Bosworth also showed their support for Obamacare with their own homemade signs. Us Weekly notes that the actress\u2019 picture has helped the #getcovered campaign gain nearly 94,000 likes.\n\nPerhaps it was seeing Dobrev topless that encouraged people to visit the Health Insurance Marketplace or maybe it was a real concern about finding a decent medical care plan, either way traffic surges and glitches marked the debut of the federal website HealthCare.gov (the website is running even though the federal government isn\u2019t).\n\nDobrev isn\u2019t the first celebrity to stand behind President Obama in an unusual way. Actor Samuel L. Jackson showed his support for 44 in a campaign video entitled \u201cWake the F**k Up.\u201d The video was a parody of the children\u2019s book \u201cGo the F**k To Sleep.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of Dobrev\u2019s stance on Obamacare?
