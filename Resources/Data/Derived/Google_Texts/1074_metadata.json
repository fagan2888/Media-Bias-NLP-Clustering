It is modeled after SEO Scholars program which prepares low-income, public high school students for admission to college and then follows them through graduation.\n\nSEO reports a 95 percent success rate for students who graduate from college within six years.\n\nThe goal for this new effort is to empower students through academic, social and emotional support. UBS NextGen Leaders also will sponsor special summer events and international trips to provide students with a world view.\n\nA recent McKinsey study found that the annual Gross Domestic Product can increase as much as $525 billion when that gap is narrowed. A report from the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project also found that someone with an associate\u2019s degree earns about $170,000 more than a high school graduate, over a lifetime. Those with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn $570,000 more.\n\nChildren at the lowest rung of poverty who earn a college degree have an 84 percent chance of bettering themselves.\n\nUBS has a long tradition of supporting education and small businesses through Elevating Entrepreneurs. The program provides mentoring and networking opportunities as well as loans to small business owners in all of the Americas so they can grow their companies and create jobs.\n\nFor instance, the UBS Bank Community Development Group and California-based nonprofit VEDC have pledged $35 million to qualified small businesses in cities and states across the country including Chicago, New York and Salt Lake City. Since 2012 about $9.1 million has been awarded to more than 45 small businesses through loans ranging from $50,000 to $500,000. The funds helped create or retain more than 1,200 jobs.\n\nA new partnership with Venture for America focuses on recruiting top college graduates to work for two years at start-up businesses in cities with potential for redevelopment. Another UBS partner, American Corporate Partners, works with UBS to aid veterans transitioning from military service to private sector of small businesses.\n\nGet Free Updates!
