ASIC launched its case against the directors on August 21, 2012.\n\nOn Monday Judge John Middleton, who is hearing the matter with Judge Andrew Greenwood and Judge Lindsay Foster questioned the basis for the claim that the decision to pay Mr Lewski was made at the July 19 meeting.\n\nJudge Middleton said the \"Blind Freddy\" test could also be applied to the meeting on August 22 because they \"had a chance to stop it [the approval of the payment to Mr Lewski].\"\n\nJudge Foster noted that there was no evidence in the original case about what exactly had been discussed at the August 22 meeting, just that a vote had taken place, adding: \"Nobody could remember anything \u2013 extraordinary.\"\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission is also appealing the penalties handed out to the directors \u2013 in the case of Mr Lewski, a 15-year ban and $230,000 fine, and in the case of Dr Wooldridge, a two-year, three-month ban and a $20,000 fine \u2013 asking the court to increase the disqualification orders against both men.\n\nMr Butler, Mr Jaques and Mr Clarke are also appealing the Federal Court decision that they breached the Corporations Act in granting the payment to Mr Lewski.\n\nMr Bulter and Mr Jacques were banned from acting as a company director for four years and fined $20,000 each.\n\nMr Clarke was not banned as a company director, but was slapped with a $20,000 fine is appealing the findings of contravention against him.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Clarke's lawyers told Judge Middleton, Judge Andrew Greenwood and Judge Graeme Foster the court had erred in finding that Mr Clarke's decision to not vote on the decision to award the payment to Mr Lewski was akin to an approval.\n\n\"He wasn't well prepared for the meeting and didn't feel comfortable voting,\" Daryl Williams, QC, for Mr Clarke said.\n\nThe $560m trust collapsed in 2010, affecting about 8000 investors.\n\nMr Lewski and his fellow directors face further legal action over the board granting Mr Lewski management rights for the trust's aged care homes for nothing. Mr Lewski later sold the rights to Babcock & Brown for $60m.\n\nASIC will deliver its submissions on Tuesday.
