The attorneys general plan a public announcement in the afternoon.\n\nIt's unclear what the announcement will be.\n\nMcCarthy is expected to face tough questions regarding what the agency did or did not do and what it plans to do long term.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gov. John Hickenlooper met with Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials to look at fish cages in which young trout were put in before the sludge came through.
