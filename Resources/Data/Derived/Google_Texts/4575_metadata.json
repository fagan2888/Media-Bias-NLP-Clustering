The research, published by the U.S.-based Public Library of Science, compares the lives of 55,000 Polish Jews who emigrated to Israel before and after the war. What it discovers is that men who lived through the Holocaust as boys or young men lived as much as 18 months longer than those who didn't -- an astonishing finding that co-author Avi Sagi-Schwartz says could be attributed to a phenomenon known as \"post-traumatic growth.\" \"When we talk about post-traumatic growth, it refers to a positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances -- things like life-threatening illness, war, abuse, domestic violence, immigration, or the death of loved ones,\" Sagi-Schwartz says.\n\nGenetic research has shown that exposure to profound trauma at an early age can in fact lead to a shorter life span, by permanently damaging chromosomes meant to fight off cancer and other illnesses. But Sagi-Schwartz , a psychology professor at the University of Haifa and a research fellow at the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., says it's also possible that extreme hardship may infuse survivors with a vitalizing appreciation of life and personal strength that counterbalances earlier damage. The authors of the study have struggled, however, to explain why the same phenomenon has not been witnessed in female Holocaust survivors, who lived as long as their non-Holocaust peers but no longer. Sagi-Schwartz says the discrepancy may be partly due to a natural lifespan \"ceiling.\" Israeli women already live, on average, an extremely robust 84 years, a standard that may be hard to improve upon. But he also notes that women, as a group, are more vulnerable to mental disorders, like depression, that may override any emotional gains they might experience as Holocaust survivors. \"We know that the symptom of depression shortens life expectancy. Post-traumatic growth might work to lengthen life expectancy, but depression works the other way around,\" Sagi-Schwartz says. \"And we know that there is a higher rate of depression among females. So females might be less open to post-traumatic growth because they're more liable to [experience] problems associated with depression.\" The study's authors have also suggested a second, more controversial, explanation for why male and female Holocaust survivors did not both experience longer lifespans, a theory known as \"differential mortality.\" Differential mortality is based on the notion of survival of the fittest: that those who survived the Holocaust were already the strongest and healthiest members of their group. Male concentration-camp prisoners were valued for their physical strength, and sometimes spared extermination in order to be used as labor. With men, therefore, the study's authors say, it's possible to make the case for differential mortality and say the strongest survived.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study shows that what doesn&#39;t kill you sometimes literally makes you stronger.", "author": "Daisy Sindelar", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new study shows that what doesn&#39;t kill you sometimes literally makes you stronger.", "title": "Male Holocaust Survivors Lived Longer Than Those Who Escaped Europe", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/retrieveasset/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/male-holocaust-survivors-lived-longer-than-those-who-escaped-europe/279462/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "A surprising new study looking at World War II appears to draw the same conclusion, saying male survivors of the Jewish Holocaust lived longer than peers of the same age who escaped Europe before the war.\nThe study's authors have also suggested a second, more controversial, explanation for why male and female Holocaust survivors did not both experience longer lifespans, a theory known as \"differential mortality.\"\nThe authors of the study have struggled, however, to explain why the same phenomenon has not been witnessed in female Holocaust survivors, who lived as long as their non-Holocaust peers but no longer.\nSo females might be less open to post-traumatic growth because they're more liable to [experience] problems associated with depression.\"\nBut he also notes that women, as a group, are more vulnerable to mental disorders, like depression, that may override any emotional gains they might experience as Holocaust survivors."}
