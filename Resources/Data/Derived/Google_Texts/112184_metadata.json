Koerber is the new executive director of the Gateway Family YMCA Rahway Branch, managing day-to-day operations at the newly renovated facility.\n\n\u201cAlong with extensive experience, Rodger brings strong leadership and vision to the association,\u201d said Melynda A. Mileski, the EVP/COO of Gateway Family YMCA.\n\nKroeber has a bachelor\u2019s degree in science and a sports management concentration from Slippery Rock University in Western Pennsylvania, and has past experience managing YMCAs, including his most recent position as CEO of the Ocean County YMCA, and positions in the YMCAs of Western Monmouth County and Altavista in Virginia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunity,\u201d Koerber said.\n\nKoerber said that he sees \u201ctremendous growth opportunities here\u201d and that he hopes to branch out to other locations within the city.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see how far through the community we can reach,\u201d he added.\n\nThe new executive director said he wants to \u201cstep out of the boundaries of the Y,\u201d and use his organization\u2019s expertise to help other venues within the town, including churches, firehouses and community centers.\n\nIn addition to trying to transform the community outside the walls, the Rahway Branch has also finished its own transformation.\n\nThe recently completed $3.4 million, 16,938 square foot renovation has brought the arts to the branch with the addition of five studio lofts on the top floor which, along with the two floors below it, had not been in use since being destroyed in a fire in 1981.\n\n\u201cThis branch is beautiful,\u201d said Koerber of the renovations.\n\nThe renovations also include the restoration of two old locker rooms as well as the addition of two new family/wheelchair-accessible locker rooms, a wheelchair-accessible entrance, wheelchair-accessible lift for the pool and four new multi-purpose rooms to be used for YMCA programs and classes, community events and for rental space for various other community activities such as birthday parties or church groups. One of the multi-purpose rooms currently being used for an art class.\n\nThe facility is one of a few YMCAs to offer art programs. The branch\u2019s position in the Art District of Rahway adds weight to the additions made by the renovations.\n\nThe final stroke on the canvas for the Rahway Branch is the hiring of the branch\u2019s first Arts Director, Lara Kennedy, in January of this year. Koerber said that Kennedy is creating a new program for the arts.\n\nAlthough usual YMCA Arts programs such as dance, messy arts and arts and crafts have been offered at the Rahway facility in the past, these new programs will offer members a higher level of programming.\n\n\u201cThe YMCA has made a full commitment to integrating the arts into our traditional wellness programming,\u201d said John Ludington, the Gateway Family YMCA board president in a prepared statement. \u201cThis renovation allows us to initiate a specialized arts program for youth and adults.\u201d\n\nKoerber said that he hopes the branch will have an impact on the community through the new arts program, a feature which he says makes the Rahway Branch unique among the YMCAs he has managed in the past.\n\n\u201cI see us growing in the number of people we serve,\u201d he said.\n\nThe grand opening of the Rahway Branch is scheduled for June 8, and it will host an open house for the public from June 8 to 14.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1bSQtV8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Gateway Family YMCA named Rodger D.
