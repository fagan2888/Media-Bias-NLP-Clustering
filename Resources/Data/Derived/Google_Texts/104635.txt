A poll taken last month by The Washington Post and NBC found that 33 percent of Bernie Sanders supporters cannot see themselves voting for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election. Although Sanders has stated he would endorse Clinton as the nominee, many of his supporters see Clinton as part of the plutocracy they’re fighting against. But shouldn’t Sanders voters back Clinton’s incremental progress when the GOP’s message of intolerance threatens to take America back generations? Actor, LGBT-rights activist and Star Trek-star George Takei thinks so.

“I’m a Democrat, and as many of you have seen, I’m also a fan of Bernie Sanders,” Takei said in a video posted on his wildly-popular Facebook page. “Having been through many bruising primaries in my life, I’m also a realist. From where I sit, the math is clear, Hillary will likely win and she will be our nominee, but that doesn’t mean Bernie didn’t also win.” Takei then praised Sanders for bringing important issues to the campaign and his supporters for thier passion.

Although Sanders’ views are to the left of Clinton’s, Takei pointed out there are many issues the two agree upon, including: Obamacare, raising the minimum wage, protecting a woman’s right to choose, making college affordable and LGBT rights. “On her worst day, Hillary Clinton will be an infinitely better candidate and president than the Republican candidate on his best day,” Takei said, quoting Sanders. “If Bernie believes that, his supporters can, too.”
