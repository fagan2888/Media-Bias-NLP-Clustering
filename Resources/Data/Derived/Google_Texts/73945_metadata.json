But there lurk mosquitoes, an all-too-familiar menace. What\u2019s more, a wave of mosquito-borne tropical disease that first appeared in the Western Hemisphere in late 2013 has now spread across the Caribbean, stoking concerns about a debut in the continental U.S. The painful virus is already plaguing U.S tourists who have contracted it overseas, but it has not yet been transmitted by mosquitoes buzzing around the mainland. Last week, however, the first three cases were confirmed in Puerto Rico, expanding the disease\u2019s reach.\n\nChikungunya (pronounced chik-un-GUNH-ya) first emerged last year on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. As I reported in February, just a few months after the disease was first detected the number of cases had already climbed to more than 1,000 and had hop-scotched across several of the Caribbean islands. Since then, the disease has crept even closer to the continental U.S. with one confirmed case in the U.S. Virgin Islands and 14 cases in Haiti. There are now 4,576 confirmed cases of the disease in the Western Hemisphere, according to the Pan American Health Organization, and more than 165,000 suspected cases.\n\nThe disease is known for causing patients to stoop over from joint and muscle pain that typically lasts for weeks, but can persist for months or years. It can also cause high fever and headaches. The three cases in Puerto Rico were locally acquired and all occurred among patients who had no history of travel, says Brenda Rivera-Garcia, state epidemiologist for the Puerto Rico Department of Health. The first Puerto Rican patient started having symptoms in mid-May, she says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chikungunya, which can cause muscle pains for months and even years, has already spread across the Caribbean  VIDEO", "author": "Dina Fine Maron", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Chikungunya, which can cause muscle pains for months and even years, has already spread across the Caribbean  VIDEO", "title": "Nasty mosquito-borne virus could be headed for US", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/19/nasty_mosquito_borne_virus_could_be_headed_for_us_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_186391907.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chikungunya, which can cause muscle pains for months and even years, has already spread across the Caribbean  VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_186391907.jpg", "title": "Nasty mosquito-borne virus could be headed for US", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Nasty mosquito-borne virus could be headed for US", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Caribbean, Chikungunya, Mosquitos, Scientific American, Video, virus", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf460\"", "article_summary": "Last week, however, the first three cases were confirmed in Puerto Rico, expanding the disease\u2019s reach.\nThe three cases in Puerto Rico were locally acquired and all occurred among patients who had no history of travel, says Brenda Rivera-Garcia, state epidemiologist for the Puerto Rico Department of Health.\nThere are now 4,576 confirmed cases of the disease in the Western Hemisphere, according to the Pan American Health Organization, and more than 165,000 suspected cases.\nTopics: Caribbean, Chikungunya, Mosquitos, Scientific American, Video, virus, Life NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanIt\u2019s summertime so when the weather is fine many of us head outdoors.\nThe painful virus is already plaguing U.S tourists who have contracted it overseas, but it has not yet been transmitted by mosquitoes buzzing around the mainland."}
