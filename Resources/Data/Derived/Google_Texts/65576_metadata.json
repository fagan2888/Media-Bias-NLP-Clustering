A source who checked her laptop said the hacker used spyware \u201cproprietary to a government agency,\u201d according to a Monday article in the New York Post.\n\n\u201cThis is outrageous. Worse than anything Nixon ever did. I wouldn\u2019t have believed something like this could happen in the United States of America,\u201d said the source, according to Ms. Attkisson\u2019s account in the New York Post.\n\nIn an Oct. 3 video preview of the book, Ms. Attkisson describes how her computer suddenly went haywire as she was working at home on a Benghazi story.\n\n\u201cAs I was typing and working on questions for a Benghazi-related story, the data started wiping kind of at hyperspeed, being deleted, as if my computer had been hijacked and I had no control over it,\u201d Ms. Attkisson says in the video.\n\n\u201cI knew because I had had so many anomalies over the past year and a half, two years, that someone was interfering with the computer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was described to me by the computer experts I consulted with afterward that that was purely an attempt to let me know that they could do that and they were watching and that they were in my computer.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ms. Attkisson calls herself a political agnostic who was equally tough on the Bush administration, she said her dogged reporting on stories such as the Benghazi assault, the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal, Solyndra and Obamacare made her a persona non grata with her liberal CBS bosses.\n\n\u201cMany in the media are wrestling with their own souls: They know that ObamaCare is in serious trouble, but they\u2019re conflicted about reporting that,\u201d Ms. Attkisson says in the Post account. \u201cSome worry that the news coverage will hurt a cause that they personally believe in. They\u2019re all too eager to dismiss damaging documentary evidence while embracing, sometimes unquestioningly, the Obama administration\u2019s ever-evolving and unproven explanations.\u201d\n\nAs the November 2012 election approached, her hard-hitting stories about Benghazi wound up on the network\u2019s website instead of on the air. So did a story about a Korean green-energy firm receiving U.S. subsidies.\n\nAt one point, the network lost interest in Ms. Attkisson\u2019s Fast and Furious stories. A producer told her, \u201cYou\u2019ve reported everything. There\u2019s really nothing left to say.\u201d\n\nShe ran afoul of a network executive when she appeared on conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio show, who told her Ms. Ingraham was \u201cextremely, extremely far right.\u201d One of her higher-ups insisted on identifying conservative analysts as \u201cconservative,\u201d but liberal analysts were just \u201canalysts.\u201d\n\nCBS officials have not commented publicly on the book, and a New York Post reporter wrote in a Monday article that he was unable to reach executives for their reaction.\n\nMs. Attkisson said the network\u2019s kid-gloves treatment also applied to its sponsors. She quotes an executive warning not to do anything to upset \u201ccorporate partners\u201d until the stock split in 2006, according to the Post account.\n\nShe won five Emmys in her nearly 20 years at CBS, but Ms. Attkisson recently has been attacked by left-wing groups. A senior researcher at Media Matters in June described Ms. Attkisson\u2019s reporting as \u201cshoddy,\u201d and Salon\u2019s Simon Maloy mocked her \u201cborderline obsessive focus on Benghazi.\u201d\n\nIn her video, Ms. Attkisson says the public \u201cneeds to learn to watch the news much as you do a TV commercial. You need to start thinking, \u2018Why is that story airing? Who pushed it?\u2019 What special interest might be behind it? And am I getting the full story?\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a tougher clampdown on freedom of the press, and I think it\u2019s important that someone stand and say these things and speak out about them,\u201d she said.\n\nShe concludes, \u201cI think in general I\u2019m just one of the reporters top on a list of those they watch and they disagree with and they fight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Those who suspect the worst about the Obama administration and the media won't have their beliefs contradicted by former CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson's explosive new book, \"Stonewalled: My Fight for Truth Against the Forces of Obstruction, Intimidation and Harassment in Obama's Washington.\"", "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Those who suspect the worst about the Obama administration and the media won\u2019t have their beliefs contradicted by former CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson\u2019s explosive new book, \u201cStonewalled: My Fight for Truth Against the Forces of Obstruction, Intimidation and Harassment in Obama\u2019s Washington.\u201d", "title": "Reporter Sharyl Attkisson says feds hacked computer, CBS protected Obama", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/28/reporter-sharyl-attkisson-says-feds-hacked-compute/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/10/ap718773263354.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/10/ap718773263354.jpg", "title": "Reporter Sharyl Attkisson says feds hacked computer, CBS protected Oba", "description": "Those who suspect the worst about the Obama administration and the media won't have their beliefs contradicted by former CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson's explosive new book, \"Stonewalled: My Fight", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Sharyl Attkisson, New York Post, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbc2\"", "article_summary": "She won five Emmys in her nearly 20 years at CBS, but Ms. Attkisson recently has been attacked by left-wing groups.\nThe most incendiary charge: that Ms. Attkisson\u2019s personal computer and CBS laptop were hacked after she began filing stories about Benghazi that were unflattering to the Obama administration.\nA source who checked her laptop said the hacker used spyware \u201cproprietary to a government agency,\u201d according to a Monday article in the New York Post.\nMs. Attkisson said the network\u2019s kid-gloves treatment also applied to its sponsors.\nAt one point, the network lost interest in Ms. Attkisson\u2019s Fast and Furious stories."}
