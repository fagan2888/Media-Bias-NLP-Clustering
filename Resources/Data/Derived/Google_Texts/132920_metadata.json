Bill Loving, professor and editor of CalCoastNews, is suing to get records about the university\u2019s preparation in the event of an outbreak of an infectious disease on campus.\n\nLoving named Cal Poly President Jeffrey Armstrong and the university as defendants. He is asking for an order of the court to force the release of the records.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering the first part of the flu season. That makes information about how the Cal Poly health center is prepared a matter of public interest,\u201d Loving said. \u201cStudents have come to me to complain about long waits to be seen by a doctor for minor problems. How then, is the health center going to cope with dozens or hundreds of students who might get sick?\u201d\n\nThe library of medicine at the National Institutes of Health has a number of stories about the impact of infectious diseases on campus, Loving wrote in his complaint. Some of the articles referred to the H1N1 influenza of 2009 which swept across many college campuses. Health officials note that meningitis, colds, strep and mononucleosis crop up on college campuses.\n\nThe lawsuit began after reporters in one of Loving\u2019s classes began to work on a project about illness, hygiene and preparedness. Reporters sought information from health centers, nursing schools, hospitals and experts on infection. They also requested records citing the California Public Records Act. Each request includes Loving\u2019s name. That lets him take action as soon as a government agencies refuses to release records, he said.\n\nThe head of the Health & Counseling Center on campus refused to provide the records of its infection plans even though state law requires that they be open, Loving\u2019s lawsuit says.\n\nThe center Medical Director Karen Hord-Sandquist said in an email that the center was not able to provide the materials.\n\n\u201cWe are understaffed and have multiple requests for information and interviews from many students and departments. We are unable to provide this service as it impairs our ability to do our work caring for the students we see in this clinic,\u201d Hord-Sandquist wrote.\n\nThe fact that the clinic already is understaffed strongly suggests that it would not be able to deal with an infection on campus, Loving said.\n\n\u201cThe complaints from students about wait times and the clinic\u2019s admission that it is understaffed raises reasonable questions about how prepared Cal Poly is,\u201d Loving said. \u201cStudents, their parents and the public ought to know how the health center will react.\u201d\n\nPeople ought to be able to see what the plans are, Loving said. The clinic should not be concerned about people seeing what it has planned, they might agree or make suggestions. The alternative is to blindly trust what government says.\n\n\u201cBureaucrats have long counseled people to \u2018be patient\u2019 and \u2018trust us\u2019 and in too many instances, that trust has been misplaced as contingency plans have failed,\u201d Loving said. \u201cWhen those failures take place, it is the people who suffer.\u201d\n\nThe attempt to control information is troubling, Loving said, noting in his suit that the health center recently imposed a new policy that places controls on interviews. The health center will consider interviews after reporters send them the list of questions to be asked.\n\nMost troubling is an agreement that the health center asks reporters to sign, Loving said in his lawsuit.\n\nThe interview request form would give \u201can agent\u201d of the health center the power to \u201creview and edit the final product prior to publishing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even the president of the United States has the power or the audacity to do something like that,\u201d Loving said. \u201cThe center won\u2019t give up records under state law and they want to control what reporters write. It is troubling\u201d\n\nAlthough Loving named Armstrong as the first defendant, he says he does not believe Armstrong is opposed to transparency.\n\n\u201cWhat I know of President Armstrong tells me that he wants Cal Poly to be accountable and open,\u201d Loving said. \u201cBut he is president of a university and people below him may not share his attitude.\u201d\n\nLoving acknowledged that some people would wonder about a professor suing his university and president. He is not willing to let government agencies and bureaucrats dictate what people can know, he said.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m willing to sue my boss, my employer, then the bureaucrats ought to ask themselves how much slack I\u2019m going to cut them when they don\u2019t obey the law,\u201d Loving said. \u201cOpen records applies to everyone or it applies to no one. Government is the people\u2019s business and, generally, people have the right to see what government does.\u201d\n\nLike CalCoastNews on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By KAREN VELIE A California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo journalism professor has filed an open records suit against the university.
