And by the 39 other men who signed the Constitution in 1787.\n\nThe problem, of course, is the government shutdown. It was caused because the Framers of the Constitution wisely provided for separation of powers among the three branches of government. The president would faithfully execute the laws and be commander-in-chief of the military, but both houses of Congress would have to approve every penny the government could spend.\n\nIn the early republic, it was widely assumed that presidents could veto legislation only if it was deemed unconstitutional. Disagreeing with policy was not enough. That changed after Andrew Jackson vetoed the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States in 1832 and was promptly reelected. Jackson claimed to act on constitutional grounds, but it came to be understood that presidents could veto laws they disagreed with. That understanding, together with the constitutional structure, imposes something like a duty of consultation between the president and members of Congress. Otherwise \u2014 and you may have heard about this \u2014 the government would have to shut down.\n\nBarack Obama hasn\u2019t engaged in much consultation this summer and fall. He has announced he won\u2019t negotiate with House speaker John Boehner. His defenders note that Boehner has stated publicly he won\u2019t negotiate with the president. Boehner believes Obama unfairly upped the ante in their \u201cgrand bargain\u201d negotiations in August 2011. As a practical matter, it\u2019s Obama\u2019s refusal to negotiate that matters. A member of Congress can\u2019t get time with the president or his top aides on demand. A president can always get through to a member of Congress \u2014 as Obama did, finally, Monday night for a conversation described as being \u201cless than ten minutes.\u201d\n\nAstonishingly, Obama said in a prepared statement that no president had negotiated ancillary issues with Congress when a shutdown was threatened. Four Pinocchios, said Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler. The Post\u2019s Wonkblog helpfully listed 17 government shutdowns since the late 1970s. Almost all involved legislative-executive disagreement over ancillary issues.\n\nThe bulk of pundit opinion, on the right as well as the left, holds that House Republicans blundered by attaching Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s defund-Obamacare amendment to the continuing resolution funding the government. Democrats will never accept that, they say. And voters will blame Republicans for shutting down government.\n\nMany pundits also say House Republicans\u2019 amendment delaying Obamacare was foolish for the same reason, although \u201cdelay\u201d polls much better than \u201cdefund.\u201d Cruz argues that once people receive Obamacare subsidies, they will be hooked and support the program. It\u2019s an argument akin to Mitt Romney\u2019s 47 percent remarks. But beneficiaries of government don\u2019t necessarily vote Democratic. The state with the highest percentage of residents who receive disability insurance, West Virginia, voted 62 percent for Romney.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s not clear that Obamacare subsidies will be that generous or visible. On Tuesday, the day the health exchanges were supposed to open, many Obamacare websites were giving error messages.\n\nDivided government is not exactly a novel thing. We\u2019ve had a White House controlled by one party and at least one house of Congress held by the other for 32 of the last 45 years \u2014 70 percent of the time. It\u2019s the default mode, not an exception. The current divisions result from what I call volitional migration in my just-published book, Shaping Our Nation: How Surges of Migration Have Transformed America and Its Politics. Americans have been moving to places they consider culturally congenial.\n\nDemocratic voters \u2014 blacks, Hispanics, gentry liberals \u2014 are heavily clustered in certain central cities. They give Democrats an advantage in the Electoral College. Republican voters are more evenly spread around beyond these Democratic bastions. That gives Republicans an advantage in the House of Representatives. So both sides have a legitimate mandate \u2014 but not an unlimited one.\n\nRepublicans are furious that their members can\u2019t defund or delay Obamacare. They want to see politicians stand up yelling, \u201cNo!\u201d Theater has a function in politics. But in fact, they\u2019ve had a partial victory this year, a win that didn\u2019t seem likely last December. By accepting the sequester despite its defense cuts, Republicans have actually dialed down domestic discretionary spending. Democrats\u2019 position now is essentially to maintain the sequester. They\u2019re swallowing something they hate. No wonder Obama seems sullen.\n\nSo both sides will have frustratingly partial victories and not get everything they want. That\u2019s how James Madison\u2019s system is supposed to work in a closely divided country.\n\n\u2014 Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner. \u00a9 2013 The Washington Examiner.
