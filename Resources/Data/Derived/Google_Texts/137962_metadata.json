One in three of those survivors face serious impairments, such as blindness or deafness.\n\nOne in three babies born at 23 weeks were also able to survive, with half of those children surviving without serious problems.\n\nThe medical community generally cites 24 weeks as the viable age in which a fetus is able to survive outside the womb.\n\nNow, in the wake of this research, that consensus is being questioned, invigorating the debate over whether women should be allowed, under the law, to have a late-term abortion.\n\nState Limits on Late-Term Abortions\n\nThe U.S. is one of only seven developed countries in which late-term abortions after 20 weeks (five months) are allowed, according to a report from the Charlotte Lozier Institute.\n\n>>> Read More: U.S. Is One of Seven Countries That Allows Late-Term Abortion\n\nLate-term abortions performed after 20 weeks, when not done by induction of labor (which leads to fetal death due to prematurity), are most commonly performed by dilation and evacuation procedures, which often involve removing the fetus with forceps or other instruments.\n\nIn 2013, a congressional report found that some 11,000 abortions take place each year at 20 weeks or more after fertilization.\n\nDespite there being no national law banning the procedure, a dozen states have taken it upon themselves to limit abortion at 18-20 weeks\u2014Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia.\n\nAnother 11 states\u2014Florida, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Rhode Island, and Virginia\u2014limit abortions after the 20-week mark.\n\nArizona, Georgia, and Idaho passed legislation limiting late-term abortion, but court decisions blocked those efforts.\n\nIn total, 24 states and Washington, D.C., have no limits on late-term abortions.\n\nBut now, with Congress set to take on the issue next week, that could all change.\n\nPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\n\nAs states play out their own battles over whether to ban late-term abortions, the nation is doing the same.\n\nThis week, House leaders confirmed a plan to take up a historic bill that would ban abortions nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe measure, titled the \u201cPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\u201d is built around a broad consensus of research that shows unborn infants are able to feel pain 20 weeks after fertilization.\n\n\u201cPain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the unborn child\u2019s entire body and nerves link these receptors to the brain\u2019s thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 weeks after fertilization,\u201d the bill, sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., states.\n\nTo perform surgery on unborn children 20 weeks after fertilization, children\u2019s hospitals throughout the U.S. \u201croutinely\u201d administer fetal anesthesia, which the bill states is \u201cassociated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia.\u201d\n\nHospitals have inconsistent policies regarding the age at which they attempt to save premature babies.\n\n>>> Elija\u2019s Story: A Life Saved Before Birth\n\nCritics\u2014including some physicians\u2014argue the unborn child is \u201cincapable of experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization.\u201d\n\nThe House legislation attempts to counter that argument, citing recent medical research and analysis debunking the scientific grounds for that theory.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told The Weekly Standard today that he remains committed to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, despite it failing in the House earlier this year.\n\n\u201cLife is precious and we must do everything we can to fight for it and protect it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur commitment for the House to consider this important legislation has been steadfast and I am proud of the work of our members to prepare this bill for House consideration next week.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Republican leadership canceled a highly-anticipated vote on the measure, angering voters who rallied around pro-life candidates during last year\u2019s election.\n\nFemale members of the GOP held up that vote, citing their concern over a provision in the bill that would require victims of rape to report it to law enforcement in order to legally obtain a late-term abortion.\n\nThose like Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., were concerned about the reporting requirement because the majority of rape victims don\u2019t ever report their rape to law enforcement.\n\nSome pro-life advocates pushed back against efforts to remove that language, believing that without the reporting requirements, women could still readily obtain a late-term abortion.\n\nWhen Republican leadership canceled the vote, many thought the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act was dead.\n\nBut now, after lawmakers agreed to remove the rape provision, many are hopeful the measure can pass Congress and reach the president\u2019s desk.\n\nIn an earlier statement, however, President Obama vowed to veto the legislation.\n\n\u201c[The legislation] disregards women\u2019s health and rights, the role doctors play in their patients\u2019 health care decisions, and the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nBut those advocating for the bill, like Dr. Prentice of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, say it\u2019s the unborn children who need protecting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Congress prepares to resume a debate over whether late-term abortions should be allowed in the U.S., a groundbreaking new study
