A close look at these organizations uncovers a number of examples of significant financial support for liberal causes.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFor example, in 2010 Bush joined the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charitable network founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, according to a report by the Miami Herald.\n\nBloomberg has drawn scorn from conservatives on a long list of issues, from his funding of the gun control group Moms Demand Action to his support for \u201cnanny-state\u201d policies such as banning large sodas. Bush served on the board until stepping down at the end of 2014.\n\nThe Herald describes several initiatives funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies during Bush\u2019s tenure that \u201cseem out of step with a likely GOP presidential contender,\u201d including a $50 million award in 2011 to the Sierra Club\u2019s \u201cBeyond Coal\u201d campaign, another $50 million program developed in partnership with Planned Parenthood to offer \u201creproductive health services\u201d in Third World countries, a scholarship grant program for young undocumented immigrants to attend college in the United States, and a $6 million grant to the Environmental Defense Fund to \u201cminimize the environmental impacts of natural gas operations through hydraulic fracturing.\u201d\n\nBush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told the Herald that board members \u201cdid not vote on or approve individual projects or programs,\u201d which was confirmed by Bloomberg spokeswoman Meghan Womack.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bush was honored to serve on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which does a lot of good work across the world,\u201d added Campbell. \u201cGovernor Bush and Mayor Bloomberg have great mutual respect for one another. While they disagree on several policy issues, both share a passion for improving education in America.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s work on the board for Tenet Healthcare Corporation, a publicly-traded hospital and healthcare services company, is also raising questions about conflicts of interest with the Republican platform. Back in March, the Washington Examiner reported that Bush\u2019s \u201clucrative seat\u201d on Tenet\u2019s board had earned him more than $2 million from 2007 to 2014, when he resigned to explore a presidential run.\n\nThe issue, according to the Examiner\u2019s Byron York, is that \u201cTenet strongly supported the passage of Obamacare and has profited enormously from it,\u201d and Bush \u201cremained mostly silent about the biggest public policy fight in a generation\u201d during 2009 and 2010 as Obamacare was being debated in Congress.\n\nBush spokesman Tim Miller defended the Governor, noting that Bush was not in Congress at the time and \u201che did not have a very big footprint as a guy on the cable news circuit in the years after he left the governor\u2019s office. He was focused on business.\u201d\n\nMiller adamantly denied that Bush\u2019s role with Tenet kept him silent on the issue of Obamacare. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe forcefully advocated against it in board meetings, to the point that it bubbled up in public. When asked about it, he was very clear that he was in opposition to it.\u201d\n\nHowever, as York noted, Bush rarely made any public comments about Obamacare until March 22, 2010 \u2014 the day after the law passed the House and Senate. In a Fox News Channel appearance that day, Bush sharply criticized Obamacare, calling it a \u201cmassive tax increase\u201d that he predicted would create a revolt \u201cagainst this government takeover of our lives\u201d in the upcoming elections that fall.\n\nToo little, too late, in York\u2019s opinion: \u201cIt was a tough, far-ranging indictment \u2014 delivered the day after the bill had been safely passed into law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBack when it was all on the line, and Republicans were gathering their forces in a desperate attempt to stop Obamacare, Jeb Bush mostly held his tongue.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah Rumpf on Twitter @rumpfshaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush's Corporate Board Work Tied to Liberal Causes", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jeb Bush's Corporate Board Work Tied to Liberal Causes", "title": "Jeb Bush's Corporate Board Work Tied to Liberal Causes", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Jeb-Bush-Speaking-J-Pat-CarterAP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/09/jeb-bushs-corporate-board-work-tied-to-liberal-causes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb Bush's Corporate Board Work Tied to Liberal Causes", "creator": "@rumpfshaker", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Jeb-Bush-Speaking-J-Pat-CarterAP.jpg", "title": "Jeb Bush's Corporate Board Work Tied to Liberal Causes", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 election, 2016 presidential campaign, 2016 Republican Presidential Primary, Bloomberg Philanthropies, corporations, Jeb Bush, Mike Bloomberg, obamacare, philanthropy, Planned Parenthood, Tenet Healthcare Corporation,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Tenet Healthcare Corporation", "published_time": "2015-04-09T10:59:58-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca873\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGovernor Bush was honored to serve on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which does a lot of good work across the world,\u201d added Campbell.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAfter his two terms as Florida\u2019s Governor, Jeb Bush served on a number of corporate and philanthropic boards.\nA close look at these organizations uncovers a number of examples of significant financial support for liberal causes.\n\u201cGovernor Bush and Mayor Bloomberg have great mutual respect for one another.\nHe was focused on business.\u201dMiller adamantly denied that Bush\u2019s role with Tenet kept him silent on the issue of Obamacare."}
