Chief among its targets have been the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., and the Mercedes facility in Vance, Ala.\n\nLast February, though, VW employees rejected the union in a secret-ballot vote, 712-626. Now comes more bad news for UAW bosses: Their supporters in Alabama are telling them to go back to Detroit.\n\n\u201cThis [organizing drive] has gone on for 2 years, and people are burned out,\u201d explained Kirk Garner, a union supporter who has worked at the Mercedes plant for more than a dozen years. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nJim Spitzley, another veteran Mercedes worker, is likewise fed up with the UAW\u2019s bungling campaign and myopic vision. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the image with the UAW,\u201d he laments, \u201cit\u2019s not about the workers.\u201d As a consequence, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of people that will not sign a card with the UAW. They\u2019re tired of it.\u201d\n\nIn spite of these high-profile setbacks in Alabama and Tennessee, the UAW is set to raise dues on its members. On June 3, at the union\u2019s 36th Constitutional Convention in Detroit, outgoing President Bob King successfully pushed through his long-desired 25 percent dues hike, which will bring in an estimated $45 million annually to UAW coffers.\n\nThere\u2019s no question the union needs the money \u2014 its membership has been in free-fall for decades. In 1979, it could field a formidable 1.5 million-strong army. Now fewer than 400,000 count themselves card-carrying members (and half of those do not even come from the auto industry, but hold teaching, nursing and related jobs in both the public and private sectors).\n\nThe question many union members are asking is: Does the union deserve more money from us, in light of its disastrous stewardship of its finances?\n\nTake, for example, the $6.7 million golf course the union bought in 2000 as an addition to its $33 million luxury resort in Onaway, Mich. Fox Business reported on the debacle: \u201cFrom 2005 to 2010, the resort lost an estimated $23 million, and the UAW has been forced to borrow to keep it afloat.\u201d\n\nThen there was the strike against Caterpillar, which cost the union an estimated $300 million. The failed effort at Volkswagen cost the union an estimated $5 million.\n\nAnd on and on. No wonder the union has been bleeding cash. In 2006, the strike fund was a fat $1 billion; now it\u2019s depleted to a mere $600 million. Why? According The Detroit News, \u201cThe union has tapped its strike fund over the last few years by $30 million to $40 million a year to pay operating expenses.\u201d\n\nUnion bosses waste money on fancy resorts and fat salaries for themselves. (Top leaders, such as Mr. King and new UAW President Dennis Williams, easily qualify as the \u201c1 percenters\u201d they hypocritically castigate.) Their organizing drives down South do nothing to benefit their Detroit members, whose pockets are picked to fund these shenanigans.\n\nThe pocket-picking will soon come to an end. Michigan is now a right-to-work state, which means next year Detroit autoworkers will at last be free to opt out of paying the UAW work tax.\n\nMr. King and Mr. Williams claim not to be worried. I\u2019d wager otherwise. The UAW has a record that speaks for itself, a record of crippling industry and killing jobs, of forcing workers onto its rolls and then wasting their money. In Alabama and Tennessee, workers have looked at this record and said, \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before Detroit workers say likewise.\n\nMatt Patterson is executive director of the Center for Worker Freedom at Americans for Tax Reform.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United Auto Workers (UAW) has for years tried to organize foreign-owned auto plants in the South.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The United Auto Workers (UAW) has for years tried to organize foreign-owned auto plants in the South.", "title": "PATTERSON: Driving the UAW out of the South", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/6/patterson-driving-the-uaw-out-of-the-south/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/03/uaw-dues-increasejpeg-03734.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/03/uaw-dues-increasejpeg-03734.jpg", "description": "The United Auto Workers (UAW) has for years tried to organize foreign-owned auto plants in the South.", "card": "summary", "title": "PATTERSON: Driving the UAW out of the South"}, "Author": "Matt Patterson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Detroit, Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Bob King, Jim Spitzley"}, "article_summary": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:The United Auto Workers (UAW) has for years tried to organize foreign-owned auto plants in the South.\nTheir organizing drives down South do nothing to benefit their Detroit members, whose pockets are picked to fund these shenanigans.\nNow comes more bad news for UAW bosses: Their supporters in Alabama are telling them to go back to Detroit.\nThe question many union members are asking is: Does the union deserve more money from us, in light of its disastrous stewardship of its finances?\nIn Alabama and Tennessee, workers have looked at this record and said, \u201cThanks, but no thanks.\u201dIt\u2019s only a matter of time before Detroit workers say likewise."}
