Is it the year of the Ra(h)m?

Will the year of the Ram be the year of Rahm?

As Mayor Rahm Emanuel walked through the Chinese New Year Lunar Parade in Chinatown on Sunday, it wasn’t without irony that he stopped and shook hands with someone dressed up as a Ram.

While 2015 is the year of the Ram – people described as calm, reserved, happy, kind — that’s not Emanuel’s sign on the Chinese Zodiac.

When told that he was born in the year of the Pig, the mayor smiled.

“That’s kosher,” said Emanuel, who is Jewish.

One online source describes those born during the year of the Pig as “sincere, tolerant, hard-working, honest, optimistic,” according to TravelChinaguide.com. Among the Pig’s weaknesses: “hot-tempered and impulsive.”

Here’s other Chinese Zodiac signs for mayoral candidates:

Jesus “Chuy” Garcia: Year of the Monkey. Described as “talented problem solvers, they are self-assured, sociable and innovative, with competent practical ability.”

Bob Fioretti: Year of the Snake. Described as having “gracious morality and great wisdom… They have tremendous sympathy for others and would like to take actions to help their fellow human beings.”

Willie Wilson: Year of the Rat. One who is “imaginative, generous, successful, popular and curious.”

William “Dock” Walls: Year of the Rooster. One who is “shrewd, honest, communicative, motivated, punctual.”
