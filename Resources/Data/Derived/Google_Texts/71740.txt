Jury selection began Tuesday afternoon and will continue Wednesday in Mesa County District Court in the case of the Palisade mother whose children died of hyperthermia after she locked them in a heated car.

Heather Jensen has pleaded not guilty to charges of criminally negligent homicide, child abuse resulting in death and false reporting to authorities.

Jensen left 2-year-old William Jensen and 4-year-old Tyler Jensen in her car in November 2012 with the doors locked and the heater on for more than an hour. During that time, she allegedly smoked pot and had sex with a man in his truck which was parked alongside her vehicle on a rural road on the Grand Mesa, east of Grand Junction.

William died at the scene, and Tyler died a week later at Children’s Hospital in Denver.

The boys’ father had died in a car accident less than two months before the boys died.

Jensen was arrested in Florida and extradited to Mesa County where she has been jailed for more than a year. Jensen dabbed at tears after nearly 90 potential jurors were brought into the courtroom Tuesday.

Jury selection had been delayed after Jensen’s attorneys complained that jurors would see her shackled to the defendant’s table because she was wearing a skirt. The jury pool waited for nearly two hours until a pair of slacks was procured and Jensen changed clothes.

Her trial is scheduled to last nine days.
