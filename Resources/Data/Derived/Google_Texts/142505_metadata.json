The label \u201chypoallergenic\u201d is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and has in turn turned into a marketing ploy, Hamann added.\n\nOver 30 million Americans suffer from eczema, which throws them into cycles of itching, scratching, and releasing of inflammatory chemicals, according to the National Eczema Association. The red patches of itchy skin often appear on their arms, legs, cheeks, and necks. Those with eczema are diagnosed when they are babies or young children, but the symptoms become less severe as children grow into adults. Their outbreaks make them more susceptible to allergic reactions to any topical substances, including lotions, preservatives, fragrances, or other kinds of chemicals.\n\n\u201cIt would be very difficult for even the most caring, intelligent, and well-read parent to know the names of 80-plus allergens and their synonyms,\u201d Hamann said. \u201cLet alone compare that list of allergens to a 15-plus long ingredient list on the back of a pediatric product. Many of the chemicals on that list are very, very rare causes of allergy.\u201d\n\nHamann and his colleagues tested 187 cosmetic products found throughout six different stores in California. They were looking to see if they contained any of the 80 most common known allergens. They proved the mislabeling when they found 89 percent of the products contained at least one allergen, 63 percent contained two or more, and 11 percent contained five or more. The labels read \u201chypoallergenic,\u201d \u201cdermatologist recommended/tested,\u201d \u201cfragrance-free,\u201d or \u201cparaben free,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean any of that was true. No government body is checking to make sure companies are using those terms honestly because it\u2019s an unregulated label.\n\nEerily similar, \u201cAll-Natural,\u201d \u201cOrganic,\u201d and \u201cNon-GMO\u201d (genetically modified organism) labels are used more as a way to advertise to consumers instead of inform them. The difference is the food industry is regulated and has faced legal action for falsely using the labels. Throw a \u201cNon-GMO\u201d label onto a barrel of apples and your company can be held accountable. If those apples were genetically altered to resist pesticides, a lawsuit is fair game.\n\nWhy are cosmetic companies exempt from using labels that are used to inform the consumer? The consumer, in this case, is after all a parent trying to protect his or her child from harmful chemicals that could cause an allergic reaction. So what can parents do instead of play the guessing game?\n\nDermatologists recommend safe petroleum-based products such as Vaseline for sensitive skin. Products that include a full label of their ingredients are usually reliable. Also, try to \u201cavoid fragranced, colored products and those where the ingredient listing is not stated,\u201d Dr. Michael Ardern-Jones, a skin disease specialist at the University of Southampton in the UK, told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cAlmost any chemical compound could be implicated as an allergen, so it is almost impossible for a cream to be truly non-allergic,\u201d Ardern-Jones said. \u201cThus, as there is no true \u2018hypoallergenic\u2019 cream, there is no agreed meaning of \u2018hypoallergenic.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kids, eczema, not, safe, hypoallergenic, products, labels, deceive, organic, food", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Allergy-free labels' promises ring hollow and contain unsafe chemicals for kids with eczema.", "title": "Hypoallergenic Claims Are The 'Organic' Of The Skin Care World", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kids-eczema-not-safe-hypoallergenic-products-labels-deceive-organic-food-311926", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/24/kids-eczema-arent-safe-allergen-free-lotions.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Allergy-free labels' promises ring hollow and contain unsafe chemicals for kids with eczema.", "title": "Hypoallergenic Claims Are The 'Organic' Of The Skin Care World", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kids-eczema-not-safe-hypoallergenic-products-labels-deceive-organic-food-311926", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/24/kids-eczema-arent-safe-allergen-free-lotions.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/24/kids-eczema-arent-safe-allergen-free-lotions.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-11-24T10:58:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-24T10:58:40-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Allergy-free labels' promises ring hollow and contain unsafe chemicals for kids with eczema."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5f2f\"", "article_summary": "They proved the mislabeling when they found 89 percent of the products contained at least one allergen, 63 percent contained two or more, and 11 percent contained five or more.\nWhy are cosmetic companies exempt from using labels that are used to inform the consumer?\nThe labels read \u201chypoallergenic,\u201d \u201cdermatologist recommended/tested,\u201d \u201cfragrance-free,\u201d or \u201cparaben free,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean any of that was true.\nThe difference is the food industry is regulated and has faced legal action for falsely using the labels.\nEerily similar, \u201cAll-Natural,\u201d \u201cOrganic,\u201d and \u201cNon-GMO\u201d (genetically modified organism) labels are used more as a way to advertise to consumers instead of inform them."}
