How are you feeling? What have we done to each other?\u201d The voice is Ben Affleck\u2019s, and the image on the screen is the back of a woman\u2019s head resting on a pillow\u2014his wife\u2019s head. She is blonde, and even before she turns to face the camera, we know she will be beautiful. (She is, after all, played by Rosamund Pike.) It all might make for a touching opening to the film Gone Girl, if only Affleck\u2019s conjugal musings did not take this unpromising turn: \u201cI imagine cracking open her head, unspooling her brain, trying to get answers.\u201d Umm, maybe better just to ask? Affleck plays Nick Dunne, the husband; Pike plays Amy Elliott-Dunne, the wife; and the fate of her pretty head\u2014along with the rest of her\u2014is the central mystery of David Fincher\u2019s faithful, intriguing adaptation of Gillian Flynn\u2019s gazillion-selling novel. Related Story Fall Movie Preview: 21 Buzzy Awards-Season Contenders Like the book, the film tells its story, for a while at least, in the form of two interwoven strands of he-said/she-said: the narrative DNA of an unraveling marriage. We watch as Nick, on the morning of the couple\u2019s fifth anniversary, goes to the bar he co-manages with his sister, Margo (Carrie Coon), for a far-too-early whiskey. When he returns to his home\u2014a lifeless McMansion in depressed North Carthage, Missouri\u2014his wife is missing, and there are signs of a struggle. He calls the police, and two detectives (Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit) arrive to conduct an investigation that leads, inevitably, to Nick himself. Does he seem insufficiently concerned about Amy\u2019s disappearance? How can he be so clueless regarding her daily life? Why doesn\u2019t he even know her blood type? And what\u2019s with that shit-eating grin he seems incapable of suppressing? Nick\u2019s story of loss (perhaps?) or murder (perhaps?) alternates with Amy\u2019s version of events, though the events in question are not the same. Rather she describes, in diary-entry flashbacks, their backstory: the years-long tick-tock of how she and Nick wound up unhappily-ever-after in the North Carthage McMansion. Their relationship begins, after all, with vastly more promise and glamor, a sizzling romance in magazine-world Manhattan. Nick writes for a men\u2019s mag; Amy creates personality quizzes. They meet at a hipster party, where he promises that he\u2019s \u201cthe guy to save you from all this awesomeness.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe you,\u201d she tells him, adding tartly, \u201cI think it\u2019s the chin.\u201d\n\nTheir early days are a whirlwind of spectacular sex and clever in-jokes. But then the recession hits, and both their magazine jobs are downsized out of existence. Amy\u2019s substantial inheritance\u2014the product of the \u201cAmazing Amy\u201d books written by her psychologist parents, who transmuted her childhood into a lucrative franchise\u2014becomes dramatically less substantial when said parents, deep in debt, ask for her trust fund back. Things only get worse when Nick\u2019s mom gets cancer and they move out to Missouri, where he grew up, to help. Soon enough, they find themselves stuck there: semi-jobless, almost friendless, watching their resentments multiply like a plague. Affleck has always tended toward onscreen reticence, and here that serves him well. Had things gotten bad enough for Nick to kill Amy? Had they possibly gotten even worse? In deference to readers unfamiliar with Flynn\u2019s novel, I will reveal none of its many twists or turns. For the rest, I will offer reassurance that they are all reproduced onscreen with only modest tweaks and tinkers. The script, by Flynn herself, retains many of the novel\u2019s wickedest lines (Margo\u2019s recommendation on what Nick ought to give Amy for that fifth\u2014i.e., \u201cwood\u201d\u2014anniversary is there in all its obscene splendor) and on occasion, a gag is even sharpened, as with the envelope marked \u201cClue One.\u201d As Nick, Affleck gives a better performance than he has in years. He\u2019s always tended toward a certain onscreen reticence, and here that ambiguity serves him well: Is he smarmy or awkwardly overcompensating? A cold-blooded killer or a hapless hubby? The role of Amy represents a still bigger break for Pike, who made her feature-film debut at the lowest ebb of Bond-dom in Die Another Day, and has since often been forced to rise above such fare as Wrath of the Titans and Jack Reacher. (She also made the most of her limited opportunities in last year\u2019s excellent The World\u2019s End.) The role of Amy is trickier even than that of Nick, with the possible moral poles she might inhabit still more distant: Is she the perfect wife? Or calculatedly pretend-perfect? Without giving anything away, I will say that Pike brings off the difficult role with admirable poise, and I expect the quality of the scripts landing on her agent\u2019s desk to improve commensurately.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though director David Fincher may over-Fincher-ize somewhat, he delivers a sleek, faithful adaptation of the bestselling thriller.", "author": "Christopher Orr", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Though director David Fincher may over-Fincher-ize somewhat, he delivers a sleek, faithful adaptation of the bestselling thriller.", "title": "Gone Girl Goes Grim", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/10/Gone_Girl_still_1/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/gone-girl-review-fincher-makes-it-darker-and-sleeker/381078/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcf85\"", "article_summary": "We watch as Nick, on the morning of the couple\u2019s fifth anniversary, goes to the bar he co-manages with his sister, Margo (Carrie Coon), for a far-too-early whiskey.\nShe is blonde, and even before she turns to face the camera, we know she will be beautiful.\nThings only get worse when Nick\u2019s mom gets cancer and they move out to Missouri, where he grew up, to help.\nThe role of Amy is trickier even than that of Nick, with the possible moral poles she might inhabit still more distant: Is she the perfect wife?\nFor the rest, I will offer reassurance that they are all reproduced onscreen with only modest tweaks and tinkers."}
