( Jonathan Castner / For the Times-Call )\n\nResidents of a northeast Longmont neighborhood joined veterans and their family members Monday morning for the first in a set of annual local remembrances of men and women who died while serving in the country's armed forces.\n\nScott Sullivan and Dean Augustad said they aren't veterans themselves but \u2014 as they've done for several years \u2014 they showed up with their 10-year-old daughters, Brynne Sullivan and Kiya Augustad, for the Memorial Day ceremony at Longmont's Stephen Day Park, 1340 Deerwood Drive.\n\nThe city park is named for Army Private First Class Stephen Wayne Day, a Hygiene resident who was born in Longmont and attended Longmont schools. He died on Dec. 1, 1966, in Vietnam at the age of 22.\n\nRalph Bozella and Mary Blue listen to the playing of \"Taps\" at the end of the wreath-laying ceremony in honor of the fallen military personnel at Stephen Day Park in Longmont on Monday. (Jonathan Castner / For the Times-Call)\n\nThe Sullivan and Augustad girls, students at nearby Fall River Elementary School, and their parents participated in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance and looked on as various veterans' organizations and service clubs placed wreaths on stands.\n\nThey also saw an American Legion John Harold Buckley Post 32 honor guard, which featured flag-bearers and seven riflemen who fired a three-volley military salute.\n\n\"We come every year,\" Scott Sullivan said.\n\nHe said the ceremony offers a chance to \"teach our children to realize that these veterans fought for our freedoms\" and that Memorial Day \"is not just another day off.\"\n\nSteve Augustad said the event is an opportunity \"to show the kids, to remember, the reason we're here.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Stephen Day Park ceremony, which was repeated at Foothills Gardens of Memory, 14241 N. 107th St., and Mountain View Cemetery, 620 11th Ave., later in the day, concluded with the playing of \"Taps.\"\n\nThe remarks at the Stephen Day city park ceremony overseen by Post 32 chaplain Bill Bohn were brief, coming chiefly from several of the wreath-bearers.\n\nA representative of local American Legion post's auxiliary, for example, said that organization's wreath was \"in memory of the brave men and women and the sacrifices that they have made.\"\n\nOther wreaths were presented by representatives of Longmont Elks Lodge 1055, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2601, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Military Order of the Purple Heart and Disabled American Veterans, Bohn said.\n\nLongmont's Ralph Bozella, chairman of the American Legion's National Affairs Committee, said that at the Mountain View event, he'd be speaking about how \"remembrance is the highest form of honor\" and how the day is the national occasion that's observed to remember the nation's deceased veterans \"and learn from their sacrifice.\"\n\nThe service at Mountain View Cemetery also marked the first such Memorial Day event being held there since a granite Civil War memorial statue was broken when tipped over by vandals in August 2013. The statue has been replaced and was rededicated during the ceremony.\n\nMemorial Day, once called Decoration Day, has its own origins with the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union Army Civil War veterans, which in May 1868 established a day for the nation to decorate the graves of that war's dead with flowers.\n\nJohn Fryar: 303-684-5211, jfryar@times-call.com or twitter.com/jfryartc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28185756/veterans-neighbors-gather-longmonts-memorial-day-services", "modificationDate": "2015-05-25T16:42:59-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0525/20150525__26TCAMEMw~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Residents of a northeast Longmont neighborhood joined veterans and their family members Monday morning for the first in a set of annual local remembrances of men and women who died while serving in the country's armed forces.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28185756:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-25T13:24:18-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28185756/veterans-neighbors-gather-longmonts-memorial-day-services", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0525/20150525__26TCAMEMw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Residents of a northeast Longmont neighborhood joined veterans and their family members Monday morning for the first in a set of annual local remembrances of men and women who died while serving in the country's armed forces.", "title": "Veterans, neighbors gather for Longmont's Memorial Day services"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Residents of a northeast Longmont neighborhood joined veterans and their family members Monday morning for the first in a set of annual local remembrances of men and women who died while serving in the country's armed forces.", "title": "Veterans, neighbors gather for Longmont's Memorial Day services", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28185756/veterans-neighbors-gather-longmonts-memorial-day-services", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0525/20150525__26TCAMEMw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-25T13:24:18-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-05-25T16:27:10-0600", "sailthru.title": "Veterans, neighbors gather for Longmont's Memorial Day services", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By John FryarStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0525/20150525__26TCAMEMw~3.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-05-25T16:30:25-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8542\"", "article_summary": "Scott Sullivan and Dean Augustad said they aren't veterans themselves but \u2014 as they've done for several years \u2014 they showed up with their 10-year-old daughters, Brynne Sullivan and Kiya Augustad, for the Memorial Day ceremony at Longmont's Stephen Day Park, 1340 Deerwood Drive.\nWes Stiller, of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, lays a wreath in honor of fallen military personnel at Stephen Day Park in Longmont on Monday as part of a Memorial Day service.\nAdvertisementThe Stephen Day Park ceremony, which was repeated at Foothills Gardens of Memory, 14241 N. 107th St., and Mountain View Cemetery, 620 11th Ave., later in the day, concluded with the playing of \"Taps.\"\nThe remarks at the Stephen Day city park ceremony overseen by Post 32 chaplain Bill Bohn were brief, coming chiefly from several of the wreath-bearers.\nThe service at Mountain View Cemetery also marked the first such Memorial Day event being held there since a granite Civil War memorial statue was broken when tipped over by vandals in August 2013."}
