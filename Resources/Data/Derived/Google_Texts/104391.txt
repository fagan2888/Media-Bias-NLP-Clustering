Donald "D.L." Sheets said he got tired of telling his concerns to state legislators and getting a standard reply.

"It's the response you get from every politician: I'll look into that and get back to you," said Sheets, a retired chef and restaurant owner who lives in Mount Solon.

They never did either, as far as he knows, so he figured to take matters into his own hands to campaign for the 24th District seat of the state Senate.

Sheets is challenging incumbent Emmett Hanger for the GOP nomination, the contest that will likely decide the eventual victor in the heavily Republican district.

Hanger is running for a sixth term in the Senate, the type of tenure that Sheets believes is part of the problem in state government.

"Public service was never intended to be a profession," said Sheets, a county native who served a stint in the U.S Navy. "Public service was meant for you to get in, do your service and get out."

Health concerns forced him to retire relatively young, and he believes the biggest problem with health care in the nation is the greed on the part of the private sector. Sheets doesn't believe that expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is the answer, though.

Other issues he would like to see addressed are the influence of voter-dense Northern Virginia on state policy and what he considers the excessive cost of opening a small business.
