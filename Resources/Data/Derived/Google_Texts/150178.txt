The next President of the United States will take office at the start of one of the greatest shifts in demographics in the history of our country. The number of people in the United States age 85 and older will mushroom from about 6 million to over 15 million in the 25 years following inauguration. How the next President responds to this population shift will have an enormous impact on the quality of life of America's seniors and their families, the Federal Medicare budget, and the overall economy for decades to come. Simply put, today we are quite challenged to make America great for the current group of oldest Americans and their families--it will take real focus and Presidential leadership to avoid catastrophe and hopefully do much better for a much larger group of people age 85 and older.



Many of the solutions will require several years to bear fruit, so much of the opportunity to navigate this demographic shift will rest on the next President. The Affordable Care Act or "Obamacare" has dominated the debate and discussion about health and human services for several years, but Obamacare is primarily focused on policies related to younger people, and the issues facing the oldest Americans have gone largely unaddressed. In fact, while not widely reported, in order to pay for some of the subsidies for younger people, Obamacare took monies away from elder home health care and has steadily added new paperwork barriers to qualify for home health care. Home health is a program that is primarily used by the oldest and most vulnerable Medicare recipients and their families. Cutting home health is a foolish cost-control strategy, home health needs to be harnessed as a lower cost way to help vulnerable elders stay out of much more costly hospitals and nursing facilities.
