Come to our theme park, it\u2019s off I65 third exit Northbound. When you get there, we give you a gun, it\u2019s safe, then after you\u2019re done, you go home and feel better with your shitty American life. Hell, you don\u2019t even need your own gun, we give you everything,\u201d McCormack revealed to the Texas Sun newspaper.\n\nGuns are such a big part of American society that taking them away is akin to taking a baby away from its mother\u2019s teat.\n\nPresident Obama praised the new shooting massacre theme park, stating that although it was in bad taste, it could serve a valuable function to anyone who lives in the dog eat dog society that is modern America.\n\n\u201cI prefer they do it this way. Millions of Americans are on prescription drugs and have psychotic thoughts daily. Add in the mix of my taxation drive, Obamacare unaffordable poor healthcare, and the American media constantly broadcasting actual shooting sprees, I feel this theme park may take it off the streets and we can begin our valuable work of disarming civilians and their dangerous weapons once and for all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Squib", "description": "TEXAS - USA - Americans love a shooting spree, and one entrepreneur is capitalising on this American penchant for indiscriminate shooting by opening a new theme park dedicated to shooting sprees.", "title": "American Shooting Spree Theme Park Opened in Texas - Daily Squib", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/american-shooting-spree.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-01T10:10:18+00:00", "url": "http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/8042-american-shooting-spree-theme-park-opened-texas.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "TEXAS - USA - Americans love a shooting spree, and one entrepreneur is capitalising on this American penchant for indiscriminate shooting by opening a new theme park dedicated to shooting sprees.", "title": "American Shooting Spree Theme Park Opened in Texas - Daily Squib", "image": "http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/american-shooting-spree.jpg", "creator": "@dailysquib", "site": "@dailysquib", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "kroYtIxHvqAlqElZy1Y5WhETJxnHbMZqRRYiflvM_Go", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailysquib?ref=ts", "section": "World", "tag": "us", "published_time": "2014-06-01T10:08:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-01T10:10:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddda2\"", "article_summary": "Come to our theme park, it\u2019s off I65 third exit Northbound.\nGuns are such a big part of American society that taking them away is akin to taking a baby away from its mother\u2019s teat.\nPresident Obama praised the new shooting massacre theme park, stating that although it was in bad taste, it could serve a valuable function to anyone who lives in the dog eat dog society that is modern America.\nKevin McCormack, 54, is a Texan businessman who has financed the latest in American entertainment that has already received massive interest from the public.\nHell, you don\u2019t even need your own gun, we give you everything,\u201d McCormack revealed to the Texas Sun newspaper."}
