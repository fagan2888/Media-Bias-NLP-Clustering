Policy Watch show that budget cuts prompted the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Early Intervention Program to call for the closure of three children\u2019s developmental services agencies in New Bern, Rocky Mount and Wilmington.\n\nThe state agency will expand an existing contract with East Carolina University\u2019s School of Medicine to continue providing services to families in the 21 affected counties, according to a Feb. 10 strategic plan written by Dr. Robin Cummings, the state\u2019s acting health director, and obtained by N.C. Policy Watch.\n\nECU already has a contract with DHHS to provide early intervention services for several counties in the Greenville area.\n\nA question and answer document provided to staff emphasized that services would not be interrupted for families.\n\n\u201cServices for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families will continue, and again, we want that to be as seamless as possible,\u201d the DHHS advisory to employees stated.\n\nThe upcoming closures in New Bern, Rocky Mount and Wilmington will mean job losses for 173 DHHS employees, who were informed Wednesday about the closures. The new ECU contract is expected to create 150 jobs that laid-off workers are encouraged to apply for, but don\u2019t have any guarantees of being hired, according to DHHS documents.\n\nThe state currently has 16 child developmental service agencies (CDSAs) around the state (click here to see locations), that assess and provide services to children under the age of 3 with developmental delays. All but four of the CDSAs are state-run.\n\nThe three soon-to-be closed offices provide services to families of disabled babies and toddlers in 21 eastern counties \u2013 Bladen, Brunswick, Carteret, Columbus, Craven, Cumberland, Duplin, Edgecombe, Halifax, Johnston, Jones, Lenoir, Nash, New Hanover, Northampton, Onslow, Pamlico, Pender, Robeson, Sampson and Wilson counties.\n\nCummings, in his memorandum to early intervention staff, said services in the 21 affected counties will be shifted to Greenville because of continued budget cuts from state leaders coupled with a state government hiring freeze that leaves therapist and staff positions vacant.\n\nThe state budget passed last summer called for $18 million in cuts over two years to the federally-mandated early intervention program that screens an estimated 10,000 children a year at 16 children\u2019s developmental service agencies statewide. Additional services, such as physical and speech therapies, are also provided to children that have developmental delays or other issues that threaten cognitive health.\n\nThe program is facing $10 million in cuts for the fiscal year beginning this July.\n\n\u201cThe program has, however, experienced multiple reductions in state appropriations over the last several years and will sustain another very substantial reduction in 2014-15,\u201d Cummings wrote.\n\nHe added, \u201cState and contract CDSAs are all doing very well in serving infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families; the only discernable difference between them that we find is that contract CDSAs are able to have a much lower vacancy rate,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDeborah Carroll, the head of the N.C. Infant-Toddler Program, referred questions about the closures to DHHS communications office.\n\nDHHS\u2019s communications staff, had not returned phone calls by Monday afternoon seeking comment about the early intervention office closures.\n\nCummings Memo by NC Policy Watch", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "ECU already has a contract with DHHS to provide early intervention services for several counties in the Greenville area.\nDHHS\u2019s communications staff, had not returned phone calls by Monday afternoon seeking comment about the early intervention office closures.\nDeborah Carroll, the head of the N.C.
