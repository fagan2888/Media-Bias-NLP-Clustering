A new national report says hate groups are on the rise, but an Albuquerque group is trying to change that.

Sunday, hundreds of people gathered in Civic Plaza for a march and rally to unite against hate in our community.

The even was organized by the Albuquerque United Front Against Hate, who says the demonstration is in response to the increase in incidents targeting Muslims, the LGBTQ community and women.

“We’re here to combat stigmatization, racism and discrimination,” said demonstrator Samia Assad. “People are sick of it. They’re tired of hearing the rhetoric taking over the nation and they’re here to say we are the majority. We’re against racism. We stand against it.”

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of hate groups in America rose by 14 percent in 2015 from the year before.
