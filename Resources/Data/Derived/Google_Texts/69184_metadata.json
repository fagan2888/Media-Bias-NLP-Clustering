On February 24, 2009, Barack Obama\u2019s 35th full day in office, he delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress to explain how America had gotten into its economic mess and how his just-passed $787 billion stimulus bill would help get it out. He spoke about foreign policy, too: about his plans to wrench America\u2019s orientation toward the rest of the world away from the snarling martial barks of the Bush years, rebuild alliances, reestablish diplomacy as a first resort, and use \u201call elements of our national power\u201d\u2014for, he concluded, \u201cliving our values doesn\u2019t make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger.\u201d It started Obama\u2019s first term off with a wave of nearly universal approval\u2014even among Republicans.\n\nI\u2019ve always seen that speech as a key to understanding a certain sort of road not taken by this administration. It\u2019s one that could have led Obama to considerably more success than he has enjoyed, and perhaps even fulfilled expectations that his would be a \u201ctransformational\u201d and not a \u201ctransactional\u201d presidency\u2014a failure Obama himself seemed to acknowledge by explicitly, almost apologetically, comparing himself unfavorably to Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. I agree with him. It\u2019s not that he has not scored important, even historic successes as president: the Affordable Care Act, the Iranian nuclear deal. But a president is transformational when he meets head on, and transcends, the preeminent historical crisis of his times\u00ad\u00ad\u2014the incapacity of the weak American state to deal with a Depression in Roosevelt\u2019s case, the sectional crisis over slavery in Abraham Lincoln\u2019s. Add Ronald Reagan, who Obama once cited as another model of a transformational president, whose accomplishment was turning \u201cliberalism\u201d into a dirty word. Obama\u2019s historical task was to do the same for conservatism. It hasn\u2019t happened; conservatism has instead thrived. That was not foreordained.\n\nRemember the Republican response that evening in 2009? It featured Bobby Jindal\u2019s infamous schoolboy singsong flaying of the new law as a sinkhole of waste\u2014140 million \u201cfor something called volcano monitoring!\u201d (A month afterward, a volcano sent up a 60,000-foot cloud of ash over parts of Alaska, including Sarah Palin\u2019s hometown of Wasilla.) The pundits, even Republican ones, declared it the end of an era. As David Brooks put it on CNN:\n\n\u201cTo come up at this moment in history with a stale, government-is-the-problem, we can\u2019t trust the federal government\u2014it\u2019s just a disaster for the Republican Party.\u2026in a moment when only the federal government is big enough to actually do stuff\u2014to just ignore all that, and just say \u2018government is a problem, corruption, earmarks, wasteful spending,\u2019 it\u2019s just a form of nihilism. It\u2019s just not where the country is. It\u2019s not where the future of the country is.\u201d\n\nThe American people agreed. Obama\u2019s full-throated defense of the role of government in stabilizing the U.S. economy, and the world, got a 92 percent overall approval rating.\n\nWhat a historic opportunity!\n\nIn the previous six years following the Republican takeover of the Senate, America had embarked upon an almost unprecedented experiment: effective conservative control of all three branches of government. The result, of course, was smoking ruins. Out of those political ashes Obama\u2019s commanding electoral victory arose.\n\nThe strategic situation was propitious, too. By the time Obama gave that speech, senior GOP members of Congress had already met with conservative movement leaders and Republican strategists and agreed to ignore the electoral mandate and commit the party to a course of absolute obstruction, the better to turn Obama into a one-term president.\n\nThe Obama White House either never learned about this or didn\u2019t care. With aching sincerity, the president kept extending his hand in bipartisan fellowship, only to have an anvil dropped on it. The parable of Lucy and the football became our modern-day version of the myth of Sisyphus.\n\nAt any number of moments he could have staged what Bill Clinton called a \u201cGary Cooper moment.\u201d The next time they proffered extremism in the face of his invitation to compromise, Obama could do what Clinton did when congressional Republicans offered Medicare cuts as their budget \u201ccompromise\u201d in 1995. Clinton told Rep. Dick Armey, as Paul Begala recalled, \u201cIf you want somebody to sign this budget you\u2019re going to have to put another president behind that desk, because I will never do it.\u201d Armey responded by shutting down the government. Clinton made that his appeal to the public. He said, effectively, I set the table for a moderate middle course. I did so patiently and evenhandedly. The Republicans responded by flipping over the table. See how childish they are?\n\nObama has always refused that Gary Cooper role. Not his style: there is no blue America, there is no red America. Consider his reaction to the Tea Party victories of 2010. After that election, political scientists crunched all kinds of numbers to figure out what happened. Here are the only numbers that mattered, I think: (1) by a two-to-one margin, voters surveyed on election day believed that under Obama their taxes had gone up; but (2) in actual fact the taxes of 95 percent had gone down. Given all the right-wingers who won congressional seats crying TEA\u2014\u201cTaxed Enough Already\u201d\u2014it was the perfect opportunity to call out Republican successes, not as a mandate, but a Big Lie.\n\nHe could have done what Ronald Reagan did following his own \u201cshellacking\u201d in 1982: offer a full-throated pledge to stay the course. Instead, in his press conference the next day, Obama practically waved the white flag of surrender. He said the vote \u201cconfirmed what I\u2019ve heard from folks all across America\u201d\u2014that his presidency was on the wrong track. He was \u201ceager to sit down with members of both parties and figure out how we can move forward together,\u201d because \u201cno person, no party, has a monopoly on wisdom.\u201d He took \u201cdirect responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make.\u201d So it was time to find \u201ccommon ground.\u201d\n\nHe took a Republican lie and chiseled it for all time into the tablets of history.\n\nWhy did this keep happening? In 2012 Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker got hold of a series of memos that revealed a White House defined by reactive lurches\u2014a White House, I wrote back then, that \u201clet themselves be guided by clich\u00e9s made up by Republicans and parroted by pundits.\u201d Rooted, always, in the confidence that he could find reasonable negotiating partners in the Republican leadership, who could discipline their caucuses into going along with reasonable deals.\n\nBut a more historically astute and strategically clear-eyed White House would have known this was fantasy. James Fallows explained the nature of compromise with a Congress controlled by the opposition. Fallows, who had worked as a speechwriter and adviser for Jimmy Carter, cited a memo that a Harvard-trained lawyer who had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote to Harry Truman after the 1946 elections. Republicans had taken control of both Houses of Congress seven months after Truman had succeeded FDR, and James Rowe Jr. warned the President that cooperation with Congress \u201cis a one way street.\u201d\n\nWhat Obama should understand was what Rowe explained to Truman, Fallows wrote:\n\n\u201c[W]hen an opposing party holds Congress, it will always view weakening the president as its paramount goal.\u2026 Its leaders will define \u2018compromise\u2019 as the president\u2019s accepting all of their demands and abandoning his own.\u201d\n\nIn stuttering steps, Obama seemed to begin to learn the lesson. In The New Republic Noam Scheiber wrote of a moment in 2011 when, after pursuing \u201cpainstaking negotiations with Republicans over a series of dead-end deficit deals, even as the economy teetered on the edge of a second recession,\u201d after two and a half years of \u201chatching proposals with an eye toward winning over the opposition,\u201d the president told aides to put together a second stimulus package instead, imploring them not to \u201cself-edit\u201d their proposals. He took $450 million of spending to the electorate. His poll numbers went steadily up for all the next year. He won reelection.\n\nThen he forgot the lesson.\n\nIn 2012 with utter stalemate in budget negotiations\u2014and a looming \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d\u2014Obama offered a deal including massive budget cuts across the government. He assumed the Republicans would never allow it to happen because it included defense cuts.
