Then, for the past three months, she lived with the fear that goes along with not having health insurance. She\u2019s still afraid her health coverage won\u2019t last.\n\nScott, 52, of Richmond was diagnosed with kidney disease at age 32 and had a kidney transplant eight years later. Ever since, she has depended on medications she\u2019ll have to take for the rest of her life to ensure her body doesn\u2019t reject the transplanted kidney.\n\n\u201cOne of my biggest fears in having a transplant was not being able to pay for the meds,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAnd everyone was like, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry.\u2019 You know, \u2018You don\u2019t have to worry.\u2019 And here I am worrying.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because in August, Scott joined the ranks of thousands of Maine residents who have lost their health coverage through MaineCare over the past year as a result of state budget cuts. MaineCare is Maine\u2019s version of the federal Medicaid program, which offers health coverage for people with low incomes and disabilities.\n\nScott recently received notice that her coverage would be reinstated, though the notice didn\u2019t explain why. But for three months, she joined nearly 35,000 Maine people, the majority of whom work, who lost coverage as a result of the budget cuts and Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s vetoes of legislation that would have allowed Maine to accept federal funds set aside through the Affordable Care Act to close the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d for people with low income. Those people are not eligible for subsidies to help them afford private insurance. Not accepting the federal funds meant many low-income adults \u2014 working people like Sheila \u2014 were cut from MaineCare and lost their health care coverage.\n\nThe people who lost coverage at the start of the year fit into two categories: parents who earned between 100 and 133 percent of the federal poverty level and adults without dependent children. None of them earned more than $11,670 annually for a household of one. Scott likely qualified for Medicaid as part of this latter category.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown to Scott and those who advocated for her continued MaineCare coverage why the Department of Health and Human Services cut off her coverage in August, rather than in January when other childless adults lost their coverage. It\u2019s similarly unclear why she received notice that her coverage would be reinstated.\n\nA DHHS spokeswoman said the department can\u2019t comment publicly on specific cases. It\u2019s possible, however, that the department has determined Scott qualifies for coverage due to disability.\n\n\u201cThere are a variety of reasons why an individual could lose coverage and then regain it,\u201d DHHS spokeswoman Sarah Grant wrote in an email. \u201cFor example, if the department requests information and the client does not provide the information, their case would close. If the client subsequently provides the information, the case could then be reopened.\u201d\n\nScott first qualified for MaineCare more than 20 years ago as a low-income parent with dependent children. She kept her coverage after she became disabled due to her kidney disease diagnosis. After the transplant 12 years ago, Scott returned to work and stopped collecting the Supplemental Security Income she had been receiving as a result of her disability.\n\nThough she stopped collecting her disability-related income, she continued to qualify for MaineCare until she lost it in August. The loss of health insurance coverage presented life-threatening consequences for Scott. How would she afford the medications she needs for her kidney?\n\nWithout MaineCare, she couldn\u2019t afford them. She was able to receive some assistance from the Kidney Foundation, but the foundation paid for a substitute medication. \u201cI just had to swap medications because I couldn\u2019t find anyone to cover [my previous prescription].\u201d\n\nShe is not certain yet whether the new medication is working properly because she has not been able to have the needed blood test to check that out.\n\nThat would involve seeing a doctor, and Scott had to stop going to the kidney specialist she has seen for years because she couldn\u2019t afford those services without MaineCare. \u201cI have a lot of fears, because I don\u2019t want to go back on a kidney machine,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I did it as long as I did. My kids were young, and I just needed to.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s two sons are grown now and have children of their own. She helps take care of her grandchildren and works 20 hours a week as a cook at a market in Richmond. She makes $8.75 per hour. She lives alone in a small, one-bedroom, rental house and struggles to make ends meet.\n\nMaintaining her health is the priority in Sheila\u2019s life, and losing MaineCare scared her \u2014 \u201cespecially after years of taking care of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t do drugs. I\u2019ve taken care of myself to keep this kidney.\u201d\n\nWithout coverage, Scott found herself neglecting other health care needs. \u201cMy knees have been swollen for two weeks now,\u201d she said recently before she found out her coverage would be reinstated. \u201cI see my primary care doctor on Thursday, but I couldn\u2019t afford to go to two [other] doctors and I don\u2019t even know if I can get x-rays or anything. You know, it is just the wrong timing. My condition is never going to get better, because of what I have.\u201d\n\nSome days, Scott had to miss work as her health has deteriorated. She knows this means a decrease in much-needed income but says, \u201cSince my leg\u2019s been bothering me, I had to call out because it hurt too much to be on it. I had worked Friday and Saturday, so I called out Sunday.\u201d When her boss asked her if she needed to stay home the following week, she said no, despite her ongoing pain. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to because I have meds to pay for next week, and there is no way to pay for them.\u201d\n\nScott also suffers from degenerative disc disease, type II diabetes, severe arthritis and cataracts. She has begun to look into getting disability benefits again, but for now she works at her physically demanding job.\n\nWithout MaineCare, Scott lived in fear of what would happen if she couldn\u2019t afford the medications and doctors\u2019 appointments she needs to maintain her health. \u201cBefore you do a transplant, make sure you have good insurance, because it is not easy,\u201d she warns others with kidney disease. \u201cMake sure you are going to be able to keep it, because you have to be on these meds for the rest of your life. You can\u2019t just stop them.\u201d\n\nScott still worries her MaineCare, while reinstated, won\u2019t last.\n\nIf Maine had accepted the federal funds to expand MaineCare this past year, Scott would not have gone without coverage. Maine can still accept the federal funds to close the \u201ccoverage gap\u201d so Scott and nearly 70,000 Maine people can gain coverage.\n\nScott said she hopes a new Legislature and governor will agree to accepting the federal funds following the Nov. 4 elections so she and many others in Maine can rest a little easier knowing they can access the health care they need to remain healthy, continue working and taking care of the children and grandchildren they love.\n\nSandy Butler is professor of social work and graduate program coordinator in the School of Social Work at the University of Maine.

Many of these 70,000 are not eligible for federal subsidies as they are below the federal poverty level. They fall in the so-called \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d\n\nThe Legislature passed bipartisan legislation to accept federal funding to close Maine\u2019s \u201ccoverage gap\u201d and expand Medicaid for people who can\u2019t afford health care coverage in the new marketplace. Gov. Paul LePage vetoed various versions of this legislation five times.\n\nNew Census data show the number of uninsured Mainers increased by 12,000 in 2013 and that Maine\u2019s uninsured rate rose to 11.2 percent from 10.2 percent in 2012. This is in sharp contrast with national trends where the uninsured rate fell by 0.2 percent during that same time.\n\nA July 2014 Urban Institute report found that overall, the ACA has helped states to experience a significant drop in uninsured rates.\n\nStudies also show that uninsured people generally receive much less care for acute and chronic health conditions and fewer preventive services and screenings, such as mammograms, pap smears, or prostate screening and that people without coverage often wait to seek health care until they are in need of more costly care.\n\nThe Maine Center for Economic Policy estimates that Maine\u2019s failure to accept federal money for Medicaid expansion is costing Maine\u2019s economy half a billion dollars each year, which could support over 4,000 jobs, ensure Mainers get the care they need from their family doctor, and save hospitals millions of dollars for care provided to the uninsured.\n\nAccepting federal funds to close the coverage gap in Maine makes good sense. Adults with insurance coverage are healthier and at lower risk for premature death than the uninsured. Recent studies of states that have accepted the federal funds show the amount of charity care provided by hospitals has substantially decreased in states that have expanded Medicaid while revenues have increased.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sheila Scott has lived in fear of kidney failure for 20 years.
