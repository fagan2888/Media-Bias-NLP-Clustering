On Thursday, Alabama became the third U.S. state in a week to withdraw funding from local branches of Planned Parenthood.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThousands of Americans have participated in rallies across the nation to urge their state and federal lawmakers to investigate and defund Planned Parenthood in the aftermath of the release of a series of recent gruesome videos showing the abortion provider\u2019s practice of harvesting the body parts of aborted babies for sale to biomedical companies.\n\nAlabama governor Robert Bentley wrote to the head of Planned Parenthood Southeast on August 6, informing her that his state\u2019s Medicaid agency is terminating is existing agreements with the Planned Parenthood affiliate.\n\nA statement from the governor said that the \u201cdeplorable practices at Planned Parenthood have been exposed to Americans, and I have decided to stop any association with the organization in Alabama,\u201d an expression he extended to his followers on Twitter.\n\nThe deplorable practices at Planned Parenthood have been exposed to Americans. I\u2019ve terminated any association with the organization in AL. \u2014 Gov. Robert Bentley (@GovernorBentley) August 6, 2015\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a doctor and Alabama\u2019s governor, the issue of human life, from conception to birth and beyond, is extremely important. I respect human life and do not want Alabama to be associated with an organization that does not,\u201d he said.\n\nCasey Mattox, a senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, lauded Bentley\u2019s decision: \u201cNot one more penny should go to Planned Parenthood, a billion-dollar abortion dealer caught on camera negotiating the sale of hearts, lungs, and livers from aborted babies. Governor Bentley should therefore be commended for ending the use of state taxpayer dollars for such barbarism.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur tax dollars instead should fund local public health clinics, which outnumber Planned Parenthood locations more than 10 to 1 and are not tainted by constant scandals and misdeeds. America doesn\u2019t need Planned Parenthood,\u201d Mattox said.\n\nThe other two states to defund Planned Parenthood this past week were New Hampshire and Louisiana.\n\nOn August 5, New Hampshire\u2019s Republican-controlled Executive Council voted 3-2 to deny the state\u2019s contract with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, against the objections of Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. The decision will remove $639,000 in state funding from the organization.\n\nThe Democratic governor has refused to launch investigations into Planned Parenthood\u2019s activities in New Hampshire, saying that such inquiries should not be conducted \u201con rumor.\u201d\n\nExecutive Councilor Chris Sununu, a Republican, voted to deny Planned Parenthood\u2019s contract, even though he supports legal abortion. Sununu said that \u201cfor some reason the Democrats seem to be going out of their way to find an excuse to keep Planned Parenthood around, and on the line and on contract. There are lots of other providers of these services out there. All I\u2019m saying is, let\u2019s go contract with them and use these other health care providers to make sure we are giving adequate choice to these women.\u201d\n\nOn August 3, Louisiana\u2019s health department under Governor Bobby Jindal ended its Medicaid provider contract with Planned Parenthood. Jindal stated that \u201cPlanned Parenthood does not represent the values of the people of Louisiana and shows a fundamental disrespect for human life. It has become clear that this is not an organization that is worthy of receiving public assistance from the state.\u201d\n\nJindal has also opened an investigation into Planned Parenthood\u2019s activities in Louisiana and sent a letter to both the Louisiana Inspector General and the F.B.I. asking them to assist in the investigation.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
