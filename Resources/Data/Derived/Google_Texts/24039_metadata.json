Inequality is dangerous, he argued, not merely because it\u2019s unseemly to have a large gap between the rich and the poor, but because inequality, itself, destroys upward mobility, making it harder for the poor to escape from poverty. \u201cIncreased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream,\u201d he said. Obama is only the most prominent public figure to declare inequality Public Enemy #1 and the greatest threat to reducing poverty in America. CAP\u2019s new Washington Center for Equitable Growth, Princeton economist Alan Krueger, and economist Miles Corak (with his famous Great Gatsby Curve) have all argued that it\u2019s harder for the poor to climb the economic ladder today because the rungs in that ladder have grown farther apart. In Krueger\u2019s words, countries like the United States with high inequality tend to have less upward mobility \u201cfor children from low-income families.\u201d\n\nBut for all the new attention devoted to the 1 percent, a new dataset from the Equality of Opportunity Project at Harvard and Berkeley suggests that, if we care about upward mobility overall, we\u2019re vastly exaggerating the dangers of the rich-poor gap. Inequality itself is not a particularly potent predictor of economic mobility, as sociologist Scott Winship noted in a recent article with his colleague Donald Schneider based on their analysis of this data. Why do we care so much about inequality? Is it to help the poor get ahead? If so, we should care much more about other factors. So what factors, at the community level, do predict if poor children will move up the economic ladder as adults? What explains, for instance, why the Salt Lake City metro area is one of the 100 largest metropolitan areas most likely to lift the fortunes of the poor and the Atlanta metro area is one of the least likely? Harvard economist Raj Chetty, a principal investigator at the Equality of Opportunity Project, has pointed to economic and racial segregation, community density, the size of a community\u2019s middle class, the quality of schools, community religiosity, and family structure, which he calls the \u201csingle strongest correlate of upward mobility.\u201d Chetty finds that communities like Salt Like City, with high levels of two-parent families and religiosity, are much more likely to see poor children get ahead than communities like Atlanta, with high levels of racial and economic segregation. Chetty has not yet issued a multivariate analysis of the project\u2019s data that compares the relative predictive power of each of these factors. Based on my OLS regression analyses of the data, of the factors that Chetty has highlighted, the following three seem to be most predictive of rags-to-riches mobility in a given community: Per-capita income growth Prevalence of single mothers (where correlation is strong, but negative) Per-capita local government spending In other words, communities with high levels of per-capita income growth, high percentages of two-parent families, and high local government spending\u2014which may be a proxy for good schools\u2014are the most likely to help poor children relive the Horatio Alger story. The following figures illustrate the relationship between each of these three factors and rags-to-riches mobility in the United States:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don\u2019t mind the rich-poor gap.
