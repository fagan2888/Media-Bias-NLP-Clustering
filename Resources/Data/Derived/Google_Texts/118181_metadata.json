The winning projects represent the outstanding examples of research projects that benefit the health and wellbeing of the general public.\n\nThe REDUCE MRSA trial found that using germ-killing soap and ointment on all intensive-care unit (ICU) patients can reduce bloodstream infections by up to 44 percent and significantly reduce the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A multidisciplinary team from the University of California, Irvine, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) carried out the study. A total of 74 adult ICUs and 74,256 patients were part of the study, making it the largest study on this topic to date.\n\nFor more information about the REDUCE MRSA trial, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/media/dpk/2013/dpk-mrsa-study.html.\n\nFor more information about the Clinical Research Forum Top 10 Clinical Research Achievement Awards, visit: http://www.clinicalresearchforum.org/index.asp?SEC=BDC805A5-CF89-466B-BA25-59EB3F79CF39&Type=B_BASIC.", "article_metadata": {"vpi-date": "2014-04-10", "description": "The Clinical Research Forum has selected the REDUCE MRSA trial as one of the winners of its third annual Top 10 Clinical Research Achievement Awards.
