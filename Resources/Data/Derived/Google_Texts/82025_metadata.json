It was extremely negative and feeds into the right-wing racist views that responsible journalists should be trying to dispel, not feed.\n\nHow about covering some of Paul Krugman's columns from the New York Times or covering his recent article in Rolling Stone? Although Krugman is often critical of Obama, this Nobel Prize-winning economist has stated that he views President Obama as one of the most consequential and successful presidents in history.\n\nIt is lazy journalism to fill your paper with trash talk and a sure way to lose readership.
