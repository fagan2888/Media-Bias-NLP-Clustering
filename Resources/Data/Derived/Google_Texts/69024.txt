WESTMINSTER — A security guard assigned to a Westminster apartment complex shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at him, police said Saturday. It happened at about 1:25 a.m. at the Sunset Ridge Apartments at 8300 Sheridan Blvd.

Johnny Secrest said his cousin was confronted by the security guard while urinating next to a dumpster in the complex’s parking lot.

He said the security guard followed them back to their apartment while threatening to use pepper spray on them. When they got to their unit, Secrest said his cousin, 24-year-old David Ludewig, walked in and came back out with an airsoft gun.

Family members told Channel 4 and Channel 9 that Ludewig was celebrating news that his wife was pregnant with his first child.
