BOSTON (AP) — Former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis has received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for reversing his position on climate change despite the political fallout that cost him his seat in Congress.

Inglis received the honor Sunday at the JFK Library and Museum in Boston from Kennedy’s grandson, Jack Schlossberg. He praised Inglis’ “decision to sacrifice his political career to demand action on the issue that will shape life on earth for generations to come.”

The South Carolina Republican, a member of the House Science Committee and ranking member of its Energy and Environment Subcommittee, had opposed legislation on climate change, but later advocated for a carbon tax to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. He then lost the 2010 primary.

Inglis represented South Carolina’s 4th Congressional District from 1993 to 1998 and 2005 to 2010.
