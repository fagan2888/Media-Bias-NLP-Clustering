And like other executives at CCHP \u2014 which traditionally serves about 15,000 members of San Francisco\u2019s ethnically Chinese community \u2014 Cho has been ambitiously working to grow the plan\u2019s business by one-third this year.\n\n\u201cOur exchange target enrollment through the end of March 2014 Open Enrollment Period is +4,950,\u201d Cho told California Healthline via email back in December.\n\nBut when \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d checked in with Cho this week, he said that number didn\u2019t apply anymore; CCHP needs to come up with a new one. That\u2019s because the plan had received 5,036 applications as of last week, the halfway point of the enrollment period.\n\n\u201cOur sales manager just beat his annual goal,\u201d Cho joked.\n\nSmall Plans Often Edged Out\n\nCCHP\u2019s early, obvious success is testament to Covered California\u2019s potential to drive improvements in access and coverage, especially by introducing new market competitors.\n\nBut for other small health plans \u2014 who were hoping the insurance exchange would be a vehicle to pick up new members\u2013 it hasn\u2019t been a smooth ride.\n\nOne small health plan dropped out. Another was kicked out. And a third is openly hunting for business.\n\nThat\u2019s in sharp contrast to the experience of the four largest plans on the exchange \u2014 Anthem, Blue Cross, Health Net, and Kaiser \u2014 which are hoovering up new members, based on the most recent data available.\n\nAbout 96% of Covered California customers are picking among the \u201cbig four\u201d plans, according to a \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d analysis of October and November enrollment figures. (Based on off-the-record interviews with several health plan officials, a similar trend continued through December).\n\nExchange officials take issue with that characterization. \u201cWhile the majority of enrollment across the state is in four plans, it\u2019s different when you look region by region,\u201d Executive Director Peter Lee said in December.\n\nHowever, a region-by-region look shows that\u2019s not true. \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d analysis reveals that those four plans commanded 100% of sign-ups in nine of Covered California\u2019s 19 regions, and captured at least 95% of market share in seven other regions.\n\nThe only exceptions:\n\nRegion 4 \u2014 San Francisco County \u2014 where the big four has 78% of the market, and CCHP has carved out the remaining 22%;\n\nRegion 8 \u2014 San Mateo County \u2014 where CCHP has 8% of the market; and\n\nRegion 19 \u2014 San Diego County \u2014 where Sharp Health Plan, which is offering policies on the individual market for the first time, has 10% of new sign-ups.\n\nWhat Gives These Plans an Edge?\n\nA range of factors is driving consumer interest, executives at both CCHP and Sharp Health Plan say. And they stress that they\u2019re still mulling the causes even as new enrollment data come in. But to some extent, the simplest explanations may be the right ones.\n\nCCHP\u2019s Price, Tailored Offering\n\nIn the case of CCHP, while the plan may not be well-known beyond San Francisco\u2019s ethnically Chinese community, it\u2019s offering some of the most competitive rates in the state, and maybe the nation.\n\nChristina LaMontagne \u2014 vice president of health at NerdWallet, a consumer analytics service that offers a popular Obamacare Plan Finder tool \u2014 points to one chart showing that in the San Francisco area, the average uninsured 27-year-old can get a Bronze plan for $4 per month from CCHP. That\u2019s miles ahead of the plan\u2019s nearest competitors.\n\nAnd based on NerdWallet data, CCHP is the only non-Big Four plan listed as the \u201cleast expensive\u201d plan available in its region.\n\n\u201cOur price advantage is crazy,\u201d Cho concedes. He notes that CCHP comes by its advantage based on actuarial data drawn from its existing members and efficiencies running its current HMO model. And some new customers, perhaps 20%, will sign up with the plan based solely on its low rates.\n\nYet there\u2019s also a nuanced explanation, Cho notes. CCHP historically has been crowded out by some of the larger plans \u2014 when employers offered coverage to their workers, they would tend to contract with insurers like Kaiser, for example. But the exchange has made CCHP more broadly available to customers who may have been previously locked out.\n\nCCHP is well-positioned to capitalize on its unique features: There are more than 180,000 ethnically Chinese residents of the San Francisco area who aren\u2019t members of CCHP and might be interested in a plan better catered to their language needs and traditional popularity of therapies like acupuncture, Cho says.\n\n(KQED\u2019s \u201cState of Health\u201d blog offers useful details on CCHP\u2019s marketing strategy and attempts to go beyond its traditional customer base.)\n\nSharp\u2019s Brand Equity\n\nMeanwhile, Sharp Health Plan\u2019s success story can\u2019t be due only to its rates \u2014 which are competitive, but are basically in line with the San Diego market. Instead, its promising debut on Covered California is likely driven by its strong regional brand presence.\n\nAlthough the two-decade-old plan is new to the individual market, it\u2019s already familiar to many San Diego residents; the plan serves 70,000 members in its commercial book of business, CEO Melissa Hayden-Cook told California Healthline.\n\nAn added advantage: The health plan\u2019s parent company, Sharp HealthCare, is the largest private employer in San Diego and caters to almost one-third of the market through its integrated delivery system.\n\nPlan executives say there was built-in interest waiting for them, too. \u201cThere has long been a demand for an individual product from Sharp Health Plan, and Covered California provides a great opportunity for us to enter that market and serve the community,\u201d Hayden-Cook told California Healthline by email. And \u201cwe believe that the brand equity we have built up in the community over the years has really paid off during this enrollment period.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\nSince Covered California\u2019s customers began signing up on Oct.\u00c2\u00ad 1, 2013, both CCHP and Sharp Health Plan have essentially held steady in capturing market share in the regions they serve. And if present trends continue, that means both plans could pick up several thousand additional members before open enrollment ends in March.\n\nBut Sharp Health Plan executives say they\u2019re already pleased with their sign-up numbers \u2014 although perhaps any figure would do.\n\n\u201cWe did not have a concrete enrollment goal for the first year of the program,\u201d Sharp\u2019s Hayden-Cook said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe [anyone] could accurately predict what enrollment would be given the unknowns about health care reform.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s making news as the nation continues down the road to reform.\n\nThanks, Obamacare?
