Robert Hurt\n\n\n\n\n\nTickle doesn\u2019t fit in politically with either party. \u201cI can\u2019t agree with everything on both sides and they tend to frown upon you when you don\u2019t agree with all of their views,\u201d he said.\n\nTake Obamacare. He believes Americans should have access to health care, but not a system that lets federal officials opted out. \u201cAny health care plan that tells government officials, \u2018You know this is crap, you don\u2019t have to take it, just vote on it,\u2019 I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d said Tickle. \u201cWhy not give our American people the very best health care we can?\u201d\n\nHe also said he wouldn\u2019t be afraid of people looking into his checkered past which includes a recent arrest for public intoxication. \u201cThere is no dirt to dig up, everybody already knows about me,\u201d he cheered.\n\nThe Moonshiners co-star would be the first rural reality show star to run for Congress. Some GOP insiders tried to get \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Willie Robertson to run, but he turned them down.\n\nHis new show is on at 9 p.m. on Tuesdays, and Tickle calls it a reality comedy.\n\nOf course Tickle said he would give up the show and making moonshine if elected, but he would make his first priority passing legislation to legalize the depression-era hooch. He even plans to start a \u201cMoonshine Caucus,\u201d which he said would put the popular \u201cBourbon Caucus,\u201d made up of Tennessee and Kentucky lawmakers, out of business.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s ever had good moonshine and who\u2019s had bourbon, would rather drink the moonshine,\u201d he said with pride.\n\nPaul Bedard, The Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at pbedard@washingtonexaminer.com.\n\nWhile he lives in the heart of Tea Party country, represented by conservative Republican Rep. Robert Hurt, Tickle is a union carpenter who would run as an independent.
