Can we stop overpopulation before it does us in like it did Easter Island?\n\n\u201cOverpopulation leads to famine, desertification, shocking inequalities between rich and poor nations, unconscionable waste and devastation of irreplaceable resources, deforestation, increasingly rapid extinctions of species, decrease(s) in biodiversity, (increases in) global warming, and (the) pollution of our oceans and freshwater,\u201d Jacqes-Yves Cousteau said in a 1992 speech at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe words of the famous explorer and conservationist are well on their way to becoming reality. Global warming and the pollution of our oceans are scientifically documented as a result of overpopulation.\n\nWhy have we evaded the problem? Its solutions are not simple. There are extremely strong beliefs and opinions by people who find the most-obvious potential solutions most difficult, even as dire circumstances increase. But do strategies for population control \u2014 specifically birth control, abortion, and immigration \u2014 have to be so difficult? We have to slow population growth. There are now more than 7 billion people and counting on Mother Earth. We\u2019ve known of this need for some time, but the manners to reduce population offend individual choice and/or religion.\n\nChina took major action in 1980 with its one-child policy. Demographers estimate the policy averted at least 200 million births between 1979 and 2009. It seems most unlikely the U.S. would \u2014 or could \u2014 pass such a law, but we still need to reduce the poverty birth rate.\n\nThe April 18-24 issue of the Economist magazine reported, \u201cLong-acting contraceptives make it easier for the poor to escape from poverty.\u201d\n\nAlan Weismann, the author of \u201cCountdown,\u201d said in a speech last year that, \u201cEight billion dollars annually would provide contraceptives for everyone on Earth who wants them.\u201d Compare that with our military expenditures. A two-child policy would be worthy of consideration.\n\nAfter contraceptives, as much as it is disliked, abortion is a necessity. No one takes it lightly; but unless an unborn child has parents awaiting its arrival with support for years of upbringing, is allowing the child to be born a reasonable gamble? Is it moral, given the child is unwanted and the parents are unprepared and unwilling? Can we mouth \u201cpro-life,\u201d given the realities of what\u2019s sure to come?\n\nLeaving a pregnant female without abortion rights, while the impregnator goes scot free, is another societal issue that needs correction. Why have female rights been so late in arrival? Let\u2019s be the great country we claim to be. As was written in the Economist, \u201cWhat we believed to be true \u2026 we know for certain now; we cannot get ahead by leaving half our population behind.\u201d\n\nIn addition, immigration must be controlled. We have too many border miles. Innumerable border guards and fences sky high would be needed to secure it all. One rule would suffice, since the new immigrants work cheap. The new law would dictate that employers hiring workers without valid citizenship documentation be subject to 30 days in jail. No ifs, ands and buts. Stop allowing foreign-visitor visas for immigration-worker purposes. We should freeze foreign aid to nations that won\u2019t cooperate.\n\nIf we continue to ignore our population problems and overuse nature\u2019s resources, Mother Nature will control our population \u2014 brutally and totally, as she did with Easter Island.\n\nBernie Hughes of Superior is professor emeritus of educational administration at the University of Wisconsin-Superior.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "opinion,local view,editorials,Local view,columns", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Duluth News Tribune", "description": "By evaluating Easter Island\u2019s demise, we can see the threat of overpopulation in today\u2019s world, especially if we continue with present practices.
