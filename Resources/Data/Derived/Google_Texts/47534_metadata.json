(bigstock/bigstock)\n\nLibbi Stovall couldn\u2019t believe it last month when she looked at the fine print in her company\u2019s 2016 health plan, which supposedly meets the strictest standard for employer obligations under Affordable Care Act rules.\n\nThe insurance paid for inpatient hospital care, office visits and diagnostic imaging. But it provided no coverage for outpatient surgery, which accounts for two out of every three operations in the nation, according to hospital industry data.\n\n\u201cI knew their policy would not give my family the coverage we need,\u201d said Stovall, 52, who lives in Carrollton, Tex., and has a history of back problems, including outpatient surgery in 2014 to remove a cyst. Her doctor, she added, said that \u201cI absolutely have to be on an insurance plan that covers both outpatient and inpatient hospitalization.\u201d\n\nWorse for her, being offered such a plan through her workplace, an international staffing firm called Open Systems Technologies, barred Stovall from federal subsidies to buy more comprehensive coverage in online insurance marketplaces.\n\nHer experience illustrates the latest chapter in the story of employers and insurance designers pushing the limits of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLast year regulators blocked companies with millions of lower-wage workers from claiming that coverage with no inpatient hospital benefits met the Affordable Care Act\u2019s strictest standard for large employers.\n\nNow that those \u201cskinny plans\u201d aren\u2019t allowed, insurance administrators and many cost-conscious employers are purporting to meet the rules with a new version that excludes another major category: outpatient surgery. The new plans may not survive regulatory scrutiny any more than the old ones did, some experts say.\n\n\u201cI really wonder whether they can do that,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia who is an authority on the health law. \u201cRefusing to cover any outpatient physician surgical services is arguably a violation.\u201d\n\nOutpatient surgeries \u2014 those without an overnight hospital stay \u2014 happen in a hospital or a freestanding surgery center. Hernia repairs, knee replacements or bone fracture repairs are typical. They normally cost less than an inpatient operation but can still come to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nLeaving such procedures out of a plan can save money for employers but leave workers with crippling bills.\n\nLarge employers are not required to offer a list of \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d unlike insurers that sell insurance to individuals and small businesses through online marketplaces. Instead, large employers must offer minimum value \u2014 roughly comparable to that of a high-deductible, \u201cbronze\u201d marketplace plan \u2014 as determined by an online calculator and regulatory guidance, or face a penalty. There is also a lesser standard for large employers \u2014 \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d \u2014 that triggers different fines for noncompliance. But nearly all workplace-based plans that offer some types of preventive care meet this requirement.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that hospitalization had to be covered\u201d by large employers after regulators ruled in February that skinny plans lacking inpatient benefits did not meet minimum value, said Anne Lennan, president of the Society of Professional Benefit Administrators, a trade group for claims processors. \u201cBut then the question was, \u2018How much?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor 2016, insurance lacking outpatient surgery benefits has been marketed primarily to staffing companies, hoteliers and other lower-wage employers that had historically never provided major medical coverage. Those are the same firms that were sponsoring skinny coverage a year ago, industry consultants say.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many companies said yes for this year, although last year about half the 1,600 corporate members of the American Staffing Association were interested in the plans with no inpatient coverage. The trade group didn\u2019t conduct a similar study for the latest skinny plans, said senior counsel Edward Lenz.\n\nMore than 30 employers working with EBSO, a Minnesota-based benefits company, have implemented 2016 minimum-value plans that cover inpatient hospitalization but not outpatient surgery, said President Bruce Flunker.\n\nJFC Staffing, based in Camp Hill, Pa., offered a skinny plan lacking outpatient surgery benefits to nearly 700 eligible employees this year, said Cathy Reichelderfer, the company\u2019s chief financial officer\n\nJFC struggled with simultaneously conforming to Affordable Care Act rules, offering coverage that wouldn\u2019t break the budget and giving workers insurance they wanted, she said.\n\n\u201cAs an employer, we want to do the right thing,\u201d she said. On one hand, offering a minimum-value plan means \u201cpotentially somebody losing their subsidy\u201d to buy alternative coverage in the marketplaces, she said. On the other hand, overpaying for insurance or offering no insurance \u2014 and subjecting JFC to fines \u2014 could wipe out hundreds of jobs \u201cbecause we can\u2019t stay in business,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is the second year under the health law that large employers must offer affordable, minimum-value coverage or face penalties of up to $3,000 per worker\n\nTemp companies, restaurants and others that never offered major medical coverage before are \u201ccertainly keen to minimize this cost,\u201d said Kevin Schlotman, vice president of employee benefits at Benovation, an Ohio consultant.\n\nFor many workers at such employers, even plans lacking inpatient benefits or outpatient surgery \u2014 but paying for office visits, emergency-room care and prescriptions\u2014 are a significant improvement, say consultants selling them.\n\nOST, Stovall\u2019s employer, offered a minimum-value plan for 2016 without outpatient surgery benefits that is designed and administered by Key Benefit Administrators, one of the country\u2019s largest independent claims-processing firms. KBA was one of the leading promoters of last year\u2019s skinny plans.\n\nAfter Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post wrote about those policies in 2014, federal regulators issued clarifying rules saying that large-employer plans must provide \u201csubstantial coverage of inpatient hospital and physician services\u201d to qualify as minimum value. The debate now is whether \u201csubstantial coverage\u201d of \u201cphysician services\u201d includes outpatient surgery.\n\nNot surprisingly, the American Hospital Association \u201cis deeply concerned\u201d about plans that exclude it, a spokeswoman said.\n\nNew York-based OST, which says it is one of the largest privately held staffing firms in the world, declined to comment, as did Key Benefit Administrators\u2019 general counsel Wallace Gray. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on specific plans.\n\nLibbi Stovall turned down OST\u2019s minimum value plan and bought insurance on Healthcare.gov that covers both inpatient care and outpatient surgery.\n\n\u201cI fear that other contracting companies are giving their employees the same substandard insurance coverage,\u201d she said. \u201cI am standing up for these people, because I don\u2019t want to see anyone go bankrupt\u201d from uncovered medical bills.\n\nHancock works for Kaiser Health News, a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.
