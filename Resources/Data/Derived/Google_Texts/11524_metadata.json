That\u2019s what we have today.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line on all this: A lot of things have to be done, but you gotta do the big three,\u201d Forbes said.\n\nForbes also promoted his newly released book, \u201cReviving America: How Repealing Obamacare, Replacing the Tax Code and Reforming the Fed Will Restore Hope and Prosperity.\u201d\n\nForbes said his book is meant to \u201cinform citizens in a very straightforward, understandable way so that they can become advocates and educators, because oftentimes candidates learn from the questions they get from citizens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"You gotta do the big three,\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"You gotta do the big three,\u201d", "title": "3 Areas Steve Forbes Thinks We Should Tackle to Revive USA", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160224_SteveForbes2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-29T11:18:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1n2nqUF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"You gotta do the big three,\u201d", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160224_SteveForbes2.jpg"}, "title": "3 Areas Steve Forbes Thinks We Should Tackle to Revive USA", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "Opp4All", "published_time": "2016-02-26T17:36:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-29T11:18:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "steve forbes, reviving america, book, health care, economy, monetary policy, Federal Reserve, flat tax, Heritage Foundation"}, "article_summary": "Addressing tax, health care, and monetary policy is key to ensuring America\u2019s economic future, says Steve Forbes, chairman of Forbes Media.\n\u201cYou can literally [file your taxes with] a single piece of paper, a few keystrokes on your computer,\u201d Forbes said.\n\u201cWhen you have an unstable currency, since it is the basis of all our interactions, it undermines social trust,\u201d Forbes said.\n\u201cThe bottom line on all this: A lot of things have to be done, but you gotta do the big three,\u201d Forbes said.\n\u201cWhy waste both massive resources and our best brains on such a stupid, dead-weight, unnecessary activity?\u201d Forbes asked rhetorically, to applause from the crowd."}
