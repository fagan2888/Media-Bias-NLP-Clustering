Although neither party has confirmed or denied the allegations, Haqq appears to be attempting to remain positive amid the allegations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHours after MediaTakeOut.com released a report regarding the cheating allegations, Haqq took to Instagram to post this message:\n\n\"We cannot change our past...We cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one thing we have, and that is our attitude.\"\n\nDespite a source confirming to the site that the flirty texts were the result of Montana and Kardashian's split, a new source reveals that it's unlikely that reality star would forego her longtime friendship with Haqq over a short-term dating relationship.\n\n\"Khloe has been down with Malika since forever. They have the kind of friendship that even if Malika was f------- Khloe's man, they'd still be friends,\" the insider admitted. \"Besides, I don't think Khloe was into [French Montana] like that.\"\n\n\n\nSIGN UP TO RECEIVE THE LATEST NEWS FROM FASHION&STYLE\n\n\u00a9 2015 Fashion & Style.com All rights reserved.
