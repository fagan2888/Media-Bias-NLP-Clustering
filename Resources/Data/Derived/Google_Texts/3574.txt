Re: “Many Colorado schools still failing after years, millions of dollars,” Feb. 21 news story.

I’m happy to see that education concerns are finally making the front page. However, I think there is a bigger funding issue for Colorado schools that should be on the front page.

Earlier this month, the Colorado legislature killed a bill that would fund all-day kindergarten statewide. As it is now, only half-day kindergarten is state-funded. So only families that can afford to pay tuition for their child are able to get a full day of kindergarten education in the public school system.

These are the pre-Common Core children whose curriculum was changed mid-education, without any additional funding provided by the state to purchase new textbooks and science supplies that are necessary to teach the altered curriculum. There is a lack of funding for teacher training in this critical time, when we have changed their teaching requirements. We need fully funded kindergarten, ongoing state-funded teacher training for core curriculum, and provision of supplies (including textbooks and science kits) before we will see educational success.
