Healthcare.gov would use Jekyll, a widely used tool for building sleek and fast websites, and the software code underpinning the site would be released on GitHub, the social coding site where you can let anyone fix problems with your software.\n\nBut things didn\u2019t quite work out as planned. After the site went live on October 1, it was buggy, as millions sought new healthcare plans. And then, in a move that symbolizes its inability to completely grasp the new tech status quo, the federal government put the kibosh on the GitHub repository where much of the site\u2019s code was housed.\n\nBut ultimately, outside coders showed the federal government just how powerful open source code can be.\n\nBy all accounts, the Development Seed code performed as expected when Healthcare.gov finally went live, but other back-end components didn\u2019t do so well. Users reported problems with the systems used to register accounts on the site \u2014 WIRED attempted to register an account on the site Monday night; our two attempts failed thanks to a glitch in the account activation process \u2014 and as the complaints piled up, angry users went to the one public venue that the government had provided to report problems: the healthcare.gov source code repository on GitHub.\n\nInstead of using GitHub to report issues with the source code that had been released, they started to vent about bugs in the closed-source code that ran the site\u2019s back-end. \u201cActual plans and rates are hidden behind an application process that literally takes 5 days to complete,\u201d wrote one user who went on to detail a litany of glitches. \u201cSeriously, this is the worst, most frustrating web experience I have ever had. Ever. And I started browsing the Web using NCSA Mosaic.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Clay Johnson \u2018It makes me think that anytime the government puts code into GitHub, someone should go fork it, just in case.\n\nBy Monday, things had become so bad that President Barack Obama held a press conference to discuss the problems. \u201cNo one is madder than me that the website is not working as well as it should \u2014 which means it\u2019s gonna get fixed,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the complaints piled up, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which manages the site simply shut down the entire GitHub repository without explanation. According to them, they did this because people were confused about the difference between the front-end and back-end systems and the issues that people were raising on GitHub was only adding to the confusion. From the perspective of the open-source community, it was exactly the wrong thing to do.\n\n\u201cBy removing the GitHub repository, they removed from view any surface area by which they might communicate to interested developers what the actual situation was,\u201d says Karl Fogel, an open-source technology consultant who works with government agencies. \u201cInstead they just took it down so there\u2019s this blank space leaving everyone speculating and assuming the worst.\u201d\n\nBut they couldn\u2019t erase the code from the web. Fogel and several other GitHub users have now built their own \u201cforks\u201d of the Development Seed software \u2014 something that GitHub and open source let you do so easily. And now anyone can once again propose changes or comment on the website. They\u2019ll just be commenting or coding for Karl Fogel, or another forker like him.\n\nThe government isn\u2019t going to use these forks, although they may look at them. They\u2019re more likely to simply restore their own repository on GitHub when things cool down. But that isn\u2019t the point. \u201cI wanted to preserve the code-base on GitHub and have it be forkable on GitHub just as matter of principle,\u201d Fogel says. \u201cIt\u2019s really there as an admonition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the great part about open source, you can never take it back,\u201d says Clay Johnson, the founder of Blue State Digital, the company that Built Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign website. Last year, he spent six months as a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow, where he got an insider\u2019s look at technology in the federal government. \u201cIt makes me think that anytime the government puts code into GitHub, someone should go fork it, just in case.\u201d\n\nStill, while Johnson agrees that the government removing its own GitHub repository was a bad move, he says it must have been hard to have been the one open-source component in this project. \u201cI think that if you or I were in their shoes over the past weeks, we might be making some irrational and erratic decisions too.\u201d\n\nThe federal government\u2019s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services declined to comment directly on the Healthcare.gov issues, but when we asked a spokeswoman there how people should report technical issues with the site, she gave an answer that once again shined a harsh light on the problem.\n\nShe said they should give Obamacare\u2019s 800 number a call.
