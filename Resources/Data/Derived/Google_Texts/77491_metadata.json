Historically, competitive market economies are a relatively new economic system, and while very productive, they are not self-sustaining, are unstable and require significant state support and regulation to function properly.\n\nNevertheless, self-regulating market economies are superior to other political-economic systems\u2014such as dictatorial fascism or autocratic communism\u2014however, the state can mismanage them.\n\nHistory of Market Economies\n\nMarket economies are nonexistent during primitive times, and even during feudal times, markets trade local goods and remain small, with no tendency to grow. External foreign markets carry only specialty items\u2014such as spices, salted fish and wine. Foreign trade does not begin in feudal societies, between individuals, but is only sanctioned by civic leaders\u2014between whole communities.\n\nDuring feudal times, markets for local community goods do not mix with markets for goods that come from afar. Local and external foreign markets differ in size, origin and function\u2014are strictly segregated, and neither market is permitted to enter the countryside.\n\nFeudal society transitions into the mercantile society of the 16th to late 18th centuries, where the state monopolizes the economic system, for the state\u2019s benefit. Colonies are forbidden to trade with other countries, and workers\u2019 wages are restricted. However, mercantilism proves divisive; fostering imperialism, colonialism and many wars between the Great Powers. Market economies have yet to arrive, and would not do so until after 1790.\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, production processes transition from hand crafting methods that supply only the local community, into mechanized manufacturing; thereby vastly increasing production, driving down costs and increasing wealth. The source of a person\u2019s income is now the result of product sales to far-off, unknown customers. Private business entrepreneurs are the driving force pushing the state to institute the market economy, thereby protecting the sale of their goods in far-off lands.\n\nUnfortunately, in practice, market economies result in corporate monopolies. Corporations may use a product dumping predatory pricing strategy, by charging less than their cost to produce, in a specific market, in order to drive weaker, smaller competitors out of business, and then significantly raise prices at a later date, in order to gouge the consumer. If the monopoly is in a vital economic area and the company institutes monopoly pricing to overcharge the consumer, only the state has the power to protect the market economy from monopolistic inefficiencies and break up the offending company; thus reinstituting competitive pricing. As a result, government regulations and market economies develop simultaneously.\n\nLaws & Regulations Are Necessary\n\nLeaving business a free hand, especially when dealing with far off customers, leads to misrepresentations, shoddy practices and fraud. The food industry is an example.\n\nUpton Sinclair writes The Jungle (1906), exposing the disgusting unsanitary conditions in the Chicago meatpacking industry, during the early 20th century. Public uproar prompts President Theodore Roosevelt to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the Meat Inspection Act. Roosevelt says that government laws and regulations are the only way to restrain the arrogant and selfish greed of the capitalist system.\n\nShocking examples of food fraud in 2013 highlight the need for enforcing government regulations. Inspectors uncover corporations selling horse meat as beef, and routinely mislabeling about 40% of the fish served in U.S. restaurants. Cheap rockfish and tilapia are substituted and sold as expensive snapper, and restaurateurs frequently switch escolar for white tuna, causing diners to suffer indigestion.\n\nOver 70% of the tilapia sold in the U.S. is imported from Asia, and only 2% is inspected by the Food and Drug Administration. Much of this Asian farm raised tilapia is \u201cfilthy fish,\u201d where pesticides and manure run off into the tilapia raising ponds, causing infections. Or the tilapia is raised in polluted Asian rivers. Americans are impairing their health by unknowingly eating filthy Asian tilapia, fraudulently substituted in U.S. restaurants for the healthy fish ordered.\n\nOther fraudulently mislabeled foods include sausage, organic foods, energy drinks, milk and eggs. Without sanitary food preparation standards, set and fairly enforced by the government\u2014Americans will soon return to naively eating rat droppings\u2014so, unknown to them, CEOs can meet Wall Street earnings expectations.\n\nDepartments of Weights and Measures (DWMs) at the state and federal level develop \u201cuniform laws, regulations and methods of practice\u201d that impact about 50% of U.S. GDP\u2014to ensure there is equity between buyers and sellers in commercial transactions.\n\nBecause gasoline stations routinely pumped less gas then charged for, DWMs now ensure the accuracy of gasoline pumps, octane levels, labeling and restricting water in gasoline. Butchers used to add lead weights to the chest cavity of the poultry sold, prior to weighing, then noiselessly dumped the weights out into an unseen padded draw before the bird was held up for the customer\u2019s inspection, thereby swindling their trusting patrons.\n\nWithout the state to step in to punish fraudulent wrongdoers, dishonest business practices would be widespread. Consumer trust, in everyday market transactions, is paramount for market economies to function effectively and efficiently\u2014making government regulations vitally important.\n\nWithout regulation and transparency, bad businesses drive out good businesses, following Gresham\u2019s Law. The economic system then atrophies, with a loss of trust in the marketplace. What is lost is not just the money on an inferior product or service, in the short run, but more importantly, the bad businesses may use their outsized profits to buy political protection and start changing laws, to make new laws favorable only for them\u2014thereby damaging the market economy and reducing the state\u2019s economic growth and welfare.\n\nCompetitive Market Economies\n\nAn economic market system capable of directing the whole of economic life, without out-side help or interference, is called self-regulating. Once the self-regulating or competitive market economy is designed and implemented by the state, to give all participants an equal opportunity for success, the self-regulating market is to be let alone by the state and allowed to function according to laws and regulations, without after-the-fact government intrusions\u2014regardless of the expected consequences.\n\nThose in Western societies are told that competitive market economies, which have self-regulated prices for land, labor and money, set solely by the market, are normal, and that human beings develop market economies on their own, without help from the state, which is the proof of human progress. Also, that market institutions will arise naturally and spontaneously, if only persons are left alone to pursue their economic interests, free from government control. This is incorrect.\n\nThroughout most of human history, self-regulating markets are unnatural and exceptional. Human beings are forced into the self-regulating market economy, by the state. Look at the following false competitive market economy assumptions.\n\nWe are told people naturally bartered goods. Actually, human beings, down through history, have no predilection to barter. Social anthropology says that assuming tribal and feudal men and women bartered are rationalist constructs, with no basis in fact. Market economies are the result of often violent government directives, implemented for society\u2019s eventual improvement.\n\nThe assumption is man is a trader by nature, and that any different human behavior is an artificial economic construct. By not interfering in human behavior, markets will spring up spontaneously. Social anthropology disproves this.\n\nNeoliberal Economic Theory\n\nOriginally, neoliberal economic theory means, \u201cfree enterprise, competitive markets, the priority of the market price setting mechanism, and a strong and impartial state\u2014to ensure it all functions properly.\u201d\n\nThe Mont Pelerin Society, led by Dr. Milton Friedman, supports Hayek\u2019s economic theories, based on \u201cfree market\u201d ideology and help change neoliberal economic theory by rejecting government regulation\u2014calling it inefficient. In addition, financial economists at the University of Chicago School of Business promote the efficient market hypothesis or theory (EMT), supporting the Mont Pelerin Society\u2019s conjecture. Thus, the primacy of deregulated or \u201cfree markets\u201d becomes mainstream within academe in the 1970s. Large corporations then use \u201cfree market fundamentalism\u201d to their advantage, by lobbying the U.S. Congress to pass legislation beneficial to them.\n\nSome think that \u201cfree markets\u201d are a matter of degree, and the practical issues of implementation are paramount. This is incorrect, and will not resolve the current \u201cfree market fundamentalism\u201d debate. Instead, the real issue is semantics. Notice how quickly those with a political agenda change the debate from \u201ccompetitive markets,\u201d which require state regulations and are highly productive\u2014to \u201cfree markets,\u201d which result in fraudulent marketplace behavior, crony capitalism and weak economic growth.\n\nUsing the term \u201cfree markets\u201d is an Orwellian ruse, designed to change the focus in the public\u2019s mind from, \u201cthose in authority have to do better\u201d to \u201cthose in authority know best, therefore, let them have their way.\u201d\n\nToday, neoliberal economic dogma promotes \u201cfree market fundamentalism\u201d of reducing the size of government through the privatization of government services, deregulation and globalization. Privatization professes to reduce the state\u2019s authority over the economy, but state money is used by private companies to lobby legislators, to change laws, which will increase the government\u2019s demand for these same private corporation services. Privatization of government services by corporations does not promote the common good, only corporations\u2019 private profits.\n\nNeoliberal \u201cfree market\u201d economists have doubled down on the failed liberal economic theory, with the ongoing 2008 credit crisis as the result.\n\nFree Markets Are Impractical\n\n\u201cFree markets\u201d are free from state intervention, i.e., unfettered capitalism. Those who understand how markets function realize this is an impractical view\u2014simply a rhetorical device\u2014using the popular word \u201cfreedom\u201d to mask its real purpose.\n\n\u201cFree markets\u201d are a fantasy, far outside the realm of practicality, used by wealthy international corporations to bully governments and labor, to get their way. The reality is a competitive market economy requires powerful complex opposing interests, mediated by government, to produce an efficient and effective economy that supplies the most to the many, which includes the common good.\n\nFree Market Fundamentalism Leads To Economic Disaster\n\nNowhere is \u201cfree market fundamentalism\u201d more highly trumpeted by neoliberal economists than in the financial markets. The foundation of neoliberalism is, \u201ca deregulated financial sector will regulate itself efficiently, making better use of capital, thus ushering in a new age of prosperity.\u201d\n\nTragically, the massive deregulation of the financial markets during the Clinton and Bush presidencies, results in the ongoing 2008 credit crisis\u2014which the U.S. Government Accountability Office reports has cost the U.S. economy about $13 trillion dollars in lost GDP output.\n\n\u201cFree market\u201d apologists ingenuously explain the 2008 credit crisis is not caused by \u201cfree markets,\u201d but because government regulations are not loose enough. All \u201cfree market\u201d failures are dismissed by the financial elite, because of cognitive dissonance. Bankers and neoliberal economists want to believe in what is making them richer and more important. This is the same logic used by those in charge in the USSR, when communism failed, \u201cit wasn\u2019t being applied purely enough.\u201d\n\nFree Market Ideology in Practice\n\n\u201cFree market,\u201d ideology, as practiced today, is the opposite of what is stated. Instead, governments step in to save insolvent banks and large international corporations, when they make bankrupting mistakes, and give the bill to the taxpayer. This transforms the difficult but manageable ongoing 2008 credit crisis, into a much larger and dangerous sovereign bankruptcy crisis, with potentially calamitous political consequences.\n\n\u201cFree markets\u201d usher in unfettered capitalism, unleashing the \u201claw of the jungle\u201d and a \u201cdog-eat-dog world\u201d that fosters fraud and corruption. Human beings, no matter their station in life, cannot be trusted to always do the right thing, especially in a competitive situation. Doing away with laws or regulations so those in power know it is impossible to be caught or penalized does not stop them from acting improperly. Only criminal punishment and public disgrace accomplish that.\n\nThe resulting \u201cfree market\u201d business jungle includes monopolies, coercion, fraud, theft, parasitism, crony cabals and racketeering. Ironically, unfettered \u201cfree markets\u201d are not free, but increase injustice, making the economic system inefficient. Only government laws and regulations can keep markets competitive.\n\nThe EMT Supporting Free Markets Is Wrong\n\nNew scientific evidence on the efficient market hypothesis or theory (EMT), shows University of Chicago School of Business researchers ask the wrong questions, use erroneous data and an incorrect research method to analyze the data, and then jump to false conclusions, based on half-truths\u2014please read further in my journal articles: link, link and link.\n\nThe EMT and \u201cfree market fundamentalism\u201d are false gods.\n\nConclusion\n\nMarkets are not efficient, based on the data. Consequently, \u201cfree markets\u201d have no theoretical foundation. Therefore, reject the incorrect theory of \u201cfree market fundamentalism\u201d It is impractical and dangerous, leading us into the ongoing 2008 credit crisis.\n\nCompetitive market economies only function properly by having fair laws and regulations, set up and impartially enforced, by a strong state. Dr. Robert M. Solow, 1987 Nobel Prize Winner in Economics and MIT Institute Professor Emeritus says, \u201cThe switch to talk about \u201cfree\u201d markets diverts attention from these deficiencies and suggests that any attempts at corrective regulation are instead limitations on freedom.\u201d\n\nNeoliberal\u201d free market fundamentalists\u201d in business use \u201cfree market\u201d ideology as a negotiation ploy. Do not succumb to this ruse. The U.S. requires \u201ccompetitive markets for economic growth,\u201d not \u201cfree markets for fraud.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8d2\"", "article_summary": "Free Markets Are Impractical\u201cFree markets\u201d are free from state intervention, i.e., unfettered capitalism.\nThe U.S. requires \u201ccompetitive markets for economic growth,\u201d not \u201cfree markets for fraud.\u201d\nFree Market Fundamentalism Leads To Economic DisasterNowhere is \u201cfree market fundamentalism\u201d more highly trumpeted by neoliberal economists than in the financial markets.\n\u201cFree market\u201d apologists ingenuously explain the 2008 credit crisis is not caused by \u201cfree markets,\u201d but because government regulations are not loose enough.\nIronically, unfettered \u201cfree markets\u201d are not free, but increase injustice, making the economic system inefficient."}
