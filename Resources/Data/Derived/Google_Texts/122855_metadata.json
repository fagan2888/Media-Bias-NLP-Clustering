Online and offline has come together. It\u2019s helping the retailer but it\u2019s also great for the customer.\u201d\n\nHere are some innovations that are changing the way we shop:\n\nNo More Buyer\u2019s Remorse. Wouldn\u2019t you love it if you could wear those sneakers for a few days to see if they really fit? This isn\u2019t far in the future: GU, a Japanese apparel retailer, lets customers wear clothes for a day before deciding to purchase them or not.\n\n\u201cYou can walk out of a store with clothes you just tried on,\u201d said Scott Lachut, director of consulting at PSFK\u2019s Labs, which provides insights on retail trends. And don\u2019t feel bad if you decide against buying the item: The retailer uses the returned clothes on mannequins in the store.\n\nRelated: 8 Things That Will Get Cheaper in 2015\n\nCloser to home, cell phone carrier T-Mobile launched its \u201ctest drive\u201d in June, where customers receive an iPhone 5 and unlimited nationwide service for seven days at no cost. \u201cIt\u2019s like they allowed people to cheat on their current mobile carrier,\u201d Lachut said.\n\nNever Get Lost in a Department Store Again. Unless you frequent a department store on a regular basis, it\u2019s often easy to get lost and frustrated when looking for a specific brand. It can get even worse when traveling abroad. Huge department store Galleries Lafayette in Paris recently launched an app that allows customers to plan their shopping trip ahead of time.\n\nSimply select the brands you desire to visit \u2013 and the app creates a personalized route through the store based on your entries. The added bonus for the store: The app may also add a detour to a specific exhibition or may map the route so you\u2019re forced to pass a certain area.\n\nTweet and Shop. Retailers used to see social media as a distraction to shopping \u2013 but if customers can now shop on social media, there\u2019s nothing to fear anymore. Twitter added a buy button in September to start testing a new way to discover and shop on the social media site.\n\n\u201cThis is an early step in our building functionality into Twitter to make shopping from mobile devices convenient and easy, hopefully even fun,\u201d the company noted in September. \u201cUsers will get access to offers and merchandise they can\u2019t get anywhere else and can act on them right in the Twitter apps for Android and iOS.\u201d\n\nRelated: U.S. Holiday Season Beats Expectations on Late Shopping Surge\n\nPlan Ahead. You may be familiar with the concept of purchasing an item online and picking it up in a store. Now you can reserve an item online, search stores in your area to see if they have your size, and have 24 hours to go try it in a store, with no obligation to buy it. This is another way for shoppers to expand their research before making purchases. Banana Republic, Athleta and Gap are offering this option.\n\n\u201cInventory has become more transparent to the customer,\u201d said Lachut. In a similar way, all Supercuts stores are now offering a mobile app that allows customers to book a hair appointment while having the ability to check the real-time wait-time at various locations.\n\n\u2018Smart\u2019 Fitting Rooms. There\u2019s no need to step out of the fitting room half-clothed anymore to look for a different size. Touch screens will assist you with everything you need \u2013 from checking whether a different style, color or size is in stock in the store to calling an actual person to bring you the next item you want to try.\n\nBloomingdale\u2019s just installed wall-mounted iPads in the dressing rooms of a few select stores in the U.S. as part of a smart-fitting testing phase. The iPad can also connect to the company\u2019s inventory-management systems and locate items throughout its multimillion-item inventory network.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Retailers are bringing the best of online and mobile shopping to brick-and-mortar stores to give customers a fully-integrated experience combining the best of all worlds.", "title": "5 Innovations That Are Changing the Way We Shop", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/13/5-Innovations-Are-Changing-Way-We-Shop", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-03-03T162150Z_2_CBREA2219FD00_RTROPTP_2_SHOPPING-TIPS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/13/5-Innovations-Are-Changing-Way-We-Shop", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-03-03T162150Z_2_CBREA2219FD00_RTROPTP_2_SHOPPING-TIPS.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Retailers are bringing the best of online and mobile shopping to brick-and-mortar stores to give customers a fully-integrated experience combining the best of all worlds.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s helping the retailer but it\u2019s also great for the customer.\u201dHere are some innovations that are changing the way we shop:No More Buyer\u2019s Remorse.\nTwitter added a buy button in September to start testing a new way to discover and shop on the social media site.\nYou may be familiar with the concept of purchasing an item online and picking it up in a store.\nRetailers are bringing the best of online and mobile shopping to brick-and-mortar stores to give customers a fully-integrated experience \u2013 combining the best of all worlds.\nRetailers used to see social media as a distraction to shopping \u2013 but if customers can now shop on social media, there\u2019s nothing to fear anymore."}
