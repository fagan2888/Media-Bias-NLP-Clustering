The other four hold more than 100 stocks each.\n\nIn total, Doll manages eight funds and co-manages one in the stock market today . His largest is $426 million Large-Cap Value , which gained 12.94% over those 12 months. The S&P 500 rose 14.22%.\n\nDoll is also Nuveen's chief equity strategist, helping plot game plans for successful investing for $8.5 billion worth of funds.\n\nThat makes Doll a notable minority: a coach for a large stock mutual fund group who is also a quarterback, running money. That gives him a public win-loss record. Every year he also creates a second win-loss record with his well-known list of 10 market predictions.\n\nIn his 2014 predictions, he was wrong on two -- he forecast cyclical stocks outperforming defensives and he expected active managers to outperform indexes.\n\nHe was correct on five, and half right on three.\n\nDoll, 61, took his top strategist job after leaving a similar post at BlackRock. Based in Princeton, N.J., he talked with IBD about his investment process while meeting clients in San Francisco.\n\nIBD: Several of your funds are relatively small. Does that help their performance?\n\nDoll: I manage these portfolios the same way as I plan to when they are $1 billion in size, so no difference.\n\nIBD: Bob, your funds have some very different characteristics. What's their overall investment strategy like?\n\nDoll: My team and I are of the view that you can combine multifactor quantitative models with deep (fundamental) research, and your chances of winning go up. Both sides have to agree that the name is attractive.\n\nWe use a multifactor model to rank our universe. For the Large Cap Core Fund, that's the Russell 1000 Index. We can own any name in it.\n\nThe model has 56 variables, from business momentum to (earnings) acceleration and revenues, profitability, valuations measures, the way management uses capital, to a whole, long list of factors.\n\nWe rank stocks from most to least attractive.\n\nThen our deep fundamental research takes over. ... By the end, 250 of the original 1,000 names are in the top quartile. The fundamental research looks at which 100 of the 250 go into the fund.\n\nIBD: Is Concentrated Core your best ideas from Large Cap Core?\n\nDoll: Yes, with a couple of provisos. Each name in Concentrated Core is a 5% position. I want to make sure a 5% position doesn't have a high probability of blowing up and damaging the portfolio. So we spend a little extra time on risk evaluation, and we're a little more value conscious.\n\nWhen the process works, Concentrated Core is generally the best performing.\n\nIBD: How does Large Cap Core differ from Core Plus?\n\nDoll: Large Cap Core Plus is a 130/30 short extension fund; 130% long is similar to Large Cap Core. But we lay on 30% short positions, as all short-extension funds do.\n\nIBD: That means that 30% of the portfolio is in short positions, right?\n\nDoll: That's correct. If you invest $1 in that fund, you invest $1.30 in longs and 30 cents in shorts. So $1.30 long minus 30 cents shorts is a net of $1 or a fully invested position. That's why academics call it a short-extension fund. The extension is the extra 30%.\n\nIBD: Bob, what do you expect the market to be like this year?\n\nDoll: Our view is that coming up with the gains of 2014 will be hard, and it will have more volatility.\n\nWe expect a constructive environment as the U.S. economy does better. And earnings growth will be sufficient for the U.S. equities market to move higher. But we expect a bumpier ride.\n\nIBD: Will the market environment be friendly to your approach?\n\nDoll: Our process tends to fail at turning points, which we don't anticipate this year, so we hope the environment will be friendly to our process.\n\nIBD: Genpact ( G ) ( which was in five of his funds as of Dec. 31) provides commercial services. It was spun out fromGeneral Electric ( GE ) in 2005. What do you like about it?\n\nDoll: We like tech overall. Like health care, it depends on unit growth, not pricing power.\n\nThis company is somewhat misunderstood as shown by its reasonable valuation. (It is trading around 20 with a price-earnings ratio of around 20.) It's gaining market share.\n\nWe like tech companies that have the best propensity to report at or better-than-expected earnings. But this is not typical of our tech stocks. And we don't marry tech stocks. This is a rental.\n\nIBD: So you see all tech holdings as highly temporary?\n\nDoll: I don't mean to imply that we rent all tech stocks. TakeApple ( AAPL ) andMicrosoft ( MSFT ).\n\nThe demand for their products and the predictability of those companies will last for some time.\n\nGenpact is more of a specialty company. It's a smart enterprise. It benefits when it can service people who do central planning.\n\nIBD: So Genpact is more volatile than Apple and Microsoft?\n\nDoll: Apple and Microsoft are leaders in their businesses. Genpact's business is more competitive. I'm not sure they're a leader.\n\nIBD: Why else do you like Apple? You've increased your weighting at least three quarters in a row.\n\nDoll: I wish I could find more companies that are market leaders that grow through penetration of existing products and new products selling at market multiples. They have a clean balance sheet, lots of cash, buybacks, rising dividends.\n\nThere are a lot of good things about Apple. But it is not an undiscovered story. Yet they can grow earnings higher than the market and more consistently.\n\nIn the old days, when Apple was expensive, it had to come up with home runs to sustain its momentum and price. Now it has to hit only singles and occasionally doubles.\n\nIBD: Anthem ( ANTM ), a managed health care service provider, has been rallying. What's driving it?\n\nDoll: At the highest level, we like health care, especially health care services, including particularly managed care. We own about 100 names in (each of several of) the portfolios. And we often take several positions in similar industries. Then we decide which we like best.\n\nManaged care benefits from unit growth. More people have been added to health insurance rolls as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis stock has rallied as the market has moved in a more defensive direction, which benefits sectors like health care, whose growth is somewhat independent of the economy.\n\nIBD: Gilead Sciences (GILD) sold off in late October, into November. What's your thesis?\n\nDoll: Gilead is one of the few large-scale multiproduct biotechs we own. It's the one that's most controversial.\n\nIts Q4 problem was not being able to sell their products while competing products sold at a more reasonable price.\n\nThat caused investors to say (Gilead) may not be able to sell as much as what we thought.\n\nOn the sell-off we added to our position, and so far, so good.\n\nIBD: So why did you add?\n\nDoll: I thought the stock overreacted. I think the hepatitis C opportunity is a lot bigger than the narrow winner-loser discussion. And Gilead tends to be very conservative in their guidance.\n\nIBD: Why did medical products makerC.R. Bard (BCR) show price strength from mid-October through late January?\n\nDoll: It's similar to the HMO companies. Its business is more predictable. At the same time, its business is more independent of the economy. They have all kinds of products that are demanded whether we're in a boom or recession. So it reflects the appeal of a defensive category that has attracted attention.\n\nIBD: Why isHuntington Ingalls (HII), a big-ticket defense contractor, doing well in a time of austerity and budget cutbacks?\n\nDoll: This company is a small operator compared toGeneral Dynamics (GD) andLockheed (LMT). Huntington operates in niches. It's a shipbuilding company. They provide engineering and management services, both for defense and commercial markets, so it's not a pure play on defense.\n\nThey have orders on nuclear-powered aircraft carriers keeping them busy. I think -- I'm not sure -- that they're the largest shipbuilder in the U.S.\n\nI agree with your macro comment (about austerity and cutbacks), but these guys have good demand and decent backlog.\n\nIBD: Gap' s (GPS) rally appears to have stalled. Do you still like it?\n\nDoll: Concerns first. This is a cheap stock, but there's a reason it's cheap. It gets one fashion cycle right, then it gets the next one wrong.\n\nIt has a number of concepts. Sometimes they fire on six cylinders, sometimes they fire on just three.\n\nWe own it because we think the risk-reward is interesting. But we have a shorter leash on this than on any other company.\n\nIBD: Amgen (AMGN) has downtrended since early December. Do you still like it?\n\nDoll: This is the most conservative biotech stock there is. It has products that are advanced, selling well.\n\nAnd it has an R&D lab that is important, unlike many tiny biotechs. Some pharmaceutical analysts cover it instead of biotech analysts.\n\nWe like it because it has predictability. It has a number of products that are needed and growing. And it is increasingly able to sell overseas.\n\nIBD: What's your thesis aboutBiogen-Idec (BIIB), another biotech?\n\nDoll: Many analysts would say don't put Biogen in the same sentence with Amgen and Gilead. They all deal with different illnesses, different therapeutic categories.\n\nBut they do have similar characteristics. We like them when they have accelerating free cash flow and profit margins are high.\n\nIBD: Why do you likeMasterCard (MA), which has rallied in recent sessions after downtrending since early December?\n\nDoll: Among the stocks that fall in the cracks between technology and financials, we like credit card companies. They don't have all of the regulatory issues and balance sheet issues that banks do.\n\nAnd they benefit from improving consumer confidence, which means they'll use their cards more.\n\nIBD: What's drivingCorning (GLW)?\n\nDoll: Gorilla glass! They've been beating earnings expectations. They do have a checkered history, so it's a bit of a show-me stock. But when they report decent earnings, investors buy the stock.\n\nThere's increasing demand for their product. They're making technical upgrades.\n\nThey're in a fairly competitive business, but they are leaders, and so far, so good.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Investing,Mutual Funds", "og": {"url": "http://www.nasdaq.com/article/nuveens-bob-doll-runs-several-top-funds-cm439956", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "site_name": "NASDAQ.com", "title": "Nuveen's Bob Doll Runs Several Top Funds"}, "Robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "nasdaq news, market headlines, market news, stock market headlines, stock market news", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-03T06:22:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Special Report: Best Mutual Funds 2015, January Performance Report  B ob Doll runs an all-star team.
