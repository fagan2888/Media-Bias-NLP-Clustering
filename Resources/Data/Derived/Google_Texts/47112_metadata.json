John L. Lewis, the Georgia Democrat whose aides falsely claimed was spit on by conservatives opposing Obamacare back in 2010, is accusing the president of selling out his political base by naming Eleanor Ross as a federal judge. She is, literally, not politically correct enough.\n\nSince most black women are Democrats, Lewis reasons, any black woman Obama appoints should be Democrat, too.\n\n\u201cBlack women vote in a higher percentage than any other group in Georgia,\u201d Lewis told USA Today columnist DeWayne Wickham for a column published Tuesday. \u201cI think the president should do better by them.\u201d\n\nAnd Wickham, one of the most reliably inane lib pundits in a country rife with inane lib pundits \u2013 agrees.\n\n\u201cLewis is right,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis fight is about the long term, not the remaining years of Obama\u2019s presidency,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs important as it is to Democrats to get as many of Obama\u2019s judicial nominations confirmed as possible, it\u2019s even more important to put the right people on the bench.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about the column is that Wickham describes opposition to five other nominees Obama put forward based on their record \u2013 one voted as a state representative to keep the Confederate battle flag on the Georgia state flag, another is an attorney who defended Georgia\u2019s common-sense voter ID law.\n\nFair enough. Flawed but fair enough.\n\nThe opposition to Ross\u2019s nomination, though, appears to be based entirely on her race, her sex and her politics \u2013 in that order.\n\nThere\u2019s a beautiful irony in the confirmation fight that\u2019s coming over Ross \u2013 and one that the libs will no doubt are miss completely.\n\nThe first black president names the first black woman to the federal bench in Georgia and \u201ccivil rights leaders\u201d who\u2019ve made skin color a primary way of judging people for decades are furious because she\u2019s not their kind.\n\nAnd Republicans are in a war on women?", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Libs hate the idea of black women Republicans so much that one of the best-known black Democrats in Congress is threatening to go to war with a black Democrat president over the prospect of a black woman being named a federal judge because she\u2019s a Republican.
