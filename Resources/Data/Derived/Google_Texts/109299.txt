The gathering of eagles and silver beaver banquet was held at MCC's multi-purpose building.

Six out of every 100 boy scouts reach the Eagle Scout rank. Executive CEO of the Choctaw Council says the scouts had the chance to eat dinner with mentors from the career they are interested in pursuing. Those who help with the scouts were also recognized.

"Silver Beaver is an honor we bestow a volunteer or a couple of volunteers each year that has gone above and beyond for the Choctaw area council and the six counties we serve," Executive CEO of Choctaw Council Ken Kercheval says.

Kercheval says there were 26 Eagles this year. 16 were able to be honored.
