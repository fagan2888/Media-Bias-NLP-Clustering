(CNSNews.com) - Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said although Republicans have had "tactical differences" on how to get rid of Obamacare, they all share the same goal. He suggested that Republicans will run against the president's signature health care law in 2014.



"Obamacare is the worst piece of legislation that's been passed in the last half century -- the single biggest step in the direction of Europeanizing our country," McConnell told CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sunday. "We need to get rid of it. And if the American people will give us a majority in the Senate and a new president, that's exactly what we're going to do."





McConnell said he agrees with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who led the effort to defund Obamacare, that Obamacare is a "trainwreck."



"I mean, a visit to the website is kind of like a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles in your state. People can't -- even if they can access the website, there's no way to get quotes. Even those who may be fortunate enough to sign up are going to find that the premiums are higher and the choices are fewer. One thing that all Republicans agreed on back in 2009 is that we thought Obamacare was a terrible mistake for the country.



We still think that, and we're going to do everything we can in the future to try to repeal it. But that requires a Republican Senate and a different president. We have a math problem in the Senate in getting rid of Obamacare.



McConnell said that with 45 Republicans to 55 Democrats, "we only control a portion of the government, and so that limits our ability to get rid of this horrible law."
