First came Great Thursday, then Black Friday, now a nationwide campaign, Small Business Saturday to encourage citizens to shop local.

"It's an opportunity to understand that shopping local, at home is good thing and it helps our local economy more than the big box stores," says Robbie Hales, The Liberty Store Co-owner.

The Liberty Store is one of the many businesses in Meridian supporting Small Business Saturday. They're running special deals to draw in customers.

Loeb's Clothing Tradition is another. Owner, Robert Loeb says Small Business Saturday comes at a good time of year. "A really busy time of year for us. I think small businesses are really the backbone of this country. It's an independent business owner trying to make it."

Loeb says the local stores have a lot of competition with big box stores, but customers shop local because there is one thing the bigger stores are missing.

"Personal service. You'll still be able to find someone to help you find something you're looking for. Someone to give you information and knowledge about the product you're buying and I think we can compete with sale prices as much as anybody," says Loeb.

Customers like Emilee Griffith would rather shop local than in big box stores or online. "I like to come in and try stuff on and support local businesses."

Robbie Hales, Co-owner of The Liberty Store says the local businesses give their all to make sure they have good customer service and keep customers coming back.

"We believe, we meaning the local stores do so much. We are here late. We come early. We do those special things to let our customers know we really appreciate them," says Hales.
