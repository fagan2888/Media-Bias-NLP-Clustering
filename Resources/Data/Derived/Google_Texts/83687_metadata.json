But, on June 12, 1967, the Supreme Court overturned all \u201canti-miscegenation laws\u201d in the U.S.\n\nCuriously, justices used the words of a slave-owning white plantation owner \u2014 the \u2018Father of the Constitution\u2019 \u2014 to make their ruling.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision probably didn\u2019t sit well with the Virginia judge who, in 1958, sentenced Mildred and Richard Loving to a year in prison for their forbidden marriage.\n\n\u201cAlmighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. \u2026 The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix,\u201d said racist Judge Leon M. Bazile, who offered to suspend the sentence if the couple left Virginia for 25 years.\n\nInstead of prison, they chose to live in nearby Washington, D.C., but a few years later were arrested again in Virginia for traveling in the same car.\n\nTimes have changed. Or have they?\n\nIn many ways, 1967\u2019s \u201cLoving v. Virginia\u201d decision presages the upcoming Supreme Court decision on gay marriage, which may strike down all state laws banning that particular form of love.\n\nWhen that happens, politicians will claim the court is being an \u201cactivist judiciary\u201d or somehow diminishing the role of Congress.\n\nRecently, President Obama attempted to lecture the court on a pending Obamacare decision that might not go his way.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I am confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress,\u201d said Obama.\n\nObama, a legal scholar at one point, surely knows the primary function of the non-elected Supreme Court is to make decisions based on their interpretation of the Constitution. If a law is unconstitutional but passed by a \u201cstrong majority\u201d of Congress and popular with the public \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 the Supreme Court is obligated to strike it down.\n\nBTW, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed the House in 2010 by a 219-212 vote, which I would not characterize as a \u201cstrong majority.\u201d\n\nA recent poll says 55 percent of Americans don\u2019t approve of Obamacare, but 63 percent believe gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry.\n\nShould the Supreme Court look at polls before making decisions?\n\nOf course not.\n\nIn 1958, Mildred and Richard Loving didn\u2019t know it was illegal for a white man and black woman to get married in Virginia.\n\nIn the near future, a gay couple in Georgia may feel equally free.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "News To Me Blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://newstome.blog.ajc.com/2015/06/12/loving-day-marks-48th-anniversary-of-legal-interracial-marriage/", "image": "https://cmgajcnewstome.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/mildred_jeter_and_richard_loving.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Supreme Court is often maligned, but the case could be made that the nation's highest court embodies what is best about America.\r\n\r\nYoung people may find this hard to believe, but 48 years ago it was illegal, in many states (including Georgia), for blacks and whites to marry or even live together.
