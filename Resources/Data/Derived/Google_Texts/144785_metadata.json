Also attending was fellow candidate Jim Webb. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nThe first gathering of the Democratic presidential candidates played almost according to script here Friday night. Hillary Rodham Clinton stood above the field but did not dominate. Bernie Sanders displayed the passion that has made him such a favorite of the left. And Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s speech got a reception that belied his anemic poll numbers.\n\nThe serial speeches by Clinton, Sanders and O\u2019Malley \u2014 who were joined in the program by fellow contenders Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb \u2014 also highlighted the leftward shift of the Democratic Party under President Obama and the degree to which that movement is continuing during the contest for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nClinton, who spoke with the aid of a teleprompter, was fiery, funny and sharply partisan. It was a red-meat speech delivered to an audience eager for her to deliver it. She took little notice of her Democratic opponents and concentrated her attacks on the opposition party.\n\nShe noted that Republicans have fresh faces running for president but denounced the GOP as a party mired in the past and wedded to policies that have not worked except for thewealthiest in society.\n\nOn economics, she warned that the GOP candidates want to return to the tax-cutting policies of previous Republican administrations. \u201cTrickle-down economics has to be one of the worst ideas of the 1980s,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is right up there with New Coke, shoulder pads and big hair. I lived through it \u2014 and there are photographs. And we\u2019re not going back to that.\u201d\n\n1 of 44 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Hillary Clinton makes campaign stops in N.H., Iowa View Photos The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential hopeful held a town-hall meeting and other events in the two states.

When she turned to Donald Trump, it went like this: \u201cFinally, a candidate whose hair gets more attention than mine.\u201d Then the humor stopped, as she added that there is \u201cnothing funny about the hate he\u2019s spewing\u201d toward immigrants. She called it shameful and ridiculed the other GOP candidates for being slow to denounce Trump\u2019s words.\n\nThe former secretary of state and senator from New York attacked former Florida governor Jeb Bush for his comments on part-time work. She hit at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for restricting reproductive rights in his state, saying the voters should say no to politicians \u201cwho shame and blame\u201d women. She even went after Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad for vetoing spending on mental health and got one of the biggest ovations of the night.\n\nIf once she seemed tentative about talking about herself and her family, she no longer is. She talked as she has done in this campaign about the abandonment her mother endured as a child. She said becoming a grandmother was \u201ctransformational,\u201d forcing one to consider the kind of future this generation will leave for others. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m never going to let the Republicans rip away the progress we have made,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she would fight against efforts to go back to trickle-down economics and to a \u201cwild West on Wall Street,\u201d to retrenchment on marriage rights or to efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe mocked Republicans who say they aren\u2019t scientists and therefore can\u2019t judge whether climate change is man-made. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not a scientist either,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain, and I\u2019m not going to let them take us back.\u201d\n\nShe showed her willingness as well to embrace gender issues and the prospect of becoming the first female president. Ticking through a series of policies that would help women, she noted that some would say, \u201cThere she goes again\u201d on women\u2019s issues. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to stop,\u201d she said, \u201cso get ready for a long campaign.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s fire\n\nSanders again showed he is prepared to go where Clinton won\u2019t on economic issues. He called for a nationwide mass movement against the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d that he has made the heart of his populist insurgency. No president, he said, can bring about the changes he says are needed \u201cunless there is a political revolution.\u201d\n\nClinton attacks Wall Street but hardly with the vigor of Sanders. Calling wealth and income inequality the moral and political issues of the day, the senator from Vermont identified his enemy and called on Democrats to take up the fight. \u201cThe greed for the billionaire class has got to end, and we are going to end it for them,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is an old-fashioned passion that Sanders brings to the campaign, and it has clearly found an audience on the left. Clinton\u2019s policies are progressive but safely so; Sanders\u2019s go beyond. Without naming her, he drew contrasts with Clinton that many in the audience clearly understood.\n\nSanders would raise the minimum wage more than she. He opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. He favors both a big infrastructure program to rebuild roads and bridges as well as a big public jobs program to reduce unemployment among young African Americans and Hispanics.\n\nOn health care, he would move beyond the Affordable Care Act and seek to enact a Medicare-style government-run single-payer system. On Social Security, he would expand benefits, not cut them.\n\nThe Sanders cheering section on Friday filled one end of the room, and the response he received was one more sign that he has found an audience within the party and, if he can keep building on it, could threaten Clinton here and in New Hampshire.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s eloquence\n\nThe surprise of the night might have been O\u2019Malley, the former Maryland governor and ex-mayor of Baltimore, if only because he has largely been dealt out of the narrative of the current Democratic contest. He had hoped to become the alternative to Clinton only to see Sanders take up that space. Now he languishes far behind. But he showed he has a message, too.\n\nHis speech was a version of Sanders\u2019s message but with a different style and eloquence. Sanders\u2019s style is direct and blunt. O\u2019Malley\u2019s rhetoric and cadence lift in other ways, and many times he brought the whole audience from their seats cheering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only Democratic candidate for president who holds progressive values,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am the only candidate for president with 15 years of executive experience.\u201d He said he offered the party \u201caction not words.\u201d\n\nHe agrees with Sanders on minimum wage and trade and Social Security. He wants a major initiative to rebuild urban America. He attacks the \u201cbullies of Wall Street\u201d with just as much enthusiasm and edge.\n\n\u201cWe must prosecute financial crimes, and if a bank is too big to fail, too big to jail and too big to manage, then it\u2019s too damn big and it needs to be broken up before it breaks us up,\u201d he said to cheers and applause.\n\nChafee and Webb\n\nChafee and Webb provided the evening\u2019s bookends, curiosities to many in the audience and so far barely registering in the consciousness of party activists.\n\nChafee, the former Rhode Island governor, spoke for less than seven minutes, denouncing Republican foreign policy as \u201cfailed, arrogant, unilateral, bellicose.\u201d He added: \u201cWe need to reject once and for all the belligerent advocates of conflict.\u201d\n\nWebb was notable for declaring his differences with Obama on the newly negotiated nuclear agreement with Iran. And seeking to set himself apart from others, the former senator noted that he is the only candidate elected statewide in Virginia \u201cwith a union card, two purple hearts and three tattoos.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have had many such forums this year. For the Democrats, Friday was the first opportunity to see their candidates in the same room. Clinton delivered a rousing and polished speech, but Sanders and O\u2019Malley showed there is appetite for an even harder-edge populist message among party activists. That will provide the tension as the Democratic contest evolves in the coming months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "THE TAKE | The Democratic 2016 roster appeared together onstage.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "THE TAKE | The Democratic 2016 roster appeared together onstage.", "title": "In Iowa, it was a good night for Clinton \u2014 and her rivals", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-iowa-it-was-a-good-night-for-clinton--and-her-rivals/2015/07/18/f7d171d0-2d67-11e5-960f-22c4ba982ed4_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/18/National-Politics/Images/481142686-4830.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@danbalz"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-iowa-it-was-a-good-night-for-clinton--and-her-rivals/2015/07/18/f7d171d0-2d67-11e5-960f-22c4ba982ed4_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danbalzwapo"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "f7d171d0-2d67-11e5-960f-22c4ba982ed4"}, "article_summary": "(Charlie Neibergall/AP)The first gathering of the Democratic presidential candidates played almost according to script here Friday night.\nDemocratic presidential candidates, from left, Bernie Sanders, Martin O\u2019Malley, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Lincoln Chafee stand onstage during the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Hall of Fame Dinner in Cedar Rapids.\nJuly 27, 2015 After touring the Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority\u2019s Central Station in downtown Des Moines, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton takes questions about her climate-change policy announcement.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only Democratic candidate for president who holds progressive values,\u201d he said.\nClinton delivered a rousing and polished speech, but Sanders and O\u2019Malley showed there is appetite for an even harder-edge populist message among party activists."}
