The executive director of Evergreen Park and Recreation District, Scott Robson, will leave his position at the end of August to step into the role as CEO of Golden-based Colorado Mountain Club and American Alpine Museum, the district said Thursday in a news release.

“Although it will be difficult to leave the district, after almost 20 years of public service, I’m really looking forward to leading a top-tier non-profit organization with a statewide focus on programs, education and conservation of Colorado’s mountain environment,” Robson said in a statement.

The president of the board, Peter Linquist, said the board will be launching a search for a new executive director over the next couple of weeks and hopes to fill the position sometime this fall.

Robson was Evergreen Park and Recreation District’s director for 3½ years, having previously worked as a manager for Denver Parks and Recreation.

Evergreen Park and Recreation District serves approximately 22,000 residents and covers nearly 50,000 acres, making it one of the largest park districts in the state. It has 10 parks, three facilities, including Evergreen Lake and Lake House, and numerous trails.
