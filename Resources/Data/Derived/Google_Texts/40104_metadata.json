In 2010, Podesta wrote the foreword to a book on UFO investigations, writing, \u201cAs someone interested in the questions of UFOs, I think I have always understood the difference between fact and fiction. I guess you could call me a curious skeptic.\u201d Adding more fuel to the fire, Podesta wrote the foreword to Leslie Kean's 2010 New York Times bestseller, \"UFOs: Generals, Pilots, And Government Officials Go On The Record\": I'm skeptical about many things, including the notion that government always knows best, and that the people can't be trusted with the truth. The time to pull the curtain back on this subject is long overdue. Presenting the facts, the book includes statements from only the most credible sources -- those in a position to know -- about a fascinating phenomenon, the nature of which is yet to be determined. It's time to find out what the truth really is that's out there. The American people -- and people around the world -- want to know, and they can handle the truth.\n\nBut they can't handle the truth about ObamaCare. Or maybe even aliens.\n\nPodesta immediately became a big fan of UFO proponents, but now he has lost favor with the group. Recently, he asked Will Allen, known for his photographs of UFOs over Capitol Hill, to cease and desist. According to reports, Podesta stated that these reports could \"destabilize society.\"\n\nIf you like your probing, you can keep your probing.\n\nPerhaps Podesta spent too much time reading the works of fellow UFO Socialist Juan Posadas, who wrote, \"We must appeal to the beings on other planets, when they come here, to intervene and collaborate with Earth\u2019s inhabitants in suppressing poverty.\"\n\nWhy are illegal aliens always such liberals?", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "If you like your probing, you can keep your probing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "If you like your probing, you can keep your probing.", "title": "Obama's New Center for American Progress Boss is Really Into UFOs", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/213218/obamas-new-center-american-progress-boss-really-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:48:10-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/213218/obamas-new-center-american-progress-boss-really-daniel-greenfield", "description": "If you like your probing, you can keep your probing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama's New Center for American Progress Boss is Really Into UFOs"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-15T05:22:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:48:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6a7\"", "article_summary": "According to reports, Podesta stated that these reports could \"destabilize society.\"\nJohn Podesta of the Center for American Progress is coming on board as an adviser/boss to the man that his political group and their left-wing billionaire funders put into office.\nRecently, he asked Will Allen, known for his photographs of UFOs over Capitol Hill, to cease and desist.\nThe American people -- and people around the world -- want to know, and they can handle the truth.\nIn 2002, Podesta called on the federal government to declassify records relating to UFO investigations."}
