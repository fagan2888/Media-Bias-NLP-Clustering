Bush was in office; and he is battling the twin plagues of Ebola and the rise of ISIS, crises not of his making, with thoughtful, measured approaches.\n\nStill, a majority of Americans may be turning to a Republican Party that has promised diminished government, repeal of Obamacare, environmental and corporate deregulation, and further tax reductions that will balloon the deficit and vastly reduce funding of essential services.\n\nThe message from voters is wildly ambivalent: Many Americans want a severely hobbled federal government, but at the same time one that guarantees their health and safety. They want stronger government and leadership, even as they ask for less. The truth may be even more troubling: Too many Americans don\u2019t know what they want, or care. If history is any indicator, a sizable majority of eligible voters won\u2019t even bother to vote.\n\nThis is the real tragedy. The fault is not in our stars, it is in ourselves. We get the government we deserve. I pray I am wrong.\n\nTONY GITTELSON\n\nLos Angeles, Nov. 2, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cBraced for a Shift in Congress, Obama Is Setting a New Agenda\u201d (front page, Nov. 2): Americans have grown weary of agenda-driven politics that often results in deep divisions. Why would they vote to change the players only to have the same scenes re-enacted? The only agenda the White House and Congress need right now is one with a single item on it: Work together.\n\nANDREA ECONOMOS\n\nScarsdale, N.Y., Nov. 2, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nYou write of President Obama and his aides: \u201cAnticipating a less friendly Congress, they are mapping possible compromises with Republicans to expand trade, overhaul taxes and build roads and bridges.\u201d Less friendly Congress? I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s room for that, given the unfriendliness of the past one. And I find this article, and Mr. Obama\u2019s intent, a bit polyannaish.\n\nThe bottom line is this: The most conservative Republican members of Congress, particularly in the South, vowed to destroy this presidency on Day 1. And I don\u2019t think that will change. They have zero interest in governing, but 100 percent interest in grandstanding, and making the president take the blame for their intransigence.\n\nAm I cynical? You bet I am. How can anyone not be after the last six years?\n\nCHRISTINE McMORROW\n\nWaltham, Mass., Nov. 2, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cCancel the Midterms,\u201d by David Schanzer and Jay Sullivan (Op-Ed, Nov. 3): The two-year term for the House is obsolete and, more important, detrimental to our democracy. It seems that as soon as the winners of the midterm election arrive in Washington for their first day on the job, they already need to create a re-election team to raise money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the writers point out, elections are expensive. This fact makes our representatives more dependent on raising funds and less focused on the independent thinking needed to resolve the issues of our day.\n\nDAN FRYDA\n\nNew York, Nov. 3, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \u201cHow Obama Lost America,\u201d by Ross Douthat (column, Nov. 2):\n\nAlthough we can debate the reasons, we cannot dispute the fact that President Obama is unpopular with the majority of Americans.\n\nA politics built on resentment of the successful, including derision of their effort (\u201cYou didn\u2019t build that\u201d), a politics pitting class against class, a politics of personal identity instead of time-honored American principle and tradition, a politics that veers into autocratic executive action in the flawed belief that ends justify means, may yield electoral victory when championed by a political pied piper, but ultimately debases the commonweal.\n\nThis is the sour politics of bitterness, the corrosive politics of envy, the superficial politics of expedience. This is not optimism. There is no shining city on a hill at the end of this twisted trail but only a covetousness that demeans the founders\u2019 experiment.\n\nPAUL BLOUSTEIN\n\nCincinnati, Nov. 2, 2014\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRoss Douthat misses a major point: President Obama\u2019s biggest problem is that he does not seem presidential. His leadership of the country, his party and his agenda is at best tepid at a time when strong, media-savvy leadership is called for. He also does not appear willing to engage in the necessary political fray that is Washington.\n\nThe country wants a confident, larger-than-life figure in the presidency \u2014 a Teddy Roosevelt, an F.D.R., a Ronald Reagan \u2014 and Mr. Obama fails this critical test.\n\nJOHN MATHEWSON\n\nWeaverville, N.C., Nov. 2, 2014", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141103180530, "twitter": {"description": "Readers discuss coverage of the midterm elections and President Obama\u2019s popularity.", "title": "Election Day: The Mood of America", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/election-day-the-mood-of-america.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003213503"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/04/opinion/04LETTERS/04LETTERS-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/election-day-the-mood-of-america.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003213503", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/election-day-the-mood-of-america.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Election Day: The Mood of America", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 3, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-11-03", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2014-11-03", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Midterm Elections (2014),Elections  House of Representatives,Elections  Senate,United States Politics and Government,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Republican Party,Democratic Party,House of Representatives,Senate,United States,Obama  Barack", "description": "Readers discuss coverage of the midterm elections and President Obama\u2019s popularity.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/04/opinion/04LETTERS/04LETTERS-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "slug": "l04elect", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers discuss coverage of the midterm elections and President Obama\u2019s popularity.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/04/opinion/04LETTERS/04LETTERS-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Senate", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "org": "Senate", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141103235757, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/opinion/election-day-the-mood-of-america.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/04/opinion/04LETTERS/04LETTERS-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers discuss coverage of the midterm elections and President Obama\u2019s popularity.", "title": "Election Day: The Mood of America"}, "pdate": 20141103, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003213503, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Election Day: The Mood of America", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd154d\"", "article_summary": "PAUL BLOUSTEINCincinnati, Nov. 2, 2014To the Editor:Ross Douthat misses a major point: President Obama\u2019s biggest problem is that he does not seem presidential.\nThe bottom line is this: The most conservative Republican members of Congress, particularly in the South, vowed to destroy this presidency on Day 1.\nThis is the sour politics of bitterness, the corrosive politics of envy, the superficial politics of expedience.\nThis fact makes our representatives more dependent on raising funds and less focused on the independent thinking needed to resolve the issues of our day.\nIt seems that as soon as the winners of the midterm election arrive in Washington for their first day on the job, they already need to create a re-election team to raise money."}
