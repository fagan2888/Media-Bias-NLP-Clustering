He took out a $4,000 bank loan to pay a fixer to get him into the country without a visa and to find him a job at a U.S. military base.\n\nFor about three months Ranabath lived in a shipping container in Baghdad with 30 other Nepalese men while he waited to land a job. Since he was in Iraq illegally, he wasn\u2019t able to rent a hotel room or an apartment. At night in Baghdad, he said, he could hear the distant explosions of bombs and the sounds of gunfire. During the days he was on virtual lockdown, unable to move freely due to his illegal immigration status and the threat of terrorism.\n\n\u201cIraq was a very scary place,\u201d said Ranabath, who is now manager of the Silver Oaks Inn in the Nepali town of Pokhara, during an interview. \u201cBut I made a lot more money than I could in Nepal.\u201d\n\nRanabath eventually secured a job with the ITT Corporation, a U.S.-based civilian defense contractor, working maintenance at the U.S. military\u2019s Tallil Air Base. Ranabath worked in Iraq until U.S. forces withdrew in December 2011 and ITT\u2019s contract ended.\n\nRanabath\u2019s first year salary paid back the $4,000 loan. And when he returned to Nepal in 2012, Ranabath admits most of the money that he saved up from the second year went toward his wedding.\n\n\u201cIt was worth it,\u201d he said with a smirk.\n\nToday, Ranabath has a wife and a 2-year-old son who live in an apartment he rents in Pokhara. He works 15 to 16 hours a day, but that still isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet, he said. In the wake of the devastating April 2015 earthquake and India\u2019s ongoing blockade of fuel into Nepal, the tourism economy, upon which Ranabath relies to support his young family, has dried up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year for us,\u201d Ranabath said. \u201cFirst it was the earthquake, then the fuel shortage. Now there are no tourists. And if there are no tourists, there is no business.\u201d\n\nTrekking and mountaineering are the lifeblood of Pokhara\u2019s economy. Normally, the Silver Oaks Inn is at maximum occupancy in October. Now, Ranabath said, only about a quarter of the rooms are filled. He\u2019s had to lay off half his staff, reducing the number from 25 to 12, to account for the lost revenue. Even now, he said, the hotel is barely breaking even. Consequently, Ranabath is once again considering going abroad to find work.\n\n\u201cIf it stays like this, I\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI could go to Dubai, Qatar or Afghanistan to work. At least there I could get a good job for a few years.\u201d\n\nOne-Two Punch\n\nThe April 2015 earthquake was one of the most destructive in Nepal\u2019s history. It killed more than 9,000 people and displaced about 450,000. Centuries-old monuments crumbled in Kathmandu, and massive landslides and avalanches swept through the Himalayas, including an avalanche at Mt. Everest base camp that killed at least 20 mountaineers and Sherpas.\n\nThe devastation was extensive, but Nepal\u2019s infrastructure was not irreparably damaged. Six months later, Kathmandu\u2019s streets are clear of rubble and its monuments are being rebuilt. The streets are clogged with cars, motorcycles, rickshaws and cows. In parts of the city, including the touristy Thamel district (a hangout for hippies and mountaineers), the earthquake\u2019s impacts are practically invisible. Shop owners push their wares and rickshaw drivers trail tourists, repeatedly asking if they need a ride and apparently deaf to the word \u201cno.\u201d Bars serving Everest beer are open late into the night as local bands play covers of ever-popular American songs like \u201cHotel California.\u201d It\u2019s the same old Kathmandu.\n\nAnd outside the Nepalese capital, life is also returning to normal. The road connecting Kathmandu to Pokhara, a major tourist artery, is clear and appears undamaged. Roadside cafes are open for business, serving buffets of dal bhat (lentils and rice) and naan.\n\nNepal\u2019s tourism industry is back up and running. The problem, however, is that in places like Pokhara, where October is high tourism season, there just aren\u2019t that many tourists. And, adding to Nepal\u2019s woes, recent protests over Nepal\u2019s new constitution\u2014adopted Sept. 20\u2014spurred neighboring India to block transport trucks from entering Nepal, creating a nationwide fuel shortage that threatens to derail Nepal\u2019s earthquake recovery.\n\n\u201cThere haven\u2019t been any tourists,\u201d said Shiva Shunar, 35, a jewelry shop owner in Pokhara.\n\nShunar has a wife and an 8-month-old daughter. Monthly rent for his jewelry shop on Lakeside, Pokhara\u2019s main drag, is about $150, which he hasn\u2019t been able to pay for months. He said that due to the food shortage he has to cook all his meals over a wood fire.\n\n\u201cThis year has felt like taking a Mike Tyson punch,\u201d Shunar said.\n\nNepal gets 60 percent of all imports and nearly all of its oil from India. India cut its flow of transport trucks into Nepal after protests against Nepal\u2019s new constitution erupted in villages along Nepal\u2019s southern border with India at the end of September. More than 40 people died in related violence.\n\nThe protesters claimed Nepal\u2019s new constitution left Nepal\u2019s southern border territories, which have close ethnic ties to India, under-represented in Nepal\u2019s parliament and showed preference to northern highland territories.\n\nIndia has denied blockading fuel supplies into Nepal, claiming protesters in southern Nepal were blocking the shipments. The Indian government issued a statement expressing concern over the protests and ensuing violence, as well as for the safety of its truck drivers who transport goods into Nepal.\n\nNepalese officials claim, however, that India has limited its fuel shipments to punish Nepal for its new constitution. Kathmandu has labeled India\u2019s fuel blockade an infringement in Nepal\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nPushback\n\nIn some respects, evidence of the fuel shortage in Nepal is currently more ubiquitous than that of earthquake damage.\n\nSome airlines have canceled flights to Kathmandu since the fuel shortage began, while others have had to reroute flights to refuel outside Nepal.\n\nPrepaid taxi stands at Kathmandu airport are shut down, and taxi drivers no longer accept only one fare, cramming as many customers as possible into their cabs to minimize trips back and forth to the airport.\n\nGas lines in Kathmandu stretch for kilometers and last for days. One taxi driver claimed he had to wait in line for a week to fill up his cab. Taxi prices have quintupled, and there are fewer buses running every day between Kathmandu and Pokhara.\n\nEven before the earthquake or fuel crisis, the tops of buses in Nepal were frequently crowded with passengers sitting in luggage racks. The typical cost to sit on top of a bus from Pokhara to Nepal was about 500 Nepali rupees. Since the fuel shortage that price has jumped to more than 1,000 rupees.\n\nTrucks transporting food are also stuck at the Indian border, creating a shortage of staples such as rice. Restaurants in Kathmandu and Pokhara are now offering limited menus, and the remaining items are typically more expensive than usual.\n\nMany Nepalese citizens have turned to burning wood to cook since there is not enough fuel for gas stoves and ovens. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big problem,\u201d Shunar said. \u201cWe can only eat very simple things at home now.\u201d\n\nKathmandu has implemented fuel-rationing measures, limiting the fuel available to private vehicles. But many in Nepal claim rationing has created a fuel black market. In Pokhara, gas prices have gone up from about 100 Nepali rupees a liter (about $1) to more than 500 rupees (about $5). Consequently, prices on almost everything, from beer to eggs, have increased.\n\nWhile the fuel shortage is usually nothing more than an inconvenience for foreign visitors, the blockade has strained the resources of Nepal\u2019s citizens to make ends meet and stifled the tourism industry, which is a key pillar of Nepal\u2019s economy.\n\nIn 2014, about 800,000 tourists visited Nepal. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, travel and tourism accounts for about 8.2 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. Tourism directly supports more than half a million jobs in Nepal (which has an unemployment rate of about 38 percent), and travel and tourism collectively support about 7 percent of the total jobs in Nepal.\n\nThe Indian blockade has also ignited anti-Indian sentiment across Nepal. Protesters in Kathmandu rallying against the blockade chanted anti-Indian slogans, and buildings from Kathmandu to Pokhara are spray-painted with the graffiti: \u201c#backoffindia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all mad at Modi,\u201d Shunar said, referring to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done with India,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I were prime minister, I\u2019d build a great wall on the border with India.\u201d\n\nNepal, which is wedged between India and China, has long had to balance relations with its more powerful neighbors. Nepal\u2019s economic reliance on India increased after the earthquake destroyed land transport routes into China. And while India remains Nepal\u2019s No. 1 trading partner, China overtook India in 2014 as Nepal\u2019s top foreign investor. The fuel shortage and the anti-Indian sentiment it has ignited have prompted some in Nepal to desire closer ties with China.\n\n\u201cMaybe if we do more business with China, it would be better,\u201d Ranabath said. \u201cBeing closer with China would be good for Nepal.\u201d\n\nSucker Punch\n\nThe fuel shortage has hampered ongoing relief efforts to many of Nepal\u2019s remote mountain villages, which were the hardest hit by the earthquake.\n\n\u201cAcute shortages of fuel supplies continue to impede planned deliveries to affected villages and trailheads for onward transportation using mules and porters,\u201d Jamie McGoldrick, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Nepal, said in a statement.\n\nWith winter coming, many of the trails used to transport supplies to remote mountain villages, which cannot be accessed by air or wheeled vehicles, will soon be covered in snow and impassable. Therefore, the timeframe to deliver vital supplies to many hard-hit areas is dwindling. And without enough fuel to truck supplies to trailheads, a lot of vital aid, including hundreds of tons of food, will spend the winter in warehouses.\n\n\u201cOnly a small time window remains before the available land access trails become closed in the coming weeks,\u201d McGoldrick said. \u201cDue to limited availability to conduct deliveries by road and air during the recent monsoon season, a backlog of 1,200 MT [metric tons] of shelter and non-food item supplies is awaiting delivery to earthquake-affected population.\u201d\n\nThe Gurkha Welfare Trust, a British NGO that provides aid to Gurkha veterans, has been providing earthquake relief aid to remote mountain villages. (The British army\u2019s 200-year-old Brigade of Gurkhas comprises soldiers from Nepal.)\n\nThe fuel shortage has affected the group\u2019s operations, mainly due to limited fuel for transportation and a lack of supplies. \u201cMedical supplies are currently difficult to obtain, although we have reserve supplies so it\u2019s not yet a crisis for us,\u201d Alex Pope, communications officer for The Gurkha Welfare Trust, told The Daily Signal.\n\nTough Choices\n\nPokhara sits on Phewa Lake, about 124 miles west of Kathmandu. Even though the climate is hot and muggy, and the terrain is covered in tropical jungle, the rock and ice spires of the Annapurna massif loom nearby. Historically, Pokhara was a key stop on trade routes through the Himalayas from Tibet to India. The old trade routes were cut off, however, following China\u2019s invasion of Tibet in 1950 and the war between India and China (the Sino-Indian War) in 1962.\n\nPokhara gained fame among Westerners during the 1960s and 1970s as a favorite stop along the \u201chippy trail\u201d across South Asia. (Pokhara is one of several places in Nepal claiming to be the place where Jimi Hendrix wrote \u201cPurple Haze.\u201d) On Pokhara\u2019s streets one still spots tattooed Western septuagenarians\u2014with long knotted hair, grey beards and bloodshot eyes\u2014who just never went home.\n\nWith a population of about 250,000, Pokhara is Nepal\u2019s second largest city and a popular tourist destination from which trekkers embark for treks in the Annapurna and Mustang regions of the Himalaya. It\u2019s also an adventure sports mecca. The skies over the city are dotted with paragliders and the jungle canopies are draped in zip lines. Ultralight aircraft launch from Pokhara\u2019s airport for flights into the Annapurna Sanctuary\u2014a spectacular bowl of glaciated Himalayan peaks, including Annapurna, the 10th highest mountain in the world.\n\nPokhara was spared from major damage in the earthquake. But months later during the monsoon season, massive landslides cut down the slopes of the low mountains surrounding Phewa Lake. Dozens were killed as the flanks of mountains loosened by the earthquake finally gave way under the monsoon rain.\n\nReflecting the combined impact of the earthquake and the fuel shortage on Nepal\u2019s tourism economy, the streets of Pokhara are eerily quiet this October, a sharp contrast from the crowds typical in the tourism high season.\n\nRanabath is reluctant to leave behind his wife and child to work abroad, and he is nervous about potentially going to Afghanistan, another warzone, where he knows the risks are high. Yet, it is hard to resist the opportunity to make more money in two years of work abroad than he might make in a decade in Nepal.\n\n\u201cThe salary I make is just not enough,\u201d Ranabath said. \u201cIf tourists come, then yes, it\u2019s enough. But now, it\u2019s very hard. It\u2019s been a year of very bad things. It\u2019s hard to believe they will get better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "India's decision is hurting this country.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "India's decision is hurting this country.", "title": "First, an Earthquake Struck Nepal.
