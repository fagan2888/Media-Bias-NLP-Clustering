ISIS, or as they refer to themselves, “The Islamic State,” has launched a socialized health service called the Islamic State Health Service (ISHS), Daily Mail reports.

The imagery bears a striking resemblance to Britain’s socialized medicine program, the National Health Service (NHS).

A video surfaced online, featuring doctors talking about the services offered by ISHS. Two of the doctors are seen speaking English. They have been identified as Abu Muqatil al-Hindi and Abu Yusuf al-Australi.

The video, which describes the “Islamic State Dewan of Health,” details the various services offered.

One of the English-speaking doctors says:

“The physical therapy center is one of the most important areas that any hospital should have.”

The video has remained on YouTube, and unlike many other productions from the radical Islamic terrorist group, this one doesn’t feature any gruesome murders and imagery.

A handful of users on Twitter were quick to mock the new PR push from the radical militants.
