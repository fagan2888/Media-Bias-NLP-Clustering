Muslim civilians in the Central African Republic, clutching machetes and crude, homemade weapons, prepared to fight off marauding Christians. Christians were forming self-defense militias in other parts of a country the size of Texas, to prevent Muslims from slitting their throats. \u201cWe drove through some villages where every single person has picked up arms,\u201d Peter Bouckaert, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, told me in a telephone interview from the republic on Tuesday. \u201cChildren as young as 11 have picked up daggers or have knives or even hunting rifles.\u201d\n\nAs world leaders praised Mandela\u2019s legacy of tolerance and reconciliation, the international community was still struggling with how to respond to one of humanity\u2019s most depraved acts\u2014mass killings. Chaos and sectarian killings have steadily spread throughout the Central African Republic since predominantly Muslim Seleka\u2014\u201cAlliance\u201d\u2014rebels ousted the Christian president, Francois Bozize, in March. Rebel leader Michel Djotodia lost control of his forces, which have carried out atrocities against Christians across the resource-rich, but unstable former French colony. Over time, Christian militias retaliated. Last week shootings, stabbings and lynchings spiraled across the country. At least 465 people have died since last Thursday, according to the Red Cross. United Nations officials have warned\u2014in unusually blunt terms\u2014that the country contained \u201cthe seeds of a genocide.\u201d After failing to halt genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda, the United Nations now faces what the New York Times called a \u201creckoning\u201d in the Central African Republic. With the United Nations already carrying out 15 peacekeeping missions worldwide and Western militaries focused on counterterrorism missions, a new approach is unfolding in the Central African Republic. Last week the U.N. Security Council authorized sending 1,600 French peacekeepers to bolster the poorly equipped African Union force of 2,500. The Obama administration has offered $100 million in equipment and assistance. Wealthy nations are funding a poorly-equipped regional peacekeeping force instead of authorizing more costly United Nations troops. It is still unclear whether the approach will work\u2014but it reflects new political realities in Africa, Europe and the United States. An increasingly assertive African Union, which has won praise for recent peacekeeping missions in Somalia, said it wanted to deploy forces in the Central African Republic, rather than use U.N. troops. With the continent now home to several of the fastest-growing economies in the world, African leaders are arguing they can sort out their own problems. Bolstered by economic growth sparked by Chinese investment in the continent, African Union leaders are eager to assert their growing economic and political power and remove all vestiges of Western colonialism.\n\nGiven the slow pace and high cost of creating a U.N. force to operate in the landlocked Central African country, American and European diplomats agreed to the joint AU-French intervention. In the United States and Europe, war weariness and fiscal crises have tempered the appetite for costly U.N. interventions. For years, Western governments demanded the United Nations shrink or eliminate its large, outdated peacekeeping missions in Haiti, Liberia and the Ivory Coast. They also called for the U.N.\u2019s 21,000-troop, $1.5 billion mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to shift to the country\u2019s east. U.N. officials, however, have generally resisted the changes, saying large missions remain necessary. At the same time, U.S. conservatives have long complained that Washington pays far too much of what they call a bloated U.N. peacekeeping budget. The world body spent $7.5 billion in 2013 on peacekeeping missions. The United States provided 28 percent of this funding\u2014roughly three times the amount paid by each of the next largest contributors, Japan, France, Germany and Britain. U.N. officials estimated last month that a U.N. peacekeeping force of roughly 6,000 to 9,000 troops would be needed to stabilize the country, largely ruled by autocrats since it gained independence from France in 1960. There were no exact cost estimates, but a similar U.N. mission in South Sudan costs $900 million a year. Some diplomats at the United Nations speculated that American officials backed the African Union-French force for cost reasons. A senior American official flatly denied this. \u201cThe issue was never one of money,\u201d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was about efficiency. The official said that quickly strengthening the 2,500-strong African Union force already on the ground was the fastest way to halt the killing. Creating a U.N. peacekeeping mission, the official insisted, could take months. \u201cWe have the $40 million in hand,\u201d the official said, referring to State Department funding provided last month, \u201cand we\u2019re moving to disperse it as quickly as possible. The priority is getting equipment for the AU force and also helping get them there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will the international community respond?", "author": "David Rohde", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Will the international community respond?", "title": "The Threat of Genocide in the Central African Republic", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/RTX16FCY/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/a-spiral-toward-genocide-in-the-heart-of-africa/282303/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fe8\"", "article_summary": "Muslim civilians in the Central African Republic, clutching machetes and crude, homemade weapons, prepared to fight off marauding Christians.\nChaos and sectarian killings have steadily spread throughout the Central African Republic since predominantly Muslim Seleka\u2014\u201cAlliance\u201d\u2014rebels ousted the Christian president, Francois Bozize, in March.\nAn increasingly assertive African Union, which has won praise for recent peacekeeping missions in Somalia, said it wanted to deploy forces in the Central African Republic, rather than use U.N. troops.\nWith the United Nations already carrying out 15 peacekeeping missions worldwide and Western militaries focused on counterterrorism missions, a new approach is unfolding in the Central African Republic.\nUnited Nations officials have warned\u2014in unusually blunt terms\u2014that the country contained \u201cthe seeds of a genocide.\u201d After failing to halt genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda, the United Nations now faces what the New York Times called a \u201creckoning\u201d in the Central African Republic."}
