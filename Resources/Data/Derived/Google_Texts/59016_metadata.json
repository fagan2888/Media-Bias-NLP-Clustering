Close\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever picked up a copy of the Binghamton Review, then you know they\u2019re not afraid to voice their political opinions. The opening sentence of their mission statement is \u201cBinghamton Review is a non-partisan, student-run periodical of conservative thought at Binghamton University,\u201d and later states \u201cit is our duty to expose the warped ideology of political correctness that dominates this university.\u201d Release sat down with the Review to discuss how their ideology relates to issues on campus.\n\nSince its inception in 1987, the Binghamton Review has been a conservative publication that has shifted more to incorporate the growing libertarian voice over the past years. With the libertarian interest growing, some members of the College Libertarians have also associated with and written for the Binghamton Review.\n\nWhile many college libertarians actively advocate for the legalization of marijuana and marriage equality across the country, especially at more liberal schools, many of their more conservative beliefs fall into the background.\n\nAt a meeting, Samson Audino, president of the College Libertarians and a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, spoke about Yik Yak and the allegations of racism across campus.\n\n\u201cWhat can\u2019t be forgotten is free speech is important at a public university,\u201d Audino said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to Students for Change\u2019s meeting with Harvey Stenger.\u201d\n\nSitting down with some editors from the Binghamton Review, we discussed issues on campus and throughout the country that they plan to take more steps towards.\n\nSome of the issues that the editors spoke about was opposing the National Security Agency\u2019s (NSA) collectivization of data and being against Obamacare. They also expressed their desire to raise political awareness across campus and their ongoing attempt to get individual racks for the Review\u2019s monthly publication.\n\nDuring the latest round of Student Association Executive Board elections, the Binghamton Review put out an article endorsing candidates as well as airing complaints with the current E-Board. While many organizations, as well as residential communities, decided not to endorse a candidate for vice president of multicultural affairs (VPMA), the Binghamton Review wrote, \u201cAs we have been asking for the last two decades, why exactly does this position exist?\u201d\n\nDaniel Milyavsky, editor emeritus of the Binghamton Review and vice president of the College Libertarians, said the Review decided not to endorse anyone for the position because it\u2019s not convinced anyone ever does anything substantial with the position.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who actually knows what the VPMA does on a daily basis,\u201d said Milyavsky, a senior majoring in biology.\n\nAfter discussing the VPMA, the discussion moved to Students for Change.\n\nMilyavsky complained about the recent Lecture Hall protests run by the advocacy group and said, \u201cYou will definitely see something about the protests in the Review soon,\u201d as well as his belief that they are an \u201canti-free speech group.\u201d He promised something written online by the week\u2019s end that will also be published in the Binghamton Review\u2019s April edition.\n\nSean Glendon, the editor-in-chief of the Review and a junior double-majoring in accounting and business administration, called Students for Change\u2019s demands to the University\u2019s administrators \u201cunrealistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to work together and not talk down to them,\u201d Glendon said.\n\nMilyavsky and Glendon also discussed one of Students for Change\u2019s long term goals: \u201cThere should be a mandatory cultural competency course as a general education requirement for all Binghamton University students in order to be eligible for graduation.\u201d\n\nThey explained how during the 1990s, the pluralism general education requirement was created for this reason. They also mentioned how the Binghamton Review had fought this requirement at the time, and Milyavsky commented that if Students for Change continues with this demand, \u201cWe\u2019re definitely gonna fight that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Pipe Dream", "description": "While many college libertarians actively advocate for the legalization of marijuana and marriage equality across the country, especially at more liberal schools, many of their more conservative beliefs fall into the background.", "title": "What would a libertarian do?", "url": "http://www.bupipedream.com/ac/51767/what-would-a-libertarian-do/", "image": "http://www.bupipedream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-FL-WEB18-1024x682.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"expiration_time": "2015-03-24", "published_time": "2015-03-20T01:24:17EDT", "section": "Arts & Culture", "author": "http://www.bupipedream.com/author/jsereno/"}, "fb": {"admins": 1352160452}, "twitter": {"site": "@bupipedream", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83f8\"", "article_summary": "With the libertarian interest growing, some members of the College Libertarians have also associated with and written for the Binghamton Review.\nSince its inception in 1987, the Binghamton Review has been a conservative publication that has shifted more to incorporate the growing libertarian voice over the past years.\nBinghamton Review on hot-button campus issuesFranz Lino/Photo Editor Pictured: Binghamton Review, the most opinionated rag on campus.\nCloseIf you\u2019ve ever picked up a copy of the Binghamton Review, then you know they\u2019re not afraid to voice their political opinions.\nDuring the latest round of Student Association Executive Board elections, the Binghamton Review put out an article endorsing candidates as well as airing complaints with the current E-Board."}
