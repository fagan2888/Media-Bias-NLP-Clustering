Attempts to schedule a visit are ongoing, but the start of the football season has complicated that effort.\n\nAlthough White House officials told the Journal they were still working to find a date for Florida State to visit, there may be reasons for the president to shy away from a meeting with the team.\n\nHeisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis Winston was accused of sexually assaulting another student at the university in 2012, and local authorities \u2014 who ultimately opted against filing criminal charges \u2014 were widely criticized for their handling of the case. The Department of Education has launched an investigation into the university's handling of the allegations.\n\nOver the summer, Winston was also cited for shoplifting after allegedly attempting to steal crab legs from a supermarket.\n\nEarlier this spring, the president announced a task force working to generate recommendations for how the federal government can help combat sexual assaults.\n\n\"When a young woman drops out of school after being attacked, that\u2019s not just a terrible loss for her, it\u2019s a loss for our country,\" Obama said when announcing the initiative.\n\nAt a science fair event at the White House in May, the president also opined on how he wanted to do more to highlight work done by scientists and entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s a tradition that when the NBA champions or the NFL champions or college football champions \u2014 if they win a championship, they get a chance to come and get highlighted in the White House and take a picture with the president,\" Obama said. \"But I believe that what\u2019s being done by these amazing young people who I had a chance to meet is even more important.\n\n\"And I\u2019m a big sports fan. Everybody knows that,\" he added. \"But what\u2019s happening here is more important. As a society, we have to celebrate outstanding work by young people in science at least as much as we do Super Bowl winners.\"\n\n\n\nThe president has met with every other champion from the major sports leagues, including the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, and men's college basketball, with the exceptions of the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Kings, who won their respective titles in June. Florida State's Bowl Championship Series title was secured in January.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Seminoles have yet to get their post-championship White House visit.", "description": "The Seminoles have yet to get their post-championship White House visit.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Seminoles have yet to get their post-championship White House visit.", "title": "Florida State, Obama can't get on same page", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/216059-fsu-obama-cant-get-on-same-page", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/216059-fsu-obama-cant-get-on-same-page", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-27T11:10-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "author": "Justin Sink", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-27T11:10:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/216059-fsu-obama-cant-get-on-same-page", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Seminoles have yet to get their post-championship White House visit.", "card": "summary", "title": "Florida State, Obama can't get on same page"}, "dcterms.title": "Florida State, Obama can't get on same page"}, "article_summary": "The Florida State Seminoles may become the first Obama-era college football national champions not to visit the White House for a celebratory meeting with the president.\nADVERTISEMENTAccording to email exchanges shared by the Florida university, the White House said the president was unavailable on 12 different dates submitted by the school, ranging from April to June.\nAlthough White House officials told the Journal they were still working to find a date for Florida State to visit, there may be reasons for the president to shy away from a meeting with the team.\nAt a science fair event at the White House in May, the president also opined on how he wanted to do more to highlight work done by scientists and entrepreneurs.\nAttempts to schedule a visit are ongoing, but the start of the football season has complicated that effort."}
