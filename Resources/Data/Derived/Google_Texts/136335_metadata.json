Allan Ajifo\n\nTwenty years ago, the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives launched Brain Awareness Week (BAW) \u2014 March 16 to 22 \u2014 in the U.S. to celebrate and increase the public\u2019s awareness of the progress and benefits of brain research. What began as a partnership with 160 organizations stateside has now expanded to thousands of organizations and hundreds of countries across the globe. Why then, is a growing global campaign still unknown to so many, its reach not quite on par with, say, heart health and sleep?\n\n\u201cI think brain health is lagged behind,\u201d neuroscientist Dr. Deborah Yurgelun-Todd, of The Brain Institute at the University of Utah, told Medical Daily. \u201cWhere other areas of health research have made advances, we haven\u2019t had as many good solutions to problems. So it\u2019s harder to know how to impact our brain\u2019s integrity.\u201d\n\nHard but not impossible, considering the \u201cunbelievable advances\u201d brain imaging tools have made in the last few decades. Neuroscientists are now able to study the naturally made nutrients that enhance the brain\u2019s power (such as citicoline, which we talk more about later), as well as pharmacology and the overall ways physical health impacts brain health. This may account for the public shift Yurgelun-Todd has seen among what people consider major health problems.\n\n\u201cI think people are less worried of dying of a heart attack and more worried with living with dementia,\u201d she said.\n\nDementia Fact Sheet\n\nThe World Health Organization classifies dementia as \u201ca syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behavior, and the ability to perform everyday activities.\u201d Worldwide, 47.5 million people have dementia and there are 7.7 million new cases each year. Despite the number of cases among older adults, it\u2019s not a normal part of aging.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common form of dementia, and WHO estimates it's the cause of 60 to 70 percent of dementia cases. There are, however, a variety of diseases that might cause the disease, including stroke. There\u2019s currently no cure and \u201cresearch identifying modifiable risk factors is scarce,\u201d but prevention focuses on lowering risk factors for vascular diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity.\n\nAnother way to preserve cognition is to enhance the body\u2019s natural stores of citicoline, \"a water-soluble compound that supplies precursors for the synthesis of phospholipids, including phosphatidyl-choline, a major constituent of brain tissue.\" Referred to by scientists as \u201cthe brain nutrient,\u201d Yurgelun-Todd has studied the ways citicoline works to enhance the brain \u2014 most prominently in early development and later in life after cell loss \u2014 over the last 15 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty logical that nutrition would be a critical thing to examine,\u201d she said. \u201cThe mechanism for [citicoline] is it increases two key neurotransmitters, which is what brain cells use to talk to each other: dopamine and norepinephrine.\u201d\n\nThese two neurotransmitters play a vital role when it comes to cognition and mood. In fact, a study published in the journal Methods and Finding in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology found citicoline improved memory deficits among older adults. Yurgelun-Todd herself conducted a similar study and found Cognizin citicoline \u2014 a branded form of citicoline developed by international manufacturer Kyowa Hakko \u2014 improved cognitive scores on attention and performance in adult women between the ages of 40 and 60; the findings were published in Food and Nutrition Sciences.\n\n\u201cThe body naturally stores other enhancing nutrients, but citicoline is key,\u201d Yurgelun-Todd said. \u201cIt has a much stronger impact.\u201d\n\nWhat Todd was surprised to see was how quickly citicoline impacted the brain; there were benefits after just four weeks of supplementation. And patients self-reported benefits that the scientists weren\u2019t looking for. Some reported reduced cravings for food and cigarattes, while others reported improved skin care. These anecdotes have now provided groundwork for future research, namely those tied to reward circuitry, or the brain\u2019s reward center.\n\nFood cravings and substance abuse target the brain\u2019s reward system, and Yurgelun-Todd is especially interested in exploring substance abuse. There are currently trials involving meth users who are taking Cognizin citicoline, and so far, they\u2019re showing improvements. Previously, this supplement was limited to patients suffering from severe neurological disorders, such as post-stroke, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. But as Yurgelun-Todd is learning, Cognizin citicoline doubles as preventive treatment.\n\n\u201cNo one was thinking how to use this in healthy individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about prevention in their 20s and 30s. I know I was more worried about toning my body in my 20s.\u201d\n\nTips and tricks for improved brain health. Porter Novelli\n\nHow To Enhance Cognition\n\nCognizin citicoline is a pure form of citicoline, and it's marketed as such in order to differentiate from other, unsubtantiated citicoline supplements. Strictly using this supplement is partly how Yurgelun-Todd assures her collaborators she isn\u2019t \u201cgoing over to the dark side.\u201d The dark side being the shady, dishonest labeling system behind many popular supplements.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at whether the product is reliable and well-made,\u201d she said. \u201cCognizin citicoline is provided to us by a good company.\u201d Those interested in taking this branded supplement can search retailers here, or otherwise focus their own supplement research on scientific evidence that\u2019s been published (as Yurgelun-Todd admitted to doing herself.)\n\nTaking a supplement, however, isn\u2019t the only step to take toward improved brain health. Eating well, getting regular exercise, and enough sleep are sort of the three pillars of a healthy brain. You'll notice it doesn't stray from the staple advice your parents gave you growing up. With respect to exercise, a flexible body translates to a flexible brain; nutrients flow better and are delivered to the brain easier when you move more.\n\nCognitive training, however, is not a surefire method for success. Like supplements, the claims attached to these apps (Lumosity being a popular one) are heavily debated. Yurgelun-Todd told us she's \u201coptimistically cautious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think there are some training tools that can be valuable for some populations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the supplement world, too; many products aren\u2019t substantiated, but that\u2019s not to mean some aren\u2019t worthwhile. What we know is doing anything by practicing over and over usually leads to improvement.\u201d\n\nThis is known as the practice effect, the scientific phrase for \u201cimprovements in cognitive test performance due to repeated exposure to test materials.\u201d Some research suggests these effects are sources of error, but a 2007 study found they may provide useful information for predicting cognitive outcome.\n\n\u201cWhen my dad was in assisted living, he downloaded and played games [designed] to improve brain health. There weren\u2019t improvements, but he enjoyed the socialization and competition aspect of it,\u201d Yurgelun-Todd said. \u201cThere\u2019s lot to be said for engaging this way.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Yurgelun-Todd is working to get across the fact that her research (and presumably those of other neuroscientists) is aimed at the healthy individual who wants to improve their personal best. Supplements and cognitive enhancers aren't exclusive to the neurologically impaired, either. This is a critical aspect of health people of all ages should consider in order to preserve their brain\u2019s functionality over the course of their life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful [people] pay attention to this message the same way they do when it comes to daily vitamins and exercise,\u201d Yurgelun-Todd concluded.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "brain, awareness, week, 2015, how, brain, research, has, progressed, and, ways, you, can, enhance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Our understanding of the brain has come so far in the last few decades.", "title": "What We've Learned About The Brain In The Past 20 Years", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-awareness-week-2015-how-brain-research-has-progressed-and-ways-you-can-enhance-325732", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/14/14599057004984399e790o.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our understanding of the brain has come so far in the last few decades.", "title": "What We've Learned About The Brain In The Past 20 Years", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-awareness-week-2015-how-brain-research-has-progressed-and-ways-you-can-enhance-325732", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/14/14599057004984399e790o.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/14/14599057004984399e790o.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-03-14T14:02:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T16:23:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Our understanding of the brain has come so far in the last few decades."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think brain health is lagged behind,\u201d neuroscientist Dr. Deborah Yurgelun-Todd, of The Brain Institute at the University of Utah, told Medical Daily.\nI know I was more worried about toning my body in my 20s.\u201dTips and tricks for improved brain health.\nAllan AjifoTwenty years ago, the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives launched Brain Awareness Week (BAW) \u2014 March 16 to 22 \u2014 in the U.S. to celebrate and increase the public\u2019s awareness of the progress and benefits of brain research.\n\u201cWhere other areas of health research have made advances, we haven\u2019t had as many good solutions to problems.\n\u201cWhen my dad was in assisted living, he downloaded and played games [designed] to improve brain health."}
