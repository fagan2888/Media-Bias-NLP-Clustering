Founder Ning Liang points to the cappuccino machine, the bike rack, a futon for naps and four desks.\n\nBut, he clarifies, his team didn\u2019t need all of them. \u201cActually it was just three of us, over the course of about maybe three days.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, HealthSherpa serves a very limited purpose. It just helps online shoppers get price quotes and contact insurance companies. It\u2019s not integrated with the Social Security Administration or the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nLiang says his site is not a full-on replacement for the government\u2019s site. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018This is the Affordable Care Act portal.\u2019 And we\u2019re saying, \u2018Shop here.\u2019\u201d\n\nLiang, who\u2019s 27, goes to his Mac and pulls up the two websites for a side-by-side comparison. The homepage of Healthcare.gov has three buttons, \u201cand then a bunch of icons that look like buttons but actually aren\u2019t buttons.\u201d\n\nIf you manage to click the right link, you have to plow through about half an hour of questions and legal jargon before ever getting an estimate.\n\nAt HealthSherpa, there\u2019s just a box for your zip code. Hit enter, and get basic prices for local insurance plans. \u201cWe want you to get that payoff as soon as possible, maybe 5 seconds.\u201d\n\nLiang says about 85 percent of users complete the process, from entering their zip code, age and family information, to getting insurance estimates and contacts.\n\nLiang is not the only one with tips on how to build an e-commerce site. If you call around Silicon Valley, every other CEO has advice for the government.\n\nTake Tom Lounibos with SOASTA, which provides services to test websites and web applications: \u201cIt appears the journey was not tested end to end. They might have tested the ability to search for a plan.\u201d\n\nRob Bernshteyn, CEO of Coupa, a cloud financial applications company, says the scope of the website was just too broad: \u201cScope creep tends to develop in these types of deployments. People take shortcuts, get sloppy, redundant code.\u201d\n\nJonas Jacobi with Kaazing, which builds interactive platforms, says the government website was built on old technology: \u201cStatic platforms are the past. It\u2019s like buying a used car. It won\u2019t last.\u201d\n\nGoogle, Oracle and Red Hat have joined the effort to fix Healthcare.gov. The Obama administration says it\u2019s time to stop belaboring the problems because they\u2019re in the midst of getting fixed.\n\nBut a former federal government employee says we should fixate a bit more.\n\nSumit Agarwal is a startup founder in Silicon Valley and a former head of Google\u2019s mobile product management. In 2010 he joined the Obama administration, managing Internet contracts for the Department of Defense, where he worked for a year and a half. \u201cI do think it\u2019s an important case study. If we had a government that couldn\u2019t build a bridge or lay a mile of road, we\u2019d say it\u2019s a dysfunctional government. In 2013, a website is absolutely a simple, core piece of infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAgarwal says the Department of Health and Human Services got stuck in the traditional bidding process, which limited its choices of contractors.\n\nBut there\u2019s another federal agency that doesn\u2019t have to do that. The Defense Department has a lot more leeway. That\u2019s why the National Security Agency can build (and hack) some of the best websites. It gets to call the companies it wants.\n\n\u201cIn the name of national security, a DoD-oriented component can say, \u2018Look, I have a totally legitimate, strategic need to be able to reach out to this private sector company. I\u2019m not willing to go through the contracting process,\u2019\u201d Agarwal says. \u201cThat\u2019s what allows DoD in many cases to go work with someone other than a large-scale government contractor.\u201d\n\nAgarwal says if the health care people got as much freedom to choose private partners as the military people have, the next Healthcare.gov would be a better online shopping experience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Entrepreneurs says health-care website suffers from flawed approach in contracting and development.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Tech Advice on Building a Better Healthcare.gov\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2013\\/11\\/12\\/117996\\/Affordable-Care-Act-health-care-healthsherpa\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-13 12:21:18\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-11-13 12:21:18\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":117996,\"author_id\":\"1340\",\"author_name\":\"Aarti Shahani\",\"author_display_name\":\"Aarti Shahani\",\"tags\":[\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Health\",\"health care\",\"healthsherpa\"],\"categories\":[\"Technology\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2013\\/11\\/RS7542_Health-Sherpa-scr-e1384309899136.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "Entrepreneurs says health-care website suffers from flawed approach in contracting and development.", "title": "Tech Advice on Building a Better Healthcare.gov", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2013/11/12/117996/Affordable-Care-Act-health-care-healthsherpa/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2013/11/RS7542_Health-Sherpa-scr-e1384309899136.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "affordable care act,health,health care,healthsherpa", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7eed\"", "article_summary": "It won\u2019t last.\u201dGoogle, Oracle and Red Hat have joined the effort to fix Healthcare.gov.\n\u201cActually it was just three of us, over the course of about maybe three days.\u201dTo be fair, HealthSherpa serves a very limited purpose.\nFounder Ning Liang points to the cappuccino machine, the bike rack, a futon for naps and four desks.\nThe Obama administration says it\u2019s time to stop belaboring the problems because they\u2019re in the midst of getting fixed.\nLiang is not the only one with tips on how to build an e-commerce site."}
