But the little-understood reality is that the \u201csmart grid\u201d will never become a reality until jurisdictions develop \u201csmart regulation.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, there remains huge resistance to passing through to residential consumers dynamic prices that reflect system supply and demand at any particular moment. (This is not the same as time-of-use pricing, in which retail prices vary by time of day but not as a function of real-time system conditions.) Only after consumers are exposed to dynamic prices as the default option will a strong market pull materialize for smart household technologies that seamlessly reduce consumption when prices are high.\n\nRegulators claim that they want to \u201cprotect\u201d consumers from volatile prices. But utility rates need to cover costs, so consumers still pay high prices\u2013just averaged over time so that they have no opportunity to reduce consumption (and lower their electricity bills) when the system is stressed. And dynamic pricing doesn\u2019t prevent risk-averse consumers from buying contracts that eliminate most or all of their price risk.\n\nWhat may ultimately overcome the resistance to dynamic pricing\u2013and a truly \u201csmart grid\u201d\u2013is the push to obtain a high fraction of electricity from renewable energy. Without dynamic pricing, the intermittence of wind and solar can create major challenges for managing the grid. But showing high prices to consumers when the wind isn\u2019t blowing and the sun isn\u2019t shining will go a long way toward making renewable energy viable at scale. If countries with aggressive renewable ambitions like Denmark realize that they need dynamic pricing to make their dreams a reality, they can become the real leaders in smart grid\u2013and in the process show the rest of us that high renewable-energy fractions are possible.\n\nMark Thurber is associate director at the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University.\n\nRead the latest Energy Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "What energy buzzword do people misuse and misunderstand?", "title": "A Simple Way to Make the \u2018Smart Grid\u2019 Brilliant", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/25/a-simple-way-to-make-the-smart-grid-brilliant/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "A Simple Way to Make the \u2018Smart Grid\u2019 Brilliant", "description": "What energy buzzword do people misuse and misunderstand?", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "What energy buzzword do people misuse and misunderstand?", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-11-25T12:50:42-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/25/a-simple-way-to-make-the-smart-grid-brilliant/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-4633", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "What energy buzzword do people misuse and misunderstand?", "title": "A Simple Way to Make the \u2018Smart Grid\u2019 Brilliant", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/25/a-simple-way-to-make-the-smart-grid-brilliant/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-4633", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-25T15:06:27-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd256\"", "article_summary": "Without dynamic pricing, the intermittence of wind and solar can create major challenges for managing the grid.\n\u201cSmart grid\u201d brings to mind a set of technologies to optimize how electricity is supplied to and consumed by households and businesses.\nAnd dynamic pricing doesn\u2019t prevent risk-averse consumers from buying contracts that eliminate most or all of their price risk.\nBut showing high prices to consumers when the wind isn\u2019t blowing and the sun isn\u2019t shining will go a long way toward making renewable energy viable at scale.\nBut the little-understood reality is that the \u201csmart grid\u201d will never become a reality until jurisdictions develop \u201csmart regulation.\u201dSpecifically, there remains huge resistance to passing through to residential consumers dynamic prices that reflect system supply and demand at any particular moment."}
