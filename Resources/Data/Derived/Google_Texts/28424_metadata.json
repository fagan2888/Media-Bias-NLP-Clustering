Jackson).\n\nBut if that\u2019s what it takes to wake people up to the seriousness of our situation, then F-bombs away.\n\nThe US right now is allowed to borrow up to $16.699 trillion. That figure was raised in 2011 \u2014 during the last threatened government shutdown \u2014 by $2.1 trillion, with $1.2 trillion of that increase coming just last January.\n\nWe\u2019ve blown through this already.\n\nUS debt grows every second by hundreds of thousands of dollars and stood at $16.967 trillion when I last checked at 1:15 p.m. on Monday.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew announced a few months ago that he would take extraordinary measures (read: finagling and accounting tricks) to delay the debt limit issue.\n\nNow the time has come. The debt limit will be reached Oct. 17 \u2014 unless, of course, there are more tricks that the Treasury hasn\u2019t tried yet.\n\nAs it now stands, the Republicans won\u2019t deal with the debt limit issue or the government shutdown unless they get something.\n\nBoehner seems to want spending cuts, although a portion of the membership he supposedly controls in the House seems to want ObamaCare, aka the Affordable Health Care Act, gutted before we move forward.\n\nThe White House, on the other hand, wants to give nothing. Raise the debt ceiling, reopen the government \u2014 or else, is what the president is saying.\n\nWhich side is right? Neither one. Which side will come out looking worse in this fight? Who the hell cares?\n\nIt\u2019s the country and its citizens who are going to be the losers.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been writing for years, the worst thing that could happen is for our elected officials to lose control over the US economy.\n\nThere was a good example on Monday of what could happen.\n\nAccording to a report in the Financial Times, \u201cThe Chinese government has warned the US that the government shutdown and prospect of Washington\u2019s first ever default were threatening the value of its US investments.\u201d\n\nBeijing, the paper reported, has told the US that \u201cthe clock is ticking\u201d and urged Washington to \u201censure the safety of the Chinese investments.\u201d\n\nYou need to understand a couple of things to get the full meaning of this.\n\nFor many years to come, we will have to endure lectures from the Chinese, as well as Japan, banks in the Caribbean, OPEC, Brazil, Taiwan, etc. The list of countries that have invested heavily in US government securities is enormous.\n\nChina alone held $1.275 trillion of US government securities in June. And the number was already declining as that country showed concern about how the US was handling its finances.\n\nIn addition to the budget and debt-ceiling issues, the Chinese and other investors are also concerned about the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions.\n\nUsing its controversial quantitative-easing program, the Fed competes against legitimate bond buyers.\n\nSo when the Chinese are bidding to purchase US bonds, the Fed causes them and others to pay more by having QE act as a shill buyer.\n\nAdd that to budget and the debt-ceiling concerns, and you can understand the Chinese concern.\n\nYou might ask: Who cares if China and the others are worried? Who cares if they pull money out of the US or don\u2019t invest in the future?\n\nBut we\u2019ve gotten ourselves into such a pickle that we can\u2019t survive without these big foreign-bond buyers. A lecture alone from the Chinese might be enough to send interest rates here rising; an actual boycott of our bonds would be a complete disaster.\n\nYou and the company you work for would be paying a lot more to borrow money if interest rates rise.\n\nThere would be widespread layoffs. The US government would be paying even more of its revenue to service debt on money already spent. The stock market would collapse. And the economy could spiral downward out of control.\n\nWhat should be done?\n\nThe Republicans should be willing to approve a budget and debt ceiling in exchange for substantial cuts in federal spending. Defunding ObamaCare just isn\u2019t going to happen, so they should move on to other expenses and not just closing tax loopholes and the old standby \u201cgetting rid of wasteful spending.\u201d\n\nThe president and the Democrats can\u2019t expect to raise the debt ceiling and get a budget without giving something. The fact that the deficit is projected to be only $642 billion this year is nonsense \u2014 a lucky bounce in tax receipts.\n\nObama doesn\u2019t know it yet, but history will not treat him well unless he gets spending under control.\n\nAnd if he doesn\u2019t pull things together by next Thursday, he could secure the title as the worst President in modern history.\n\nDo I have to say again that I\u2019m f\u2014ing mad?
