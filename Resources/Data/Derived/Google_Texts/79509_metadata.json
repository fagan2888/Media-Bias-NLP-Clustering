REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n4722183\n\nA provision of the Affordable Care Act established to advance Obamacare could do just the opposite if a Republican is voted into the White House in the next election cycle.\n\nSection 1332 of the law, set to take effect in 2017, would allow conservative states to to change how they implement their health care policies without a congressional vote if the executive branch approves of the plan.\n\nUnder the provision, if states provide a reasonable alternative that covers the same amount of people and doesn\u2019t increase the deficit, requirements including the individual and employer mandates could be eliminated.\n\nThe waiver would also give states flexibility on subsides and would potentially allow them to dispose of the online exchange.\n\nArkansas is the first right-leaning state to consider using the measure, Politico reports.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that we can get flexibility with the Obama administration,\u201d Arkansas Surgeon General Greg Bledsoe told the publication. \u201cBut if we can\u2019t get the flexibility that we want, we believe that a Republican administration would be a lot more flexible. We think we\u2019d have a lot more common ground.\u201d\n\nWhile section 1332 does provide some flexibility, it may not be the easy fix some conservatives are hoping for.\n\nAccording to Edmund Haislmainer, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the waiver doesn\u2019t come without its caveats.\n\nHaislmainer said, while one may be exempt from the mandate, the need for an equivalent could drive up the cost of care.\n\n\u201cIt would have minimal impact on bringing premiums down,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first issue he cited involves a provision that limits age variations to a maximum three to one ratio, meaning an elderly person can\u2019t be charged more than three times more than a younger, healthier adult for the cost of their premium. Subsidies would then be utilized by a less needy demographic.\n\nHaislmainer also said states could face issues in creating an alternative due to a provision involving preexisting conditions.\n\n\u201cWithout the flexibility to adopt better rules on guaranteed issue and preexisting condition exclusions (something Sec. 1332 also does not permit), it is also difficult to see how a state could get rid of the individual mandate as part of any alternative design,\u201d he said.\n\nStuart Butler of the Brookings Institute wrote in a policy paper, even with certain limitations in place, it \u201ccould lead to state health plans in the future that change the ACA beyond recognition.\u201d\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
