Gaylord Nelson founded Earth Day in 1970, his primary objective was to demonstrate to political leaders the \u201cbroad and deep support\u201d people had for the environment. Nelson knew the day would be a success, with peaceful demonstrations catching on from coast-to-coast \u2014 but he never could have imagined the actual response.\n\n\u201cTwo thousand colleges and universities, 10,000 high schools and grade schools, and several thousand communities in all, more than 20 million Americans participated in one of the most exciting and significant grassroots efforts in the history of this country,\u201d Nelson wrote in an article published by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1980. \u201cEarth Day 1970 made it clear that we could summon the public support, the energy, and commitment to save our environment.\u201d\n\nSo this year, on Earth Day\u2019s 45th anniversary, the Earth Day Network hopes to remind people there\u2019s strength in numbers. The network proposes 2015 could be an environmental game changer, \u201cthe year in which economic growth and sustainability join hands,\u201d if everyone can rally for change.\n\nThe thing is, for those of us not already subscribed to a sustainable, \u201cgreen\u201d lifestyle, it's overwhelming to think of where to start. And if you don\u2019t go big, go home, right?\n\nNot necessarily. The big issues, like global warming and toxic waste, certainly warrant attention, but it\u2019s possible to go green on a small, equally impactful scale. Enter: grocery shopping.\n\n\"A consumer's simple act of buying products that help preserve natural resources and contribute to responsible and sustainable growth is extremely powerful,\u201d Betsy Foster, Whole Foods Market global vice president of growth and business development, said in a press release. \u201cWhen consumers choose environmentally-friendly alternatives with their dollars, it sends a clear message to companies.\u201d\n\nEverything, from a food\u2019s packaging materials to the unwrapped product, can have an impact on the planet. QSR Magazine reported companies have started to use renewable fiber, post-consumer waste (recycled trash), and/or plant-based coatings to \u201cintegrate sustainability into every step of the packaging development process.\u201d Many also use recycled paperboard (which we\u2019ll get a bit more into later).\n\nCompanies are also going through the process of getting their food products certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Fair Trade USA. According to the USDA, organic agriculture \u201cproduces products using methods that preserve the environment and avoid most synthetic materials, such as pesticides and antibiotics.\u201d Organic farms and processors themselves preserve natural resources and biodiversity and support animal health and welfare, among other things. Not to mention supporting local farmers keeps them in business.\n\nFor Fair Trade Certified products, shoppers are required to \u201cpay a small premium for high-quality foods produced on the principles of equity and sustainability,\u201d Fair Trade USA reported. In addition, Fair Trade farmers \u201cearn higher prices and achieve the capability to compete in the global marketplace through direct, long-term relationships with international buyers.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not always thinking of the farmer, or the type of packaging a food comes in, especially when a busy scheduled only allows for a power trip to the store. But choosing to be more aware of the efforts companies are making, and acknowledging them by buying one or two of their products each time you\u2019re in the store, can make a difference. The bottom line is, small choices add up to big change.\n\nTo get you started (for real this time), we\u2019ve rounded up five of the more environmentally responsible companies we\u2019ve recently come across to serve as inspiration.\n\nAlter Eco\n\nBased in San Francisco, Alter Eco\u2019s very mission is \u201cglobal transformation through ethical relationships with small-scale farmers, an integral sustainability orientation at every point on the supply chain.\u201d Their products are USDA Organic, Fair Trade, and gluten-free certified, respectively, and their packaging process is equally impressive. Their chocolate truffles, for example, arrive in a recycled box, while the inner bag and individual wrappers can both be entirely composted.\n\nTRY: Salted Caramel Truffles\n\nLundberg Farms\n\nLundberg Farms has been producing quality rice and rice products since 1937. According to their website, the third and fourth generations are continuing their family\u2019s commitment to eco-positive farming methods, as well as wholesome, healthful products. Their products are also USDA Organic, Fair Trade, plus Vegan and Non-GMO Project certified. What\u2019s more is their boxes are printed on 100 percent recycled paperboard.\n\nAs the Recycled Paperboard Alliance explains, paperboard \u201cis made from recovered paper that has been diverted from the solid waste stream and later collected, separated, cleaned and recycled for use.\u201d\n\nTRY: Toasted Almond Pilaf\n\nNumi Organic Tea\n\nNumi Tea is \u201creportedly the largest, premium, organic, Fair Trade certified tea companies\u201d \u2014 even their tea bags are biodegradable. Using the Environmental Paper Network calculator, Numi calculated their choices conserves 9, 037 trees; 581,216 pounds of landfill; over four million gallons of water; and over 800,000 greenhouse emissions. It\u2019s CEO and co-founder Ahmed Rahim\u2019s goal to be of service to those focused on caring for their community and creating positive change for our environment. Their actual tea flavors, too, are quality.\n\nTRY: Indulgent Tea: Chocolate Earl Grey and Turmeric Tea: Amber Sun\n\nEarthbound Farm\n\nHappy people, happy planet, and happy place are the cornerstones at Earthbound Farm. What began as a 2.5 acres labor of organic love has grown to 50,000 acres. EB Farm products range from smoothie starter kits to pre-packaged, powerhouse meals \u2014 and they\u2019re are all USDA Organic certified. This means their produce is all grown without any toxic chemicals, GMOs, or irradiation. And in 2015, EB Farm predicts they\u2019ll keep 16.1 million pounds of synthetic fertilizers and toxic pesticides out of the environment. Plus, the plastic their meals come is 100 percent post-consumer recycled PET plastic.\n\nTRY: Kale Caesar salad\n\nMary\u2019s Gone Crackers\n\nMary Waldner first started baking gluten-free crackers and pretzels shortly after she learned she had Celiac disease. By using \u201cvery cool ingredients,\u201d like rice, quinoa, red palm oil, and turmeric, Waldner told Medical Daily she could cook (and provide) whole, real gluten-free food (also certified organic and vegan) that tasted great too. \"That's number one to me,\" she said. \"Why eat something if it doesn\u2019t taste good?\u201d\n\nThese ingredients have a positive impact on the Earth; it all folds into Waldner's idea of \"conscious eating.\" To her, \"being conscious about what you eat means you're conscious about where it\u2019s from, the impact it's having on your body, and the impact it\u2019s having on the environment.\"\n\n\"Wake up and pay attention,\" Waldner said. \"You can have really good-tasting food that nourishes body[and the environment].\"\n\nTRY: Ancient Spice with Turmeric THINS crackers", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "earth, day, 2015, 5, food, companies, make, it, easy, go, green", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The easiest place to go green is the grocery store.", "title": "5 Food Companies That Make It Easy To Go Green", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/earth-day-2015-5-food-companies-make-it-easy-go-green-330272", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/grocery-store.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The easiest place to go green is the grocery store.", "title": "5 Food Companies That Make It Easy To Go Green", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/earth-day-2015-5-food-companies-make-it-easy-go-green-330272", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/grocery-store.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/22/grocery-store.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-04-22T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T21:35:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The easiest place to go green is the grocery store."}, "article_summary": "Companies are also going through the process of getting their food products certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Fair Trade USA.\nFor Fair Trade Certified products, shoppers are required to \u201cpay a small premium for high-quality foods produced on the principles of equity and sustainability,\u201d Fair Trade USA reported.\nEB Farm products range from smoothie starter kits to pre-packaged, powerhouse meals \u2014 and they\u2019re are all USDA Organic certified.\nTheir products are also USDA Organic, Fair Trade, plus Vegan and Non-GMO Project certified.\nBy using \u201cvery cool ingredients,\u201d like rice, quinoa, red palm oil, and turmeric, Waldner told Medical Daily she could cook (and provide) whole, real gluten-free food (also certified organic and vegan) that tasted great too."}
