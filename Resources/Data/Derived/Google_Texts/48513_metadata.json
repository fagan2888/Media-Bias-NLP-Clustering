Period.\n\nThat's not Senator Elizabeth Warren talking. That's the latest conclusion of new research from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIn fact, researchers found that when the top earners in society make more money, it actually slows down economic growth. On the other hand, when poorer people earn more, society as a whole benefits.\n\nThe researchers calculated that when the richest 20% of society increase their income by one percentage point, the annual rate of growth shrinks by nearly 0.1% within five years.\n\nThis shows that \"the benefits do not trickle down,\" the researchers wrote in their report, which analyzed over 150 countries.\n\nBy contrast, when the lowest 20% of earners see their income grow by one percentage point, the rate of growth increases by nearly 0.4% over the same period.\n\nRelated: Class war locks poor kids out of top U.K. jobs\n\nThe new report called widening inequality \"the defining challenge of our time,\" echoing earlier comments from President Obama.\n\nThe authors explain that high levels of income inequality drag down growth because poor people struggle to pay for health care and education, which hurts society as a whole.\n\n\"For instance, it can lead to under-investment in education as poor children end up in lower-quality schools and are less able to go on to college,\" the report says. \"As a result, labor productivity could be lower than it would have been in a more equitable world.\"\n\nThe report builds upon research from other international organizations and Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate who has been campaigning against rising inequality.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "trickle down, wrong, inequality, imf, unfair, fairness, trickle down theory, trick down economics, economics, joseph stiglitz", "title": "The \"trickle down theory\" is dead wrong", "og": {"site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "The economic theory that wealth trickles down from the rich to the poor is dead wrong, according to new research from the International Monetary Fund.", "title": "The \"trickle down theory\" is dead wrong", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/15/news/economy/trickle-down-theory-wrong-imf/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150615153437-inequality-homeless-new-york-780x439.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "news", "author": "Alanna Petroff", "vr": {"category": "economy", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-15T11:52:29", "keywords": "trickle down, wrong, inequality, imf, unfair, fairness, trickle down theory, trick down economics, economics, joseph stiglitz", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "subsection": "economy", "date": "2015-06-15 11:52:29", "twitter": {"description": "The economic theory that wealth trickles down from the rich to the poor is dead wrong, according to new research from the International Monetary Fund.", "title": "The \"trickle down theory\" is dead wrong", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/15/news/economy/trickle-down-theory-wrong-imf/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150615153437-inequality-homeless-new-york-540x304.jpg", "site": "@CNNMoney", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "The economic theory that wealth trickles down from the rich to the poor is dead wrong, according to new research from the International Monetary Fund."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd368\"", "article_summary": "This shows that \"the benefits do not trickle down,\" the researchers wrote in their report, which analyzed over 150 countries.\nWealth does not trickle down from the rich to the poor.\nThe report builds upon research from other international organizations and Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate who has been campaigning against rising inequality.\nIn fact, researchers found that when the top earners in society make more money, it actually slows down economic growth.\nThe authors explain that high levels of income inequality drag down growth because poor people struggle to pay for health care and education, which hurts society as a whole."}
