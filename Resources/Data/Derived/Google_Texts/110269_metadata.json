Berg largely defended the recent actions of the legislature on matters of education policy, asserting that North Carolina\u2019s decline in academic success began well before the recent takeover of the state legislature by Republicans.\n\nWatch Berg\u2019s presentation at the John Locke Foundation luncheon in its entirety here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28cc\"", "article_summary": "BEST NC\u2019s education vision has been in process for a year, said Berg, and once it goes live, \u2018real action\u2019 will result.\nRecently, Berg penned a rebuttal to education blogger James Hogan\u2019s chronicling of North Carolina\u2019s war on education.\nBEST NC, which stands for Business for Educational Success and Transformation in North Carolina, was formed in 2013 by a coalition of business leaders who wanted a seat at the table when state leaders crafted education policy.\nWorking collaboratively with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, Berg said the business community should be the one to set a vision for public education in North Carolina \u2014as they did in Massachusetts decades ago\u2014because they are the ultimate end consumer of education.\nNorth Carolina sits well below the mark in terms of the necessarily amount of postsecondary education that workers need in order to compete in today\u2019s job market, ranking North Carolina 46th in the nation in educational attainment, said Berg."}
