To say he has a worldview at all is probably generous. He\u2019s a grab bag of ethno-nationalist platitudes and half-articulated grievances, with a menagerie of grade school insults sprinkled in between. His blend of bombast and bigotry has catapulted him to the top of the GOP polls, however, and very likely to the nomination.\n\nIt will also cost the Republicans the White House in 2016.\n\nTrump has splintered the party, exposed its tenuous fault lines. The culture wars and religious pandering have held the base together, but traditional conservatives \u2013 voters who are socially moderate but fiscally conservative \u2013 have been alienated by the emergent extremism. Joel Kotkin of the Orange County Register put it well: The GOP now \u201cconsists of interest groups that so broadly dislike each other that they share little common ground.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s rise makes a lot more sense against this backdrop. He\u2019s exploited the party\u2019s internal divisions by appealing solely to voter frustration. \u201cFor years the GOP failed to give people a clear sense of our principles and plans.\u201d Republican Sen. Ben Sasse recently told the Washington Post. \u201cDonald Trump has filled that vacuum with lots of showmanship, hooey, and bluster, but he\u2019s done more than just that. He\u2019s waged an effective war on almost every plank of the Republican Party\u2019s platform.\u201d\n\nSasse is half-right: Trump has indeed filled a vacuum, but he\u2019s done so, in part, because the Republican Party doesn\u2019t have a consistent platform. The GOP drifted away from whatever principles it once had and is now a jumble of malcontents and culture warriors. Which is why Trump\u2019s indignant bullshit routine resonates so deeply.\n\nThe problem, though, is that as much as Trump appeals to the angry conservative base, he\u2019s a repellent to everyone else \u2013 including many conventional Republican voters. A New York Times/CBS News poll shows that 60 percent of Republicans are \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Trump and the GOP race more generally. 88 percent of Republicans say the party is divided. A paltry 51 percent of Republicans have a favorable opinion of their own front-runner.\n\nThat\u2019s a recipe for defeat in November.\n\nTo make matters worse, President Obama has a 50 percent approval rating \u2013 the highest it\u2019s been in two years. The economy has recovered; unemployment has dipped below 5 percent; Obamacare is working; and nearly 14 million jobs have been created in the last 69 months. History suggests these numbers will favor the Democratic Party in the general election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From a brokered convention, split GOP,  job growth and Obama's approval rating, the odds against Trump are \"yuuge\"", "title": "The recipe for a Trump defeat: Don\u2019t let the primaries fool you, the ingredients are there for a happy November for Democrats", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From a brokered convention, split GOP,  job growth and Obama's approval rating, the odds against Trump are \"yuuge\"", "title": "The recipe for a Trump defeat: Don\u2019t let the primaries fool you, the ingredients are there for a happy November for Democrats", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/24/the_recipe_for_a_trump_defeat_dont_let_the_primaries_fool_you_the_ingredients_are_there_for_a_happy_november_for_democrats/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/gop-2016-trump.jpeg87-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From a brokered convention, split GOP,  job growth and Obama's approval rating, the odds against Trump are \"yuuge\"", "title": "The recipe for a Trump defeat: Don\u2019t let the primaries fool you, the ingredients are there for a happy November for Democrats", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/gop-2016-trump.jpeg87-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, President Obama, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, President Obama, Republican Party, Elections News, News, Politics NewsDonald Trump\u2019s worldview is incoherent.\nThe problem, though, is that as much as Trump appeals to the angry conservative base, he\u2019s a repellent to everyone else \u2013 including many conventional Republican voters.\n\u201cDonald Trump has filled that vacuum with lots of showmanship, hooey, and bluster, but he\u2019s done more than just that.\nA New York Times/CBS News poll shows that 60 percent of Republicans are \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Trump and the GOP race more generally.\nHe\u2019s a grab bag of ethno-nationalist platitudes and half-articulated grievances, with a menagerie of grade school insults sprinkled in between."}
