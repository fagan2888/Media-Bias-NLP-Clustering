Goldman Sachs is urging junior staff to take weekends off.\n\nThis surge in corporate beneficence isn't an indication that employers are becoming kinder and gentler: It's about the bottom line. After years in which the ease of instant communication via email and smartphones allowed bosses to place greater and greater demands on white-collar workers, some companies are beginning to set limits, recognizing that successful employees must be able to escape from work.\n\n\u201cIndustry is now responding,\u201d said Cary Cooper, a professor of organizational psychology and health at Lancaster University, who says the imperative to be constantly reachable by iPhone or tablet is taking a toll on the work delivered at the office. \u201cEmployees are turning up, but they're not delivering anything.\u201d\n\nAfter seeing colleagues lose their jobs during the Great Recession, workers are more inclined to come to work, even when sick, surveys show. After hours, physical presence is replaced by the next best thing \u2014 a virtual one. Many employees fear switching off, instead deciding to work on vacation, during dinner and in bed with the help of smartphones, laptops and tablet computers.\n\nPeople also have more data than ever to process \u2014 whether they ask for it or not. Information overload cost American businesses just under $1 trillion in employee time lost to needless emails and other distractions in 2010, according to Jonathan Spira, chief analyst of the New York research firm Basex.\n\nThe cost of replacing employees who leave in search of better work conditions is also a concern. A study from the Center for American Progress put the cost of turnover at just over a fifth of the employee's salary for people making up to $75,000 a year. That goes up exponentially for top managers, with turnover costs as high as 213 percent of salary for very highly paid positions.\n\nAfter worrying about trimming staff numbers during the recession, employers are focusing on how to keep those who are left from burning out.\n\nJob safety\n\nOne strategy, which Goldman Sachs has been trying, is to make people feel less at risk in their jobs. That's not easy in most companies, much less so in investment banking, infamous for its competitive environment and grueling work hours.\n\nTo keep junior analysts from burning out in the attempt to prove their worth, the bank has decided to start hiring first-year analysts as permanent employees, instead of taking them on as contract workers. It is also encouraging them not to work on weekends.\n\n\u201cThe goal is for our analysts to want to be here for a career,\u201d said David Solomon, global head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThis is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d\n\nWork conditions in banking fell under scrutiny when an intern at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London died of an epileptic seizure that may have been brought on by fatigue. The case prompted the bank to review work conditions for junior employees.\n\nInformation overload\n\nThough technology has helped boost worker productivity over the past few decades, it has come with related costs, such as stress.\n\nTechnology, for example, is eliminating the downtime or slack that used to be built into the day \u2014 such as the time one took to go to the library to conduct research that can now be completed online, said Edward Tenner, author of \u201cWhy Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences.\u201d Those minutes used to act as a buffer that prevented people from working constantly.\n\nCompanies have not come to grips with how bad it is, said Spira, the analyst. Information overload has decreased people's ability to manage thoughts and ideas. Fixing it means changing company culture, such as the idea that dozens of people need to be cc-ed on a given email.\n\n\u201cAlmost every organization is burying its head in the sand,\u201d said Spira, the author of \u201cOverload!: How Too Much Information is Hazardous to Your Organization.\u201d\n\nTougher measures\n\nTo get everyone, from intern to CEO, not to overdo it with the work hours, some companies have resorted to bolder measures.\n\nQuirky, a New York-based startup that shepherds inventions to the marketplace, has instituted a \u201cblackout\u201d week once a quarter during which no one except customer service representatives are allowed to work, lest employees be tempted to check their email.\n\n\u201cWe all dropped pencils together,\u201d said CEO Ben Kaufman, who figured he could bring the idea of re-invention to his own company. \u201cPeople were getting burned out. They needed to see other things besides their desk.\u201d\n\nAnd having the message come right from the top was important for Shirin Majid, the company's 39-year-old head of digital marketing, who laments not having enough time to spend with her husband and 9-month-old daughter, Ella. In 17 years of public relations work, she has yet to take a vacation devoid of that dreaded phone call from the office.\n\nBut not during a recent vacation. No one could call from the office \u2014 since no one was at the office.\n\n\u201cIf you know that your boss is checked out, you're going to relax a bit and not worry that you're going to get an email,\u201d Majid said. \u201cYou can just have a nap.\u201d\n\nAll that blackout-inspired creativity is working out for them so far: General Electric just invested $30 million.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "The Associated Press", "description": "LONDON \u2014 Volkswagen turns off some employees' email 30 minutes after their shifts end.
