Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that fellow candidate Donald Trump \u201csupports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. Those are New York values\u201d and pointed to polling that shows \u201cI\u2019m beating Hillary Clinton right now and Donald Trump\u2019s losing to her\u201d on Tuesday\u2019s \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe interview began with a discussion of Cruz\u2019s invocation of \u201cNew York values\u201d in the last debate. Cruz said he doesn\u2019t think he made a mistake by using the term, and stated it didn\u2019t come from him, it came from Trump.\n\nO\u2019Reilly then stated, \u201c[I]t seems to me that you were trying to point based upon a fairly old definition of where he stood on issues, 1999 or so, and that point actually helped him. Would i be wrong?\n\nCruz responded, \u201cYou know, you would be wrong, Bill, and if you want to look at what New York values are, you can look at positions that are current. right now today, Donald Trump supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. Those are New York values. Right now today, Donald Trump supports using eminent domain to condemn private property to give it to giant corporations. That\u2019s New York values. And I would note that Donald Trump supported Barack Obama\u2019s big bank bailout, the TARP bailout of Wall Street. And he also supported the Obama stimulus. Now, listen, that \u2014 he\u2019s entitled to have those positions. I disagree with him on every one of those positions. I think that\u2019s how we got into this mess. We\u2019re bankrupting this country. And the point I was making is those views and values are different from the views and values here in Iowa.\u201d\n\nLater, after Cruz said, \u201cYou know, what we have seen under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, is we\u2019ve seen the power of Washington, the rich and powerful have gotten richer. the top 1% today have a \u2014 earn a higher share of our economy than any year since 1928. O\u2019Reilly stated, \u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like [Democratic presidential candidate Sen.] Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\u201d\n\nCruz responded, \u201cYou know what? Bernie, at least, is willing to stand up to the corruption of the Democratic Party. He\u2019s halfway there.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly also said to Cruz, \u201cThe problem you\u2019re going to have if you get the nomination is the middle. Barry Goldwater got trounced because he ran as doctrinaire conservative. And we are living in a changing America. You know the demographics are changing. The attitudes are changing. We\u2019re not going to back on gay marriage. We\u2019re not going to go back on a lot of these things, and they work against you in the general election. So, it\u2019ll be very fascinating to see, if you do win the nomination, how you can persuade those people to go for you.\u201d\n\nCruz countered, \u201cI\u2019ll point out that the polling numbers are contrary to what you\u2019re saying, that I\u2019m beating Hillary Clinton right now and Donald Trump\u2019s losing to her.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz: Trump Supports Funding Planned Parenthood, I'm Beating Hillary While He's Losing To Her", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz: Trump Supports Funding Planned Parenthood, I'm Beating Hillary While He's Losing To Her", "title": "Cruz: Trump Supports Funding Planned Parenthood, I'm Beating Hillary While He's Losing To Her - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Cruz-126-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/01/26/cruz-trump-supports-funding-planned-parenthood-im-beating-hillary-while-hes-losing-to-her/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz: Trump Supports Funding Planned Parenthood, I'm Beating Hillary While He's Losing To Her", "title": "Cruz: Trump Supports Funding Planned Parenthood, I'm Beating Hillary While He's Losing To Her - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Cruz-126-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Planned Parenthood, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Abortion, Breitbart TV,Cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2016-01-26T19:50:07-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Abortion"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "right now today, Donald Trump supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Sen.
