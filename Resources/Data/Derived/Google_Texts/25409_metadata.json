Many people in South Hutchinson say pit bulls get a bad rap.\n\n\"I think it's a good thing,\" said Mike Jones. \"Pit bulls kind of have a dark side ban that everybody seems to think that they're mean viscous dogs.\"\n\n\"Basing a judgment just on a breed is ridiculous,\" said Lacy Lane. \"I think if they're raised the right way it can be a wonderful pet to a family.\"\n\nOthers say this decision could be a mistake, but not mayor Pete Murray. He says over the past few years, South Hutchinson hasn't had many complaints about the breed.\n\n\"We decided we'd go ahead and change it,\" said Murray. \"Somebody wanted a pit bull and went to the police department and checked on it and they said they had an ordinance against it, maybe they brought up the question, why?\"\n\nMurray says a string of incidents with vicious pit bulls a couple decades ago led to the original ordinance against them.\n\n\"There were some fights going on with pits so we decided we'll just do away with them because we don't want the problem,\" he said.\n\nNow that they are allowed, Murray wants to remind residents that just like any dog, if a pit bull encounter turns dangerous, they could be put down.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it's a pit bull or a puppy, if it gets vicious then we deal with it,\" said Murray.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Two weeks ago, city councilmembers voted unanimously to once again allow pit bulls to be owned as pets.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Two weeks ago, city councilmembers voted unanimously to once again allow pit bulls to be owned as pets.", "title": "Long-standing pit bull ban lifted in S.
