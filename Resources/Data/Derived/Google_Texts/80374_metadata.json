Cavuto noted, as was sent to the media in a recent Tenth Amendment Center press release, that states are considering over 200 bills to push back against federal power. He asked Johnson why so many states are rebelling against the federal government and why that number has increased so dramatically in recent years.\n\nJohnson could easily have answered Cavuto\u2019s query with, \u201cBecause the Tenth Amendment Center exists.\u201d Instead he spoke more generally of the federal government\u2019s increasing attempts to regulate all areas of American life with legislation ranging from No Child Left Behind to Obamacare.\n\nAs Cavuto groped for the boundaries of how far the states can take their opposition \u2013 for instance, can they oppose attempts to nationalize the issue of vaccination? \u2013 Cavuto asked, \u201cWhere do you draw the line between what the federal government can do and what the state governments should do?\u201d Now certainly, this is an appropriate question. But it\u2019s also one with a strikingly simple answer.\n\nThe answer, Neil, is that line has already been drawn. It was drawn in 1787 when the Constitution was written. It was drawn in 1788 and 1789 when the states ratified the Constitution. It was drawn in 1791 when the Bill of Rights, particularly the Tenth Amendment, was ratified. The line is this: if the Constitution does not specifically authorize the federal government to take an action, it cannot legally do so. How far the states can go is dictated by the text of the Tenth Amendment, which says that any power not specifically delegated to the federal government remains with the states.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that so many in the media, especially the so-called conservative media, don\u2019t understand this. Sure, the correct understanding of the rights and powers of the states was neglected for decades, but the delineation of such powers is right there in the Constitution.\n\nWithout stating his level of agreement with it, Cavuto referenced the opinion that, \u201cit\u2019s dangerous when the states make their own rules\u2026\u201d and create a lack of uniformity of laws across the country. The Tenth Amendment Center\u2019s counterpoint to this is that it is exponentially more dangerous for the federal government to ignore restrictions on its own authority. The founding generation understood that the people of the United States were nonuniform in their cultures, traditions and desires \u2013 and they remain so.\n\nBecause of this, for one government to apply a wide swath of uniform laws on a diverse group of people would be the very definition of arbitrary government. This, combined with the tendency of centralized power to become increasingly oppressive, is why the Constitution allows a wide range of authority for the states, but a strictly limited one for the federal government.\n\nThis line between state and federal powers is absolutely clear. It remains in the same place it was two and a quarter centuries ago.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "On an episode of his Cavuto on Business\u00a0show on the Fox Business Network last week, Neil Cavuto spoke with former governor and presidential candidate Gary", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center Blog", "description": "On an episode of his Cavuto on Business\u00a0show on the Fox Business Network last week, Neil Cavuto spoke with former governor and presidential candidate Gary Johnson.
