TIRANA, Albania (AP) â€” Albanian police have arrested two suspects considered to be the leaders of the armed group that fatally shot one policeman and wounded two others this week.

Police spokesman Gentian Mullai on Sunday said two teenagers, brothers Arbjon and Alban Aliko, handed themselves over after 500 police isolated them Saturday evening at a former army mountain tunnel 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the marijuana-growing village of Lazarat. The village, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the capital, Tirana, is where the policeman was killed.

Six people so far have been accused and detained in both the policeman's killing and for illegal weapons possession. Police say gunmen were organized to push away police from the village so locals could resume planting marijuana, a multibillion-dollar business in Lazarat.
