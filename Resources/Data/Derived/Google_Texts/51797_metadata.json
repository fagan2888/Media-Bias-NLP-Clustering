And to prove he means \u201cbusiness,\u201d the former private sector executive ticked off this morning on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press some of the changes he\u2019s already made in the six short months he\u2019s been on the job:\n\nHe has fired more than 900 employees, 60 of whom were removed because they manipulated wait times on records from veteran care medical facilities.\n\nHe is investigating more than 100 senior leaders for their actions.\n\nHe\u2019s given out his personal cell phone number to assist in the services provided by the problem-plagued veterans\u2019 homelessness call center.\n\nHe met with the comptroller general and personally encouraged him to put the VA\u2019s hospital problems on the GAO\u2019s annual \u201cHigh Risk List,\u201d which happened this year for the first time, in order to shine a light on those problems and get them fixed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: Embattled VA Added to Federal High-Risk List\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not where we need to be yet,\u201d said McDonald this morning. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that.\u201d But he is convinced the agency is making progress, he said.\n\nThe former corporate executive at Procter & Gamble was sworn in unanimously by the Senate in late July 2014 after his predecessor, Eric Shinseki, resigned in disgrace following revelations that more than 40 veterans died while awaiting health services at a VA health facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Thousands more across the country experienced longer-than-usual wait times for care.\n\nShortly after taking the reins, McDonald told his department in a memo, \u201cI will not tolerate those who stifle initiative, seek to punish people who raise legitimate concerns or report problems, or lack integrity in word or deed. Trust is essential.\u201d\n\nHe told Chuck Todd this morning his goal is to end homelessness among veterans by the end of 2015. He reiterated the agreement he and attorneys for homeless veterans in L.A. negotiated last week after a four-year lawsuit. The West Lost Angeles VA campus will ramp up services to veterans in need, including those who are homeless, aging or disabled.\n\n\u201cI knew we were aligned on the issue, which was to take care of veterans,\u201d he said of the deal. \u201cWe announced the agreement and we\u2019re moving ahead. We\u2019re putting in more vouchers that will get people into housing. We have buildings that are vacant. We need to do some seismic work on them\u2026 We\u2019re moving full steam ahead.\u201d\n\nRelated: Americans Sour on VA After Health Scandal\n\nVeteran homelessness is down nationally some 33 percent since 2010, but McDonald acknowledged the vast amount of work still to be done. The Veterans Affairs agency, responsible for running more than 150 hospitals, has a budget of some $170 billion.\n\n\u201cCan you really run the VA like a business?\u201d Todd asked.\n\n\u201cI think you can. I think that\u2019s the process we\u2019re testing,\u201d said McDonald, an Army veteran himself and a West Point graduate. \u201cI\u2019m determined to take business practices and apply them to government and make them work.\u201d\n\nTodd asked him about the hit war drama American Sniper, which is based on the real-life experiences of SEAL sniper Chris Kyle. The film has already brought in more than $304 million in the U.S. alone. \u201cGreat movie,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cI\u2019m hoping [it] will help raise the consciousness for the need for mental health treatments among the general public. We see that need [in the VA], but it\u2019s a national need as well.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The new head of the Veter", "title": "Veterans Affairs Chief Vows to Operate Like a Business", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/15/Veterans-Affairs-Strains-Operate-Business", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04042014_Veterans_Affairs.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/15/Veterans-Affairs-Strains-Operate-Business", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04042014_Veterans_Affairs.png", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The new head of the Veter", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd82f\"", "article_summary": "The new head of the Veterans Affairs Department, Robert McDonald, says he\u2019s determined to run the sprawling, scandal-ridden government agency like a business.\nThe West Lost Angeles VA campus will ramp up services to veterans in need, including those who are homeless, aging or disabled.\nHe\u2019s given out his personal cell phone number to assist in the services provided by the problem-plagued veterans\u2019 homelessness call center.\nThe Veterans Affairs agency, responsible for running more than 150 hospitals, has a budget of some $170 billion.\nRelated: Embattled VA Added to Federal High-Risk List\u201cWe\u2019re not where we need to be yet,\u201d said McDonald this morning."}
