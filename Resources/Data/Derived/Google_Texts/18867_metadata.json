Sometimes because they fail to grasp the concept (the learning curve is indeed steep):\n\nIndia Must Build Intellectual Property: \u201cFor most Indians, intellectual property is a combination of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Robin Hood. The French anarchist famously declared property to be theft. Indians, few of whom put in the hard slog required to create intellectual property, readily agree, and are eager to do to the owners of intellectual property what Robin Hood did to the rich. Karl Marx, no fan of property himself, pronounced Proudhon to be confused: you can steal something only if it already belongs to someone, meaning property must precede theft and so cannot be theft. Indians are equally wrong to disrespect intellectual property.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s first correct this mis-characterization of Robin Hood. He didn\u2019t steal from the rich \u2013 he stole government\u2019s onerous taxes from the collectors, to return the coin to the people. Robin Hood, if anything, was a pro-capitalism, pro-private property figure.\n\nProudhon and Marx (duh) were decidedly not. And it does appear that their anti-property perspectives rule the roost in India.\n\n\u201cIndian companies glibly disregard the need to license technologies, leading to legal disputes with patent holders. The larger problem is consistent failure by Indian firms to carry our research and development (R&D) that would create intellectual property.\u201d\n\nNo R & D, no IP. Not only must you protect the end products, you must respect the process necessary to deliver them. India seems to grasp none of this.\n\nOther nations understand IP \u2013 and thus know its immense value. They just don\u2019t want to pay for it. Or do the heavy lifting of developing it. Behold China:\n\nIP Theft Costs US $300 Billion Per Year: \u201cA private advisory panel says growing intellectual property theft, mainly by China, is costing the United States more than $300 billion each year.\u201d\n\nUS Report Warns on China\u2019s Massive Intellectual Property Theft\n\nChina: Theft of Intellectual Property \u2013 What Should Be Done?\n\nOne thing that should be done is to have the United States stop borrowing trillions of dollars to fund massive, massively stupid government spending \u2013 from the world\u2019s biggest IP thief. Any governmental attempt to rein in China\u2019s IP heist \u2013 is met with a threat to cut us off. Our deadbeat government then immediately returns to the corner to recommence cowering \u2013 and our IP remains open to unfettered Chinese raiding.\n\nOne thing that shouldn\u2019t be done \u2013 is to make our domestic IP landscape less safe. I.e. more like China and much of the rest of the world.\n\nThankfully, we have our Constitution \u2013 which makes IP protection an expressed responsibility of our federal government. Behold Article I, Section 8, Clause 8: \u201cTo promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries\u2026\u201d\n\nSadly, Republicans and Democrats both are working to undermine our rights and their responsibilities. And make us look like much of the rest of the IP world. Via yet another woefully misnamed DC un-\u201csolution\u201d \u2013 like the Affordable Care Act, Network Neutrality, the Fairness Doctrine or immigration \u201creform.\u201d\n\nH.R. 9, The Innovation Act: \u201cThe bipartisan Innovation Act\u2026address(es) the ever increasing problem of abusive patent litigation.\u201d\n\nTranslation: The government is seeking to undermine the ability of patent holders to protect their property. Because suing to protect valid patents isn\u2019t \u201cabusive\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s vitally necessary to protect intellectual property and preserve a free market economy.\n\nHR 9 sort of contradicts that whole Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 thing. And would make us just another nation eminently more susceptible to IP thieves.\n\nChina would be thrilled with this legislation. No one here should be.\n\n[Originally published at Red State]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2016/04/lets-not-emulate-how-much-of-the-world-treats-intellectual-property/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/patents.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Let\u2019s Not Emulate How Much of the World Treats Intellectual Property"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Behold China:IP Theft Costs US $300 Billion Per Year: \u201cA private advisory panel says growing intellectual property theft, mainly by China, is costing the United States more than $300 billion each year.\u201dUS Report Warns on China\u2019s Massive Intellectual Property TheftChina: Theft of Intellectual Property \u2013 What Should Be Done?\nIndians, few of whom put in the hard slog required to create intellectual property, readily agree, and are eager to do to the owners of intellectual property what Robin Hood did to the rich.\nSometimes because they fail to grasp the concept (the learning curve is indeed steep):India Must Build Intellectual Property: \u201cFor most Indians, intellectual property is a combination of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Robin Hood.\nApril 26 is World Intellectual Property (IP) Day: \u201cWe celebrate World Intellectual Property Day to learn about the role that intellectual property rights (patents, trademarks, industrial designs, copyright) play in encouraging innovation and creativity.\u201dIt\u2019s sad that so many of us still need to learn \u201cthe role that intellectual property rights\u2026play in encouraging innovation and creativity.\u201d It\u2019s sad that the inherently obvious isn\u2019t inherently obvious: that IP and its protection is a fundamental building block to any successful economy.\nBecause suing to protect valid patents isn\u2019t \u201cabusive\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s vitally necessary to protect intellectual property and preserve a free market economy."}
