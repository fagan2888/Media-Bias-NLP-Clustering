We can either choose to keep our head down, to not rock the boat, to not stand for anything\u2026 or we can stand for principle. They say if you stand on principle, you lose elections,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz at CPAC 2014, a conference at which a few other speakers would go on to say exactly that. \u201cThe way to do it \u2013 the smart way, the Washington way \u2013 is: don\u2019t stand against ObamaCare. Don\u2019t stand against the debt ceiling. Don\u2019t stand against nothing. I want to tell you something: that is a false dichotomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to lose elections, stand for nothing,\u201d Cruz warned, listing congressional and presidential elections where he felt Republicans \u201cstood for nothing\u2026 and we got walloped.\u201d 2008 and 2012 were years featured prominently in that list.\n\nThe Tea Party wave of 2010 is how Cruz wants to roll. \u201cWe said we stand unequivocally against ObamaCare, against bankrupting the country, and we won a historic tidal wave of an election,\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cAnd then all of us remember President Dole\u2026 and President McCain\u2026 and President Romney,\u201d he continued, allowing that all of these defeated candidates were good and decent men, but \u201cwhen you don\u2019t stand and draw a clear distinction, when you don\u2019t stand on principle, Democrats celebrate.\u201d\n\nThe contrary view was most directly articulated at CPAC by Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose well-received speech included an admonition that Republicans had to win elections first, before they could get anything done. Cruz has the advantage of recent history to cite, since those oh-so-electable candidates he mentioned didn\u2019t actually get, you know, elected. Also, the strategy Cruz advocates is more honest with the voters, who have a right to know what they\u2019re voting for, both in terms of immediate policy changes and long-term strategy.\n\nEven if one is inclined to give Democrat-style lying and identity-group pandering a shot, it\u2019s hard to argue that Republicans could ever beat them at those games. For one thing, the media wouldn\u2019t let them. No Republican could possibly survive Barack Obama\u2019s Big Lie \u2013 one \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d burst of hyper-mendacity would doom the GOP to a generation of portrayals as the Party of Fraud in news and entertainment culture.\n\nThe other 2016 hopefuls who spoke at CPAC discussed principle in mostly general ways, aside from Senator Rand Paul\u2019s obvious desire to visit NSA headquarters on a mission to chew bubble gum and kick ass, and quickly run out of bubble gum. This far out from the election, generalities are safer than specific policy proposals.\n\nTed Cruz, on the other hand, dropped a ten-point platform with only two relatively vague imperatives, \u201cstop the lawlessness\u201d and \u201cend the corruption.\u201d Perhaps the day will come that a politician of either party declares himself uninterested in ending corruption, but today is not that day.\n\nAs for \u201cstopping the lawlessness,\u201d that\u2019s a tall order in Washington today, since the entire system is predicated on ignoring checks, balances, equal protection under the law, and lately even the specific wording of laws duly enacted by Congress and signed by the President. ObamaCare would be instantly annihilated, in its entirety, if the Administration was simply obliged to obey it as passed and signed; repeal would occur in an emergency overnight session of Congress, with virtually no Democrat votes against.\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend that I didn\u2019t just have a quick daydream of President Cruz rampaging through D.C. and forcing everyone to fully obey every word of the laws they passed. It was bloodier than \u201c300\u201d and its new sequel combined.\n\nCruz\u2019 other eight points were exactly the sort of specific proposals a likely presidential aspirant is supposed to avoid, two years out from the election: \u201cNumber one, defend the constitution\u2026Number two, we need to abolish the IRS\u2026Number three, we need to expand energy in this country\u2026Number four, we need to expand school choice\u2026Number five, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank\u2026Number six, we need to audit the federal reserve\u2026Number seven, pass a strong balanced budget amendment\u2026Number eight, we need to repeal every single word of ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned above, I think his Number Nine, \u201cend the lawlessness,\u201d will pretty much take care of Number Eight. He\u2019ll have no shortage of supporters for expanding energy, and a powerful ally in Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal for expanding school choice. Vowing to audit the Fed must have gotten the attention of Paul family supporters in the room. His subsequent shout-out to Ron Paul as one of the two Republicans in the modern era who energized young people (the other being Reagan \u2013 \u201capparently the key is being named Ronald!\u201d) doubtless helped in that regard as well. Cruz puts a lot of work into these speeches, folks. He just makes it look easy by wandering around the stage, cracking jokes, and doing Jay Leno impressions.\n\nI tend to think 2016 will be a good year to talk about balanced budget amendments, after years in which getting the deficit under a trillion dollars was celebrated as a major achievement, the Budget Control Act of 2011 became one of the sickest jokes ever perpetrated on the American public, and some of the Skittle-pooping deficit unicorns chained up in the Treasury basement are going to start keeling over from exhaustion.\n\nWe\u2019ll need to hear more specifics about how President Cruz would abolish the IRS. I think there will be an audience for those specifics. And would you like to go back to having a free checking account with great benefits? Then you want to repeal Dodd-Frank.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of populist appeal in Cruz\u2019 proposals, and a lot for young people to consider. He made a special appeal to the young, and young at heart, by saying every CPAC attendee has a youthful spirit, because they care about the future. In 2016, more than ever, Democrats will be pushing the idea of burning the future as fuel to keep the present system running a bit longer. Put Ted Cruz on a stage opposite Hillary Clinton, and imagine which one young voters will find more appealing.\n\nThe 2016 Democrat candidate will be taking the stage after eight absolutely brutal years for young people, as Cruz reminded the audience: \u201cIf you were to sit down and try to design an agenda to hammer the living daylights out of young people, you couldn\u2019t do better than the Obama economic agenda. Under President Obama, we\u2019ve had five years of the Great Stagnation. No economic growth, which means one generation after another coming out of school can\u2019t find jobs. You know, economists are referring to this generation of young people as a \u2018lost generation.\u2019 ObamaCare\u2026 one of the easiest ways to understand it? It\u2019s a massive wealth transfer from young, healthy people to everybody else. And then our national debt, from $10 trillion to $17 trillion\u2026 who the heck do you think is gonna pay for that?\u201d\n\nCruz noted that Republican presidential candidates haven\u2019t been asking questions like that during the last couple of elections, leaving some of the best cards they have to play with young voters on the table\u2026 as though playing those cards would be rude to Democrats, or perhaps too uncomfortable for some debt-friendly Republicans. He had a great youth-friendly answer to the Democrat push for higher minimum wages, too: why not focus on creating more jobs that pay far more than minimum wage? The GOP puts some effort into crafting appeals to young voters, but not many of their top candidates can think young the way Ted Cruz does.\n\nCruz was one of the first CPAC 2014 speakers, but his presentation is perhaps best viewed last, after absorbing what the other 2016 prospects had to say. Cruz offered a synthesis of their strengths, and unless they were sharing advance copies of their speeches with him, he did it without any particular foreknowledge. The others will run hard against him, but it also seems clear he could partner up with any of them; he understands the case Rep. Paul Ryan made against deficit spending, the fiery opposition Senator Rand Paul declared against the surveillance state, the devolution of power Governor Rick Perry called for, and the urgent need for competent and accountable administration described by Governor Chris Christie.\n\nAnd he accomplishes this fusion through his understanding of the issues, not witless pandering. He didn\u2019t eat anyone\u2019s lunch, but he sat down next to each of the other candidates with a big smile and helped himself to a couple of french fries off their plates. There\u2019s a lot of ground to cover between now and the first 2016 primaries, but for what it\u2019s worth at this early date, Ted Cruz looks like a front-runner to me.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Not many GOP candidates can \"think young\" the way Cruz does.", "title": "Ted Cruz at CPAC 2014: 'How we win.' | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cruz_cpac14-480x268.png", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/03/08/ted-cruz-at-cpac-2014-how-we-win/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Not many GOP candidates can \"think young\" the way Cruz does.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cruz_cpac14-480x268.png", "creator": "@@Doc_0", "description": "Not many GOP candidates can \"think young\" the way Cruz does.", "card": "summary", "site": "@humanevents"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04d3\"", "article_summary": "The GOP puts some effort into crafting appeals to young voters, but not many of their top candidates can think young the way Ted Cruz does.\nPut Ted Cruz on a stage opposite Hillary Clinton, and imagine which one young voters will find more appealing.\nWe\u2019ll need to hear more specifics about how President Cruz would abolish the IRS.\nThey say if you stand on principle, you lose elections,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz at CPAC 2014, a conference at which a few other speakers would go on to say exactly that.\nI\u2019m not going to pretend that I didn\u2019t just have a quick daydream of President Cruz rampaging through D.C. and forcing everyone to fully obey every word of the laws they passed."}
