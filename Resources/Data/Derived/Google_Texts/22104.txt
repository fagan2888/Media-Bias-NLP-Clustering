Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said that someone began throwing rocks and other objects, prompting police to deploy tear gas, but no arrests were made. Molotov cocktails hit a liquor store causing it to catch fire, HuffPost's Christine Conetta reported from the scene.

Police in riot gear were present, but never left the corner of Florissant Ave and Ferguson Ave., despite stores being looted just feet away. From midnight to 4:00 a.m., community members were left to self-police, Conetta observed, with several people trying to prevent looters from continuing to take items from stores.

But some protesters took positions to block the looters from ransacking the businesses.

Several community members showed up Saturday morning to clean up the mess that looters left behind, KMOV reported, and business owners expressed their gratitude.

The liquor store seemed to have experienced the most damage, and most of the liquor had been stolen, according to KMOV.

Michael Brown was shot on Aug. 9 after he and a friend were walking in the street and encountered a police officer. Brown's friend who was with him that night, Dorian Johnson, said that the officer attacked Brown, then shot at the 18-year-old as he was trying to get away. Ferguson Police claim that Brown attacked the officer, and said Wednesday that the officer involved in the altercation was injured. Multiple witnesses have said that they saw Brown with his hands up in the air when he was shot.

Police released footage on Friday that they said showed Brown robbing a convenience store for cigarillos. Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, was not aware that he was a suspect in a robbery at the time of the shooting. The family's attorney accused police of trying to "assassinate the character of Michael Brown" to divert attention from his death.
