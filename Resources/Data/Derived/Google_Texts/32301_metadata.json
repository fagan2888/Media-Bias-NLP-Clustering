As a scientist, he studies the effects of drugs and alcohol on our brains in the lab. When he practices clinical psychology, the discipline under which he received his formal training, he has spoken to and counseled many addicts, both current and former. (He estimates that he\u2019s talked to hundreds, if not thousands of addicts.) Finally, he himself was an addict throughout his young adulthood, a period of his life that he chronicled in his first book, \u201cMemoirs of an Addicted Brain.\u201d\n\nAll these experiences have led Lewis to a unique perspective: He believes that addiction is not a disease.\n\nHis new book, \u201cThe Biology of Desire: Why Addiction Is Not a Disease,\u201d uses both scientific arguments and the narratives of five different addicts to make Lewis\u2019s case. There are several reasons why we\u2019ve been inclined to view addiction as a disease, he writes. Scientifically, for instance, addictions actually do change the biological makeup of the human brain. In addition, in a social context, proponents of the disease model argue that classifying addiction as disease will reduce stigma and shame, thereby encouraging addicts to seek help and treatment.\n\nWhile Lewis acknowledges that the disease model has its uses, he generally believes that the rationale behind it is insufficient and, in many ways, completely false. Instead, we should view addiction as an issue of habit. This doesn\u2019t preclude it from being a problem \u2014 of development, perhaps \u2014 but to call it a disease can actually be counterproductive and hinder many addicts from recovery, he says.\n\nLewis spoke to us recently about the problem of the disease model as it relates to addiction, but also about broader issues relating to medical practices of the Western world in the 21st century.\n\nWhat exactly are the broader negative implications of calling addiction a disease?\n\nIn my mind, I divide it into a scientific debate and a social, terminological debate. On the scientific side, I present several reasons in the book for thinking about addiction as a learning phenomenon, a developmental process rather than a pathology. Let\u2019s put that aside and talk about the social aspect.\n\nWhy is the disease label harmful regardless of its merit? First of all, the other side of the debate is pretty much exemplified by Nora Volkow. She is the head of NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse. NIDA funds about 90 percent of the addiction research in the world, not just in the U.S. It\u2019s incredibly powerful. Her position is we need to call addiction a disease because addicts need help: If we don\u2019t call it a disease, they\u2019re not going to get the help they need. Her second point is that the shame, the humiliation, the degradation, the notion of addicts being morally repugnant needs to be combated, and if we see them as sick, then we\u2019re not going to denigrate them because we don\u2019t put down people for being sick.\n\nI think both those arguments are completely wrong. If addiction is a disease, then it has to be treated by medical processes and policies. So what does that amount to? In the actual treatment and rehab industry, you have people giving drugs that either simulate or counter the effects of the addictive drug. There\u2019s suboxone, which is what they give mostly. It\u2019s kind of like methadone, and it\u2019s basically an opiate. You can give it to people to relieve withdrawal symptoms, and they might stay on it indefinitely or they might come off of it. But once you come off of it, you\u2019re vulnerable. If there haven\u2019t been psychological changes, you\u2019re very vulnerable to relapse again. Maintenance on methadone and suboxone is really another form of addiction. You still have to take this drug every day. That\u2019s a pretty heavy opiate.\n\nThe other kinds are opiate or alcohol antagonists, which make you sick if you drink, for example. The trouble with those kinds of medicines is that people stop taking them because they want to get high. If you\u2019re on a medicine that keeps the drugs or drinks from having any effect, people very often just stop taking them.\n\nThat\u2019s about all medicine has been able to offer. It\u2019s a fairly small drop in the bucket. There are so many psychological, social and developmental factors in addiction, and these medicines are really just attacking one aspect of it.\n\nThe next point is that the rehab and treatment industry isn\u2019t very effective because medicine doesn\u2019t have a lot to offer. There\u2019s a well-known revolving door phenomenon. People go back to rehab again and again. It\u2019s not unusual for people to show up at rehab five or 10 or 15 times. They show up, they get clean, they get straight, they come out, they relapse, and they come back again. There\u2019s something wrong with the whole industry. I think a lot of that is that it\u2019s based on a medical model. We\u2019re going to treat your disease, we\u2019re going to give you your medications, you\u2019re going to go home, and you\u2019re going to be fine. But they\u2019re not. Calling addiction a disease in that sense isn\u2019t helping anybody.\n\nThe third point is that rehab is so expensive. The centers now run from $10,000 to $100,000 per month \u2014 the latter for the so-called high-end luxury rehabs. It\u2019s way too much money. People can\u2019t afford that. The high-end rehabs don\u2019t actually do a better job than the low-end ones. They\u2019re a lot more pleasant, which could be good to get a break, but that has nothing to do with medicine. For the most part, the rehab industry is sucking people in, charging them an enormous amount of money, making huge profits, and generally not helping people. We don\u2019t know the numbers because they don\u2019t keep good outcome statistics. In Anne Fletcher\u2019s book \u201cInside Rehab,\u201d she makes it very clear many people don\u2019t answer the centers\u2019 calls to report back and say how they\u2019re doing, especially those who have fallen off the wagon. But a lot of the centers don\u2019t even try. It\u2019s really a twisted, corrupted industry. I don\u2019t want to get too much into it because others have written extensively on the topic. Because the rehab industry is based on the medical model, calling addiction a disease is actually working against people getting better.\n\nThe other thing that Nora Volkow and others emphasize is that if we don\u2019t call it a disease, we\u2019re going to revert to the bad old days where we call it a moral deficit: People are basically sinners, they\u2019re weak-willed, selfish and irresponsible. That produces a lot of shame, and shame is a pretty horrible emotion and it doesn\u2019t really help people. Is that right? Should we call it a disease to avoid shame? I think no, partly because being told you have a chronic brain disease that causes you to act badly and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it doesn\u2019t actually reduce shame very much. It can produce shame, especially among young people who want to feel that they have some agency and a chance to construct their lives. This can seem like a death sentence.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to hundreds, probably thousands of addicts, and most addicts, especially recovered addicts, recoil at the idea of thinking that their addiction is a chronic disease, especially if they\u2019ve worked really hard to get out of it. These people are trying to reconstruct their attitudes, change their perspectives, work on their willpower and self-control. There\u2019s a lot of effort involved, and that doesn\u2019t jibe with the idea that addiction is a disease and you have to give it to the experts to fix. I don\u2019t think the disease label absolves people from guilt and blame. But when it does, that\u2019s not necessarily even a good thing. I think a certain amount of shame and blame is probably appropriate. People don\u2019t try to fix themselves if everything\u2019s okay. You have to feel that you\u2019re doing something wrong to work hard to repair it. Massive amounts of shame can be quite toxic in personality development, but a small amount is probably healthy.\n\nOne last point: When you call addiction a disease, that means that by definition, addicts are patients. They\u2019re part of an expert-driven hierarchy. They\u2019re told what to do and they\u2019re supposed to follow a particular regimen. The whole notion of empowerment and self-efficacy gets completely quashed. And yet, a lot of people who work with addicts recognize that self-efficacy and empowerment are massively important factors that help people get better. You need to have the feeling that, \u201cI can do this, I can get over it, I have the capacity to do so.\u201d In addiction counseling, and especially motivational and cognitive techniques, that sense of agency is actually encouraged and nurtured. I don\u2019t think we want to take it away by saying people have a disease.\n\nYour book discusses the Alcoholics Anonymous approach to overcoming addiction as it relates to the disease model, and also as a rather powerless approach. How are the two models similar and different? Can seeking help through AA ever be empowering, as it\u2019s often depicted to be in popular media?\n\nIt\u2019s a messy and controversial issue, and it\u2019s been in the press a lot. It\u2019s hugely popular in the U.S. and throughout most of North America and Europe. People have strenuously argued against it because it\u2019s not scientifically based. The first step is to acknowledge your lack of power. There\u2019s a certain tribe of people out there, let\u2019s call them \u201cAA-bashers.\u201d I\u2019m not one of them. I\u2019m more neutral about it. They often point to the first step and say, \u201cWell, in fact, addicts require empowerment.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s this emergent barrier between AA and the disease model. It didn\u2019t necessarily start out like that. Bill Wilson talked about alcoholism as many things: a spiritual malady, a psychological issue, and also a physical issue. But the whole disease nomenclature didn\u2019t catch up to AA until the \u201950s and \u201960s, and now they\u2019re joined at the hip. That\u2019s partly because AA has become institutionalized within these treatment centers and rehabs. When you go to group in a church basement, they don\u2019t require the disease terminology, but when you go to rehab and you\u2019re paying $30,000 or $50,000 a month, they say, \u201cYour addiction is a disease, and we\u2019re going to deal with it that way. By the way, we do 12-step meetings every night.\u201d They merge the 12-step philosophy with the disease concept.
