A Swedish mother who had lost her uterus to cancer in her 20s has given birth to a son, thanks to her mother\u2019s donated womb.\n\nIn a groundbreaking success for fertility medicine, Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Sahlgrenska Hospital at the University of Gothernburg and Stockholm IVF, first transplanted wombs into nine women as a part of an experimental study. The women in the trial had either been born without a womb or had it removed because of cancer.\n\nThough this new baby is not the first to be born this way \u2014 Brannstrom has ushered in four babies with transplanted wombs \u2014 this case is a special one because \u201cIt\u2019s one uterus bridging three generations of family,\u201d he told AP.\n\nThe new mother underwent in vitro fertilization to make embryos with her eggs and her husband\u2019s sperm. Doctors waited a year after the transplant to be sure of avoiding complications, but after four attempts to transfer embryos, the woman got pregnant. There were no complications with the pregnancy, and she delivered via cesarean section, as intended.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t describe how happy we are,\u201d the woman told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I hoped for and a little bit more.\u201d\n\nThe mother said that she and her husband intend to tell the boy how he was conceived someday.\n\n\u201cHopefully when he grows up, uterus transplantation (will be) an acknowledged treatment for women like me and he will know that he was a part of making that possible.\u201d\n\nA Revolutionary Process\n\nBefore Brannstrom\u2019s breakthrough, there had been two previous attempts to transplant a womb. One attempt in Saudi Arabia and one in Turkey both yielded no live births. Doctors in the United States, Britain, France, and elsewhere are planning similar operations \u2014 but with the wombs of women who have died recently, not living donors.\n\nBrannstrom and his colleagues are planning more womb transplant procedures, including one trial that will employ robotic surgery to shorten the 10- to 12-hour operation time. He is also working with doctors in countries like Argentina, Lebanon, and Singapore to do womb transplants there.\n\nExperts describe Brannstrom\u2019s work as the biggest development in fertility medicine since IVF.\n\n\u201cThis was impossible until Brannstrom did it,\u201d said Dr. Antonio Gargiulo, an associate reproductive endocrinologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. Gargiulo pointed out the nuances of womb transplants \u2014 like any other surgery, the organ must be carefully grafted into the patient\u2019s arteries and veins, and doctors need to monitor the babies in the womb to be sure they\u2019re getting enough nutrients and sufficient blood flow.\n\nBrannstrom said that in the pregnancies he has overseen through womb transplant, the blood flow was normal and that all of the babies are healthy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "thanks, uterus, transplant, mother, and, her, child, were, born, same, womb", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In a revolutionary process, one woman was able to give birth to her son by way of a donated womb.", "title": "This Mom And Child Were Born From The Same Womb", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thanks-uterus-transplant-mother-and-her-child-were-born-same-womb-349594", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/26/newborn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a revolutionary process, one woman was able to give birth to her son by way of a donated womb.", "title": "This Mom And Child Were Born From The Same Womb", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thanks-uterus-transplant-mother-and-her-child-were-born-same-womb-349594", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/26/newborn.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/26/newborn.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-08-26T10:47:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-26T10:47:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In a revolutionary process, one woman was able to give birth to her son by way of a donated womb."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dfa\"", "article_summary": "A Swedish mother who had lost her uterus to cancer in her 20s has given birth to a son, thanks to her mother\u2019s donated womb.\nBrannstrom said that in the pregnancies he has overseen through womb transplant, the blood flow was normal and that all of the babies are healthy.\nBrannstrom and his colleagues are planning more womb transplant procedures, including one trial that will employ robotic surgery to shorten the 10- to 12-hour operation time.\nThe women in the trial had either been born without a womb or had it removed because of cancer.\nThe bond between a grandmother, child, and grandchild has always been special, but never before has it been quite like this."}
