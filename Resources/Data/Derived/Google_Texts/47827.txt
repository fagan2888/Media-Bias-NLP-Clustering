NEW YORK (AP) - The Children’s Museum of the Arts is opening an exhibition that juxtaposes children’s artworks with 3D renderings of those works.

The exhibition is called: “Into the Third Dimension: 3D Printing for Young Artists.” It opens Thursday and runs through Jan. 11.

The museum partnered on the exhibition with a new company called 3DP4E or 3D Printing for Everyone.

The institution has over 2,000 pieces of children’s art from around the world in its permanent collection. It is showcasing some of the 2-dimensional works alongside a 3D-printed detail of each.

The goal is to invite viewers to contrast the two forms and introduce them to a new art-making technique.

The exhibition also features a film that explains how a 2D drawing is turned into a 3D object.
