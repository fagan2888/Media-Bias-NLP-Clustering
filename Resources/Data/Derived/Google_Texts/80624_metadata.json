While the state has flexibility in implementing child welfare programs, it must adhere to federal requirements and regulations, the letter said.\n\nThe letter said Nebraska improperly included non-allowable maintenance costs, such as contractors\u2019 administrative costs, in foster care maintenance assistance payment claims.\n\n\u201cDespite several requests from the ACF, Nebraska was unable to provide any source documentation of actual payments made to foster parents for Title IV-E allowable maintenance expenditures,\u201d the letter said, noting the state\u2019s failure to properly document such claims continues today.\n\nGov. Dave Heineman\u2019s initiative to privatize the child welfare system began in 2009, when the state began contracting with five private companies to provide child welfare services. All but one eventually dropped out or lost their contracts as their costs spiraled. Nebraska consistently led the nation in the number of children removed from their homes and placed in state custody. The state also got low marks from the feds for the quality of care of those kids.\n\nBut within the first seven months of implementing the Family Matters child welfare reform plan, three of the five contractors pulled out. Foley\u2019s 2011 audit showed child welfare costs increased 27 percent after the system was privatized and the state failed to seek bids on multi-million dollar contracts, overpaid contractors millions, continued to pay contractors who failed to meet benchmarks and failed to document how money was spent.\n\nA separate 2011 legislative audit concluded the reform wasn\u2019t working, that the state failed set goals or do cost-benefit analysis before diving in and didn\u2019t make much progress in reducing the number of children taken from their homes. That audit also recommended the 2007 restructuring of DHHS be examined to determine whether changes were needed to improve oversight and accountability. In 2006, Heineman began reforming the way the state manages foster children and other state ward cases and in 2007 restructured the administration of state child services after merging three Health and Human Services agencies into one.\n\nEvery year, the federal government requires the state to file an audit report of federal funds, which is then reviewed and occasionally there are \u201cfinancial consequences.\u201d Foley said the latest development confirms his view that although DHHS has many \u201cfine, dedicated employees, the agency is in turmoil and in desperate need of an overhaul.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime and time again, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services has squandered millions in state and federal dollars,\u201d Foley said in a press release. \u201cThe agency\u2019s refusal to adhere to sound business practices for the proper expenditure of funds will now result in Nebraska taxpayers having to pick up considerably more of the cost for its foster care program.\u201d\n\nThe demand for $22 million in repayments comes on the heels of a similar $3.2 million repayment demanded from the state in August 2012. Nebraska initially appealed that cost disallowance but, ultimately withdrew its appeal.\n\nHHS CEO Kerry Winterer said in a press statement that the notification from the feds was expected and related to inadequate documentation for expenses by private contractors.\n\nHe said the department began resolving those issues in 2012 and a disallowance should not occur again, as Children and Family Services Director Thomas Pristow has been working closely with federal officials for the past 12 to 18 months to fix this issue. Winterer said the department will decide soon how to respond to the feds\u2019 demand.\n\n\u201cWe believe we can provide information that will change the amount owed and we believe it will be considerably less,\u201d he said.\n\nFoley said if the state doesn\u2019t repay the money within a month, it will be subject to annual interest expenses of over 10 percent. The auditor\u2019s office is finishing the 2013 audit, which Foley said could lead to more questioned expenditures.\n\n\u201cNebraska taxpayers deserve better than this,\u201d Foley continued.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
