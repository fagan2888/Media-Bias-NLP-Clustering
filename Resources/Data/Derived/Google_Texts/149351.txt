Atlantic City’s pageant-peekers were justifiably giddy last week as the Miss America pageant rolled back into town, nine years after absconding for more sinful surroundings in Las Vegas.

Yes, Miss America’s finally back in New Jersey. Maybe Miss Hawaii didn’t get the memo.

When Aloha State contestant Crystal Lee stepped to the microphone on the Atlantic City boardwalk, she apparently forgot where she was.

“Since Vegas is already considered the ninth island of Hawaii,” she said, “I’m just so happy to have this opportunity to travel across country to represent the beautiful island of Hawaii.”

Muffled gasps from the Jersey crowd are heard in the background. Maybe they were thinking the same thing we were: “This ain’t Vegas. That’s the Atlantic Ocean behind you. Not the fountain at the Bellagio.”

Lee’s not the first pageant contestant to earn a Miss Knucklehead nod. Last year, Tinton Falls native Michelle Leonardo finished Top 10 in the Miss USA pageant but No. 1 on our list when she forgot the name of the U.S. vice president in a TV interview.

Coincidentally, the Miss USA pageant was then held in … Las Vegas.
