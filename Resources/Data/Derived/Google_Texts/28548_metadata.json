Harry Reid is continuing his odd habit of providing racial commentaries. It seems that Asians were the next demographic on his list, where his speech to the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce included some awkward jokes about Asian-Americans (via Time) [emphasis mine]:\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re smarter than anybody else, but you\u2019ve convinced a lot of us you are,\u201d Reid, a Nevada Democrat, told the guffawing crowd at the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce. Video of the remarks was recorded by the Republican opposition research group American Rising. Later, before walking off stage, Reid quipped: \u201cOne problem that I\u2019ve had today is keeping my Wongs straight.\u201d The group decided against backing the Reid-endorsed Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Lucy Flores, supporting Republican Mark Hutchison instead, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. A spokesperson for Reid did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n\nSen. Reid has a history of making odd comments about ethnic groups, some of which have been racially-charged.\n\nBack in 2008, Sen. Reid said that then-Sen. Obama would be successful in his presidential ambitions since he was a \u201clight-skinned African American 'with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.\u201d These private comments were included in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann book \"Game Change.\" Reid later apologized for his remarks.\n\nIn 2010, during his re-election bid, Reid told a group of Hispanic voters at a campaign event that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow how anyone of Hispanic heritage could be a Republican.\u201d That same year, Nevada elected Brian Sandoval, a Republican of Hispanic heritage, as their next governor. Sandoval handily beat Reid\u2019s son, Rory, in that contest.\n\nRight now, Sandoval\u2019s incredibly popular, especially with Hispanics in Nevada; and has little to no opposition. Democrats were said to be having trouble finding a worthy opponent to challenge Sandoval in this Democrat-leaning state for 2014.\n\nOh, and if Sandoval decides to challenge Reid in 2016, things could get interesting.\n\nUPDATE: (via the Washington Post): Almost forgot that he called New York Senator Kristien Gillibrand the \"hottest member\" of the Senate; she was sitting a few feet away from him. And, said that Sen. Ted Kennedy's death would make it easier to pass Obamacare. He's very indelicate to say the least.\n\nUpdate II: I almost forgot to add what Hot Air's Noah Rothman tweeted earlier today. Back in 2010, Reid criticized his then-Republican opponent, Sharon Angle, for making an Asian comment (via Politico):\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid is pounding Republican Sharron Angle for telling a Hispanic student group they looked Asian, hoping to fire up a crucial voting demographic in the process. \"I really don't know what my opponent was talking about, because you all look like Nevadans to me,\" Reid said to cheers at a Las Vegas get-out-the-vote rally today [ 10/19/10]. ... Reid also blasted Angle at a press conference on Monday, saying, \"Her mouth does not have the ability to speak the truth.\"\n\nUPDATE III: Harry Reid has apologized. The Senate Majority leader said, \"My comments were in extremely poor taste and I apologize. Sometimes I say the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nThat's an understatement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oh jeez..05/25/2016 11:42:24AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Oh jeez.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Oh Jeez: Harry Reid Told Some Asian Jokes", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/08/22/untitled-n1882079", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/206/2014-07-15T205521Z_1_LYNXMPEA6E10Y_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Oh jeez.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Oh Jeez: Harry Reid Told Some Asian Jokes", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/08/22/untitled-n1882079", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/206/2014-07-15T205521Z_1_LYNXMPEA6E10Y_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Oh Jeez: Harry Reid Told Some Asian Jokes , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9eb1\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
