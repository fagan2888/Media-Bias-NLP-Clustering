Once restoration of the Victorian is complete, Meridian said it will be able to reduce the combined parking requirements, create additional underground parking below the clinic, and enable the development of the outpatient center to proceed.\n\nHarriman Kinyon of Walnut Creek is the architect for the outpatient clinic.\n\nEarlier this year, Meridian bought a 69,000-square-foot medical office building at 5900 State Farm Dr. in Rohnert Park and recently leased the entire second floor to Petaluma Health Center.\n\nMr. Pollock said the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has \"paved the way to new models of care, requiring providers to re-think their delivery of services in a lower-reimbursement environment, and requires innovation from across the spectrum from population health management, to administration, physician alignment, and facility utilization.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The North Bay Business Journal", "description": "[caption id=", "title": "San Rafael outpatient center construction to start", "url": "http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/industry news/4185185-181/san-rafael-outpatient-center-construction", "image": "http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/csp/mediapool/sites/nbbj/assets/img/logo/nbbj_square.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"page_id": 62345329754, "app_id": 175505928793}, "description": "[caption id="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86ef\"", "article_summary": "[/caption]SAN RAFAEL -- A San Ramon-based developer of medical real estate on Monday said it plans to start construction soon on its second North Bay health clinic project this year, this time in downtown San Rafael.\nHarriman Kinyon of Walnut Creek is the architect for the outpatient clinic.\nMeridian Property Company said it intends to build a 10,500 square-foot outpatient center at 1415 Third St.\nMeridian partnered with San Francisco-based architectural design firm Carey & Co., Inc., which specializes in restoration projects throughout the Bay Area, to restore the Victorian home.\nEarlier this year, Meridian bought a 69,000-square-foot medical office building at 5900 State Farm Dr. in Rohnert Park and recently leased the entire second floor to Petaluma Health Center."}
