Tulsi Gabbard, a twice-deployed Army veteran, is taking heat from liberals in the media for criticizing President Obama\u2019s strategy to defeat Islamic State militants and the administration\u2019s refusal to identify radical Islam as the enemy.\n\n\u201cEvery soldier knows this simple fact: If you don\u2019t know your enemy, you will not be able to defeat him,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said, Fox News reported Saturday. \u201cOur leaders must clearly identify the enemy as Islamist extremists, understand the ideology that is motivating them and attracting new recruits, and focus on defeating that enemy both militarily and ideologically.\u201d\n\nMs. Gabbard, who is a member of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees, told Fox that the administration\u2019s fear of associating radical terrorist groups with the Islamic faith were \u201cunfounded.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Mecca debate challenges Obama narrative: \u2018The terror we face \u2026 is religiously motivated\u2019\n\n\u201cI think recognizing and being very accurate and very specific and understanding this must be a core part of our strategy, to defeat those who seek to do harm to the American people is exactly how we must be looking at this issue and remain very focused on it,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said, Fox reported.\n\nBut political experts in her home state have criticized the rising Democratic star for challenging a president from her own party, and worry she has jeopardized her prospects for re-election in one of the bluest states.\n\n\u201cWhile Gabbard is correct in her \u2018emperor has no clothes\u2019 moment, she may have lost her future seat on Hawaii\u2019s political bench,\u201d said Michael W. Perry, of Hawaii\u2019s \u201cPerry & Price\u201d KSSK radio show.\n\nMr. Perry said Ms. Gabbard had committed a \u201cmortal sin\u201d by challenging the president and \u201cnow the knives are coming out,\u201d Fox reported.\n\nBob Jones, a columnist for the Oahu-based Midweek, wrote that Ms. Gabbard\u2019s comments were out of line.\n\n\u201cI take serious issue when somebody who\u2019s done a little non-fighting in Iraq, and is not a Middle East or Islamic scholar, claims to know better than our President and Secretary of State how to fathom the motivations of terrorists, or how to refer to them beyond the term that best describes them \u2014 terrorists,\u201d Mr. Jones said.\n\nBut others in the military community have stepped forward to defend Ms. Gabbard, saying her remarks are courageous and correct.\n\n\u201c[Gabbard] has taken a very courageous stand in a party that just refuses to face reality,\u201d said Retired U.S. army Lt. Gen. Michal Flynn, who directed the Defense Intelligence Agency, Fox reported.\n\nFormer intelligence officer and noted specialist on Islamic law, Stephen Coughlin told Fox, \u201cRep. Gabbard is correct as a matter of history, she is correct as a matter of current events, and she is correct of published Islamic law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hawaii Democratic Rep.
