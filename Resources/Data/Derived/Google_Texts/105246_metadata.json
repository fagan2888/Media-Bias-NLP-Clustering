Distant controversies over $600 toilet seats and multi-million-dollar cost overruns on weaponry seem quaint by today\u2019s standards, in light of cost overruns of $100 billion or more to develop the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and tens of billions more for the highly flawed Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The ship was meant to be a next-generation asset for the Navy but has suffered from structural cracks, propulsion problems, and computer and communications issues.\n\nThe Pentagon has also had a penchant for wretched excess in ordering equipment and weaponry for new conflicts. As former Republican Sen. Tom Coburn\u2019s annual government waste report found, the DOD wound up destroying 170 million pounds worth of usable vehicles and other military equipment in Afghanistan. Overall, 20 percent of all military equipment in Afghanistan, valued at $7 billion, was scrapped rather than returned to the U.S. or sold to the Afghans.\n\nThe Pentagon said it would have been too costly to ship home the equipment. Moreover, they might have hurt defense contractors domestically by driving down prices of equipment overseas.\n\nRelated: Obama Would Slash Overseas War Budget by 21 Percent\n\nCarter, an expert on military financial issues, said in his testimony, \u201cEvery company, state and city in the country has had to lean itself out in recent years, and it should be no different for the Pentagon.\u201d But the DOD and its allies in Congress have little interest in slimming down the defense establishment given the growing threat from ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria and Russian aggression against government forces in Ukraine.\n\nThe budget that Obama submitted to Congress would breach the Pentagon\u2019s legal spending caps by $35 billion and provide for a total of $585 billion of defense spending in the new fiscal year. Those funds would cover a base budget of about $534 billion for general military operations and salaries and $50.9 billion more for the military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIt\u2019s logical that the proposed spending surge, after several years of enforced belt tightening, will produce its share of waste and excess. As the GAO noted in a report several years back, it has been impossible to accurately audit the Pentagon for two decades.\n\nOne wasteful practice that may be ending is the military\u2019s billion dollar \u201cwish lists\u201d that officials of the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force annually and informally submit to friendly lawmakers, as Defense One has reported. The lists, closely watched by defense firms and lobbyists, are brimming with expensive programs that fell just below the cut line \u2013 or that were unwanted by the administration.\n\nRelated: How the Pentagon Cooks the Books to Hide Massive Waste\n\nIf a defense contractor\u2019s project turns up on one of these lists, it gives their lobbying effort a big boost or greater standing. Company officials can argue it reflects the desire of military officials \u2013 albeit not their superiors. Congress has often found ways to squeeze these projects into the budget at reduced spending levels.\n\nThis year, it happened with the Navy\u2019s EA-18G Growler, an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet that carries special wing pods that jam enemy radio signals, Defense One said. The Navy did not request Growlers in its fiscal 2015 budget proposal but included 22 in its unfunded wish list. Lawmakers ended up adding $1.46 billion for 15 jets to the DOD budget.\n\nCarter said yesterday he would allow the wish lists to continue but said it was up to Congress to request them. Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain said, \u201cActually I\u2019m not really big on unfunded priority lists,\u201d calling them a back door way of operating. House Armed Services Committee Chair Mac Thornberry (R-TX), hasn\u2019t decided yet if he will request lists from the services, according to a committee spokesman.\n\nOverall, Carter said there was \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d in reforming Pentagon spending practices. \u201cThe issues and solutions for acquisition reform change over time as technology and industry change, as I noted. They extend from acquisition, and this is important, to all other parts of the defense budget. Force size, compensation and training as well as equipment. If confirmed as secretary of defense, I pledge to make needed change in the Pentagon.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s choice for Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, was refreshingly can", "title": "Ashton Carter: Americans Are Disgusted with Government Waste", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/Ashton-Carter-Americans-Are-Disgusted-Government-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/Ashton-Carter-Americans-Are-Disgusted-Government-Waste", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama\u2019s choice for Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, was refreshingly can", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ffb\"", "article_summary": "Overall, Carter said there was \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d in reforming Pentagon spending practices.\nCarter said yesterday he would allow the wish lists to continue but said it was up to Congress to request them.\nThey extend from acquisition, and this is important, to all other parts of the defense budget.\nAs former Republican Sen.
