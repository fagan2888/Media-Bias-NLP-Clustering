At least, management says it won't try to block one.\n\nCompany spokesman David Tovar tells The New York Times that the company has \"decided not to take a position on minimum wage proposals,\" so long as they don't single out specific employers like the bill it opposed in Washington, D.C., that would have only raised wages at big-box stores.*\n\nIf you assume that Wal-Mart is hell-bent on paying its associates as little as possible, its casual attitude here might seem surprising. But it's not really. The company previously backed a minimum wage increase in 2007 and has good reasons to be at ease with the idea today.\n\nFirst, while most of Wal-Mart's associates don't earn much, the do generally make more than the minimum. Wal-Mart's official figures bounce around a bit, but in November Tovar told me the average hourly worker, not including supervisors, earns $11.83 an hour. In 2011, meanwhile, the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley, estimated that almost 80 percent of their hires earned more than $9.00 per hour.\n\nThat's one reason why, as Lydia Dypillis notes, \"Wal-Mart is much better able to absorb a minimum wage increase than its smaller competitors,\" which are more likely to rely on bonafide minimum wage, opposed to merely low-wage, employees. So long as the cost of labor rises for everybody, at least within certain limits, Wal-Mart doesn't have much reason to sweat. Now, if the minimum suddenly shot up so everybody had to pay on a Costco wage scale, that might be a problem for its business model. But the Berkeley paper estimated that if the behemoth from Bentonville were to raise its pay all the way to $12 an hour, it could pass the entire cost onto consumers while raising prices just 1.1 percent for its average shopper.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The retail behemoth might not feel much pain from a hike, but some of its competitors would.", "author": "Jordan Weissmann", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The retail behemoth might not feel much pain from a hike, but some of its competitors would.", "title": "Why a Minimum-Wage Hike Could Be Good for Wal-Mart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/Walmart_Wages_Protest/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/why-a-minimum-wage-hike-could-be-good-for-walmart/283976/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee9c\"", "article_summary": "The company previously backed a minimum wage increase in 2007 and has good reasons to be at ease with the idea today.\nWal-Mart, the b\u00eate noire of American labor unions, the king of all low-pay retail, might be kosher with the idea of a minimum wage hike.\nSo long as the cost of labor rises for everybody, at least within certain limits, Wal-Mart doesn't have much reason to sweat.\nThat's one reason why, as Lydia Dypillis notes, \"Wal-Mart is much better able to absorb a minimum wage increase than its smaller competitors,\" which are more likely to rely on bonafide minimum wage, opposed to merely low-wage, employees.\n*If you assume that Wal-Mart is hell-bent on paying its associates as little as possible, its casual attitude here might seem surprising."}
