This month Christy offers a round up of the data on global warming trends from the past 36 years. He notes:\n\nThis report represents the completion of 36 years (December 1978 through November 2014) of global temperature data collected by microwave sounding units on NOAA and NASA satellites. During that time the global atmosphere has warmed an average of 0.14 C per decade, or just over one-half degree C (0.91 degrees Fahrenheit) in 36 years (emphasis added).\n\nThat warming has not, however, been uniform around the globe. The fastest warming has been over the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic portions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Those areas have warmed at the rate of 0.49 C per decade, or more than 1.76 C (about 3.17 degrees Fahrenheit) in 36 years. The fastest warming spot is in Baffin Bay, where temperatures have risen 0.82 C per decade since 1978.\n\nBy comparison, the oceans surrounding the Antarctic are cooling at the rate of 0.02 C per decade, or 0.07 C since December 1978. The fastest cooling area is in East Antarctica near Dome C, where temperatures have been dropping at the rate of 0.50 C per decade.\n\nDriven in part by those contrasting regions, the Northern Hemisphere is warming more than twice as fast as the Southern Hemisphere (0.19 C per decade vs. 0.09 C per decade).\n\nThe contiguous 48 U.S. states have an average warming rate of 0.22 C (almost 0.40 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade during the past 36 years. That means the average atmospheric temperature over the lower 48 has warmed by 0.79 C or about 1.43 degrees Fahrenheit during that time (emphasis added).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Every month University of Alabama in Birmingham Huntsville climatologists John Christy and Roy Spencer publish the latest global temperature trend data", "title": "Global Warming 36 Year Update: Atmosphere has warmed an average of 0.14 C per decade, or just over one-half degree C (0.91 degrees Fahrenheit).", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/12/04/global-warming-36-year-update-atmosphere", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14177142863558.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/rbailey/2014_12/November2014Temperatures.jpg", "description": "Every month University of Alabama in Birmingham Huntsville\nclimatologists John Christy and Roy Spencer publish the latest\nglobal temperature trend data obtained from NOAA satellites.
