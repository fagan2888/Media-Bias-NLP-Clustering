That might ordinarily be the job of the U.S. Surgeon General, but as of now, we don\u2019t actually have one.\n\nAs regular readers may recall , President Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy to the post nearly a year ago, and at first blush, this seemed like a no-brainer \u2013 Murthy is an impressive medical professional with sterling credentials. He\u2019s an attending physician, an instructor, and a public-health advocate, so when Obama nominated him for the post, no one questioned his qualifications.\n\nBut Murthy, like so many in his field, also sees a connection between gun violence and public health, which meant Republicans and the NRA decided to destroy his nomination. Senate Democrats could have confirmed him anyway, but red-state Dems got election-year jitters, which means. at least for now, Murthy has been temporarily derailed and the Surgeon General\u2019s office is empty during a public-health scare.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Fox News\u2019 Steve Doocy told his audience something interesting yesterday:\n\n\u201cYou would normally think that in something like this, the Surgeon General would be in charge, but right now at this point oddly, the United States of America does not have a Surgeon General. His nomination is tied up in politics.\u201d\n\nEllie Sandmeyer explained yesterday:\n\nFox personalities repeatedly worked to cast doubt on Dr. Vivek Murthy\u2019s nomination, questioning his strong qualifications and smearing him as \u201ctoo political\u201d for the job. In March, network host Brian Kilmeade alleged that Murthy \u201chasn\u2019t done much in his career yet,\u201d and argued that \u201cyou want to be impressed with\u201d a Surgeon General nominee\u2019s resume. [\u2026] In addition to questioning Murthy\u2019s qualifications, Fox has also worked to baselessly politicize Murthy\u2019s position that gun violence should be considered a public health issue. Fox & Friends co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck falsely claimed that Murthy views gun ownership as a \u201cdisease\u201d and forwarded claims that he has \u201ca radical agenda when it comes to guns and your health.\u201d Network legal analyst Peter Johnson Jr. suggested Murthy would make the examining room about \u201cabout party registration or about gun registration,\u201d and Fox host Megyn Kelly claimed that Murthy is \u201cnot a big fan of the Second Amendment,\u201d and said he is \u201cso anti-gun that the NRA has decided to score this vote.\u201d\n\nSo when a Fox host complains that \u201cpolitics\u201d is leading to a vacancy in the Surgeon General\u2019s office, the natural follow-up question is, \u201cYes, and exactly whose politics might be responsible for this result?\u201d\n\nAs Rachel noted on the show last night, the public would benefit from having a qualified medical professional focused specifically on helping Americans better understand these complex medical questions.
