Although the surgery has been previously attempted, this is the first time that surgeons have seen a full recovery and lasting function.\n\nThe nine-hour-long operation was led by Dr. Andr\u00e9 van der Merwe and performed at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town in December, according to a Stellenbosch University press release. Now, three months later, the University announced that the unidentified patient has made a full recovery and has regained function of the newly transplanted organ.\n\n\"Our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years, and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery,\" Van der Merwe said in the press release. \"The end result of the transplant was the restoration of all the patient's urinary and reproductive functions.\"\n\nThe young man suffered devastating injuries sustained during a ritual circumcision and needed to have his entire penis amputated in order to save his life. Complete penile amputations like the patient's are unfortunately common in South Africa due to the circumcision tradition, and can run upward of 200 in a single year. The consequences of losing such an important organ can be devastating for young men, with some unable to cope with the psychological loss and resorting to suicide, Van der Merwe explained.\n\nMedically speaking, the operation itself is not very complicated. The South African team used a similar technique to that done on face transplants, using microscopic surgery to connect small blood vessels and nerves. It\u2019s the lengthy recovery period, however, that can prove difficult.\n\nThe first recorded case of a penile transplant occurred in China on a 44-year-old man who refused to explain how he lost the organ. Although the operation was successful overall, only two weeks following the surgery, the man asked that his transplant be removed due to his wife's severe rejection.\n\nThe South African case, though, may hopefully set a precedent for more successful future operations. The transplant is available to men who have lost their penises to accidents and cancers, and can even be used as a long-term solution for cases of severe erectile dysfunction, Sky News reported.\n\n\"It's a massive breakthrough. We've proved that it can be done \u2014 we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had,\" Professor Frank Graewe, who assisted in the operation, explained in the press release.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "operation, transplant, surgery, penis transplant, circumcision", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The world's first successful penis transplant was recently completed in South Africa, and doctors hope this operation may one day help more men with penile injuries.", "title": "Man Receives World's First Successful Penis Transplant In South Africa", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/worlds-first-successful-penis-transplant-man-receives-new-sex-organ-after-9-hour-325604", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/13/penis-transplant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The world's first successful penis transplant was recently completed in South Africa, and doctors hope this operation may one day help more men with penile injuries.", "title": "Man Receives World's First Successful Penis Transplant In South Africa", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/worlds-first-successful-penis-transplant-man-receives-new-sex-organ-after-9-hour-325604", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/13/penis-transplant.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/13/penis-transplant.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-13T13:16:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T13:24:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The world's first successful penis transplant was recently completed in South Africa, and doctors hope this operation may one day help more men with penile injuries."}, "article_summary": "Doctors in South Africa have performed the world\u2019s first successful penis transplant on a 21-year-old man who lost his penis after a botched circumcision.\nAlthough the operation was successful overall, only two weeks following the surgery, the man asked that his transplant be removed due to his wife's severe rejection.\n\"Our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years, and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery,\" Van der Merwe said in the press release.\nAlthough the surgery has been previously attempted, this is the first time that surgeons have seen a full recovery and lasting function.\nThe nine-hour-long operation was led by Dr. Andr\u00e9 van der Merwe and performed at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town in December, according to a Stellenbosch University press release."}
