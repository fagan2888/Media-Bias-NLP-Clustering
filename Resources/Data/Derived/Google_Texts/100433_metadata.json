Each group of students had to find parts of their eight piece train using clues given to them. As they were searching for clues, the groups had to walk around as a train and take pieces to the gym.\n\nAdditionally, each child created a silhouette of themselves, which now line the halls of the school in the form of a train.\n\nOne of the classroom doors was decorated in a \"Polar Express\" theme for the \"Polar Express\" Day. (Courtesy Photo)\n\nFollowing lunch, the students got to watch \"The Polar Express\" movie. During intermission everyone enjoyed hot chocolate and after the move was finished, each child found a bell on their desk to signify \"they believe,\" like in the movie.\n\nCallie Jones: 970-526-9286, cjones@journal-advocate.com\n\nAdvertisement", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_27174883/caliche-elementary-celebrates-start-christmas-break-polar-express-day", "sailthru.author": "By Callie Jones \n \n  Journal-Advocate staff writer", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:27174883:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-20T07:02:12-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "ILIFF \u2014 Students at Caliche Elementary School celebrated their final day of school before Christmas break with a \"Polar Express\" Day Friday.", "title": "Caliche Elementary celebrates start of Christmas break with 'Polar Express' Day", "url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_27174883/caliche-elementary-celebrates-start-christmas-break-polar-express-day", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/1219/20141219__20STPolar_Express_Day~1.jpg", "site": "@SterlingJA", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "modificationDate": "2014-12-19T20:20:28-0700", "endDate": "2024-12-19T20:12:06-0700", "news_keywords": "Local News, Local News news, Sterling Colorado Local News news, Sterling Colorado news, Local News Sterling news, Local News Colorado news, US Local News news, world Local News news.", "byline": "By Callie JonesJournal-Advocate", "pubDate": "2014-12-19T20:22:05-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-20T07:02:12-0700", "sailthru.title": "Caliche Elementary celebrates start of Christmas break with 'Polar Express' Day", "verify-v1": "BXs3Tp/yfKM8u4D/sQH/llaXrumTjsEN3+pi+oLzohs=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/1219/20141219__20STPolar_Express_Day~2_300.jpg", "description": "ILIFF \u2014 Students at Caliche Elementary School celebrated their final day of school before Christmas break with a \"Polar Express\" Day Friday.", "sailthru.site": "journal-advocate.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_27174883/caliche-elementary-celebrates-start-christmas-break-polar-express-day", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/1219/20141219__20STPolar_Express_Day~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "ILIFF \u2014 Students at Caliche Elementary School celebrated their final day of school before Christmas break with a \"Polar Express\" Day Friday.", "title": "Caliche Elementary celebrates start of Christmas break with 'Polar Express' Day"}, "google-site-verification": "2iNkVYi6fQKhylL0pQaJF4qvYsz3qMnvr9EdKrmIbvw", "y_key": "b781c784225bf6e2", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/1219/20141219__20STPolar_Express_Day~2.jpg"}, "article_summary": "One of the classroom doors was decorated in a \"Polar Express\" theme for the \"Polar Express\" Day.\n(Courtesy Photo)ILIFF \u2014 Students at Caliche Elementary School celebrated their final day of school before Christmas break with a \"Polar Express\" Day Friday.\n( Courtesy photo )Caliche Elementary students created their own \"Polar Express\" train with silhouettes of themselves shown in each of the windows of the train, as part of the school's Polar Express\" Day.\nActivities include scavenger hunt, silhouette craftCaliche Elementary students line up as a train as they look for clues during a scavenger hunt, part of the school's \"Polar Express\" Day Friday, Dec. 19, to celebrate the last day of school before Christmas break.\nThe day started with a train scavenger hunt throughout the school."}
