Iraqi troops tied the dissidents\u2019 hands behind their backs and shot them in the head, said a camp resident who requested anonymity out of concern for his safety.\n\nIraqi officials acknowledged the deaths but blamed them on infighting among the camp\u2019s 100 residents. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq strongly condemned the \u201cterrible events\u201d at Camp Ashraf.\n\nSaddam Hussein allowed the Iranian exiles, members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MeK), to set up their paramilitary base at Camp Ashraf in the 1980s. The dissidents oppose Iran\u2019s theocratic regime.\n\nAfter the Iraqi dictator was overthrown in a U.S.-led invasion in 2003, the U.S. military disarmed the dissidents, who had renounced violence in 2001. The State Department removed the MeK from its list of terrorist groups a year ago.\n\nNearly 3,000 of Camp Ashraf\u2019s residents have been relocated to Camp Liberty, near Baghdad\u2019s international airport, under a United Nations-brokered deal that seeks to resettle the Iranians abroad. A total of 162 MeK members have been resettled abroad so far, mostly in Albania.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite whose government has grown close to Iran\u2018s, wants the Iranian dissidents out of his country.\n\nWhile most of the Iranian exiles were relocated to Camp Liberty, about 100 remained at Camp Ashraf to look after their property.\n\nOn Sunday, Iraqi special forces \u201ckilled them one by one\u201d and set fire to buildings inside the camp, the source at Camp Ashraf said. He put the death toll at 52 and said seven others are missing. Six of the missing are women.\n\nShahin Gobadi, a Paris-based spokesman for the MeK, also known as the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also said 52 people had been killed.\n\nAli al-Moussawi, a spokesman for Mr. al-Maliki, confirmed that some camp residents had been killed. He said a preliminary investigation suggested they died as a result of infighting among camp residents, and he denied that Iraqi forces were involved, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe U.N. condemned the attack and called on the Iraqi government to investigate the incident and determine who was responsible.\n\n\u201cThe priority for the Iraqi government is to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and to ensure their security and safety against any violence from any side,\u201d said Gyorgy Busztin, the deputy special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for Iraq.\n\nUnder its humanitarian mandate, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq \u201cis closely following up on developments on the ground, and is using all possible means to conduct its own assessment of the situation\u201d, Mr. Busztin said.\n\nAt Camp Liberty, meanwhile, residents have gone on a hunger strike to protest the attack on Camp Ashraf, said Shahriar Kia, a spokesman for the residents said in a phone interview from Camp Liberty.\n\nCamp Ashraf previously has been the target of Iraqi forces: In July 2009, a least nine dissidents were killed in an Iraqi army raid, and 34 were killed in a massive attack in April 2011 that was widely denounced as a massacre.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iraqi security forces carried out a \"massacre\" of 52 unarmed Iranian dissidents early Sunday at their camp north of Baghdad, the Iranian exiles said.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Iraqi security forces carried out a \u201cmassacre\u201d of 52 unarmed Iranian dissidents early Sunday at their camp north of Baghdad, the Iranian exiles said.", "title": "52 Iranian exiles killed at Iraq\u2019s Camp Ashraf", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/1/least-47-iranian-exiles-killed-iraqs-camp-ashraf/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/01/mideast-iraq-iranian-_lea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/01/mideast-iraq-iranian-_lea.jpg", "description": "Iraqi security forces carried out a \"massacre\" of 52 unarmed Iranian dissidents early Sunday at their camp north of Baghdad, the Iranian exiles said.", "card": "summary", "title": "52 Iranian exiles killed at Iraq\u2019s Camp Ashraf"}, "Author": "Ashish Kumar Sen", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Camp Ashraf, Iraq, Mujahedeen E Khalq"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd435b\"", "article_summary": "While most of the Iranian exiles were relocated to Camp Liberty, about 100 remained at Camp Ashraf to look after their property.\nIraqi security forces carried out a \u201cmassacre\u201d of 52 unarmed Iranian dissidents early Sunday at their camp north of Baghdad, the Iranian exiles said.\nOn Sunday, Iraqi special forces \u201ckilled them one by one\u201d and set fire to buildings inside the camp, the source at Camp Ashraf said.\nSaddam Hussein allowed the Iranian exiles, members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MeK), to set up their paramilitary base at Camp Ashraf in the 1980s.\nThe assault on Camp Ashraf began at 5 a.m. and lasted until late afternoon."}
