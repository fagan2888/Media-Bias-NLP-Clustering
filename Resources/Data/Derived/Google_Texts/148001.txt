CALGARY, Alberta — Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said that star forward Matt Duchene will miss Friday night’s game at Calgary after injuring his knee Wednesday at Vancouver.

“Status is going to be day-to-day,” Roy said. “He hurt his knee last game, and we hope he will be able to recover pretty fast.”

Meanwhile, Roy said that defenseman Chris Bigras, who has been out with a concussion suffered March 5 against Nashville, will play Friday night. Forward Gabe Landeskog will return Sunday at Edmonton after serving a three-game suspension for a reckless crosscheck on Anaheim defenseman Simon Despres.

“Bigras will play tonight, he cleared yesterday,” Roy said.

“We’re going to play with 11 forwards and seven defenseman tonight. After tonight, Landy will be in lineup against Edmonton and we’ll go back with four lines.”

In Duchene’s stead, John Mitchell will slot in on the top line with Jarome Iginla and Mikhail Grigorenko.

“The trades we made at the deadline, or just before, were in order to have more depth,” Roy said. “We feel that Mikael Boedker and Shawn Matthias are going to help us play some good hockey.”
