Ted Cruz (R-TX) was entering CNN\u2019s Crossfire, where he had to contend with Van Jones and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), without too much help from Newt Gingrich. Now that House Republicans are prepared to move forward with a short-term debt deal that doesn\u2019t touch the Affordable Care Act, Jones asked Cruz, \u201cDo you feel like you owe your party an apology?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJones noted that the Republican Party has become incredibly unpopular under Cruz\u2019s \u201cleadership,\u201d saying that since the Texas senator entered office in January he\u2019s become \u201cthe most prominent Republican in this town.\u201d After stressing that \u201cwe\u2019re all friends here,\u201d Jones asked Cruz:\n\n\u201cDo you feel like you owe your party an apology? Listen, you have people who believed in you, they believed that you were somehow going to be able to defund Obamacare, they believed the strategy of shutdown might have a chance. They followed you into a ditch. And now, there\u2019s obviously there\u2019s no chance Obamacare will be defunded and we\u2019re on the brink of a horrific default. Do you think that in the reflection of your own heart, you might say, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m a new kid here, I think I owe you an apology\u2019?\u201d\n\nCruz laughed at first before getting more serious and asking some questions of his own. \u201cI know you desperately want to change the topic from Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats in this town do not want to discuss Obamacare. Why? Because it isn\u2019t working.\u201d He then turned to focus on negative polling numbers for President Obama and Democrats, crediting House Republicans who are \u201clistening to the millions of Americans who are losing their jobs, who are being pushed into part-time work, who are facing skyrocketing health care.\u201d\n\nWhen Sen. Whitehouse got a chance to chime in, he called the \u201cnotion that Obamacare is a failure\u201d a \u201cproduct of right-wing histrionics.\u201d He told stories about how well he believes the exchanges are going so far in his home state.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party decided that Obamacare was going to be a failure early on, before Obamacare was even decided,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cIt was a political choice to pull all support for anything this president wanted to do. Now they have to live with it, so they have to maintain the story line. But I have to tell you Senator Cruz, I don\u2019t see it at home, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via CNN:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just as Republican leaders were exiting their meeting with President Obama at the White House Thursday, Sen.
