LOS ANGELES (RNN) – Sandwich shop Jimmy John's trying to settle a class-action lawsuit like its catchphrase – “freaky fast.”

Legal documents show that the plaintiff, Heather Starks, filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles County, CA, claiming that a sandwich she ordered was supposed to contain sprouts but did not.

Starks claimed “that she purchased sandwiches advertised in online and in-store menus, among other places, as including sprouts, which did not in fact include sprouts.”

She sued Jimmy John's, listing fraud and a violation of California's False Advertising Act, among other claims.

While Jimmy John's denied Starks' claims and any wrongdoing, they are settling the suit, and issuing vouchers for the total of any side item to anyone who claims they purchased any sandwich that was to include sprouts, but did not.

The voucher would cover items like cookies, chips and soft drinks to all who successfully file claims. The vouchers will total “up to a maximum of $725,000 less the actual costs of the settlement administration.”

The documents also say Jimmy John's “has agreed to cease and desist” all claims of their sandwiches having sprouts if they aren't served with them. They are also donating at least $100,000 to charity, based on the number of claims filed.

Customers must fill out a form on Jimmy John's website, stating they purchased a sprout-less sandwich from Feb. 1, 2012 and July 21, 2014.

Jimmy John's has more than 2,000 stores across the U.S.
