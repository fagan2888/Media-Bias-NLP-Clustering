For these purposes, MAGI is defined as:\n\nYour adjusted gross income (the bottom line on the first page of your Form 1040), plus\n\nAny foreign earned income that was excluded from adjusted gross income, plus\n\nAny tax-exempt interest, plus\n\nAny Social Security benefits that were excluded from adjusted gross income.\n\nIn short, through specific tax planning actions, you can minimize your household income, thereby increasing the subsidies you receive.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re still working, contributions to tax-deferred retirement accounts (e.g., a traditional IRA) reduce your household income. Conversely, if you\u2019re retired and purchasing insurance on one of the new exchanges, you can reduce your household income by prioritizing spending from Roth accounts and/or taxable accounts rather than spending from tax-deferred accounts.\n\nA key point to understand about Affordable Care Act subsidies is that they work differently from most income-based tax breaks. With most tax breaks (e.g., the ability to make Roth IRA contributions), your eligibility decreases gradually as your income increases above a certain threshold.\n\nIn contrast, while the premium tax credit (i.e., the subsidy that reduces your premiums) does gradually decrease as your income increases, it disappears entirely as soon as your household income exceeds 400% of the federal poverty level. In addition, the other Affordable Care Act subsidies (which affect things such as your out-of-pocket maximum or your deductible) decrease sharply at certain income levels (specifically, 300%, 250%, 200%, and 150% of the federal poverty level), according to the ACA.\n\nIn other words, there can be situations in which a single additional dollar of income can cause you to lose out on a subsidy with a four-figure value. As a result, it\u2019s often advantageous to try to keep your income just below one of the applicable thresholds.\n\nMike Piper (@michaelrpiper) is the author of the blog ObliviousInvestor.com and personal-finance books, including his latest, \u201cSocial Security Made Simple.\u201d\n\nRead the latest Wealth Management Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "One health insurance-related mistake that I\u2019ve seen many people make this year is to fail to realize that they have some control over the size of Affordable Care Act subsidies that they can receive for purchasing health insurance on the new exchanges.", "title": "Here\u2019s the Math for Calculating ACA Subsidies", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/12/heres-the-math-for-calculating-aca-subsidies/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FM687_expert_P_20141111165538.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Here\u2019s the Math for Calculating ACA Subsidies", "description": "One health insurance-related mistake that I\u2019ve seen many people make this year is to fail to realize that they have some control over the size of Affordable Care Act subsidies that they can receive for purchasing health insurance on the new exchanges.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "One health insurance-related mistake that I\u2019ve seen many people make this year is to fail to realize that they have some control over the size of Affordable Care Act subsidies that they can receive for purchasing health insurance on the new exchanges.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-11-12T11:08:57-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/12/heres-the-math-for-calculating-aca-subsidies/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-4561", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "One health insurance-related mistake that I\u2019ve seen many people make this year is to fail to realize that they have some control over the size of Affordable Care Act subsidies that they can receive for purchasing health insurance on the new exchanges.", "title": "Here\u2019s the Math for Calculating ACA Subsidies", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/11/12/heres-the-math-for-calculating-aca-subsidies/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FM687_expert_P_20141111165538.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-4561", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-11T22:55:37-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9992\"", "article_summary": "Your household income is calculated as your \u201cmodified adjusted gross income\u201d (MAGI) plus the MAGI of your spouse and dependents.\nFor example, if you\u2019re still working, contributions to tax-deferred retirement accounts (e.g., a traditional IRA) reduce your household income.\nFor these purposes, MAGI is defined as:Your adjusted gross income (the bottom line on the first page of your Form 1040), plusAny foreign earned income that was excluded from adjusted gross income, plusAny tax-exempt interest, plusAny Social Security benefits that were excluded from adjusted gross income.\nA key point to understand about Affordable Care Act subsidies is that they work differently from most income-based tax breaks.\nIn short, through specific tax planning actions, you can minimize your household income, thereby increasing the subsidies you receive."}
