WASHINGTON -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is taking her obsession with chocolate to new heights this week by starring as a guest judge on TLC's "Next Great Baker," where she will decide which contestants' desserts are good enough to keep them from being eliminated from the show.

Pelosi will appear on the show on Tuesday night. Hosted by Buddy Valastro, the episode will feature bakers competing to win over Pelosi with their baked treats, and for a chance to be featured in People magazine.

"As a fellow Italian American and a dark chocoholic, it was an honor to visit Buddy's cake factory and be a guest judge on Next Great Baker," Pelosi said in a statement. "It was a delicious experience."

The California Democrat has made no secret of her fanatical relationship with dark chocolate -- she keeps it stashed all over her Capitol Hill office and even credits it with helping to pass the Affordable Care Act.
