Since then, former employees of Zinser have come forward, saying that the IG created a \u201ctoxic work environment,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, a bipartisan group of legislators led by Rep. Lamar Smith, the Chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, sent a scathing letter to Zinser calling on him to immediately remove his top deputies allegedly involved in the gag orders.\n\n\n\n\u201cIncredibly, these advisers were your chief legal counsel and head of whistleblower protection. Based on the conduct your senior managers engaged in, and unambiguously documented by the OSC investigative report, your own internal disciplinary policies approved and endorsed by you call for their suspension and possible removal from office. You have done neither,\u201d the letter said.\n\n\n\nRelated: No Wonder There\u2019s So Much Government Waste\n\nThe lawmakers added that the IG\u2019s actions \u201cled us to wonder about your history of conduct toward whistleblowers,\u201d which prompted them to dive into Zinser\u2019s background. They went on to say they were surprised to find out that Zinser himself had been accused of whistleblower retaliation at his former position as the deputy assistant IG at the Department of Transportation\u2014a detail he failed to mention at his Senate confirmation hearing in 2007.\n\n\n\nAccording to The Post, Zinser said it was an oversight. \u201cI just never thought of myself as a subject [of the investigation], although maybe I was,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmakers said they are also looking into whether Zinser hired certain staffers with whom he had personal relationships. In one case in particular, he allegedly hired a female worker with whom he was romantically involved. Zinser claims the relationship occurred prior to her employment.\n\nStill, the lawmakers said they will continue their probe and asked the IG for additional work documents and journals.\n\n\u201cThe Committee has uncovered evidence questioning whether the Commerce IG\u2019s office is functioning with integrity. We must determine if these allegations are true and if so, they are the result of systemic issues that may require legislative action,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a federal auditor has been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nEarlier this year, a Senate oversight panel released a report accusing the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s top auditor, Charles Edwards, of intentionally altering and delaying investigations. Edwards, who served as the DHS\u2019s acting IG, allegedly went to dinner and drinks with department officials and updated them on inside information about the IG\u2019s findings.\n\nEdwards left his post last year to join another agency within DHS, however, after the report was published. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson put him on paid administrative leave.\n\nMeanwhile, the Council of Inspectors General is conducting its own investigation into Edwards' case.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/18/Why-Government-Watchdog-Needs-Watching", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03192012_gov_corruption_article.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Why This Government Watchdog Needs Watching"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/18/Why-Government-Watchdog-Needs-Watching", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03192012_gov_corruption_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a7c\"", "article_summary": "Edwards, who served as the DHS\u2019s acting IG, allegedly went to dinner and drinks with department officials and updated them on inside information about the IG\u2019s findings.\nSince then, former employees of Zinser have come forward, saying that the IG created a \u201ctoxic work environment,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\nStill, the lawmakers said they will continue their probe and asked the IG for additional work documents and journals.\nWhat happens when the top officials responsible for exposing wrongdoing within the federal government are the very ones involved in it?\nThe lawmakers said they are also looking into whether Zinser hired certain staffers with whom he had personal relationships."}
