That year marked the first time where more federal money was spent on home and community-based LTC services than institutional care.\n\nThat spending includes money put toward initiatives to keep seniors living in their homes, like home care aides and coverage for seniors to take Ubers to doctors' appointments, the AP reported.\n\nLegislators have also focused on improving the quality of care for home and community-based programs, implementing regulations where federal LTC funding for states hinges on seniors being able to choose where they live and be treated with dignity.\n\nThe push for home and community-based care has some senior advocates worried, as demand for LTC services increases along with the government's need to control Medicaid costs.
