When she did, winning the women\u2019s title for the second time, Carfrae rushed to embrace her exhausted beau.\n\n\u201cShe sees me and I see this look in her eye,\u201d O\u2019Donnell recalled with amusement recently. \u201cShe\u2019s coming right at me and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, no, please don\u2019t jump.\u2019 She jumps right into my arms. I\u2019ve just finished the race too. I was like, \u2018Uh, I\u2019m going to drop her.\u2019 I could feel my quads just locking up. Luckily I didn\u2019t drop her.\u201d\n\nMarried last December, the Boulder couple is going back to Kona for the Ironman World Championships on Oct. 11. And this time they have high hopes that O\u2019Donnell will become the first American man to win since Boulder\u2019s Tim DeBoom did it in 2001 and 2002.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I want more this year,\u201d said Carfrae, an Australian. \u201cI\u2019ve won the race and I\u2019d love to win again. I\u2019ve put in as much preparation as I can. But after winning last year, my second time winning in Kona, all I really want is for him to find that success and know what it\u2019s like to finish in first place.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Donnell, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, is fitter than he was last year. And he has a new coach \u2014 Ironman legend Mark Allen, who won Kona six times.\n\n\u201cAfter last year\u2019s finish, a lot more people have taken notice,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell, 33. \u201cA lot of people come up to me genuinely, like, \u2018We want you to win. We want an American to win, we want it to be you.\u2019 Knowing that people are really excited that I have the chance to do that, it\u2019s pretty motivating.\u201d\n\nThat brings pressure, though, and a lot of things can go wrong in a race consisting of a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a marathon run (26.2 miles) in the oppressive heat and humidity of Hawaii. O\u2019Donnell plans to use the expectations of others as fuel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all how you spin it internally,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy and excitement that other people have toward me, being able to do this. I need to use their energy and bolster my performance from them. I just feel stronger, because I know I have the support of so many people.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Donnell was a record-setting high school swimmer in Pennsylvania before going to Annapolis, where took up triathlon at the suggestion of his older brother, a fellow Midshipman. After he graduated in 2003, the Navy sent him to grad school at UC Berkeley to get a master\u2019s degree in ocean engineering. He continued to compete in triathlons, winning the U.S. under-23 national title.\n\nThe Navy supported O\u2019Donnell\u2019s bid to make the 2008 Olympic team, sending him to train as a resident at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, but he finished sixth at the Olympic Trials and failed to make the team. After that he left the Navy to pursue triathlon full time and began to think about switching from the shorter Olympic distance to Ironman and half-Ironman races.\n\n\u201cI sat on the fence for a year and a half, almost two years,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a swimmer growing up, that\u2019s all there is, right? The Olympics. As a kid I watched Janet Evans and Matt Biondi, that\u2019s what I wanted to do, I wanted to go to the Olympics. But my running wasn\u2019t quite (good enough).\u201d\n\nHe began dating Carfrae the summer of 2009, and that fall he went to Kona with her.\n\n\u201cGoing down to the finish line at midnight, just the whole race experience, it was overwhelming,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cI got really excited. I\u2019m like, \u2018This is kind of what I want to do.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIt took him a while to commit, but he finally devoted himself fully to the Ironman after competing in an Olympic distance event in South Korea a week after the 2010 Ironman, where Carfrae won her first title.\n\n\u201cThere were about 10 people standing around, watching in this fishing village that just reeked of rotten fish,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018What am I doing here? This doesn\u2019t excite me the way Ironman does.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sit on the fence. If you want to make the Olympic team, or you want to win Kona, you have to be committed. I said, \u2018If you could do one thing in the sport, what would it be?\u2019 I said to myself, \u2018I want to win Kona. Maybe I could make the Olympic team, (but) I\u2019m not going to win a medal,\u2019 just didn\u2019t have that leg speed. I said, \u2018Let\u2019s commit.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t win Kona this year, he should have other opportunities. He\u2019s probably got another five to 10 years at the top of the sport if he stays healthy and hungry.\n\n\u201cI got out of the Navy \u2014 gave up a great job with benefits, awesome pension \u2014 and went all-in because it\u2019s one thing I want to do, win Hawaii,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I put all my energy into. The American thing is important as well. I was the top American last year, so I think I\u2019m in a good spot to try to be that next guy to (win) it.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Timothy O\u2019Donnell determined to take Kona crown in triathlon", "title": "Timothy O\u2019Donnell determined to take Kona crown in triathlon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/27/timothy-odonnell-determined-to-take-kona-crown-in-triathlon/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_CC12_SP28OEXIRONMANp3.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140927__20140928_CC12_SP28OEXIRONMANp3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T18:50:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:25:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "article_summary": "If you want to make the Olympic team, or you want to win Kona, you have to be committed.\nI said, \u2018Let\u2019s commit.\u2019 \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t win Kona this year, he should have other opportunities.\nI said, \u2018If you could do one thing in the sport, what would it be?\u2019 I said to myself, \u2018I want to win Kona.\nBOULDER \u2014 After finishing fifth as the top American at the Kona Ironman triathlon last year, Timothy O\u2019Donnell waited at the finish line for his fianc\u00e9e, Mirinda Carfrae, to arrive.\nMaybe I could make the Olympic team, (but) I\u2019m not going to win a medal,\u2019 just didn\u2019t have that leg speed."}
