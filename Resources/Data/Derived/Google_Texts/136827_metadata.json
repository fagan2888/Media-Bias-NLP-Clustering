This annual scientific meeting of the world\u2019s leading researchers working to understand, prevent, and treat HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C (HCV), Ebola, and related infectious diseases provides a vital forum for translating laboratory and clinical research into progress against these diseases. Several thousand HIV/AIDS and infectious disease research leaders from dozens of countries will assemble to share the latest studies, important developments, and research methods.\n\nTo learn more about the always-evolving science related to HIV/AIDS and HCV, AIDS.gov is attending CROI. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ll share highlights from the conference here on the blog next week and the week following. This will include video interviews by Dr. Ronald Valdiserri of HHS as well as science highlights from NIH\u2019s Dr. Carl Dieffenbach.\n\nWe encourage you to learn more about CROI. View the program-at-a-glance. You can also access webcasts, abstracts, electronic posters, and other resources available online at the conference website (www.CROIconference.org ).
