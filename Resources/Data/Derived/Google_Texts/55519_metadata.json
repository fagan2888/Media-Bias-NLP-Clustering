The rules already on the books are about to be enforced to a degree that will prompt a period of adjustment for all concerned.\n\nWith urging from the college game, pro football appears determined to clean up its act.\n\n\u201cAfter looking at a lot of tape and after talking and consulting with different entities - the coaches subcommittee, the Players Association and others - we agreed that we have an issue on the field,\u2019\u2019 said Rams coach Jeff Fisher, a long-time member of the Competition Committee. \u201cWe agreed that we are going to get it under control as soon as we possibly can.\u2019\u2019\n\nNoting that incidents of taunting vaulted from nine in 2012 to 34 last year, Fisher suggests a zero tolerance policy will be in place well before the start of training camp.\n\n\u201cWe are going to effect change immediately and that change will be effected as early as the OTAs when players come back,\u2019\u2019 said Fisher. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to change our conduct on the field. We\u2019ve got to bring the element of respect in its highest level back to our game. We are going to clean the game up on the field between the players. The language is all in the book under unsportsmanlike conduct. There is no change in the rule -- we are going to enforce the current rule.\u2019\u2019\n\nPredictably, there are critics.\n\nThe NFL has been dubbed the \u201cNo-Fun League\u2019\u2019 for awhile, and this crackdown on sportsmanship will undoubtedly embolden the skeptics whose mantra is simple: let \u2018em play.\n\nFisher\u2019s answer is equally simple -- we tried that, and it\u2019s not working.\n\nThis $10 billion industry sets the tone for every college and high school player dreaming of a pro career. The NFL seems determined to be a responsible role model.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA is hoping for us to do something at our level and we\u2019ve got to take the leap,\u2019\u2019 Fisher said. \u201cWe are going to do that. If the college athlete sees something on the weekends that the pro athletes is doing, they, most of the time, are going to act the same way. Colleges are adamant about sportsmanship on the field and celebrations and taunting and things like that. They don\u2019t tolerate it. Now, sometimes they may not see it, but we\u2019ve got to get to that point where we can\u2019t tolerate it.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen Commissioner Roger Goodell addressed NFL owners in Orlando a few weeks ago, he emphasized the R-word.\n\n\u201cWith more success comes more responsibility for all of us to step up and lead,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cRespect for our game and those that came before us. Respect for each other \u2014 teams, opponents, and game officials. Respect for our fans, our lifeblood. Respect in our workplaces for the diversity that makes us stronger. Respect for our communities and the important role we play in those communities. Let\u2019s embrace the opportunity to make a difference ... we\u2019re expected to do that.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, trash talking has approached the level of performance art at NFL stadiums.\n\nRemember when Bucs Hall of Fame defensive tackle Warren Sapp used to walk through the opposing team\u2019s pre-game stretch, just to remind them who\u2019s boss?\n\nIt sounds like those macho days are over in a league full of Rodney Dangerfields, just looking for a little respect.\n\nikaufman@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7833\n\nTwitter: @IKaufmanTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 06 Apr 2014 08:16:08 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2013 You can celebrate, but don\u2019t gloat.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2013 You can celebrate, but don\u2019t gloat.", "title": "NFL cleaning up its act on poor sportsmanship", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/bucs/nfl-cleaning-up-its-act-on-poor-sportsmanship-20140406/", "image": {"width": 1133, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140406/ARTICLE/140409406/EP/1/1/EP-140409406.jpg", "height": 820}, "updated_time": "2014-04-06T11:39:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2013 You can celebrate, but don\u2019t gloat.", "title": "NFL cleaning up its act on poor sportsmanship", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140406/ARTICLE/140409406/AR/0/AR-140409406.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-04-06T08:16:08Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-04-06T11:39:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6e9\"", "article_summary": "The NFL has publicly informed its players, coaches and executives that they are on notice.\nWith urging from the college game, pro football appears determined to clean up its act.\nThe NFL has been dubbed the \u201cNo-Fun League\u2019\u2019 for awhile, and this crackdown on sportsmanship will undoubtedly embolden the skeptics whose mantra is simple: let \u2018em play.\n\u201cWe are going to effect change immediately and that change will be effected as early as the OTAs when players come back,\u2019\u2019 said Fisher.\nColleges are adamant about sportsmanship on the field and celebrations and taunting and things like that."}
