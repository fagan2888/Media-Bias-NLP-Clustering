But \u201cthe option would be such a provocation to the separatists that it could destabilize the situation.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. State Department released satellite images that it says back up its claims that rockets have been fired from Russia into eastern Ukraine, and heavy artillery for separatists has also crossed the border.\n\nA four-page document released by the State Department seems to show blast marks from where rockets were launched and craters where they landed. Officials said the images, sourced from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, show heavy weapons fired between July 21 and July 26 \u2014 after the July 17 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.\n\nUkraine\u2019s National Security Council said Sunday that government troops have encircled Horlivka, a key rebel stronghold, and that there had been fighting in other cities in the east. Horlivka lies around 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of the main rebel-held city of Donetsk.\n\nThe armed forces \u201chave increased assaults on territory held by pro-Russian mercenaries, destroyed checkpoints and positions and moved very close to Horlivka,\u201d the council said in a statement.\n\nA representative of the separatist military command in Donetsk confirmed that there had been fighting in Horlivka but said that rebel fighters were holding their positions.\n\nElsewhere, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported Sunday that a column of Ukrainian armored personnel carriers, trucks and tanks had entered the town of Shakhtarsk, 10 miles (15 kilometers) west of the site of the Boeing 777 crash.\n\nShakhtarsk is a strategic town in the area. By controlling the town, the Ukrainian army would cut off vital rebel supply lines.\n\nLocal media reported fighting also taking place in the towns of Snizhne and Torez, the two nearest midsize towns to the crash site.\n\nThe government accused rebel forces of firing rockets Sunday on residential apartment blocks in Horlivka in what they said was an attempt to discredit the army and whip up antigovernment sentiment. The separatist self-declared \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d has accused the army of being responsible for that and other rocket attacks in nearby cities.\n\nThe Donetsk regional government \u2014 which is loyal to Kiev and based elsewhere since rebels took over the area \u2014 said Sunday in a statement that at least 13 people, including two children aged 1 and 5, were killed in fighting in Horlivka. It said another five people were killed as a result of clashes in a suburb north of Donetsk.\n\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch last week condemned what it said was the Ukrainian government forces\u2019 practice of using unguided rockets in populated urban areas. It said that use of the rockets was a violation of international humanitarian law that \u201cmay amount to war crimes.\u201d\n\nMalaysian Airlines Flight 17 was shot down with a surface-to-air missile over a part of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists on July 17, killing all 298 people on board. U.S. and Ukrainian officials say it was shot down by a missile from rebel territory, most likely by mistake.\n\nTen days after the disaster, a full-fledged investigation still has not begun at the crash site, with some bodies still unrecovered and the site forensically compromised. Concerns about the integrity of the site were raised further when a couple that had flown from their home in Perth, Australia, visited the site Saturday outside the village of Hrabove and even sat on part of the plane\u2019s wreckage.\n\nIt remained unclear when the forensic experts from the Netherlands and Australia would be able to begin their work at the site.\n\nAlexander Hug, the deputy head of a monitoring team from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said it was too dangerous for the unarmed officers to travel there from their current location in Donetsk.\n\n\u201cWe reassess the situation continuously, and we will start to redeploy tomorrow morning back to the site if the situation changes,\u201d Hug said.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had said earlier Sunday that unarmed Australian police would be part of the Dutch-led police force to secure the area and help recover victims\u2019 remains.\n\nAbbott said that by using unarmed police, Ukraine\u2019s parliament won\u2019t need to ratify the deployment as it would if the security force were to be armed.\n\n\u201cThis is a risky mission. There\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Abbott told reporters. \u201cBut all the professional advice that I have is that the safest way to conduct it is unarmed \u2014 as part of a police-led humanitarian mission,\u201d he said.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said in a statement that his country would send dozens of police and that his country had received assurances from pro-Russia separatists that they would provide protection for investigators.\n\nFlights from Ukraine to the Netherlands have taken 227 coffins containing victims of the plane disaster. Officials say the exact number of people held in the coffins still needs to be determined by forensic experts in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Malaysia Airlines disaster prompted some expectations in the West that Russia would scale back its involvement in the uprising in Ukraine\u2019s east, but the opposite seems to be the case.\n\nIn addition to producing evidence that rockets have been fired into Ukraine from Russia, the U.S. has said it has seen powerful rocket systems moving closer to the border.\n\nIn Warsaw, about 250 people marched through the city to protest what they called the \u201cterror\u201d imposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. Some of the demonstrators carried Ukrainian flags, and there were banners that proclaimed \u201cPutin is a Sponsor of Terror\u201d and \u201cEurope, Stop Just Talking. Start Taking Action!
