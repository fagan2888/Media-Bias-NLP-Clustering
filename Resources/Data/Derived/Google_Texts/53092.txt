Eugene Jackson spent six months in jail when he was 19 years old for strong armed robbery. His life changed in 1993 when he became an underground fighter in venues across the Bay Area. He eventually competed in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). After achieving success under his stage name, “The Wolf,” Jackson retired in 2007.

Now 47, Jackson spends his time mentoring youth who struggle just as he did. He is part of a group called the OGs (“Original Gangsters”), whose members work with the David Lewis Reentry Center, Live In Peace and Youth Community Services to educate troubled high schoolers.

The four groups together received $99,000 from the City of East Palo Alto in November. They plan on using the money to fund after-school boxing programs, golf programs and music programs, among other initiatives.
