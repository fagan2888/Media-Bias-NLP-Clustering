Mary is the Blessed Virgin Mary. Blessed because she believed that the word spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I wonder, what word has the Lord spoken to you?\u201d he asked. \u201cHave you been willing to take it in, let it fill your heart, let it fill your soul? Are you like our Blessed Mother, willing to say yes, willing to believe?\u201d\n\nGod, who speaks through Scripture, is working in and through each person. God\u2019s word can be consoling and challenging, the priest said.\n\n\u201cMary had to suffer,\u201d Father Hargaden said, \u201cand still she believed that this word given her, this Word that was made flesh, would be fulfilled.\u201d She was able \u201cto see not only the shadow of the cross but the light of the resurrection.\u201d\n\nMary also \u201cshows us the powerful dynamics of simple encouragement in the Visitation,\u201d he said. \u201cShe goes to support her cousin, Elizabeth. It is one of the most beautiful gifts women have with each other.\u201d\n\nFather Hargaden said that Elizabeth had a splendid awe and Mary shared the Holy Spirit with her. This is worthy of contemplation and imitation, the pastor said. \u201cMary shared in family and in love the very Holy Spirit that God had given her. When we go to visit with one another, we share the very Spirit of God.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo know the gifts, to recognize the many blessings, to always thank God,\u201d he said, \u201cis to have that Spirit, like the Blessed Virgin, of gratitude and of praise.\u201d\n\nFather Hargaden said that women\u2019s lives are \u201calways about the wonderful relationship with the Lord and through him with one another. That we, like Mary, hear his word and believe; that we, like Mary, support one another and share the Spirit the Lord grants us; that we, like Mary, be filled with thanksgiving and ever return praises to our Lord.\u201d\n\nThe theme was chosen to dovetail with a Marian year in the Atlanta Archdiocese.\n\nAll women of the archdiocese are members of the AACCW, which is comprised of parish women\u2019s councils that are organized by deanery and that serve the church in many local, national and international projects. During the convention, a new election was held and the gavel of president was passed from Dana Lee Willis to Deanna Holmer.\n\nWillis told the gathering that the role of leadership \u201chas been a blessing for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI needed to do this. This was the journey and so I took it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have been pushed to serve\u2014to serve God first, serve our family, and serve our community. I have tried to make it my mission to make sure that AACCW has shone through each one of us out there in the archdiocese and beyond,\u201d Willis said.\n\nReceiving the gavel, Holmer said she was \u201cblessed to be counted among you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour work and your prayers and your dedication to this organization are what make it work so well. With your love and support that I feel in this room, I know that we can do this together and I\u2019m looking forward to the journey,\u201d she said.\n\nOther posts filled were that of the president-elect, Julie Pardo, the secretary, Jacqueline Marshall, and the treasurer, Audrey Lee.\n\nDuring the convention, Kitty Cleveland, an inspirational speaker and gifted singer from the Archdiocese of New Orleans, gave her personal testimony, which centered around her father, Carl, a successful lawyer and Catholic deacon, who was wrongfully imprisoned and later released after his conviction was reversed by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.\n\nCleveland said when her father was first indicted for white collar crimes, she drew great consolation from reading the diary of St. Faustina, the Polish nun who fostered the devotion to Jesus as the Divine Mercy.\n\nThe saint\u2019s diary \u201chelped me to hear the voice of Jesus speaking to me personally,\u201d Cleveland said.\n\nShe called this time a several-year nightmare for her parents, herself and her sisters.\n\nWhen the jury returned its guilty verdicts, Cleveland said she started crying.\n\n\u201cAs I was crying in the courtroom, I received a special grace from Mary. With my face in my hands, all I could see was the Divine Mercy image of Jesus. So I kept praying over and over again, \u2018Jesus, I trust in You,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOne act of trust in such moments gives greater glory to God than hours passed in prayer,\u201d Cleveland said. \u201cOne act of trust when it makes no sense to trust. When you\u2019re terrified, incredible graces for you and glory to God that you would trust Him in those moments.\u201d\n\nShe said her father was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison in Florida. The family \u201cwould go monthly, sometimes weekly,\u201d from Louisiana to visit him. They would sing for the prison Mass. \u201cAttendance would triple and we suddenly found ourselves with a prison ministry,\u201d she said.\n\nAn appeal failed so Cleveland said that she and her mother had to learn to trust God daily.\n\n\u201cGod asks us to trust and to trust that we get the grace for the day. We have the grace for the moment,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy dad, ironically, found his greatest peace at this point,\u201d she said. He told her he let go of all his expectations of what his life was supposed to look like. \u201cHe lived alone with Jesus,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI learned a beautiful lesson from my dad in all of that,\u201d Cleveland said. \u201cI ended up writing a song for my dad called \u2018Surrender.\u2019 My dad realized that everything he had feared losing was an illusion and that God was all he needed to possess.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople started writing to him. He wrote a monthly newsletter from prison,\u201d she said. \u201cHe could really listen with his heart. His ministry as a deacon had never been more powerful than from prison.\u201d\n\nSix months after the appeal failed, the U.S. Supreme Court asked to hear her father\u2019s case. His lawyers petitioned the trial judge to let him come home while the case was reviewed. The judge signed his release at 3 p.m. on the Thursday between Easter Sunday and Divine Mercy Sunday. Three o\u2019clock is called the \u201chour of mercy\u201d in the writings of St. Faustina.\n\n\u201cThen in the fall of 2000 the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed my father\u2019s conviction,\u201d she said, \u201cand they said that the crimes he had been accused of were not even crimes. For six years he was gone.\u201d\n\nCleveland said that her father had three very happy years after his release and then was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer and lived for another three years. Four days after he came home for hospice care, the family received a call and was told that he had been reinstated as a deacon. Cleveland said that all her father could say upon hearing the news was \u201cWow. God is good.\u201d\n\nNine days later her father died and was buried in his vestments. His funeral \u201cwas truly a celebration of a life well-lived, especially because of the person he had become,\u201d she said.\n\nCleveland also sang as part of her luncheon talk, including several original songs she has written.\n\nThe AACCW was able to engage Cleveland as the keynote luncheon speaker at the convention with the help of a grant from the Catholic Foundation of North Georgia.\n\nFather William M. Williams, AACCW spiritual advisor, and pastor of St. Gerard Majella, Fort Oglethorpe, spoke on the spirituality of Mary with a reflection on Our Lady of Good Counsel, the patroness of the AACCW.\n\nHe said that the image of Our Lady of Good Counsel appeared in a village in Italy in the 1400s and was declared authentic by Pope Leo III in 1467.\n\n\u201cMary as Our Lady of Good Counsel consoles us and helps us to understand how we can reach out to others,\u201d Father Williams said, \u201cand console them from our own experiences, from our own journey with God.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cMary teaches us that with faith we are people of good counsel to others. Mary opened herself to be one who could be an imitator of trust, of love, of mercy.\u201d\n\nThe image of Our Lady of Good Counsel is Mary looking at her Son and he is looking back at her.\n\n\u201cHe, Jesus, draws us into this relationship,\u201d Father Williams said. \u201cWe are to look up to her. She looks back at him with the prayers that she has for us and her cares for us in this world.\u201d\n\nFather Williams said that Mary offers intercession for people constantly, praying that God\u2019s will be done, that people will have an understanding, a realization of God\u2019s love, care, and grace for them.\n\n\u201cTo be a good counselor you have to be a person of prayer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have a dialogue with God. You have to have an experience of being open to the ways that God works in our hearts and lives.\u201d\n\nFather Williams also spoke of Mary as a woman who totally trusted God.\n\n\u201cShe was totally vulnerable, totally opened, totally trusting that God\u2019s care for her will be done,\u201d he said. \u201cGod asks us to have that same kind of vulnerability, same kind of hopefulness and trust in our own lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cMary abandoned herself to his care in her walk with God,\u201d Father Williams said. \u201cShe was totally human accepting the divine into her life, into her heart. She becomes the model of what church is.\u201d\n\nOther speakers included Jack Murphy, who serves on the board of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and is the national chair of Voice of the Poor, the Society\u2019s advocacy and education effort.\n\nHe spoke on how the St. Vincent de Paul Society has been helping those in need for over 150 years worldwide. Volunteers go in pairs to visit people in need and to help them financially, give them food, and listen to them.\n\nMurphy said that in the year 2000, the National Society of St. Vincent de Paul decided they needed to do more to advocate for the poor, so Voice of the Poor was established.\n\n\u201cOur mission statement for Voice of the Poor is to research and document issues that are concerns for those in poverty and to make recommendations to our national board, which speaks on our behalf,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to act as an unified voice.\u201d\n\nHe spoke on SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan formerly known as food stamps, and on the need for Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Georgia is opposed to the Medicaid expansion, but Murphy said it could provide health care for some of the 600,000 Georgians who are uninsured.\n\nFrank Mulcahy, executive director of the Georgia Catholic Conference who represents the Catholic bishops of Georgia at the state legislature, spoke briefly on the ongoing lawsuit with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 mandate over contraceptive issues that go against the teaching of the Catholic Church. He also spoke on immigration and the U.S. bishops\u2019 support for comprehensive immigration reform. There are an estimated 11 million people who are \u201calready here in the United States without documentation, without sanction,\u201d he said. The bishops support a path to citizenship, he said. \u201cIt is not amnesty,\u201d he said, but a process with stipulations that would, in part, require applicants to present background information, pay back and current taxes, pay fees to apply to become a citizen and have a clean criminal record.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PEACHTREE CITY\u2014\u201cEncouraged by the Faith of Mary\u201d was the theme of the 57th annual convention of the Atlanta Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Women held at the Wyndham Peachtree Conference Center Sept. 6-8 with 151 in attendance.
