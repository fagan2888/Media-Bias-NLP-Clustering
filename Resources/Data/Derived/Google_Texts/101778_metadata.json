Now, the city plans to total up the police cost and bill the Sinegals for the overtime.\n\n\u201cOther police departments have absorbed the costs of these visits,\u201d Medina City Manager Michael Sauerwein said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nThe Medina Police Department is under contract to patrol the Hunts Point neighborhood, where Obama spoke. Five officers, a sergeant and the police chief were backing the Secret Service to protect Obama.\n\nThe cost isn\u2019t expected to exceed $25,000, the Business Journal reported.\n\n\u201cFrom our city council\u2019s standpoint, we shouldn\u2019t pass this on to our citizens,\u201d Sauerwein said. \u201cWe absolutely do not think the cost should be passed on to taxpayers.\u201d\n\nObama attended a fundraiser that same night at a private residence in Seattle, where the police department will absorb the cost, according to the Business Journal. The Washington state events were on the first leg of his three-day fundraising trip through Washington and California.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 2, "twitter": {"description": "Presidential visits aren't cheap, something that Washington state residents Jim and Jan Sinegal are going to find out.
