Dousing in these chemicals and artificial-scent sprays only shield body odor for a short duration, but they fail to treat the underlying cause of these nose-pinching smells. Luckily, there are natural, fresher, and cleaner approaches to tackle undesirable body odor to treat this embarrassing problem.\n\nIn order to practice good hygiene, it\u2019s important to know how body odor often occurs. Insufficient bathing or poor hygiene can lead to an unpleasant odor secreted by the apocrine glands, located in the underarms, genitals, and around the nipples, and the eccrine glands, found in the underarms, hands, and feet, when they interact with skin bacteria. The sebaceous glands, located in the scalp, face, and chest, produce oil, which has a light odor with or without bacteria. \u201cIf people have poor hygiene bacteria can build up on the skin and create more than just bad body odor,\u201d Dr. Jennifer Burns, physician at The Bienetre Center in Phoenix, Ariz., told Medical Daily in an email.\n\nTo prevent excessive sweating and body odor, add these four home remedies to your bathroom cabinet to keep your skin clean and dry.\n\n1. Shave Underarms\n\nA lot of hair under your arms can create a swampy environment for bacteria. Hair is porous, meaning it easily absorbs odors and can even slow the evaporation of sweat. Hair traps odorants, especially when it\u2019s located in your armpits. Burns recommends shaving your underarms to stop body odor so the \u201cbacteria doesn\u2019t get trapped in the hair thus decreasing odor.\u201d\n\n2. Change Shoes\n\nA common misconception is body odor comes from the armpits, but one of the foulest odors actually come from your feet. Changing your shoes will allow them to air and prevent the odors from staying concentrated in one area. This cuts down the bacteria that is in the shoe. Burns\u2019 rule of thumb: \u201cEveryone should be switching up their shoes every 500 miles anyway.\u201d\n\n3. Apply Vinegar\n\nVinegar, whether it\u2019s apple cider or white, can help lower the pH level of the skin for an anti-bacteria environment. Dr. Mehmet Oz of The Dr. Oz Show recommends this home remedy because the bacteria cannot thrive in acidity, and the smell will dissipate. It\u2019s best to splash the vinegar under the arms when you get out of the shower, but not immediately after you have shaved your underarms. This is safe for the skin as long as it\u2019s unbroken. It\u2019s best to do a test on a small patch of skin to make sure you do not react badly.\n\n4. Apply Witch Hazel\n\nWitch hazel and tea tree oil are natural sterilizers that can be applied on your armpits, since they are natural antiseptics. They lower the skin\u2019s pH, which makes it impossible for bacteria to survive. Directly applying witch hazel on your skin can serve as a regular deodorant. For those who are prone to sweating, Burns suggests \u201cwiping [underarms] down at least 4 times a day.\u201d\n\nThese four home remedies for body odor will help eliminate foul smells and leave you feeling healthy, clean, and fresh.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "body odor, home remedies, bad smell, foul smell, sweat, deodorant, antipersperiant, shaving, underarms, change shoes, apple cider vingear, white vinegar, witch hazel, tea tree oil", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Quench the stench and use these four natural ways \u2014 from changing your shoes to spritzing with vinegar \u2014 to practice good hygiene.", "title": "Quench The Stench: 4 Natural Ways To Treat Body Odor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/natural-body-odor-remedies-4-ways-eliminate-body-odor-good-hygiene-300446", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/woman-showing-armpit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Quench the stench and use these four natural ways \u2014 from changing your shoes to spritzing with vinegar \u2014 to practice good hygiene.", "title": "Quench The Stench: 4 Natural Ways To Treat Body Odor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/natural-body-odor-remedies-4-ways-eliminate-body-odor-good-hygiene-300446", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/woman-showing-armpit.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/woman-showing-armpit.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-29T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T10:22:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Quench the stench and use these four natural ways \u2014 from changing your shoes to spritzing with vinegar \u2014 to practice good hygiene."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfc2\"", "article_summary": "In order to practice good hygiene, it\u2019s important to know how body odor often occurs.\nWhether it\u2019s strong or offensive, body odor is a sensitive issue that is commonly addressed by health and fragrance companies to temporarily quench the stench.\nLuckily, there are natural, fresher, and cleaner approaches to tackle undesirable body odor to treat this embarrassing problem.\nDousing in these chemicals and artificial-scent sprays only shield body odor for a short duration, but they fail to treat the underlying cause of these nose-pinching smells.\nChange ShoesA common misconception is body odor comes from the armpits, but one of the foulest odors actually come from your feet."}
