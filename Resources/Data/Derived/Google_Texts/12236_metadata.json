But another 22 relatively big legislative goals \u2014 some set by one party, but plenty claimed by both sides \u2014 will have been left at various points along the wayside.\n\nThe narrative\u2019s been set for months: Record gridlock will be the \u201chistoric\u201d hallmark affixed to the first session of the 113th Congress. Yes, there are the easy caveats: There are always limits to making laws in a divided government. Some of the most important issues of our time are too complex to solve quickly. Writing legislation is not necessarily the best way to address a national problem. And not all bills are created equal; renaming a post office is, of course, not as credit-worthy as mandating peace in our time.\n\nStill, the 10-year extension of the ban on plastic firearms, which President Barack Obama signed a week ago, was only the 57th public law added to the books this year. And with the House gone for the year and the post-\u201cnuclear\u201d Senate in no mood to compromise on the little things during this final week, no more than a handful more measures will become statutes before 2014.\n\nThere\u2019s no way the total will reach 90 \u2014 the figure for 2011, which was the smallest annual legislative output since before World War II. As for the apples-to-apples comparisons to years when presidents were starting their second terms dealing with a divided Congress, the 2013 number will look even more meager. Bill Clinton signed 153 laws in 1997, Ronald Reagan wielded his pen 240 times in 1985, and Richard Nixon affixed his signature to 247 measures in 1973.\n\nAdd to this numbers crunched over the weekend by the New York Times, which calculated that the House\u2019s legislative weeks lasted an average of just 28 hours this year, while the Senate is on course to have the fewest days with roll calls a non-election year since 1991 \u2014 just more than 100, depending on how this week plays out.\n\nFor all the people who will be forced to spend the next two weeks defending their role in the dysfunction \u2014 to their constituents or their in-laws \u2014 here\u2019s a clip-and-save list of prompts for boasting about or deriding what did and did not get done in 2013.\n\nThe 8 Most Important Things the 113th Congress Did\n\nThe budget deal erased $45 billion in across-the-board cuts to domestic and military programs that were set to take effect in January, and another $19 billion due a year later, while leaving in place about $140 billion of the sequester for both this fiscal year and the next one. The additional discretionary spending would be more than offset by projected savings and non-tax revenue increases worth $85 billion in the next decade.\n\nThe \"nuclear option,\" pushed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democrats changed the Senate rules to eliminate the supermajority requirement for limiting debate on executive branch and most judicial nominations \u2014 from three-fifths of all senators to a simple majority of those present. It\u2019s the biggest limitation on the powers of the minority party and the most fundamental alteration to the way the Senate functions since 1975.\n\nConfirmation of four new judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit shifts the ideological balance on the nation\u2019s second-most influential federal bench. When the year began, four active judges on the court were nominees of Republican presidents and three had been picked by Democrats.\n\nThe student loan interest rate system was revamped, principally by linking the rates to the government\u2019s own cost of borrowing before the start of every school year, while also setting new caps. The compromise did away with a fixed interest rate that Congress had been under pressure to lower.\n\nThe reach of the Violence Against Women Act was expanded so that gay and lesbian victims may benefit from the law\u2019s legal assistance, transitional housing, law enforcement training and hotline programs, and the rules were eased for using tribal courts to prosecute non-Native Americans accused of sex crimes on reservations.\n\nJanet L. Yellen will likely be confirmed as the first woman to chair the Federal Reserve, the single-most-influential economic policymaking position in government. The Fed vice chairwoman for the past three years, she will be only the 15th person to wield the gavel in the central bank\u2019s 100 year history.\n\nThe Superstorm Sandy measure provided $50.5 billion to help local governments and individuals with recovery and reconstruction. After one of the most damaging storms ever hit the nation\u2019s largest metropolitan area, the emergency aid was delayed 13 weeks because of disputes over whether the package was too generous or should be matched with offsetting cuts elsewhere in the budget.\n\nThe defense authorization bill will likely be enacted for a 53rd consecutive year, a record of consistency unmatched by any other measure that\u2019s supposed to be updated annually. The bill\u2019s most notable feature is a package of provisions designed to stanch an epidemic of sexual assault in the armed forces.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every lawmaker and staffer who\u2019s about to head home for the holidays knows to expect to spend the break answering some version of the same dreaded and derisive question: What\u2019s it like, being a part of the least productive Congress in modern times?", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "Every lawmaker and staffer who\u2019s about to head home for the holidays knows to expect to spend the break answering some version of the same dreaded and derisive question: What\u2019s it like, being a part of the least productive Congress in modern times?", "title": "Lackluster Final Score for Congress This Year: 8 to 22", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/hawkings/final-score-for-the-year-8-to-22", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2013-12-16T22:22:53Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "Every lawmaker and staffer who\u2019s about to head home for the holidays knows to expect to spend the break answering some version of the same dreaded and derisive question: What\u2019s it like, being a part of the least productive Congress in modern times?", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,CQToday Topic,hill-dysfunction,icnw", "article": {"section": "hawkings", "published_time": "2013-12-16T22:22:53Z", "modified_time": "2013-12-16T22:22:53Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/hawkings/final-score-for-the-year-8-to-22", "site": "@rollcall", "description": "Every lawmaker and staffer who\u2019s about to head home for the holidays knows to expect to spend the break answering some version of the same dreaded and derisive question: What\u2019s it like, being a part", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "Lackluster Final Score for Congress This Year: 8 to 22"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dd9\"", "article_summary": "The narrative\u2019s been set for months: Record gridlock will be the \u201chistoric\u201d hallmark affixed to the first session of the 113th Congress.\nThe compromise did away with a fixed interest rate that Congress had been under pressure to lower.\nIt\u2019s the biggest limitation on the powers of the minority party and the most fundamental alteration to the way the Senate functions since 1975.\nYes, there are the easy caveats: There are always limits to making laws in a divided government.\nAs for the apples-to-apples comparisons to years when presidents were starting their second terms dealing with a divided Congress, the 2013 number will look even more meager."}
