Dick Durbin\u2014the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber\u2014told CBS \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\n\nOne year anniversary for AIG\n\nSaturday marked the first anniversary of the full resolution of the government's financial support of AIG with the completion of an offering of approximately 234.2 million shares of the insurer's common stock by the Treasury Department.\n\nAll told, Treasury said it made nearly $23 billion on its investment.\n\nBenmosche, a former MetLife CEO, came out of retirement in 2009\u2014tasked with bringing AIG back from the dead, after the $182 billion taxpayer buyout of the insurance giant that year before.\n\nAIG has since been designated as a systemically important financial institution, known by the acronym SIFI.\n\n\"SIFI is not a bad thing. Run your company the right way and chances are you'll be fine,\" Benmosche said. \"Like it or not, when you're big and you make promises and guarantees with people's lifetimes you have to have somebody overseeing that.\"\n\n\n\nHe said the money market industry should be considered systemically important. \"That's a run where you could see several trillion dollars coming out of the market and going right into a banking institution for safety,\" Benmosche said, \"and that I worry about more than people who invest in stocks and bonds who understand there's a risk.\"\n\nObamacare concerns\n\nAs for Obamacare, Benmosche thinks one of the cornerstones of the new health-care law is flawed. \"Having more access and thinking that healthy people are going to come into the system to pay for the unhealthy, I think is a failed strategy.\"\n\nAIG doesn't offer health insurance, but as an observer of the industry, he added, \"What's more important is to think about things like tort reform to begin to make sure doctors aren't afraid to practice.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This version corrected that Saturday was the first anniversary of the resolution of the government's financial support for AIG.\n\n\u2014By CNBC's Matthew J.
