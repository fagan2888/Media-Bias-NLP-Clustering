Stumpf, chairman, president, and CEO of Wells Fargo & Company, and Prologis chairman and CEO Hamid R. Moghadam both indicated that China\u2019s recent economic deceleration is not as big of a worry as it might seem to jittery Wall Street investors.\n\nMoghadam, whose company has been doing business in China for more than a decade, estimated that China\u2019s economy continues to grow at a rate of 4.5 percent. That is significantly lower than the Chinese government\u2019s official forecast of 7.0 percent and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s prediction of 6.8 percent. But he said that the Asian giant\u2019s recent slip after a quarter-century of astonishing growth was inevitable. \u201cNothing grows for 10 percent forever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be bigger than the universe.\u201d\n\nMoghadam noted that when measured in purchasing power, the Chinese economy\u2014which overtook that of the United States for the first time in 2014\u2014remains the biggest in the world. He said that when it comes to Prologis\u2019s specialty of developing, owning, and operating business logistics facilities, China still is a vastly underserved market with enormous room for growth.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at the very early stages of building out their logistics infrastructure, as they shift from export to domestic consumption,\u201d Moghadam said. \u201cWe can be busy for the next 30 years and not meet what\u2019s needed in that country.\u201d\n\nMoghadam did caution, however, that tensions in the South China Sea, where China has become embroiled with Vietnam, the Philippines, and other nations in a dispute over territorial claims to shipping routes and sites for energy exploration, could be a wild card that would cause further economic instability. \u201cBut the economy itself should be okay,\u201d he said.\n\nStumpf said that since Wells Fargo\u2019s business is primarily domestic, the bank has less exposure to the ups and downs of the Chinese economy. He said that Chinese investors are continuing to park their money in U.S. assets, though they have shifted to investing in real estate rather than purchasing government debt securities.\n\n\u201cFive percent growth in a big economy is still a lot of growth,\u201d Stumpf said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a few bumps and flat parts, as they shift from supply-side infrastructure building to demand side.\u201d\n\nStumpf said that the biggest drag on U.S. prosperity is not Chinese instability, but the relative strength of the dollar against other currencies, which makes the price of U.S. exports less competitive in foreign markets. China added to that trend when it devalued the yuan by 2 percent in a surprise move in August; but last week, the South China Post reported that the yuan recently has been trading at a slightly higher price.\n\n\u201cThe strong U.S. dollar takes a point off our growth,\u201d Stumpf explained. \u201cThink of our growth rate as 3.1 or 3.5 if we had a better international marketplace today.\u201d\n\nStumpf also painted a generally positive portrait of the U.S. real estate sector. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the reurbanization of American cities,\u201d he noted. \u201cYou go to almost any major city in America, and it looks like a crane convention. They\u2019re rebuilding the private sector infrastructure of downtown corridors.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he noted that manufacturing is growing in strength, with some companies that had relocated their operations overseas now returning to the United States. The auto industry in particular is showing strong sales, with projected sales of 17 million to 18 million vehicles this year, he said.\n\nStumpf was similarly positive about the real estate industry. He said that while homeownership has slipped from 70 percent prior to the 2007\u20132008 economic downturn to about 63 percent today, sales of both new and existing homes have been on the rise. A lack of inventory, which has forced prospective buyers to bid for homes in some hot areas, has stimulated more construction of apartment buildings to fill millennials\u2019 need for housing. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic on the residential side,\u201d he said.\n\nStumpf did identify one major weakness in the economy: Public sector infrastructure spending has not yet caught up to prerecession levels, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty bullish on [the economy],\u201d Stumpf said.\n\nMoghadam was slightly more guarded in his assessment. He said that industrial real estate remains \u201cmuted\u201d in the United States at around 2 percent demand and 1 percent growth. But the slight disparity still creates pricing power in the industry, he said.\n\nNevertheless, Moghadam said that the real estate sector is stronger than it was prior to the recession. Because financial institutions are subject to tighter regulations and loans are harder to come by, real estate developers are less leveraged than they were in the past. \u201cThis is not the old days, [when] people were running with 90 percent leverage and were at the beck and call of lenders,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we spend time making sure it is all even and smooth, and we\u2019re not overexposed at any point in time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Urban Land Magazine", "description": "In a question-and-answer session at ULI\u2019s 2015 Fall Meeting in San Francisco, John G.
