The $30 service also includes discounts for vision and dental care, lab testing, hearing aids, and diabetic and medical supplies.\n\nFounding partners Linda Cowart and Chris Cole started the venture in September after discovering how it works. Both said they decided the around-the-clock access to a doctor would have been helpful in their own experiences caring for family members. Cowart, who is CFO and executive vice president of finance at Trehel Corp., said she and Cole both had ill mothers.\n\n\u201cWe came across the product and said \u2018I wish we had these,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nCole, a former real estate manager, said he \u201cstumbled upon telehealth and decided this would solve so many problems.\u201d He said the business has had hundreds of calls since opening and typically is getting more than 40 emails daily. Cole said memberships include members\u2019 families. A growing number of businesses are using telehealth partly to help reduce absenteeism, Cole said.\n\nThe co-owners said members are linked to participating doctors licensed in the same state and there is no additional cost to the member for the online or telephone consultations. Medical records from the consultations can be forwarded to a member\u2019s primary care doctor, at the member\u2019s request. The service does not involve insurance or third-party payers.\n\n\u201cWe are not replacing the primary care physician,\u201d Cole said.\n\n\u201cPatients use online care typically to communicate with a doctor about conditions such as respiratory and sinus infections, flu, sore throats, allergies, rashes, insect bites, as well as wellness and nutrition advice,\u201d an eDocHome statement said.\n\nCowart and Cole declined to discuss their investments in the business that offers its services through a Texas company called New Benefits. Cowart and Cole said they do not know of any eDocHome competitors in the Greenville area and consider the East Coast to be wide open.\n\nDr. Louis Costa, president of the S.C. Board of Medical Examiners, said telehealth services are raising questions. He said in South Carolina they \u201chave got to have a physician where they can pass along the information required during their interaction\u201d to the primary care doctor. \u201cWhat the board is afraid of is fragmentation of care,\u201d he said.\n\nCowart and Cole said their doctors offer members that option.\n\nCosta also said there can be obvious business advantages to such telehealth ventures, when \u201cyou get 1,000 calls a week and didn\u2019t have to have a storefront.\u201d\n\nCosta said the state monitors all prescriptions, including any written by doctors in such telehealth services. He said state lawmakers are considering legislation that addresses the growing telehealth sector, and Congress may get involved.\n\n\u201cThe argument by the General Assembly has been y\u2019all need to improve access,\u201d Costa said.\n\nThe board in November approved a guidance statement for doctors that says \u201cprescribing drugs to individuals the licensee has never personally examined based solely on answers to a set of questions is unprofessional,\u201d but that has since been relaxed. Costa said after looking at the eDocHome website that its prescribing online and by telephone by licensed doctors is not considered unprofessional.\n\n\u201cA bona fide physician-patient relationship requires an in-person evaluation, and outcomes have proven when there is a physical contact there is a much more appropriate diagnosis,\u201d Costa said.\n\nThe board has issued cease-and-desist orders in two prior instances involving other businesses with doctors working in telemedicine scenarios that did not meet all requirements.\n\nDr. Bruce Snyder of Greenville, president of the S.C. Medical Association, said he also is concerned that patients are interacting with a physician they don\u2019t know.\n\nSnyder said people can go through \u201conline gamesmanship\u201d to get medications.\n\n\u201cThat worries me a great deal. I really don\u2019t understand why if someone has a primary care physician they could not contact them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEvery physician who treats a patient is obligated by the Board of Medical Examiners to have adequately assessed that patient,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cPeople who prescribe medication would be at risk of providing care without adequately having examined and interviewed the patient.\u201d\n\nCole predicts telehealth services like eDocHome are \u201cgoing to be common. You bank online. You get a college degree online. It\u2019s just a natural fit to have health care online for the masses.\u201d He said the Affordable Care Act is going to add up to 25 million \u201cnew people\u201d waiting to see a doctor in the future.\n\n\u201cIn Greenville we have a four-day wait time\u201d to see a doctor, Cole said. \u201cNow we\u2019re looking at Greenville having an eight-day wait just because of more people (receiving care).\u201d", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3abd\"", "article_summary": "I really don\u2019t understand why if someone has a primary care physician they could not contact them,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are not replacing the primary care physician,\u201d Cole said.\nDr. Louis Costa, president of the S.C.
