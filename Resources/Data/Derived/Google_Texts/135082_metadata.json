Anthem, Humana and UnitedHealth Group have all already launched telehealth programs Rhyee said it's important for payers to reimburse providers for telemedicine services, since the Affordable Care Act has increased demand through Medicaid expansion, but more doctors have not entered the field to meet that demand.Alabama's conservative Republican governor last month said his administration is thinking about expanding the state's Medicaid program under the federal healthcare law.Gov. Robert Bentley, a former dermatologist, emphasized that he was in the exploratory stages of considering expansion and that funding the state's share of costs could be a major stumbling block, but his comments were the strongest to date about the possibility of accepting expansion dollars in the deeply red, high-poverty state.Rhyee said that telemedicine services in states like Alabama could help provide residents with more timely and appropriate care, and not every health concern requires a physicians' office visit.In the future, Rhyee says the term \u201ctelehealth\u201d may be left behind, as providers and patients increasingly incorporate it into their everyday lives.\u201cTelemedicine will be a modality of healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now it looks different, because not every doctor has a virtual presence, but eventually, it's going to be ubiquitous.
