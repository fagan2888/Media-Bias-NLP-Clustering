It\u2019s exciting, and every day you learn something.\u201d\n\nIn between the two stints at the trade group, Baker served as one of the five commissioners on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as well as in top positions in the Commerce Department, a consulting firm and with NBC Universal.\n\nThe \u201cspectrum, spectrum, spectrum\u201d mantra \u201cactually comes from my godson, who somehow was at our house when I was preparing for my confirmation hearing and he\u2019s like, \u2018That\u2019s all you talk about: spectrum, spectrum, spectrum.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been privileged to be part of several different sides of that.\u201d\n\nShe also sees the advantage of the airwaves in her personal life, on one of her \u201cseveral\u201d phones and wearable devices.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m passionate about the industry, so I want to try as many different things as I can,\u201d she said. \u201cI might\u2019ve been the happiest person in Whole Foods the other day when I first used my Apple Pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think no matter what your business is, it\u2019s connected to the wireless industry at this point, and so it\u2019s important to our economy.\u201d\n\nThe wireless industry is hoping to pave the way to expansion at a pair of FCC-managed auctions that will give more companies control of the airwaves for the first time in five years.\n\nOne auction began selling off prized \u201cAWS-3\u201d airwaves currently held by the Defense Department and other agencies last week. Already, the auction has generated well more than $38 billion for the federal government, a wildly successful result that has been cheered by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nA second auction pegged for 2016 is expected to be even larger, but also more complicated. In that transaction, the FCC will buy airwave licenses from TV broadcast companies, repackage them, and then resell them to wireless companies such as AT&T and Verizon. The agency has said that it expects that auction to raise about $45 billion.\n\nMoney that the government takes in from the two auctions will go to fund a national emergency responder communications network and to pay down the federal deficit.\n\nFor the wireless companies and their millions of subscribers, the auctions should lead to faster-than-ever speeds surfing the Internet.\n\n\u201cThat will probably be our 5G platform,\u201d Baker said, which she expected would start rolling out around 2020.\n\n\u201cThe sooner we can get that spectrum in the hands of the commercial broadband providers, the better edge we\u2019re going to have in developing a 5G economy,\u201d she added.\n\nGoing forward, engineers will have to work harder than ever to get the most out of the nation\u2019s limited airwaves.\n\n\u201cThe next spectrum battles are going to be battles,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAs we look for spectrum, it\u2019s not going to be as easy. There aren\u2019t as many low-hanging fruits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be really technical about how we approach it.\u201d\n\nThe wireless industry\u2019s other major vexing problem is net neutrality, the concept that every Internet user should have equal access to the Web, no matter which sites or services they visit.\n\nThe FCC has been working on new rules for months, after a top appeals court tossed out the agency\u2019s first version of the regulations. Those previous rules, which Baker opposed as one of the two Republican FCC commissioners at the time, did not apply to wireless companies providing access to the Internet, only wired broadband.\n\nThis time around, however, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler hinted that the new rules would apply to wireless traffic as well.\n\nMost people don\u2019t notice a difference between the Internet on their phones and on their laptops, supporters of broader rules say, so neither should the FCC\u2019s regulations.\n\nPresident Obama is among those arguing for a broader approach, arguing the rules \u201chave to reflect the way people use the Internet today, which increasingly means on a mobile device.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe the FCC should make these rules fully applicable to mobile broadband as well, while recognizing the special challenges that come with managing wireless networks,\u201d Obama said.\n\nBaker and other wireless industry proponents are fighting the proposal.\n\n\u201cMobile is different in the fact that it\u2019s not at all the same,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThey may look the same to the consumer, but the technical complexity, I think everyone understands.\u201d\n\nFor one, cable wires can send massive amounts of data more easily than airwaves and, unlike with a fixed connection, people on wireless devices are constantly on the move. Companies argue they should be able to slow speeds of some users at peak hours, when their networks get congested.\n\nSupporters of the wireless industry note that there are four national companies \u2014 AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. Meanwhile, three-quarters of the country \u201chave no competitive choice\u201d for high-speed wired broadband service, as Wheeler has noted.\n\nWireless companies say they should be able to offer specialized service to gain a competitive edge. T-Mobile\u2019s Music Freedom offer, for instance, allows people to listen to unlimited amounts of streaming music from a variety of Web services such as Pandora and Rhapsody without it counting against their data limits.\n\nTough net neutrality rules could spell the end of that.\n\n\u201cWe want competitors to be able to differentiate themselves,\u201d Baker said.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not offering what you want, then you can walk across the mall and get something different.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"No matter what your business is, it\u2019s connected\" to wireless, Meredith Attwell Baker says.", "description": "\"No matter what your business is, it\u2019s connected\" to wireless, Meredith Attwell Baker says.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"No matter what your business is, it\u2019s connected\" to wireless, Meredith Attwell Baker says.", "title": "Wireless chief eyes \u20185G\u2019 breakthrough", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/interviews-profiles/225664-wireless-chief-eyes-5g-breakthrough", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/bakermerrideth_111114gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/interviews-profiles/225664-wireless-chief-eyes-5g-breakthrough", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-02T06:00-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-02T06:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/interviews-profiles/225664-wireless-chief-eyes-5g-breakthrough", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"No matter what your business is, it\u2019s connected\" to wireless, Meredith Attwell Baker says.", "card": "summary", "title": "Wireless chief eyes \u20185G\u2019 breakthrough"}, "dcterms.title": "Wireless chief eyes \u20185G\u2019 breakthrough"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4d5\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cspectrum, spectrum, spectrum\u201d mantra \u201cactually comes from my godson, who somehow was at our house when I was preparing for my confirmation hearing and he\u2019s like, \u2018That\u2019s all you talk about: spectrum, spectrum, spectrum.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been privileged to be part of several different sides of that.\u201dShe also sees the advantage of the airwaves in her personal life, on one of her \u201cseveral\u201d phones and wearable devices.\n\"Spectrum, spectrum, spectrum.\u201d That\u2019s how Meredith Attwell Baker describes her priorities at CTIA-The Wireless Association, where she took the helm six months ago.\nWireless companies say they should be able to offer specialized service to gain a competitive edge.\nFor the wireless companies and their millions of subscribers, the auctions should lead to faster-than-ever speeds surfing the Internet.\nSupporters of the wireless industry note that there are four national companies \u2014 AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint."}
