A former speechwriter for President Barack Obama scrubbed a series of late-night tweets taking aim at the glitch-ridden rollout of the Affordable Care Act from his account Wednesday.

Shortly after 1 a.m. ET, Jon Lovett sent out a burst of tweets from his verified account poking fun at healthcare.gov, asking at one point if the website was a “glitchy launch” or an “epic rickroll.”

The tweets, captured by conservative site Twitchy, were later deleted by the former Obama official.

On Wednesday, Lovett insisted he was sober while making the jokes and called the tweets “awful jokes.”
