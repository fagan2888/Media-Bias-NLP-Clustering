GREELEY â€” The Eaton nurse who has been accused of inappropriately touching patients in Fort Collins faces new similar charges in Greeley.

Greeley police arrested Thomas Mark Moore, 43, about 6 p.m. Friday on a no-bond warrant on suspicion of four counts of unlawful sexual contact and two counts of attempted sexual contact, both felonies. The arrest came after four additional victims came forward in the Greeley area with accusations he had inappropriately touched them in a manner similar to the allegations in Fort Collins, according to a police news release issued Saturday night.

Fort Collins police initially arrested Moore Dec. 21, and accused him of sexually touching female patients at various hospitals from December 2013 to April 2015, according to a Larimer County arrest affidavit.

Moore has been employed at North Colorado Medical Center, UCHealth Greeley Emergency Center, Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, and Regional West Medical Center in Scottsbluff, Neb., among other medical facilities. Initially, Fort Collins police believed Moore had unlawful sexual contact with two women in Greeley, one in Fort Collins and one in Nebraska.
