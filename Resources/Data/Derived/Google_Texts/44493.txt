Despite having taken big strides in the workplace over the past few decades, women continue to earn less than men. And the gap only increases with age.

Women's wages peak between ages 35 and 44, at a median of $781 a week, while men the same age made $964 a week, according to a recent report based on 2014 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Women in older age groups earned $1 less â€” a median of $780 a week for both women age 45 to 54 and 55 to 64. Among men, on the other hand, 55- to 64-year-olds posted the highest median weekly earnings with $1,021.

In other words, the spread between men's and women's wages is widest for those further along in their career. In that oldest group of 55- to 64-year-olds, women earn 76 cents for every $1 earned by men.

Comparing these figures to numbers from 10 years ago, the gap between men and women has worsened. In 2004, women born between 1970 and 1979 earned a median of $561 a week compared with men of the same age who made a median $639 a week. Ten years later, those women's wages rose by $220 a week. But over that decade, men's median wages jumped by $325 a week.

While women of that demographic were earning about 88 cents for every dollar men of the same age made in 2004, those women were making just 81 cents for every dollar men earned in 2014.
