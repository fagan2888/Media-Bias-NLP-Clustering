Economists expect a sharp drop in gasoline prices to help boost the economy in the coming months. The federal government forecasts the price of a gallon of gas will drop to $2.60 nationwide next year, compared with $3.37 this year, translating to greater spending rather than savings\u2014particularly for low-income Americans.\n\n\n\nReasons for concern remain, including sluggish wage growth and the plight of the long-term unemployed. The drop in oil prices is also rattling the stock market, with the Dow dropping more than 300 points on Friday.\n\nBut the most recent jobs report was promising, with 321,000 jobs added to payrolls around the country in November\u2014the biggest monthly increase in three years\u2014holding the unemployment rate at 5.8%. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the third quarter of 2014, and in the second quarter GDP grew 4.6%.\n\n\u201cEverything is pointing in the right direction for the consumer,\u201d chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics Paul Ashworth said, according to Bloomberg. \u201cWe expect a pretty good run for consumption growth in the fourth quarter. It is a big boost for the economy.\u201d\n\nAmericans are finally feeling the effects of the improving economy. According to the Reuters poll\u2019s director, Richard Curtin, more consumers had good news than bad news when asked about the economy than in any month since 1984. But the first quarter of 2014 still saw a deep contraction in the economy of 2.6%, partially due to an unusually cold winter in many parts of the country.\n\nThe improving sentiment is likely to further boost the economy and could translate into higher worker wages and more consumer purchasing.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Americans are more optimistic about the economy than they have been in nearly eight yars", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Economic optimism is at its highest level in almost eight years", "title": "Americans Get Sunnier About the Economy", "url": "http://time.com/3632516/economy-unemployment-confidence/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/economy-shopping.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/economy-shopping.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Americans Get Sunnier About the Economy", "description": "Economic optimism is at its highest level in almost eight years", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "economy, unemployment, recession, recovery", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "economy, unemployment, recession, recovery"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb95\"", "article_summary": "Americans\u2019 confidence in the economy is returning after years of doubt and pessimism, with economic output, jobs figures and retail sales in a strong upswing.\nThe improving sentiment is likely to further boost the economy and could translate into higher worker wages and more consumer purchasing.\nEconomists expect a sharp drop in gasoline prices to help boost the economy in the coming months.\nThe drop in oil prices is also rattling the stock market, with the Dow dropping more than 300 points on Friday.\nBut the most recent jobs report was promising, with 321,000 jobs added to payrolls around the country in November\u2014the biggest monthly increase in three years\u2014holding the unemployment rate at 5.8%."}
