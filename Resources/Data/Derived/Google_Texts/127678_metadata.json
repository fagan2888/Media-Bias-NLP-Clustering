You know the guy I\u2019m talking about. Incessantly checking in, sticking his nose into every and any decision, disapproving of anyone or thing that disagrees with him, and above everything else, claiming he knows what\u2019s best.\n\nWhile this persona of control and \u201cknowing best\u201d could be attributed to many individuals and organizations, one noted institution stands out: the federal government.\n\nOur friends at the Independent Institute have addressed this issue through a satirical video series titled Love Gov, highlighting the folly, cost and intrusiveness of certain government policies. According to David J. Theroux, the institute\u2019s founder and president:\n\nLove Gov is a way to help anyone, especially millennials, understand the federal government\u2019s ever-expanding reach into personal lives. It\u2019s a lighthearted approach to reach audiences on a personal level, and inspire them to learn more and take action.\n\nThe series focuses on a young woman, Alexis, and her relationship with her overbearing, borderline crazy boyfriend, Scott \u201cGov\u201d Govinsky. \u201cGov\u201d represents the federal government and continuously introduces havoc into Alexis\u2019 life through his intrusive behavior, which the series uses to allude to federal policies ranging from encouraging student debt to inadequate universal healthcare to privacy violations.\n\nThe hilarious (yet frightening) big government sentiments vocalized by \u201cGov\u201d could not have been more spot on.\n\n\u2018I love small businesses\u2026 but not as much as big business.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m massively in debt, massively. Except it\u2019s other people\u2019s debt. It\u2019s complicated.\u2019 \u2018Education is priceless!\u2019\n\nAlthough these quotes obviously are used as vehicles to poke fun at big government, all of them possess a staggering ring of truth that have not been given sufficient attention. In a day and age when the rhetoric and agenda of the political left has infiltrated educational institutions and youth opinions around the country, Love Gov brings a long-needed fresh of a breath air.\n\nHaving recently graduated from a left-leaning, private university in Washington D.C., this could not have hit any closer to home for me.\n\nIf you oppose the Affordable Care Act, you\u2019re viewed as an immoral individual who doesn\u2019t care about the health of those who are less fortunate. If you oppose excessive business regulations aimed to \u201cassist and protect employees,\u201d you\u2019re viewed as ignorant or \u201cprivileged.\u201d Unfortunately, opinions like these have transcended beyond liberal educational institutions and have started to become part of the overall millennial mindset.\n\nNearly all twentysomethings would love if it healthcare were allotted to all citizens and employees could be protected from potential abuse in the workplace. The fact of the matter is, the cost of doing so with healthcare isn\u2019t realistically attainable and a good amount of business regulations are unnecessary and kill the jobs they are designed to protect.\n\nWhat price are we willing to pay as we continue allowing the federal government to continue to meddle in education, the housing market, business, health care and various other areas of our lives?\n\nUsing various examples \u2013 ranging from how a twentysomething woman without children has no reason to pay for pediatric dental care to how universities have no incentive to cut costs due to the existence of government-backed student loans \u2013 Love Gov breaks through with humor and does what many have tried to do before, but failed. It points out to everyone, and specifically millennials, that the government has been too intrusive and costs Americans too much.\n\nLove Gov may only be a five-part video series, but through its ability to simultaneously provoke both laughter and reflection, it has a role to play in helping ignite America\u2019s youth to start a discussion about the role of big government and what we can do to fix it.\n\nYou can see the trailer for the series below:", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "commercial freedom,government spending", "og": {"image": "http://redesign.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/R-Street-Logo1.png", "title": "\u2018Gov\u2019 knows best | R Street"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Our friends at the Independent Institute have addressed this issue through a satirical video series titled Love Gov, highlighting the folly, cost and intrusiveness of certain government policies.\n\u2018I love small businesses\u2026 but not as much as big business.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m massively in debt, massively.\nThe series focuses on a young woman, Alexis, and her relationship with her overbearing, borderline crazy boyfriend, Scott \u201cGov\u201d Govinsky.\nIt points out to everyone, and specifically millennials, that the government has been too intrusive and costs Americans too much.\nIt\u2019s a lighthearted approach to reach audiences on a personal level, and inspire them to learn more and take action."}
