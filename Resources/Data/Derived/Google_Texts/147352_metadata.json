So I think that is a sign that Labour can win the general election.\u2019\n\nBut one former minister responded by saying: \u2018This is a terrible result for Labour.\n\n\u2018If the people around Ed think they are on course for an election victory on this basis, they need their heads examined.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve not met anyone on the doorstep who is saying anything warm about Ed Miliband at all. Whatever good ideas he may be having; people are not listening.\u2019\n\n\u00bfIf the people around Ed think they are on course for an election victory on this basis, they need their heads examined,' said one former minister\n\nThe European results show Labour did better in the capital; comfortably topping the poll and taking four seats.\n\nBut the former minister warned: \u2018London has a larger proportion of people who vote for us, like ethnic minorities and the young, Labour is not appealing to ordinary men and women in the rest of Britain.\u2019\n\nFrank Field, who served as a social security minister under Tony Blair, said the Labour leadership was \u2018in denial\u2019 about Ukip.\n\n\u2018We have to offer a referendum. Ordinary voters think Labour\u2019s position is untenable,\u2019 he said. \u2018They think we\u2019re shoving two fingers up their nose.\n\n\u2018We will have a catastrophe at the next election if we go on like this.\n\n\u2018Our voters are trying to give us one last chance and tell us they want change. Ed Miliband has got to free himself from this or he will drag us down with him.\u2019\n\nMany Labour MPs complain the public thinks Ed Miliband is weird \u2013 while others said the failure to offer the public a referendum on EU membership was making Labour\u2019s policies \u2018unattractive\u2019.\n\nGraham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, said the leadership was guilty of huge complacency in the face of the Ukip threat and called on Mr Miliband to change his tune on immigration and Europe.\n\nHe said: \u2018I think it\u2019s very elitist and arrogant. While these elections were about Europe and there were certainly some protest votes, there were also some people voting against the direction this country is going in Europe. Unless we have a policy response to that, which has to be\u2026a referendum, then we\u2019re going to lose votes.\u2019\n\nJohn Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, tweeted: \u2018Mmm, Labour official briefing calls results excellent. Pointy heads in the sand.\u2019\n\nMargaret Hodge, MP for Barking and Dagenham, previously warned about the dangers of ignoring the BNP and now believes the same may be happening with Ukip.\n\nThe former minister said: \u2018I think the lesson for Labour is that it can\u2019t set the agenda for people\u2019s lives from Westminster. We have to really listen\u2026and really respond.\u2019 Austin Mitchell, MP for Great Grimsby, said the leadership had not been listening to ordinary people.\n\n\u2018The Labour Party is crazy not to call for a referendum,\u2019 he said.\n\nHe told the Morning Star: \u2018We should have committed to an EU referendum before these elections.\u2019\n\nJohn Mills, Labour\u2019s largest private donor and chairman of Labour for a Referendum, said: \u2018People have clearly voted for parties offering a referendum on our membership of the EU. In some areas Ukip are taking Labour votes.\u2019\n\nA source close to Mr Miliband said the party was not going to try and \u2018out-Ukip Ukip\u2019 by offering a referendum.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Elitist,Ed,heading,disaster,Labour,MPs,says,party,leaders,head,sand,terrible,European,elections,result", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2640005/Elitist-Ed-heading-disaster-Labour-MPs-says-party-leaders-head-sand-terrible-European-elections-result.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Ed Miliband claimed his party had \u2018done well\u2019 and was \u2018making progress\u2019 \u2013 despite being the first opposition leader in 30 years not to take first place in the European poll.", "title": "Elitist Ed is heading for disaster: Labour MPs says party leaders have their head in the sand over 'terrible' European elections result", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2640005/Elitist-Ed-heading-disaster-Labour-MPs-says-party-leaders-head-sand-terrible-European-elections-result.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/26/article-2640005-1E2371EF00000578-848_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2640005/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2640005/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2640005, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Elitist,Ed,heading,disaster,Labour,MPs,says,party,leaders,head,sand,terrible,European,elections,result", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-05-26T22:52:36.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Daniel+Martin+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T07:49:26.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Elitist Ed heading disaster Labour MPs says party leaders head sand terrible European elections result"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Ed Miliband claimed his party had \u2018done well\u2019 and was \u2018making progress\u2019 \u2013 despite being the first opposition leader in 30 years not to take first place in the European poll.", "title": "Elitist Ed is heading for disaster: Labour MPs says party leaders have their head in the sand over 'terrible' European elections result", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2640005/Elitist-Ed-heading-disaster-Labour-MPs-says-party-leaders-head-sand-terrible-European-elections-result.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/26/article-2640005-1E2371EF00000578-848_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Ed Miliband claimed his party had \u2018done well\u2019 and was \u2018making progress\u2019 \u2013 despite being the first opposition leader in 30 years not to take first place in the European poll."}, "article_summary": "\u2018I\u2019ve not met anyone on the doorstep who is saying anything warm about Ed Miliband at all.\n\u2018The Labour Party is crazy not to call for a referendum,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018If the people around Ed think they are on course for an election victory on this basis, they need their heads examined.\nEd Miliband claimed his party had \u2018done well\u2019 and was \u2018making progress\u2019 \u2013 despite being the first opposition leader in 30 years not to take first place in the European poll.\nIn some areas Ukip are taking Labour votes.\u2019A source close to Mr Miliband said the party was not going to try and \u2018out-Ukip Ukip\u2019 by offering a referendum."}
