Elisabeth Hasselbeck, in particular, didn\u2019t seem to know what comedy even was, asking questions of the sort one would expect from an alien anthropologist who barely passed her required \u201cHuman Culture\u201d courses. \u201cDo you feel that you\u2019re being more and more restricted in your art, your profession, and what you do, and your freedom?\u201d she asked, as if she knew those words were related, but only theoretically.\n\nThat\u2019s because for conservatives like her and her co-hosts, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade, a \u201csense of humor\u201d isn\u2019t about what\u2019s actually funny, but about what awful thoughts they possess that comedy would provide them the \u201cfreedom\u201d to express aloud without facing public opprobrium.\n\nWhen Kilmeade points out that in Quinn\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Coloring Book: A Comedian Solves Race Relations in America,\u201d the comedian talks \u201cabout growing up with Italians, Jews, Koreans, and Chinese,\u201d he\u2019s positively radiating jealousy. Whereas Quinn\u2019s humor originates from an intimate knowledge of the social situations into which he was born and in which he was raised, Kilmeade is enraptured by the very thought of making jokes at the expense of Italians, Jews, Koreans, and Chinese.\n\nIt was a disgusting scene, and clearly one Quinn wanted no part of, but it does answer the question of why conservatives haven\u2019t found their own equivalent of Jon Stewart or John Oliver \u2014 or why the comedians who convert to conservative ideology, like Dennis Miller, aren\u2019t funny anymore \u2014 and it\u2019s that their version of comedy isn\u2019t intended to be funny, it\u2019s just meant to be mean.\n\nAt least among Fox News aficionados, because in the real world, it\u2019s quite different. The single funniest human being I\u2019ve ever met is a distant uncle-in-law who\u2019s also a pastor in rural Mississippi, so liberal he is not. But sit him at a kitchen table and let him observe the world around him and breathing will quickly become an issue. His comedy is situational and observational in the best sense, which points to the problem with Fox News-watching conservatives: the situation they believe themselves to be in is perpetually dire, always on the verge of cultural and moral collapse, so when they observe the world around them, all they see are enemies who need notches whipped into them.\n\nThey possess, in short, the mindset of an embattled bully being forced to live in a world in which the meek are rising against him en masse, and so they react as any cornered animal of meager intelligence would \u2014 they lash out. Case in point, Fox News\u2019 latest attempt at a comedy program, \u201cThe Greg Gutfeld Show,\u201d in which the former \u201cRed Eye\u201d host sits alone in an empty studio raging against the dying of the Right:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives are still only funny when they're trying to be serious", "title": "Greg Gutfeld\u2019s new \u201ccomedy\u201d show for Fox News shows once again why there are no great conservative comics", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservatives are still only funny when they're trying to be serious", "title": "Greg Gutfeld\u2019s new \u201ccomedy\u201d show for Fox News shows once again why there are no great conservative comics", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/10/greg_gutfelds_new_comedy_show_for_fox_news_shows_once_again_why_there_are_no_great_conservative_comics/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/greg-gutfeld-the-greg-gutfeld-show.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives are still only funny when they're trying to be serious", "title": "Greg Gutfeld\u2019s new \u201ccomedy\u201d show for Fox News shows once again why there are no great conservative comics", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/greg-gutfeld-the-greg-gutfeld-show.jpg", "creator": "@scottekaufman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Eric Kaufman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Brian Kilmeade, colin quinn, Comedy, elisabeth hasselbeck, Fox News, Greg Gutfeld, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04f6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Brian Kilmeade, colin quinn, Comedy, elisabeth hasselbeck, Fox News, Greg Gutfeld, Video, Entertainment News, News, Politics NewsWednesday\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d featured the show\u2019s hosts having a conversation with Colin Quinn about Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s recent complaint that political correctness has ruined comedy.\nAt least among Fox News aficionados, because in the real world, it\u2019s quite different.\nCase in point, Fox News\u2019 latest attempt at a comedy program, \u201cThe Greg Gutfeld Show,\u201d in which the former \u201cRed Eye\u201d host sits alone in an empty studio raging against the dying of the Right:\nBut sit him at a kitchen table and let him observe the world around him and breathing will quickly become an issue.\nThe single funniest human being I\u2019ve ever met is a distant uncle-in-law who\u2019s also a pastor in rural Mississippi, so liberal he is not."}
