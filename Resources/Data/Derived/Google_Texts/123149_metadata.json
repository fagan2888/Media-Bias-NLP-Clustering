But researchers couldn't pinpoint patient navigation as the primary reason for the drops.\n\nThe biggest exception is for poor patients who don't typically receive sufficient medical care. Underserved patients receive clear benefits when patient navigators help them with their cancer care, according to the National Cancer Institute's nine-site study of patient navigation, the Post reported.\n\nBut still patient navigator programs continue to grow as older Americans experience more chronic medical problems in an increasingly complex healthcare system. In fact, the American College of Surgeons now requires that cancer centers seeking accreditation have navigators, the Grand Forks Herald reported.\n\nAnd even if research hasn't so far proved their worth, supports of patient navigators still believe they help save money, ensure patients follow treatment regimens and help detect problems earlier. Some pilot programs have even found that patient navigators have helped reduce readmissions and the overuse of emergency rooms.\n\n\"I think it's a matter of how you want to define value,\" Lillie Shockney, who runs a team of four nurse navigators at the Johns Hopkins Breast Center in Maryland, told the Post. \"We can make sure we're giving this patient the best opportunity of survival with quality of life. What's the value of that? To the patient, it's huge.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read The Washington Post article\n\n- see the Grand Forks Herald article\n\n- here's the study announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCommunity partnerships, health navigators crucial to engage patients\n\n'Patient navigators' reduced readmissions, overuse of ER in pilot program\n\nPatient navigators pay for themselves\n\nNo one-size-fits-all strategy for readmission reduction", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although many providers incorporate\u00a0patient navigators\u00a0into \u00a0cancer programs to boost patient outcomes and coordinate care, it's unclear whether these individuals actually help patients or save money,\u00a0according to\u00a0The Washington Post.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Although many providers incorporate\u00a0patient navigators\u00a0into \u00a0cancer programs to boost patient outcomes and coordinate care, it's unclear whether these individuals actually help patients or save money,\u00a0according to\u00a0The Washington Post.", "title": "Do patient navigators really help?
