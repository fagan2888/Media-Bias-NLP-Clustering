He died of lung cancer at age 55 and is buried in Homewood Cemetery.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the major pianists in the history of jazz, and so by definition this is an important acquisition,\u201d said Bill Kirchner, author of the \u201cOxford Companion to Jazz,\u201d who noted that Mr. Garner was self-taught. \u201cWhat is amazing is he couldn\u2019t read a word of music. Everything he did was totally by ear.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Westinghouse High School, Garner left for New York City in 1944. Ten years later, he composed the music to \u201cMisty,\u201d his most well-known ballad, which was recorded by Johnny Mathis in 1954, becoming his signature song.\n\nThe donated materials include correspondence, performance and recording contracts, photographs, sheet music, awards and sound and video recordings. They also include such memorabilia as a cocktail napkin with a sketch of Garner made in a Paris jazz club and a telephone book. Under his contract with Sol Hurok, a fabled impresario and producer in the mid-20th century, Garner insisted on a telephone directory for the New York City borough of Manhattan that he could sit on while playing because of his short stature, Kirchner said.\n\nGarner was 5 feet 2 inches tall, and his small hands meant he could barely span an octave on the keyboard.\n\nAlso to mark Garner\u2019s birthday, Sony Legacy is expected to announce the release of a new Garner album called \u201cThe Complete Concert by the Sea,\u201d which is co-produced by Pitt\u2019s jazz studies director and pianist, Geri Allen. It will feature 11 unreleased tracks and interviews.\n\nAccording to a release from the University of Pittsburgh, Garner began playing piano at age 3 and played by ear all of his life. By age 7, he performed on KDKA radio with a group called the Kan-D-Kids, and by the time he was a teenager he played on Pittsburgh riverboats and with the Leroy Brown Orchestra.\n\nAfter moving to New York City, he played at the Three Deuces with Slam Stewart, guitarist Johnny Collings and drummer Harold West.\n\nA year after composing \u201cMisty,\u201d Garner released a live album in 1955, \u201cConcert by the Sea,\u201d which became one of the best-selling jazz releases.\n\nHe continued through two more decades of releasing albums, writing musical scores for film and stage productions and touring the country and world.\n\nIn the 1960s, he wrote the scores for films including \u201cA New Kind of Love,\u201d starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, and released several successful albums.\n\nIn the 1970s, Garner continued touring and wrote scores for films, ballets and Broadway musicals. His song \u201cMisty\u201d was featured in the 1971 film \u201cPlay Misty for Me,\u201d starring Clint Eastwood and Jessica Walter.\n\nSteven Smallovitz, spokesman for the Glaser estate, said in the Pitt news release that the university is the appropriate place for the Erroll Garner Archive because both Mr. Garner and Ms. Glaser were from Pittsburgh and because of the \u201clong and marvelous history of black music and jazz that originated in Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnliine:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1FiH8x7\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, http://www.post-gazette.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man who wrote the music to the song \"Misty\" is long gone, but his legacy will live in his hometown.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/15/jazz-musician-erroll-garners-materials-donated-to-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The man who wrote the music to the song \u201cMisty\u201d is long gone, but his legacy will live in his hometown.", "title": "Jazz musician Erroll Garner\u2019s materials donated to library"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The man who wrote the music to the song \"Misty\" is long gone, but his legacy will live in his hometown.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jazz musician Erroll Garner\u2019s materials donated to library"}, "Author": "MARY NIEDERBERGER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "A year after composing \u201cMisty,\u201d Garner released a live album in 1955, \u201cConcert by the Sea,\u201d which became one of the best-selling jazz releases.\nIn the 1970s, Garner continued touring and wrote scores for films, ballets and Broadway musicals.\nAccording to a release from the University of Pittsburgh, Garner began playing piano at age 3 and played by ear all of his life.\nThe donated materials include correspondence, performance and recording contracts, photographs, sheet music, awards and sound and video recordings.\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - The man who wrote the music to the song \u201cMisty\u201d is long gone, but his legacy will live in his hometown."}
