----------------------

Four people died Saturday morning when an air ambulance helicopter crashed in Coffee County. The chopper went down about 10 miles west of Enterprise.

Our sister station, WTVY, reports three of the fatalities are crew members and the fourth is a patient being airlifted to a hospital following a motor vehicle collision.

The helicopter is operated by Haynes, a prominent south Alabama ambulance company.

Rescue efforts are being hampered because the crash site is in a heavily wooded area near the Goodman community off Alabama Highway 134. Severe thunderstorms Saturday morning are also plaguing efforts to recover the remains.

This marks the second helicopter crash in southeast Alabama in less than a week. A Ft. Rucker aircraft went down near the Dothan Airport Monday, injuring three people.

Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration are expected to arrive on the scene later Saturday.
