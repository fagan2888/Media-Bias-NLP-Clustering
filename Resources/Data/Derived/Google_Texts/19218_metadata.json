Sandy Levin (Mich.), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, reiterated that Vietnam is one of the TPP countries that needs to overhaul its labor laws and maintain basic internationally recognized labor standards as well as adopt effective rules against currency manipulation.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Reforms under the TPP would boost Vietnam's
