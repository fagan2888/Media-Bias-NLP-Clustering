In two years, it had grown from four to 14 employees, and the firm\u2019s old location was simply too small to accommodate the ever-growing staff.\n\nNot quite a year later, Mabus Agency shows no sign of slowing down, and it now has 21 employees.\n\nAnd its latest addition is someone agency owner and founder Josh Mabus finds much in common.\n\nDaniel Hicks joined the company last week as vice president of special projects.\n\n\u201cThe beginning of October, Daniel and I started meeting,\u201d Mabus. \u201cWe both owned creative services agencies and decided it was time for Mabus Agency to acquire Hicks Design Co.
