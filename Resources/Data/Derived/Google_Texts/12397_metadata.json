When the team tested for the age of the Daphnia eggs, they discovered the eggs were centuries old, dating back 600 to 700 years.\n\n\"We were all shocked,\" said Weider. \"We have evidence that we can push that time frame back at least several more centuries.\"\n\nWeider hopes that within the next year they will have the exact age of the eggs. Water Fleas can be found in just about every lake across the nation. But the researchers chose Minnesota because those lakes were formed by glaciers up to 11,000 years ago.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "This discovery is more than 10 years in the making, but just recently it's been given life like never before in the world of science.", "author": "Justin Dougherty", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/24421055/700-year-old-eggs-hatch", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24421055_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This discovery is more than 10 years in the making, but just recently it's been given life like never before in the world of science.", "title": "700-Year-Old Eggs Hatch"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24421055_SA.jpg", "description": "This discovery is more than 10 years in the making, but just recently it's been given life like never before in the world of science.", "card": "summary", "title": "700-Year-Old Eggs Hatch"}, "wnreadableurl": "700-year-old-eggs-hatch", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/01/10", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,minnesota,discovery,eggs,700,old,ancient,justin dougherty", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,minnesota,discovery,eggs,700,old,ancient,justin dougherty"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd864d\"", "article_summary": "\"The idea of taking dormant eggs and germinate them or hatch them out,\" said OU professor Dr. Larry Weider.\nThe team pulled from three feet of sediment, looking for dormant eggs, eggs of these asexual, cyclopic crustaceans called Daphnia Pulicaria, commonly known as water fleas.\nWhen the team tested for the age of the Daphnia eggs, they discovered the eggs were centuries old, dating back 600 to 700 years.\nFor two summers, Weider, his students and other researchers from Oklahoma State traveled to Minnesota's South Center Lake.\nWeider hopes that within the next year they will have the exact age of the eggs."}
