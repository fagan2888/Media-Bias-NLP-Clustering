He was pronounced dead at New York Hospital Queens.\n\nThe deadly encounter, in Flushing, echoed the brutal hatchet attack on Thursday in Jamaica, Queens. That attack left two officers wounded, one severely, and the suspect, described by the police as a \u201cself-radicalized\u201d extremist bent on killing officers, dead.\n\nThere did not appear to be any political overtones to the confrontation early Sunday, which the police said stemmed from an effort to arrest the man, whose name was not immediately released.\n\nHe first entered the emergency room at the hospital complaining of difficulty breathing sometime late Saturday or early Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was discharged around 2:30 a.m., the police said, but returned roughly an hour later with a kitchen knife and demanded syringes. He left without any violence, the police said, and hospital workers called 911.\n\nAfter reviewing hospital video footage, four uniformed officers, including a sergeant, began searching for him in an area around Kissena Boulevard. Around 8:20 a.m., the officers believed they spotted the man near Ash Avenue.\n\nThe officers split up and intercepted him on a pedestrian path, the police said. There, the man, knife in hand, and two officers confronted one other; one fired. He was taken back to the hospital where he had been twice before.\n\nA kitchen knife was found in the man\u2019s right front pocket, the police said.\n\nThe police said the man had two arrests last year: He was accused of stealing three Xbox games from a store, and he was charged with weapons possession for having a switchblade and tear gas in a local laundromat.\n\nIn an unrelated episode hours earlier, a 22-year-old woman died at a police precinct station house in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, after what the police described as an apparent seizure. The woman, Jasmine Lawrence of the Bronx, had been arrested with two men around 8 p.m. Saturday on charges of selling marijuana on Bedford Avenue near Dean Street.\n\nNo force was used in her arrest, the police said, and she did not request medical attention. She was placed alone in a holding cell, to separate her from the male arrestees, the police said.\n\nJust before midnight, she appeared to have a seizure, the police said. An ambulance arrived in seven minutes. About an hour later, she was pronounced dead at Woodhull Medical Center. The cause of death had yet to be determined by the New York City medical examiner.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141026202330, "twitter": {"description": "The police said the confrontation followed a complaint that the man, who had been discharged from New York Hospital Queens, had returned there and menaced workers.", "creator": "jdavidgoodman", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/officer-kills-man-in-queens-brandishing-a-utility-knife.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003198403"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Officer Kills Man in Queens Brandishing a Utility Knife", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/officer-kills-man-in-queens-brandishing-a-utility-knife.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003198403", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/officer-kills-man-in-queens-brandishing-a-utility-knife.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "nyregion", "hdl_p": "Officer Kills Man in Queens Who Waved a Utility Knife", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 26, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/j_david_goodman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/nyregion/index.html", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "modified": "2014-10-27", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Queens (NYC)", "published": "2014-10-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "C4DC8C0C-E148-4201-BF10-82F1C903DBFB"}, "keywords": "Attacks on Police,Police Brutality  Misconduct and Shootings,Assaults,New York Hospital,Murders and Attempted Murders,Queens (NYC)", "description": "The police said the confrontation followed a complaint that the man, who had been discharged from New York Hospital Queens, had returned there and menaced workers.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "J.
