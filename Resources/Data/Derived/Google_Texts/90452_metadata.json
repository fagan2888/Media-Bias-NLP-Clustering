To qualify, you must be between 18 and 62 and log a minimum of eight hours of community service or job training each month. The whole idea is to help prop up people who are trying to get back into the job market or reward those who are helping their communities.\n\nRelated: HUD Execs Flagged for Ethics, Lobbying Violations\n\nBut a recent audit of the program quickly reveals that that\u2019s not exactly how the program is panning out.\n\nHUD\u2019s Inspector General found that tenants in living in at least 106,000 of the 550,000 subsidized houses didn\u2019t meet the service or job training requirements needed to qualify for the program. What\u2019s worse, while these people enjoyed housing subsidies they didn\u2019t qualify for, the program\u2019s waitlist is filling with people that actually do, according to the IG.\n\nThe problem, auditors say, is that HUD lacks a decent way to verify who actually qualifies for the program and who doesn\u2019t. They warned that if HUD doesn\u2019t address this soon, hundreds of millions of dollars in housing subsidies will go to the wrong people.\n\nRelated: HUD Funding Reveals Million Dollar Wasteland\n\n\u201cIf HUD does not strengthen its controls, it will pay at least $448 million over the next year in subsidies for public-housing units occupied by noncompliant tenants that otherwise could house compliant households,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe IG recommends that HUD should quickly develop an efficient strategy to ensure that only eligible people are getting the subsidies. It also suggested holding housing authorities accountable if they continue allowing ineligible people to receive subsidized housing.\n\nHUD concurred with the IG\u2019s recommendations and said they are already working on addressing the issue.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "More than $37 million in monthly housing subsidies for needy people ended up in the wr", "title": "HUD Gives $37 Million in Housing Subsidies to the Wrong People", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/19/HUD-Gives-37-Million-Housing-Subsidies-Wrong-People", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05042011_housing_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/19/HUD-Gives-37-Million-Housing-Subsidies-Wrong-People", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05042011_housing_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "More than $37 million in monthly housing subsidies for needy people ended up in the wr", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd088b\"", "article_summary": "They warned that if HUD doesn\u2019t address this soon, hundreds of millions of dollars in housing subsidies will go to the wrong people.\nThe housing subsidies are intended for low-income people who meet the \u201ccommunity service and self-sufficiency requirement\u201d or CSSR.\nMore than $37 million in monthly housing subsidies for needy people ended up in the wrong hands last year because the Department of Housing and Urban Development doesn\u2019t know how to verify who\u2019s eligible for its program.\nWhat\u2019s worse, while these people enjoyed housing subsidies they didn\u2019t qualify for, the program\u2019s waitlist is filling with people that actually do, according to the IG.\nThe IG recommends that HUD should quickly develop an efficient strategy to ensure that only eligible people are getting the subsidies."}
