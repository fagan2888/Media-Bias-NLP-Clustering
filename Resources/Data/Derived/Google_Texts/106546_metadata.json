But the board will not act on Segal\u2019s recommendations yet.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the board is considering all the options presented, and additional research is required before the board will take any action at its February meeting,\u201d Lamkins said.\n\nSegal Consulting\u2019s recommendation for implementing a self-insured program, Lamkins said, would not begin until 2018. But he said the board will consider all of the recommendations \u2014as there were many \u2014 using data collection as soon as 2016.\n\nThe state Assembly approved a bill Monday allowing the Joint Finance Committee to oversee any changes the board makes before they are implemented.\n\nState finance committee wants a say in Wisconsin health insurance programThe Joint Finance Committee unanimously approved a bill Thursday that would put the committee in charge of overseeing certain state health insurance \u2026\n\nBut Phil Dougherty, senior executive officer of Wisconsin Association of Health Plans, said the committee was worried about a self-insurance model because costs that would normally be handled through a third-party health insurance company would come down on the state.\n\nThe state would have to triple their reserves to pay for a self-insurance model, according to the report.\n\nDonna Friedsam, a distinguished researcher at University of Wisconsin\u2019s Public Health Institute, said many states operate under a self-insurance model. But she said Wisconsin\u2019s insurance environment is unique compared to other states.\n\nFriedsam said it would not be constructive to compare Wisconsin to other states\u2019 use of the self-insurance model. Wisconsin, she said, is the most pluralistic insurance market in the country in terms of the number of carriers it has.\n\n\u201cWe have more insurance carriers participating in the market and offering coverage than any other state in the country,\u201d Friedsam said.\n\nShe said having more carriers creates a different kind of insurance market and competitive environment than what other states experience.\n\nWisconsin also has large integrated provider networks, second only to Texas in number of provider-owned health plans, Friedsam said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a very different market in terms of the kinds of insurance products that are offered in our state,\u201d Friedsam said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Badger Herald", "description": "Group Insurance Board will debate changes to largest health insurance market in country.", "title": "Report says Wisconsin would save $42 million by switching insurance models", "url": "https://badgerherald.com/news/2015/11/17/report-says-wisconsin-would-save-42-million-by-switching-insurance-models/", "image": "http://badgerherald.com/media/2015/04/cihm-3.jpg", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "State of Wisconsin", "published_time": "2015-11-17T20:11:30-0600", "modified_time": "2015-11-17T20:11:30-0600"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Group Insurance Board will debate changes to largest health insurance market in country.", "creator": "@EmmaPalasz", "image": {"src": "http://badgerherald.com/media/2015/04/cihm-3.jpg"}, "title": "Report says Wisconsin would save $42 million by switching insurance models", "site": "@badgerherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2253\"", "article_summary": "Wisconsin would save $42.1 million if it transitioned to the self-insurance model for state workers\u2019 health care, according to a report released Tuesday.\nSegal Consulting has been working with the state\u2019s Group Insurance Board for more than a year, recommending different health insurance program changes for 2017 and beyond, Lamkins said.\nWisconsin, she said, is the most pluralistic insurance market in the country in terms of the number of carriers it has.\nShe said having more carriers creates a different kind of insurance market and competitive environment than what other states experience.\nThe state would have to triple their reserves to pay for a self-insurance model, according to the report."}
