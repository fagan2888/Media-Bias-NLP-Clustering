His was an estimable career that spanned 50 years and included Alexander Mackendrick\u2019s 1957 immortal adaptation of The Sweet Smell of Success, in which he played jazz guitarist Steve Dallas opposite gossip-mongers Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) and J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster). Of course, Milner\u2019s best known as Officer Pete Malloy on Adam-12.\n\nBut before he played a Los Angeles cop, he was hepcat drifter Tod Stiles, who, with pal Buz Murdock (George Maharis), zoomed cross-country in a convertible Corvette in search of The Meaning of Life and women \u2026 usually, in their case, the same thing. But as The New York Times noted in 2012, when the series was finally released in a boxed set, it was also something bigger than just another prime-time escape along the black-and-white road to nowhere. Wrote Neil Genzlinger, back in 1960, when Route 66 debuted, television \u201ccould still aspire to be literature. That made for some clunkiness. Writers hadn\u2019t fully grasped that television shows were not stage plays. But even at its most awkward, Route 66 reached high.\n\nBy way of proof he points to one of three Route 66 episodes shot entirely in Dallas: \u201cAren\u2019t You Surprised To See Me?,\u201d which aired in Season 2. (The whole series was shot on location, which provides us with close to three hours\u2019 worth of glimpses of pre-JFK Dallas \u2014 including Dallas Love Field, the recently opened Dallas Trade Mart and the old Wyatt\u2019s cafeteria in Preston Center \u2014 and copious references to The Dallas News and Dallas Times Herald.) You can watch the whole episode here; that\u2019s the intro above.\n\nAs The Times reminds, \u201cAren\u2019t You Surprised to See Me?\u201d is about \u201ca religious nut [who] takes Buz hostage in Dallas and threatens to kill him if the city\u2019s population fails to follow the Ten Commandments for the next 24 hours. The man (played by David Wayne) explains himself in a dizzying monologue that foreshadows both the anti-establishment mood of the Vietnam era and the current laments of the religious right.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrop the scales from your eyes,\u201d the man tells Buz while they\u2019re parked on Commerce and St. Paul, awaiting the morning edition of the Times Herald. \u201cConsider the present society of the world. Are we still individuals, or are we prisoners of bureaucracy? Insects in vast, grinding systems, carrying out ant-like, apparently rational actions with no human idea of the ends they serve? Ours is no longer a guilt culture in which control of wrongdoing is self-imposed by conscience. Instead we have a shame culture, one in which acts are judged good or evil solely on the basis of whether one is caught or not, in which the worst punishment is public humiliation, not private guilt. Ours is a world, Murdock, in which conscious morality is treated with derision and reason with scorn. This is an age which no longer waits patiently through this lifetime for the rewards in the next, but instead mills anxiously about overindulging, driven to cheat, driven to crime. So I have killed six men.\n\n\u201cWell, let me tell you that each time, I died with them. Each time I killed myself, too. So what is that insignificant sacrifice against the gigantic moral collapse of the world?\u201d\n\n(Beatle Bob also does a pretty nifty job tying two Dallas-shot episodes to the Kennedy assassination. Dig in. But, beware: It gets deep. There\u2019s another take here.)\n\nThe two other locally shot episodes are also available: \u201cLove is a Skinny Kid\u201d (shot mostly in Lewisville and Seagoville and featuring Tuesday Weld, Cloris Leachman and, in the scene below, Burt Reynolds \u2026\n\n\u2026 and the Mesquite-made \u201cA Long Piece of Mischief\u201d (with Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens and Denver Pyle). As my father reminds me once a week, or thereabouts, this was the episode filmed at my grandfather\u2019s old brickyard next to the Mesquite Rodeo. Which reminds me: If you ever find any discarded Builders bricks, lemme know?
