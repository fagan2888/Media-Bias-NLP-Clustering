For all the talk of the Affordable Care Act’s effect on the health insurance marketplace, employer-provided benefits remain the backbone of the American health insurance system, according to a new report by the Congressional Budget Office.

But the ACA will eventually start to siphon coverage away from employer-provided plans.

The CBO—which analyzes the fiscal impact of proposed legislation—found that almost two-thirds of Americans who have health insurance obtain it through an employer, either their own or that of a family member.

However, the number of people covered by employer-provided insurance is expected to fall from the current 155 million to 152 million in 2019 and stay at that level through 2026, the CBO reported to Congress in March.

“As a result of the ACA, some employers will decline to offer coverage,” the CBO report said. It said between 4 million and 9 million fewer people will have employment-based health insurance each year from 2017 through 2026 than would have had such coverage if the ACA had never been enacted.

To be sure, factors other than the ACA will contribute to the decline in employer-based coverage, including insurance premiums that are rising faster than wages. Put simply, it will be cheaper for some employers to raise pay than to continue paying for health benefits.

The decline of employer-based health insurance benefits will have an effect on the federal budget, the CBO reported—for the better.

Employer-provided health insurance represents one of Uncle Sam’s largest tax breaks. The federal tax system provides preferential treatment for health care coverage that people receive from their employers—a subsidy that costs the federal government billions in tax revenue every year.

The CBO projected the shift away from employer-provided health insurance will reduce the federal budget deficit by a total of $248 billion over the 2017–2026 period, primarily by boosting federal tax receipts.
