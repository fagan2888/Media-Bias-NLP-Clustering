Many of the people who have gotten a) angry and therefore b) stupid were never really conservatives to begin with. They are rather working-class folks who have been sold out by both the Democrats (who despise them) and the Republicans (who have ignored them) while their jobs vanished and their wages stagnated and their mortality rate rose and their concerns went unheard. Of course they're angry. They have every right to be.\n\nBut angry is angry and stupid is stupid and it's now clear that Trump's supporters, whoever they are, have been had.\n\nLet me show you how.\n\nHere are some typical responses to my attacks on Trump, copied from the comments section:\n\nAnger isn't making me stupid, it's making me take a stand against another establishment loser like Dole, McCain, Romney. I would rather suffer more time in the wilderness than have another establishment President. The thing that establishment chin strokers miss is that you can't win a fight without fighting... Trump fights, which is why his support is growing. Millions of Americans are sick of Republican wienies apologizing and running away with their tails between their legs. The Republican establishment and too many so-called conservative pundits dont seem to understand that.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Donald Trump Supporters Get Had", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Klavan On The Culture", "description": "The great crusader against the establishment is establishment through and through.", "title": "Trump Followers Have Been Had", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/andrewklavan/2016/01/22/trumpians-get-had/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/andrewklavan/user-content/26/files/2015/07/PAG-63.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "updated_time": 1464350012, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The great crusader against the establishment is establishment through and through.", "title": "Trump Followers Have Been Had", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/andrewklavan/2016/01/22/trumpians-get-had/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/andrewklavan/user-content/26/files/2015/07/PAG-63.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Donald Trump Supporters Get Had", "pinterestDescription": "Trump Followers Have Been Had", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, GOP Establishment, primaries, election", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Trumpians Get HadBack in July, I wrote a post called \"Anger is Making Us Stupid.\"\nThe Republican establishment and too many so-called conservative pundits dont seem to understand that.\nBut angry is angry and stupid is stupid and it's now clear that Trump's supporters, whoever they are, have been had.\nto make the point that justifiable anger on the right was causing conservatives to follow blindly after an untrustworthy left-winger, one Donald Trump.\nMany of the people who have gotten a) angry and therefore b) stupid were never really conservatives to begin with."}
