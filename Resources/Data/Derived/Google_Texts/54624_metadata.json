He may be living his last days as senator from Kentucky.\n\nRepublicans are buoyant they can capture the Senate this year \u2013 but will Mitch McConnell still be there as majority leader?\n\nA surprising survey out of Kentucky this week underscores that the Senate minority leader is truly running the race of his life \u2014 and could even be the underdog heading into 2014.\n\nThe Bluegrass Poll, conducted by SurveyUSA for several local TV stations and newspapers, showed McConnell trailing Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes by four points, 46 percent to 42 percent. It\u2019s the Secretary of state\u2019s biggest lead yet and outside the poll\u2019s margin of error.\n\nMaybe most troubling for the 29-year incumbent are his persistently low approval ratings \u2014 60 percent disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing in office \u2014 which make him as unpopular as Obama in the Bluegrass State. Fifty percent of Kentuckians also view McConnell unfavorably.\n\nPart of McConnell\u2019s problem lies in the fact that he\u2019s fending off attacks from both his left and right flanks. With a primary challenge from businessman Matt Bevin, he\u2019s sustained attacks from conservative groups that have further dinged him along with Democrat hits. \u2026TheHill", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.audience": "Global", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7", "og": {"site_name": "The Moderate Voice", "description": "They're coming at him from all sides.
