Set largely in an off-the-grid Qu\u00e9becois village called Three Pines \u2014 no wi-fi in sight \u2014 Penny\u2019s tales are intelligent, emotionally multi-layered \u201cbooks for grownups.\u201d Few thriller writers do a better job of divining the forces that motivate, and too often compel, the actions of 21st-century human beings.\n\nOh, and did I mention that your typical Penny novel is just plain damn fun? By page 5 of her latest, for example, Penny has arranged for socially inappropriate poet Ruth Zardo to snarl at another character, \u201cGet your own fucking duck.\u201d\n\nNow that I\u2019ve met Penny in person, I keep speculating how much of herself she may have breathed into her two main protagonists:\n\nDoes her outlook on life more closely resemble that of her upbeat homicide investigator, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec? Or does Louise Penny view the world through the harsh lens of Gamache\u2019s cynical and deeply troubled deputy, Inspector Jean-Guy Beauvoir?\n\nEven this late in the series, which began with the publication of the award-winning Still Life in 2005, you can feel the delight Penny takes in fleshing out Gamache\u2019s personality. In How the Light Gets In, we\u2019re reminded that:\n\nArmand Gamache had always held unfashionable beliefs. He believed that light would banish the shadows. That kindness was more powerful than cruelty, and that goodness existed, even in the most desperate places. He believed that evil had its limits.\n\n[Warning: Spoiler ahead!] As for Inspector Beauvoir, well, Penny left him in a dark place indeed at the end of Book 8, The Beautiful Mystery. When I confessed to Penny that \u201cI\u2019m worried about Jean-Guy,\u201d her intuition pounced: \u201cWhy \u2014 do you have a history of that [addiction] in your family?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d I stammered, \u201cI do.\u201d (It\u2019s tough to conceal much from the woman draped over you.) \u201cI quit drinking on August 6, 1986, after my wife, Mimi, \u2018crystallized the issues\u2019 for me: \u2018It\u2019s this family or that bottle.\u2019 Only later did I see the irony of getting sober on 8/6/86: \u2018Eighty-six\u2019 is bartender slang for \u2018Cut that dude off!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat got a laugh from Penny \u2014 and an admission of her own: \u201cI 86\u2019d myself in \u201994. I was working as a reporter for the CBC and using alcohol to handle the stress \u2014 jamais une bonne id\u00e9e! [Never a good idea.] I remember standing by the window in my bedroom and realizing that I was completely paralyzed \u2014 unable to move forward or backward. I was convinced I could not live another hour.\u201d\n\nPenny beat her alcoholism, she told me, got married and took up novel-writing. I was starting to understand why Jean-Guy\u2019s battle with prescription painkillers in the later books seems so visceral and real.\n\nIt was a jarringly personal encounter for such a notoriously synthetic book conference. So when How the Light Gets In was published late last month, I asked Penny if she felt the same way.\n\nI\u2019m thinking yes:\n\n\u201cThat sense of finding a kindred spirit\u2026a like being\u2026in a crowded room \u2014 what a relief it is. We suddenly \u2018know\u2019 each other in a profound and even loving way. Strangers suddenly become like brother and sister.\u201d\n\nNow do you understand why you won\u2019t find my signed ARC [Advance Readers\u2019 Copy] of Louise Penny\u2019s latest book for sale on eBay?", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "How should a red-blooded American editor react when the Canadian queen of the murder mystery throws herself in his lap?
