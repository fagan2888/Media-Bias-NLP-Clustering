Greece\u2019s latest confrontation with the European Union and the prospect of a similar crisis in Italy could hardly make the point any clearer.\n\nThe prevailing theme in 2015 looks different. World leaders find themselves amid a complex series of fragile international relationships. Some of these are troublesome, some potentially costly for Americans, others run to dangerous. A few were inevitably going to be difficult, some could have been better managed, and the only word for one or two is bungled.\n\nThere are more of these than a column can cover, but all will advance toward resolution this year. So let\u2019s call this \u201cthe Year of Tenuous Ties.\u201d Oxygen masks will drop when needed.\n\nRelated: Fallout from Obama\u2019s Russia Strategy is Spreading through Europe\n\nMaybe no one in the White House could do much better than President Obama on the foreign side, given that the U.S. is midway in a fundamental shift in its global role. But an emerging reality a year ago is now starkly plain: Obama\u2019s (1) inexperience in foreign affairs and (2) middling interest in them have landed America in pickles the match of any during the Cold War decades.\n\nThis administration has set various goals\u2014Mideast peace, a nuclear deal with Iran, now the opening to Cuba\u2014to stand as a legacy success. But none of these is half as consequential as Washington\u2019s relations with Moscow, and as 2015 gets under way these could hardly be worse.\n\nWhether Obama likes it or not, and he probably doesn\u2019t, the U.S.-Russia relationship will be his lasting mark. America is strong enough to corner the Russians, fine. Is this administration smart enough to recognize that doing so is a very bad idea?\n\nAstonishingly enough, it doesn\u2019t look like it. The near-term danger, imminent as we speak, is that the sanctions will drag most of Europe and then everyone else down with the ruble and Russia\u2019s GDP. More abstractly for the moment (and thank goodness for this), we are watching two nuclear powers in an escalating conflict.\n\nRelated: A New Leader could Lift Greece\u2014and Europe\u2014Out of Crisis\n\nThe wise course here: Acknowledge signs of flexibility from Moscow, and there are some, and follow the European lead, specifically German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s. She\u2019s a conservative who can talk effectively to President Putin. Let her do so. No one wants Ukraine to emerge now as a destabilized state with a basket-case economy, and at the moment it is evolving into both.\n\nWashington\u2019s relations with the Europeans are also a lot shakier now, in no small measure because of how Obama\u2019s State Department and Treasury have managed the Russian situation. In consequence, one of two key relationships will suffer a critical breach this year: America\u2019s with Europe or Europe\u2019s with Russia. This is Washington\u2019s gamble, and it could easily tip the wrong way.\n\nAs to a deal with Iran, normalization would indeed be a standout achievement for our 44th president. But it\u2019s going to take dexterous diplomacy abroad and tough politicking at home. This undertaking is at its most fragile now.\n\nSecretary of State Kerry has bought more time to negotiate with Tehran but will have to soften his demands. This reality, plain to anyone following the talks so far, runs 180 degrees against the White House\u2019s predicament since Republicans carried midterm elections in November. Politico instantly reported that the victors were planning to scotch the deal altogether.\n\nRelated: \u2018Another Wall Falls\u2019\u2014Europe Hails US-Cuba Breakthrough\n\nThe take-home here: Further compromises with Iran will be difficult on the way to impossible. Without further compromises, there\u2019ll be no deal. Kerry blew his best chance when he failed to stitch this one before the midterms.\n\nAcross the other ocean, I don\u2019t see danger in the deterioration of relations with China, but this regression is going to start exacting a price. Listening too much to the \u201cWho lost China?\u201d crowd in the Pentagon and the CIA and not enough to good sinologists, Obama\u2019s turning China\u2019s emergence as a regional power into a fight over the Pacific sphere of influence.\n\nNo, no, no, Mr. President. It\u2019s hands and Mandarin-speakers across the water, not Marines in Darwin and more navy frigates to Taiwan, as are now on the table.\n\nXinhua just published a year-in-prospect essay that\u2019s worth a read. The head tells the story: \u201cNot a \u2018Chinese Century,\u2019 but a less Westernized World.\u201d\n\nBeijing isn\u2019t interested in the \u201cChina-as-No. 1\u201d idea. It\u2019s vitally interested in \u201cthe collective rise of the developing camp, whose members are unleashing their pent-up eagerness and energy for socioeconomic development after having underachieved for too long thanks in no small part to a stunting\u2014and even forbidding\u2014international environment.\u201d\n\nRelated: China Offers Fresh Support for Outbound Investment\n\nPut it next to Obama\u2019s China policy and there\u2019s only one conclusion: This administration is doing tip-top work if the object is to settle on the back seat as the aspirations of emerging powers rise.\n\nExamples, two of dozens: China bought a record volume of Russian crude in November, reflecting Moscow\u2019s energetic effort to cultivate non-Western markets. In the same month, due to Russia\u2019s sanctions against food imports from the U.S. and E.U., Brazil's farm exports to Russia were up 101 percent year-to-year.\n\nThe tenuous ties aren\u2019t all America\u2019s doing, let\u2019s be sure to recognize. The E.U. is going to have to address the fractious rebellion breaking out among members tired of the savage\u2014no other word in the Greek and Spanish cases\u2014social and political costs of austerity policies deriving from ideology, not results.\n\nRelated: Anti-Arab Group Poses Legal, Political Dilemma for Israel\n\nAnd then a very big one. The Israel of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sinking into a quagmire, make no mistake. His move last week to withhold the Palestinian Authority\u2019s tax receipts, in response to the authority\u2019s application to join the International Criminal Court, is simply reckless.\n\nThe Americans have a tenuous tie to manage here, certainly, and so do Europeans as one by one they recognize Palestinian sovereignty. But it is Israelis who are heading for the hot seat. Good international relations are their life line, and their prime minister is punting them.\n\nRoger Cohen, the accomplished columnist who usually writes for The New York Times\u2019 international edition, had a sit-down the other day with Amos Oz, the noted novelist, and Oz said it best: \u201cThe day people in this country start calling Netanyahu a traitor I will know that something may change.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last January this column nominated 2014 as \u201cthe Year of Political Economy,\u201d and it pro", "title": "Why 2015 Will Make or Break a Spate of Global Alliances", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/01/05/Why-2015-Will-Make-or-Break-Spate-Global-Alliances", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12072012_World_Map_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/01/05/Why-2015-Will-Make-or-Break-Spate-Global-Alliances", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12072012_World_Map_article.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Last January this column nominated 2014 as \u201cthe Year of Political Economy,\u201d and it pro", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Good international relations are their life line, and their prime minister is punting them.\nBut none of these is half as consequential as Washington\u2019s relations with Moscow, and as 2015 gets under way these could hardly be worse.\nWashington\u2019s relations with the Europeans are also a lot shakier now, in no small measure because of how Obama\u2019s State Department and Treasury have managed the Russian situation.\nLast January this column nominated 2014 as \u201cthe Year of Political Economy,\u201d and it proved to be so in spades.\nThere are more of these than a column can cover, but all will advance toward resolution this year."}
