Five more people were unaccounted for, as it was not clear whether they had actually boarded.\n\nEnvironment Minister Segolene Royal said at the scene that the 49 people believed to be on board the trial run had included not only staff from the SNCF railway but also their family members and other guests.\n\nThe accident was caused by excessive speed, although it was too early to say why the train was going that fast, the prefecture said.\n\nRoyal also said that sabotage had been all but ruled out. But the accident jarred nerves coming less than a day after gunmen and suicide bombers killed 129 people in waves of attacks in Paris.\n\nPictures from a Reuters photographer at the scene of the train accident showed the locomotive partly submerged in a canal alongside the tracks with other parts lying broken and detached in a field beside the track. Medical units including police divers were on the scene.\n\nThe second section of the Paris-Strasbourg high-speed TGV line on which the crash happened is set to open for service in April 2016.\n\n(Reporting by Gilbert Reilhac and Vincent Kessler; writing by Michel Rose; Editing by Andrew Callus and Digby Lidstone)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Another 32 people were injured, 12 seriously.", "title": "At least 10 killed as train derails during testing in eastern France", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/14/least-seven-killed-train-derails-during-testing-eastern-France", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/france-crash_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/14/least-seven-killed-train-derails-during-testing-eastern-France", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/france-crash_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Another 32 people were injured, 12 seriously.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe100a\"", "article_summary": "(Reporting by Gilbert Reilhac and Vincent Kessler; writing by Michel Rose; Editing by Andrew Callus and Digby Lidstone)\nThe accident was caused by excessive speed, although it was too early to say why the train was going that fast, the prefecture said.\nBut the accident jarred nerves coming less than a day after gunmen and suicide bombers killed 129 people in waves of attacks in Paris.\nFive more people were unaccounted for, as it was not clear whether they had actually boarded.\nPictures from a Reuters photographer at the scene of the train accident showed the locomotive partly submerged in a canal alongside the tracks with other parts lying broken and detached in a field beside the track."}
