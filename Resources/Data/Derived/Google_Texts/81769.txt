Season four of "Love and Hip Hop New York" has come to an end, and more than likely the 4.2 million viewers that tuned in for the season finale are pretty sad about it, but luckily fans still have the "Love and Hip Hop Reunion" to look forward to.



Like most reunion specials, the upcoming reunion show, hosted by Mo'Nique, is sure to be jam-packed with tears, flying fists, heavy insults and a whole lot of drama.



The reunion show will definitely answer a lot of questions viewers have been asking about the cast members and their bumpy love lives, especially in regards to the love triangle involving Erica Mena, Rich Dollas and Cyn Santana.



In a Vh1 released clip, the three end up getting pretty rowdy on the set when Mo'Nique asks Rich if he ever respected Erica and Cyn's relationship.



"I don't know her. We've never met, right, so I don't have any loyalty to a relationship. Now if the relationship is what it is then it's gonna stand on its own two feet," Rich responds. "So with that being said... I'm a self professed creep. I'm cool with that, I'll own it. You know what I mean, I'm a man so I'm gonna dibble and dabble, I'm gonna test the waters and I'm gonna see what happens. So when I put it out there and you're receptive to when I put it out there then, no I can't just really think that your relationship is real because if your relationship was real you would of shut it down."



Initially Erica and Cyn appear pretty unfazed by Rich's comment, but as he continues to talk about their relationship things take a turn for the worse.



"And I've said this before and this is gonna sound like I'm being a prick right now but I'm not. Cyn is a prop. Erica wants attention that wasn't given," Rich continues. "And this poor girl is caught up in this love thing that we got going on but really, unbeknown to her, she's just here."



"But she's not just here," Erica intervenes. "I went after her, me and you were over and I moved on."



"I know they have feeling for each other. I don't know whether they're f**king... I would like to know cause I'm not gonna sit here and be a fool," Cyn says.



"What makes this difficult Mo is very very simple," Rich says. "You got to take responsibility."



"And I have! I said it 30 times I f**ked up! I've said that plenty of times," Erica shouts. "When are you gonna say that? When are you gonna step up and say 'you f**ked up?' Because you f**ked up on me plenty f**king times and I still ride with you! Tattoo and all! So don't f**king sit up her and act like I don't f**king do for you! I do for you a million other ways, so much so its affecting my new relationship! So don't f**king go there."



As Erica sits on the stage next to her lover, absolutely enraged by Rich's comments, it becomes pretty clear that the pair still have strong feelings for one another. The question is how messy will things get when Mo'Nique continues to dig into why Erica hasn't ditched Cyn and tried to resolve her issues with the man she seems to be completely in love with?



Will Erica leave the reunion show happily in love or utterly heartbroken?
