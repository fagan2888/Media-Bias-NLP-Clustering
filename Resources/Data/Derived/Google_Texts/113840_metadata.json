There\u2019s a house in the middle of the street; there\u2019s a watermark on the wall.\u201d\n\nMany flood insurance policy holders are still trying to settle their claims as the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 29 storm approaches.\n\nPolicy holders have one year from the date of their first claim denial to file a lawsuit, which could be as early as November, or as late as November 2014, said Adam Derman, whose West Orange-based firm is taking on a number of these claims.\n\nDan Watson, a spokesman with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the NFIP received more than 74,000 claims from New Jersey policy holders, representing $3.78 billion in payouts.\n\nHe said 1,475 appeals were filed between October 2012 and July, though the program does not break them out by disaster. But Watson said \u201ca large portion\u201d of those appeals would be related to Sandy.\n\nRobert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, a nonprofit communications company supported by the insurance industry, said claim problems exist primarily because New Jersey has never experienced a storm quite like Sandy.\n\n\u201cSandy was an event that has some issues associated with it that you don\u2019t see in other events,\u201d he said. Only about half of the homeowners affected by Sandy had flood insurance. And storm surges, like those seen in Sandy, aren\u2019t covered by typical homeowner policies, he said.\n\nThose who disagree with their flood insurance settlements can file a supplementary claim with their insurance company. If they still are not satisfied, they can appeal to the NFIP. Then, they can sue.\n\nThe NFIP doesn\u2019t actually write flood policies. Instead, commercial insurance companies write the policies and arrange for NFIP-certified adjusters to survey damage. The NFIP denies or pays claims, said Gail Peterson, a spokeswoman for Selective Insurance Co., Bennett\u2019s insurance company.\n\nThe reason for Bennett\u2019s denial \u2014 natural settling \u2014 is one of the most common used by insurance companies to turn down claims, said Derman. These types of legal fights are so new in New Jersey that Derman\u2019s firm is working with attorneys from the Gulf Coast who are well-versed in flood insurance issues after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\n\u201cIn New Jersey and New York, we really haven\u2019t had these types of cases, these types of claims, up here,\u201d Derman said.\n\nFlood policies, he said, are very specific about what is and is not covered, and when there\u2019s no clear evidence that damage was caused by a flood, there\u2019s a good chance a claim will be denied.\n\nA house that sat in floodwater won\u2019t necessarily qualify for payment to rebuild the foundation; there has to be evidence that there was flowing water that washed away the soil, said Christopher Gerold, an attorney in Derman\u2019s firm.\n\nWithout insurance money, Bennett said he can\u2019t make the needed structural repairs to his expanded Cape Cod on Joan Road. It\u2019s a second home, so he doesn\u2019t qualify for any federal aid.\n\nAngelita \u201cGigi\u201d Liaguno-Dorr, owner of the Sandy-destroyed Jakeabob\u2019s Bay in Union Beach, said she is still negotiating with her flood insurance company.\n\nShe\u2019s running her restaurant from a donated building a couple of blocks from her former location on Raritan Bay.\n\nLiaguno-Dorr said it will take $2 million to rebuild and she had $1.8 million in insurance coverage with Lloyd\u2019s of London. She said she\u2019s received only $450,000.\n\nRepresentatives for Lloyd\u2019s and Selective insurance companies said they do not comment on specific cases. But a Lloyd\u2019s spokesman said the company \u201cseeks to pay all valid claims as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to build. We just want to come back,\u201d Dorr said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s taking so long for the insurance company. I think they\u2019re waiting for us to give up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@hurricane-sandy','@river','ocean-county','union-beach'", "title": "Fight continues to settle home, business insurance claims after Sandy", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Fight continues to settle home, business insurance claims after Sandy\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/after_sandy_fight_continues_to_settle_home_business_insurance_claims.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/09/13407470-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11240645\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-15T13:35:35Z\", \"author\": \"MaryAnn Spoto | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@hurricane-sandy\",\"@river\",\"ocean-county\",\"union-beach\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/09/13407470-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@MaryAnnSpoto", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "None of the doors in Carl Bennett&#8217;s home in Holgate stays shut.
