Wilson County's first Neighborhood Health clinic has opened in Lebanon to target uninsured and underserved residents with preventative and primary care.

Neighborhood Health, a private nonprofit network of neighborhood health centers, is on East High Street.

"A clinic serving those who are low income can have a significant impact on the health of the county," Neighborhood Health CEO Mary Bufwack said in a news release.

Lebanon was chosen because of its rate of low-income and uninsured residents, Bufwack said. More than 6,000 are uninsured in the city, according to Neighborhood Health research.

There are 12 clinics in the Neighborhood Health network, the others in Davidson and Trousdale counties.

About 2,500 people are projected to be served annually at the Wilson County clinic.

Services will be provided with payments discounted based on family size and income. TennCare and other insurance are accepted. Services will not be denied because of inability to pay. â€‹A licensed behavioral health provider to provide counseling also will be at the Lebanon clinic.

The clinic opened through a $495,000 Affordable Care Act grant. The grant is part of a national initiative funding 164 new community health centers totaling $101 million.
