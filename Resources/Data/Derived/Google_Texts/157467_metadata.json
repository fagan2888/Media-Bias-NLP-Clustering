Mark Dayton says he\u2019s pleased with the progress of Minnesota\u2019s health care exchange so far.\n\nThe comments come after the federal rollout of Obamacare, which has been plagued with problems.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s health exchange went online Oct. 1 and has not had the widespread problems other states have experienced.\n\nBuy why is Minnesota apparently doing better than other states?\n\nThe biggest differences are in the state-run exchanges. For states that created their own exchanges, things appear to be operating more smoothly.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Minnesota is problem-free.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s health exchange may be up and running, but MNsure hasn\u2019t yet revealed how many people have actually signed up. And Dayton says it\u2019s going to take a year to fully measure how it\u2019s doing.\n\n\u201cGiven the complexity and the scope of the project, I think it has performed phenomenally well,\u201d the governor said Tuesday.\n\nOn the federal site, millions of people have not been able to access information, let alone sign up for insurance. In Minnesota, MNsure says it has had 36,546 unique visits, 18,560 accounts created and 3,769 waiting to enroll.\n\nRep. Greg Davids (R, District 28B) calls the lack of actual enrollees \u201can unmitigated disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe spent $152 million for something Minnesota insurance agents have done for free for years,\u201d he said.\n\nDayton, a Democrat, calls the Minnesota rollout \u201chuge and vastly complicated,\u201d adding that states like Minnesota and Kentucky are outperforming the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe are on the cutting edge,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe are ahead of virtually any other state and also the federal government. So we are pioneering this whole undertaking.\u201d\n\nThe new federal law goes into effect Jan. 1. Minnesota is encouraging people to log on to MNsure.org and sign up for insurance.\n\nThe state expects more than one million Minnesotans to participate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minnesota Gov.
