It is Logan\u2019s third trip to the DL this season.\n\nMorneau, fresh off his appearance in the Home Run Derby last week in Minneapolis, went on the 15-day disabled list because of a neck strain. The move is retro- active to July 14, meaning he is eligible to return next Tuesday at Wrigley Field in Chicago.\n\nLogan was placed on the 15-day DL just before Monday\u2019s game with a case of diverticulitis, an often-painful condition of the digestive tract.\n\nTo fill Morneau\u2019s slot on the roster, Ben Paulsen was called up from Triple-A Colorado Springs. Paulsen made his big-league debut Monday night against the Washington Nationals at Coors Field. He was the starter at first base and batted sixth in the lineup.\n\nFilling Logan\u2019s spot in the bullpen was right-hander Nick Masset, activated after a stint on the DL. He had a strained left knee.\n\nMorneau strained his neck Friday morning in Pittsburgh during an early round of batting practice. In 2011, while playing for the Minnesota Twins, Morneau had neck surgery to remove a herniated disc fragment. His history means the Rockies are proceeding with caution. Manager Walt Weiss said the current injury is not directly related to the neck surgery.\n\n\u201cNot exactly; it\u2019s not the same spot,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe are always cautious with \u2018Morney\u2019 when it comes to his neck, but it\u2019s not exactly the same thing. \u2026 He\u2019s had issues from time to time.\u201d\n\nMorneau, who signed a two-year contract worth $12.5 million to play for the Rockies, is hitting .312 this year with 20 doubles, two triples, 13 home runs and a club-high 60 RBIs.\n\nLogan\u2019s first two stints on the DL were due to a strained elbow. But his new ailment came out of nowhere. According to the Mayo Clinic\u2019s website, diverticulosis occurs when one or more diverticula (small, bulging pouches that can form anywhere in the digestive system) become inflamed or infected. The condition can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea and a marked change in bowel habits. Mild cases of diverticulitis can be treated with rest, changes in diet and antibiotics. But serious cases of diverticulitis can require surgery.\n\nThe Rockies didn\u2019t say how long they expect Logan to be out.\n\nThe former Yankee signed a three-year, $16.6 million deal with the Rockies during the offseason. He has appeared in 25 games this year, going 2-1 with a 6.11 ERA.\n\nCuddy update. The Rockies are awaiting news on outfielder and first baseman Michael Cuddyer, who is out until at least mid-August because of a fractured left shoulder socket. An MRI, scheduled for Monday, was expected to reveal if the bones in his shoulder have healed. If so, Cuddyer can begin strength exercises and there is a chance he could return late this season.\n\nFootnotes. All-star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki (left thigh) didn\u2019t start his second consecutive game. He said he was feeling better Monday, but still sore. Tulo said there\u2019s a chance he could play Tuesday, adding that he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll have to go on the DL. \u2026. To clear space on the 40-man roster for Paulsen, right-handed starting pitcher Jair Jurrjens was designated for assignment.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nNationals\u2019 Jordan Zimmermann (6-5, 3.03 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (0-2, 7.36), 6:40 p.m. Tuesday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nWell, at least Flande is part of baseball trivia. When the left-hander made his major-league debut June 25 against St. Louis, he became the fourth Rockies starter to make it to \u201cThe Show\u201d this season. It\u2019s the first time that happened in Rockies history, and the first time it happened in the majors since 2009, when Baltimore (six) and Toronto (five) both debuted four or more pitchers. Flande, by the way, has an 8.68 ERA in his two starts at Coors Field. Zimmermann (strained biceps) dodged a stint on the disabled list and has been cleared to pitch Tuesday night at Coors Field.\n\nWednesday: Nationals\u2019 Stephen Strasburg (7-7, 3.55 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (10-6, 4.39), 1:10 p.m., no TV\n\nThursday: Off\n\nFriday: Pirates\u2019 Charlie Morton (5-9, 3.28) at Rockies\u2019 Brett Anderson (0-3, 4.00), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Justin Morneau, Boone Logan became the latest additions to the Rockies\u2019 disabled list", "title": "Justin Morneau, Boone Logan became the latest additions to the Rockies\u2019 disabled list", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/21/justin-morneau-boone-logan-became-the-latest-additions-to-the-rockies-disabled-list/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140721__justin-morneau-rockies-072114bp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140721__justin-morneau-rockies-072114bp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-21T19:27:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:56:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3155\"", "article_summary": "Monday, first baseman Justin Morneau and left-handed reliever Boone Logan became the latest additions to the Rockies\u2019 disabled list.\nHe had a strained left knee.\nZimmermann (strained biceps) dodged a stint on the disabled list and has been cleared to pitch Tuesday night at Coors Field.\nMorneau, fresh off his appearance in the Home Run Derby last week in Minneapolis, went on the 15-day disabled list because of a neck strain.\nMorneau strained his neck Friday morning in Pittsburgh during an early round of batting practice."}
