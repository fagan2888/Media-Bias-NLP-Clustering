Evans joined today by partners from Beaumont Health, University of Detroit Mercy School of Dentistry and the Department of Health, Veterans and Community Wellness (HVCW) officially opened the new Wayne Health Center during a ribbon cutting ceremony.\n\nWayne County used a $700,000 grant from the United States Department of Health & Human Services to transform the 25,000 Sq foot space into a full service federally qualified health center with eight remodeled exam rooms. The expansion from two to four evaluation rooms for recipients of Women, Infants and Children (WIC) services will allow for increased access to care. The facility\u2019s dental suite will receive an increase in dentistry stations from three to five later this spring.\n\nThe Wayne Health Center located at 33030 Van Born Rd. serves residents in the cities of Wayne, Westland, Romulus and Inkster where there is only one primary care doctor for every 4,100 residents. The new health center will deliver an expanded level of services that include: Immunizations, Behavioral Health, Nutrition Counseling, Pediatrics, OBGYN and WIC.\n\nDuring his State of the County Address County Executive Evans said providing residents with access to quality health care is \u201ca top priority for my administration.\u201d At Tuesday\u2019s ribbon cutting the County Executive reinforced that message, said the health center will lower barriers to health care in Western Wayne County and discussed the impact the new partnerships with Beaumont Health and the University of Detroit Mercy School of Dentistry will have on the community.\n\n\u201cOur residents will greatly benefit from these new partnerships,\u201d said County Executive Evans. \u201cNow it\u2019s more convenient for residents to receive the health services they need and deserve.

The dental school will provide dentists and dental students that can provide services at a low cost, and the school will benefit from the volume and opportunity to expand their teaching program.\n\n\u201cThe University of Detroit Mercy School of Dentistry is excited to partner with Wayne County and Beaumont Health to provide dental services and be a part of a comprehensive healthcare solution for citizens of Western Wayne County,\u201d said Dr. Mert Aksu, Dean of the U of D Mercy School of Dentistry.\n\nDr. Mouhanad Hammami, Director of the Wayne County Department of Health Veterans and Community Wellness said, \u201cThe Wayne Health Center is providing affordable access to healthcare for some of our most vulnerable citizens.
