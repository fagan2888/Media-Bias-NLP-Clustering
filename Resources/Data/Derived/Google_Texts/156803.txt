A senior Western intelligence official has told Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin that 23-year-old London rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary is the key suspect believed to be James Foley’s assassin.

To combat ISIL’s growing threat the Obama administration “is actively weighing whether to conduct their strikes inside Syria itself. That’s where ISIL has its bases and command and control of its forces, which has swept across Iraq,” Griffin reports.

According to The Independent, Bary used the pseudonyms “L Jinny” or “Lyricist Jinn” when he was involved in the London rap scene.

Bary’s father, Adel Abdul Bary, was believed to be a close associated of Osama bin Laden and was extradited from the UK to the US in 2012 for his alleged involvement in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in east Africa.

In addition to Foley, ISIL is believed to be holding three other Americans hostage.
