(AP) - A multimillion-dollar information technology system is live for Medicaid in North Dakota after a series of delays and rising costs.\n\nThe state\u2019s new Medicaid Management Information System is running after transitioning from a system that\u2019s more than 35 years old, the Bismarck Tribune (http://bit.ly/1GBTanv) reported. The department met the latest operational date of Oct. 5 that it outlined earlier this year in a letter to Medicaid providers, though it faced lengthy previous delays.\n\nThe project\u2019s budget has risen from $62.5 million to more than $97.9 million. As of May 31, an estimated $66.4 million had been spent on the project, including $58.3 million in federal dollars. The total budget accounts for about $85.5 million in federal funds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big and very complex project,\u201d said Maggie Anderson, executive director of the state Department of Human Services. \u201cEven though the project has been going on under contract for nine years, there was an incredible amount of work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe celebrated for a few minutes then we got back to work\u201d when the system went live this week, Anderson said.\n\nDelays were caused by the system\u2019s complexity, which prompted Xerox to take a long time in designing and development, and changes in the project\u2019s scope due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, according to Jenny Witham, Information Technology Services director for the state Department of Human Services.\n\nNow the agency is making sure data from the old system has been transferred correctly and working with Medicaid providers to answer their questions.\n\nIt\u2019s good to hear the project met its go-live date, said Rep. Mark Owens, R-Grand Forks, chairman of the Interim Information Technology Committee. But Owens said he\u2019s reserving judgment about the system\u2019s functionality for the long term.\n\nHe said a clearer picture of the launch will likely be provided at a committee meeting tentatively scheduled for December.\n\n___\n\nThis version corrects the dateline to Bismarck, North Dakota.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A multimillion-dollar information technology system is live for Medicaid in North Dakota after a series of delays and rising costs.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/10/new-medicaid-system-in-north-dakota-makes-october-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A multimillion-dollar information technology system is live for Medicaid in North Dakota after a series of delays and rising costs.", "title": "New Medicaid system in North Dakota makes October debut"}, "twitter": {"description": "A multimillion-dollar information technology system is live for Medicaid in North Dakota after a series of delays and rising costs.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "New Medicaid system in North Dakota makes October debut"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf88\"", "article_summary": "___Information from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com___Information from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com\nBISMARCK, N.D.
