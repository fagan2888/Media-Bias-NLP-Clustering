It undermines our dignity and our self esteem. With everyone scrambling to be successful, why should we spend time talking about failure?\n\nExperts say we can\u2019t get ahead without experiencing bumps along the way \u2013 and that the better we know how to navigate those bumps, the better off we\u2019ll be.\n\nRelated: Want to Be Happier at Work? Ask These 3 Questions\n\nConsider that some of the biggest brands in business are rife with failure:\n\nMost start-ups, even those from successful entrepreneurs, flame out spectacularly.\n\nBombs in Hollywood \u2013 and from some of the biggest stars on the planet \u2013 are legendary. (Disney\u2019s \u201cLone Ranger\u201d last year starred Johnny Depp, cost $250 million to make, and lost roughly $100 million.)\n\nMost professional money managers \u201cunderperform broad market indexes like the S&P 500\u201d once fees are accounted for, says journalist and Bloomberg View columnist Megan McArdle in a new book, The Up Side of Down: Why Failing Well Is the Key to Success.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is that so many people fear failure at work and aim to avoid it because it feels lousy \u2013 then never take the risks necessary for professional success.\n\n\u201cThe upper middle class obsesses about sterling education credentials,\u201d says McArdle. \u201cChildren are practically encased in bubble wrap before ever stepping foot outside. And if something does go wrong, God forbid, we start looking for someone to sue.\u201d\n\nTaking chances and risking failure is often the only way. \u201cWe\u2019re the descendants of failures who fled to these shores from their creditors, their failed farms, their disastrous love affairs. If things didn\u2019t work out in New York, we picked up and moved to North Dakota,\u201d says McArdle. \u201cAlong the way, we built the biggest, richest country in the world.\u201d\n\nAll of this has practical applications for today\u2019s American workers in a challenging economy:\n\nTFT: Why are so many people afraid to admit failure?\n\nMegan McArdle (MM): We have powerful instincts urging us to wish it away. There\u2019s a paradox here: Failure should feel bad, because if it doesn\u2019t feel bad we won\u2019t stop doing whatever wasn\u2019t working. But once we\u2019ve experienced failure, we can understand what it\u2019s like for things to go wrong \u2013 and can learn from that.\n\nRelated: 6 Career-Killing Phrases to Quit Using Now\n\nYears ago, when I had a heavy student debt load after getting out of [the University of Chicago] business school, I realized I had to tell people I couldn\u2019t afford to eat dinner out with them \u2013 I couldn\u2019t do what everyone else was doing. I didn\u2019t have the money. I couldn\u2019t pretend any longer. I had to practice saying, \u2018I can\u2019t do this,\u2019 and once I did that a few times, it got easier.\n\nInstead of hiding from failure or covering it up, it\u2019s much better if we say outright, \u2018I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t do it right \u2013 but I\u2019ve learned, and next time, I\u2019ll do better.\u2019 That\u2019s freeing.\n\nTFT: You say we should actually give ourselves \u2018permission to suck.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that going a bit far?\n\nMM: People get terrified of finding out they\u2019re not up to the task, that others around them are smarter, better, more talented. So they procrastinate or don\u2019t try at all. I\u2019m saying, View failure as a normal part of growth \u2013 not as a referendum on how worthwhile we are.\n\nThat applies to the job search. I hear from a lot of unemployed young people who say, \u2018I can\u2019t find a decent job \u2013 I\u2019m living with my parents and I\u2019m miserable.\u2019 I say, \u2018Get out and do something.\u2019\n\nRelated: Want a Promotion? 5 Ways to Get It\n\nSure, it\u2019s important to be strategic, to have a plan. But your plan probably won\u2019t survive contact with reality. Unless you\u2019re a prodigy or in a highly specialized field where the path is laid out, new graduates don\u2019t always know what they\u2019re good at out of the gate or where their talents and skills can be applied.\n\nI say: \u2018Leave the house, volunteer, learn something new \u2013 be active and not passive.\u2019 Each time you\u2019re creating an opportunity for something to happen, which could change your path. If Plan A doesn\u2019t work \u2013 maybe Plan H will. Those who consistently keep moving, who keep taking steps forward, are the ones who get ahead in life.\n\nTFT: Millennials need a ton of confidence to know that this is the right thing to do \u2013 there\u2019s no roadmap here.\n\nMM: If you\u2019re not taking calculated risks in your life, you aren\u2019t creating new opportunities. If you\u2019re not taking calculated risks in your current job, you aren\u2019t creating value for your company, which could boost profits and help you earn a promotion. It\u2019s dangerous to have a career in which you haven\u2019t ever failed, because when the big failure comes \u2013 and it will \u2013 you need to know how to handle it.\n\nIt\u2019s important to be able to say to an employer: \u2018This is where I went wrong. This is what I learned, and I couldn\u2019t have learned it otherwise.\u2019 We are better workers for doing that.\n\nTFT: It takes guts.\n\nMM: Yes, but if you can pick yourself up and try again \u2013 that\u2019s when you may get the big win. Entrepreneurs and others who succeed, whether on the first attempt or the eighth, are responsible for the dynamism of our economy.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Americans don\u2019t like to talk about failure.", "title": "Want to Succeed?
