SALT LAKE CITY – The Utah Eagle Forum met for their annual convention Saturday ahead of the 2016 Utah Legislative session, and members said their priorities include things like defunding Planned Parenthood, continuing to chip away at Obamacare, and opposing medical marijuana laws.

Gov. Gary Herbert and his Republican challenger Jonathan Johnson both spoke to the group. While the Utah Eagle Forum is against medical marijuana in Utah, the two men vying for governor take a slightly different view.

"If it is of limited use and it's truly medical and prescribed by doctors for discrete sicknesses, then I think we should try it,” Johnson said.

Back in May, Gov. Herbert said he was open to the idea of medical marijuana if it is based on good science. Several medical marijuana bills are expected to be up for debate this legislative session.
