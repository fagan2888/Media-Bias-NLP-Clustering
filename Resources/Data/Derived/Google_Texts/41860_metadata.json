The sound \u2014 whether it is multi-instrumental, like in \u201cAfraid of Nothing\u201d or \u201cYour Love Is Killing Me,\u201d or just the solitary piano, as in \u201cI Know\u201d \u2014 perfectly matches Van Etten\u2019s voice. The result is booming and expansive, but also strikes an intensely personal chord with the listener. This music fills the listener with emotion, whether from big themes or the minute details that make love (and her music) so powerful.\n\n2) Owen Pallett: \u201cIn Conflict\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Conflict\u201d \u2014 Owen Pallett\u2019s second album under his own name and fourth solo album (the first two were under the moniker Final Fantasy) \u2014 is beautiful, dark and personal. Seeing Pallett live is a dazzling experience: Viewers get to watch him construct the complex interwoven sounds he is known for. Pallett uses his violin (in various ways, plucking, playing and lightly drumming) and keyboard, seamlessly loops them and then, of course, sings. The violin and keyboard are still present in this album (along with a bassist and a drummer) but even more front and center is Pallett\u2019s beautiful and unique voice. And in the personal lyrics he sings, Pallett, himself is more present.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Also Owen Pallett's stunning new album \"In Conflict,\" and the release of Neil Young's \"A Letter Home\" VIDEO", "title": "Innovative sounds: Sharon Van Etten creates masterful album, filled to the brim with emotion", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Also Owen Pallett's stunning new album \"In Conflict,\" and the release of Neil Young's \"A Letter Home\" VIDEO", "title": "Innovative sounds: Sharon Van Etten creates masterful album, filled to the brim with emotion", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/27/innovative_sounds_sharon_van_etten_create_masterful_album_filled_to_the_brim_with_emotion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/sharon_band_2014-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Also Owen Pallett's stunning new album \"In Conflict,\" and the release of Neil Young's \"A Letter Home\" VIDEO", "title": "Innovative sounds: Sharon Van Etten creates masterful album, filled to the brim with emotion", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/sharon_band_2014-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, innovation, innovative sounds, Music, Neil Young, owen pallett, sharon van etten, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc93d\"", "article_summary": "Topics: innovation, innovative sounds, Music, Neil Young, owen pallett, sharon van etten, Video, Innovation News, Entertainment News1) Sharon Van Etten: \u201cAre We There\u201dSharon Van Etten\u2019s fourth album, \u201cAre We There,\u201d stunningly captures the feelings of love, loss and desire.\n2) Owen Pallett: \u201cIn Conflict\u201d\u201cIn Conflict\u201d \u2014 Owen Pallett\u2019s second album under his own name and fourth solo album (the first two were under the moniker Final Fantasy) \u2014 is beautiful, dark and personal.\nThis music fills the listener with emotion, whether from big themes or the minute details that make love (and her music) so powerful.\nSeeing Pallett live is a dazzling experience: Viewers get to watch him construct the complex interwoven sounds he is known for.\nPallett uses his violin (in various ways, plucking, playing and lightly drumming) and keyboard, seamlessly loops them and then, of course, sings."}
