Obama’s other golf partners include Stephen Cloobeck, a businessman and Democratic donor, and Brian Greenspun, the owner of the Las Vegas Sun,.

They’re golfing at the Shadow Creek golf club in the northern part of the city, considered to be the nicest course in Las Vegas.

Jeter retired from Major League Baseball this fall after playing for the New York Yankees for 20 seasons.

Obama spent the night in Nevada after delivering his second speech at Del Sol High School on his immigration actions Friday. He returns to Washington Saturday evening.
