A new checklist helps tax professionals keep track of the new tax law changes and requirements that involve the Affordable Care Act.

The 1040 Checklist for Determining Minimum Essential Health Insurance Coverage was developed by the tax experts at Thomson Reuters and focuses on two new reporting requirements that will figure prominently on many 2014 Form 1040 returns: The premium tax credit and the individual shared responsibility penalty.

“These new requirements present new challenges for tax practitioners, as they must determine whether clients have qualifying health insurance or are eligible for an exemption from the mandate, calculate any penalties, and determine eligibility for the premium tax credit,” says Blake Smith, senior director of product development with the Tax & Accounting business of Thomson Reuters.

This free checklist guides practitioners through the questions to ask clients to determine if they had the required health insurance coverage during 2014 to avoid the individual shared responsibility penalty, or if they qualified for an exemption.

The checklist is available for download at no cost at tax.thomsonreuters.com/ACA-Checklist.
