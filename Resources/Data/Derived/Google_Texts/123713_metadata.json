How he must have railed at the notion that the intelligent boys and girls he taught and whose school he led for a time would not reach their potential without meaningful intervention.\n\nHis brand of intervention \u2014 the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Medicare, the War on Poverty, urban renewal and Great Society efforts generally \u2014 has fallen on hard times, victim to the widely accepted contemporary fiction that government is bad and that the more of it there is, the worse it is.\n\nThe size and role of government should always spur serious debate. Seemingly gone, however, are some underlying sensibilities that should never be out of fashion. These have to do with help \u2014 real solutions, whatever your notions on the size of government \u2014 for those genuinely in need.\n\nBut a hand up is somehow construed these days as purely a handout in too many important quarters in Texas. The government, when it does help, is thought to enable dependence and dysfunction.\n\nNot so. Johnson pushed for a Medicare amendment to the Social Security Act in 1965, which featured a program that has decreased poverty among seniors \u2014 added to a New Deal program that had already put a dent in such poverty.\n\nPushed and signed by his administration, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were the two most consequential legislative accomplishments to advance equality under the law in this country since the Emancipation Proclamation and the 14th Amendment.\n\nYet, in voter ID, redistricting and restrictions on third-party voter registration drives, Texas is seemingly intent on disputing government\u2019s role in even securing this basic fairness.\n\nAnd the state, with the most uninsured residents in the nation, has rejected all that has been legally allowed in the Affordable Care Act. There has been no expansion of Medicaid in Texas, an option under the ACA. And there has been a refusal to set up a marketplace exchange to connect residents to affordable health care coverage. And the state\u2019s alternative plan? There hasn\u2019t been a serious one.\n\nJohnson assumed the presidency after John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination in 1963. Vietnam ended his presidency. He declined to run for a second full term. But even with Vietnam, his legacy will mostly be one of government as an enabler of opportunity, not of dependency.\n\nIt\u2019s not that any of the programs launched in the Johnson years couldn\u2019t stand improvement. But in this quest for \u201cimprovement\u201d over the years, we\u2019ve noticed a preference for helping fewer, with less \u2014 need is not enough of a factor with modern policymakers. Education is widely accepted as a valid government role in giving Texas children a shot at opportunity, but meaningful follow-up has been absent.\n\nThe state is again in court defending a clearly unconstitutional method for funding schools, seeking court approval once again for doing it on the cheap, with a system that begets have and have-not school districts.\n\nJohnson, were he alive today (he died in 1973) might have recognized some of the inequities in what he called his \u201cWelhausen Mexican School\u201d in some school districts today.\n\nThis would sadden him. On this LBJ Day and on all others, it should sadden us all.\n\nWhether you believe the answer is smaller or bigger government, or whether the government has a role at all, the work of providing opportunity is undone. We\u2019re grateful for the difference that LBJ made.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "In launching the Great Society, historians say native son LBJ had in mind some of what he experienced as a young school teacher to Mexican and Mexican-American youth in Cotulla.
