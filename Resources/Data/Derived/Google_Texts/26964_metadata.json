They didn\u2019t know? Come on. This is disgusting.\u201d\n\nTito Montes, a former Naval officer who leads the Hawaii Republican Assembly political group, called the treatment of veterans \u201cabominable.\u201d He agreed with others that it\u2019s time for privatization of the system. He also noted the VA\u2019s failed delivery of health care to veterans doesn\u2019t bode well for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAside from the human tragedy, these terrible outcomes serve as a large wake-up call and accurate forecast of what is to come with Obamacare. If bureaucracy cannot take care of our veteran population, how can the government do it for the whole country?\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, a military veteran who served two tours in the Middle East, spent last week on a \u201cveterans listening tour\u201d and came away calling the treatment of veterans in Honolulu \u201cinfuriating and deeply disappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome came with tears streaming down their face, as they begged for someone to please help them,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cIt makes me sick knowing that our returned warriors are subject to begging for care when they come home.\u201d\n\nNationally, nearly 64,000 new veterans are said to have asked for appointments in the VA\u2019s 1,700 hospitals and clinics but have not had those appointments scheduled.\n\nGabbard last week wrote President Obama, asking him to use his executive authority to immediately allow veterans to access private health care.\n\n\u201cOur veterans should not have to wait another day to get the care they have earned and deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cThey must not be told to wait for the VA to be fixed.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who is drafting legislation to give veterans the right to obtain private medical care as a temporary solution, has launched a campaign to get local veterans to speak out if they have been treated unfairly.\n\nFormer Rep. Charles Djou, a Hawaii Republican and Afghan war veteran who served on the House Armed Services Committee, said he, too, has waited for VA services.\n\n\u201cLong term, we should allow all vets the option to access private health care facilities using the veterans benefits they earned, instead of forcing vets to use government-mandated VA institutions,\u201d Djou said.\n\nYesterday, the U.S. House passed legislation allowing veterans to seek private care at VA expense if they must wait 30 days or more to be seen by a doctor.\n\nThe VA, meanwhile, said the agency will discard its goal to schedule appointments within two weeks because it\u2019s \u201cnot attainable,\u201d but it will implement an emergency plan to get medical care to veterans by hiring temporary staff, extending clinic hours, referring patients to private care and restoring its mobile medical units in some critical areas.\n\nThe controversial bonus system that set off a firestorm across the country will be suspended, as will hiring more bureaucrats at its headquarters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "VA care in Hawaii is so bad a Democratic congresswoman wants to allow vets to access private care until the mess can be cleaned up.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "VA care in Hawaii is so bad a Democratic congresswoman wants to allow vets to access private care until the mess can be cleaned up.", "title": "As Details Emerge, Hawaii Veterans Voice Outrage at VA\u2019s Waiting Lists", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_06_11_HawaiiVA_Watchdog.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-15T00:14:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uZKenc"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "VA care in Hawaii is so bad a Democratic congresswoman wants to allow vets to access private care until the mess can be cleaned up.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_06_11_HawaiiVA_Watchdog.jpg"}, "title": "As Details Emerge, Hawaii Veterans Voice Outrage at VA\u2019s Waiting Lists", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2014-06-11T17:30:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-15T00:14:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Veterans care, VA, hospitals, veterans, Hawaii"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb35d\"", "article_summary": "Even before the audit, said Willes Lee, a West Point graduate, the problems for veterans in getting medical care were obvious.\nHe also noted the VA\u2019s failed delivery of health care to veterans doesn\u2019t bode well for Obamacare.\nGabbard last week wrote President Obama, asking him to use his executive authority to immediately allow veterans to access private health care.\nHONOLULU\u2014Veterans seeking care at the VA Medical Center here wait an average of 145 days.\n\u201cOur veterans should not have to wait another day to get the care they have earned and deserve,\u201d she said."}
