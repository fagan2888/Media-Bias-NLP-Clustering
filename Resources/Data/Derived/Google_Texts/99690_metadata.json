In-home care workers \u2013 who may under state guidelines be related to their patients \u2013 help with bathing, cooking and transportation.Although in-home care workers can, in theory, take other jobs, in practice it doesn\u2019t always occur since many often work supplemental hours for free to help patients stay in their homes. The average in-home care worker has three patients and is paid to provide care 25 hours per week, resulting in annual compensation of about $15,000.Louise Alioto-Perez, a county home care worker, put the living wage debate in human terms. \u201cHome care workers take care of indigents,\u2019\u2019 she said.\u201cThey barely get by,\u201d she added, and questioned how workers could \u201csurvive in this county\u201d when they haven\u2019t had a raise since 2004.Khanh Weinberg, communications director for SEIU Local 521, the Service Employees International Union, said the program saves $45,000 to $60,000 per patient each year by allowing them to be cared for in their homes instead of county institutions.The union said San Mateo is only offering its in-home care workers a raise of pennies per hour. Nicole McKay, Employee and Labor Relations Manager of San Mateo County, declined to comment, saying she was \u201cnot allowed to comment on anything during bargaining.\u201dAnother sticking point appears to be healthcare benefits. San Mateo county provides healthcare coverage to about one out of five in-home care workers, according to the union. The union is asking for the inclusive health coverage that Santa Clara provided its home workers in a contract signed last spring.McKay noted that home workers can obtain health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. However, the act requires employers to provide healthcare coverage only for employees working more than 30 hours per week. Although there is no suggestion that the county restricts hours to avoid application of the act, the union is demanding that San Mateo provide healthcare for part-time home workers.San Mateo in-home care workers are discussing possible strikes or acts of civil disobedience to see their demands met.\u201cWhy do we have to go through being arrested just to ask for an increase of wages?\u201d asked Faye Astrero, a San Mateo in-home care worker. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a civil disobedience is necessary to get a wage increase.\u2019\u2019The union claims that it has no definite ask figure as to wages, just an ongoing negotiation in which it is trying to increase wages and healthcare benefits to allow its members to keep up with the cost of living in San Mateo.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Stressing the need for a living wage ordinance for its lowest paid employees, San Mateo County\u2019s 5,000 in-home care workers are demanding higher wages and healthcare benefits.", "title": "Home health aids clash with San Mateo County officials over pay - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sieu-local-521-addresses-board-of-supervisors.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-30T17:57:22+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/10/16/san-mateo-county-living-wage/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Health", "tag": "wages", "published_time": "2014-10-16T10:24:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-30T17:57:22+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stressing the need for a living wage ordinance for its lowest paid employees, San Mateo County\u2019s 5,000 in-home care workers are demanding higher wages and healthcare benefits.", "title": "Home health aids clash with San Mateo County officials over pay - Peninsula Press", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sieu-local-521-addresses-board-of-supervisors.jpg", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1664\"", "article_summary": "San Mateo county provides healthcare coverage to about one out of five in-home care workers, according to the union.\nNicole McKay, Employee and Labor Relations Manager of San Mateo County, declined to comment, saying she was \u201cnot allowed to comment on anything during bargaining.\u201dAnother sticking point appears to be healthcare benefits.\nSAN MATEO COUNTY \u2013 Stressing the need for a living wage ordinance for its lowest paid employees, San Mateo County\u2019s 5,000 in-home care workers are demanding higher wages and healthcare benefits, arguing that the $11.50 per hour they are paid is not enough to live on.\nAt issue are not just the wages and benefits the county provides to in-home care workers, but the entire concept of how county workers should be compensated in one of the most affluent counties in the nation.\nIn-home care workers \u2013 who may under state guidelines be related to their patients \u2013 help with bathing, cooking and transportation.Although in-home care workers can, in theory, take other jobs, in practice it doesn\u2019t always occur since many often work supplemental hours for free to help patients stay in their homes."}
