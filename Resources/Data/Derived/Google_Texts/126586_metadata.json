Ryan laughed and said he was rethinking his appearance), then they covered a variety of topics including being chosen by Mitt Romney, Obamacare, and if Rep. Ryan plans on running in 2016:\n\nCOLMES: Were you shocked at such a young age to be asked to be on the national ticket? RYAN: Oh yeah, I didn\u2019t think he was going to pick me\u2026We never really planned on being picked because I\u2019m the guy with all the budget cuts, right? Most consultants will tell you don\u2019t pick that guy with all those specific policies.\n\n******** RYAN: It\u2019s a good thing that people who don\u2019t have insurance get insurance. Let\u2019s focus on that, but why disrupt the insurance people had and now lost as a result of Obamacare. That was unnecessary. By the way, why do you think they\u2019re delaying the employer mandate? Because it makes good policy? No, they\u2019re delaying it because it\u2019s really unpopular because people are going to lose their employer based health insurance.\n\n******* COLMES: This sounds like the kind of book you write just before you announce for President\u2026I\u2019d like to give you the opportunity now to make that announcement. RYAN: Hey! That\u2019s so kind of you, so big of you Alan. COLMES: You got to be looking at 2016, right? RYAN: No, I am. I\u2019m going to make that decision in 2015.\n\nWatch the interview here:", "article_metadata": {"prism.channel": "fnc", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "FOX News Radio", "description": "Friday on \"The Alan Colmes Show,\" Alan welcomed former Republican Vice Presidential Candidate and current Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan to the show to talk about his new book,The Way Forward: Renewing The American Idea.\r\n\r\nAlan joked with the Congressman about him coming on a show with a", "title": "Rep.
