LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — A south Arkansas woman celebrated her 116th birthday Friday with cake, a party and a new title — she’s officially the oldest confirmed living American and second-oldest person in the world, the Gerontology Research Group said.

Gertrude Weaver spent her birthday at home at Silver Oaks Health and Rehabilitation in Camden, about 100 miles southwest of Little Rock. This year’s festivities included the award from the Gerontology Research Group, which analyzed U.S. Census records to determine that Weaver is the oldest living American, rather than 115-year-old Jeralean Talley, who was born in 1899.

The research group, which consults with the Guinness Book of World Records, found that the 1900 Census listed Weaver as 2 years old, putting her birthday in 1898, said Robert Young, the group’s database administrator and consultant for Guinness.

That makes Weaver the second-oldest person in the world behind 116-year-old Misao Okawa of Japan and the 11th-oldest person of all time, he said.

Weaver was born in southwest Arkansas near the border with Texas and was married in 1915. She and her husband had four children, all of whom have died except for a 93-year-old son.

Weaver cited three factors for her longevity: “Trusting in the Lord, hard work and loving everybody.”
