He asked me to republish it here, which I do gladly with a recommendation you read it in full]:\n\nIn a May commencement speech delivered at the University of California, Irvine, President Obama mocked members of the U.S. Congress who \u201cduck the question,\u201d as he put it, \u201cof whether climate change is real by saying that they are not scientists.\u201d Since then, articles appearing in a number of \u201cneutral\u201d media outlets, including the Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald, San Francisco Chronicle, Cape Cod Times, Huffington Post, etc., have endorsed this learned approach of addressing the issue of climate change.\n\nClearly, they display climate change believers\u2019 chosen tactic of ridiculing or dismissing as climate change deniers anyone \u2014 including scientists, analysts and politicians \u2014 who dares to raise questions about the views of many within the contemporary climate science community.\n\nPerhaps a more thoughtful way to address this matter would be to question the president and his chief science adviser, John Holdren concerning which paradigm of science they subscribe to. Is it the evolved modern notion of quantitative science built on the firm empirical principles of Newtonian physics, or is it a new postmodern brand of qualitative science incorporating precautionary and other subjective concepts \u2014 all infused with a certain sense of intellectual ascendency.\n\nIf they subscribe to Enlightenment-era science, they should legitimately ask whether the myriad scientific uncertainties discussed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports, and by extension, the administration\u2019s national climate assessments, provide reason to question whether science has clearly identified the necessary causal links definitively establishing that humankind\u2019s activities are primarily, if not exclusively, responsible for all or most current global warming \u2014 both observed prior and future computer modeled global warming.\n\nIf however, they subscribe to what \u2018futurist\u2019 Jeremy Rifkin describes as \u201ca radical new approach to science and technology based on the principle of sustainable development and global stewardship of the Earth\u2019s environment\u201d premised on \u201c[t]he precautionary principle, [which] is designed to allow government authorities to respond pre-emptively, as well as after damage is inflicted, with a lower threshold of scientific certainty than has been the rule of thumb in the past,\u201d they are likely to interpret the uncertainties reflected in the IPCC and administration-developed climate science assessments differently. It would certainly explain why the president has argued that immediate regulatory actions are necessary, notwithstanding the current costs, because the possible future endangerment to human health, the environment and the economy posed by inaction is unacceptable.\n\nPresident\u2019s pledge of \u201cunparalleled transparency\u201d\n\nConsistent with the president\u2019s pledge of \u201cunparalleled transparency,\u201d Mr. Holdren\u2019s response would be illuminating. He would likely confirm the White House has, by design or happenstance, helped facilitate a subtle but nonetheless substantive change in the way Americans define, understand and apply principles of science to address perceived environmental and health risks.\n\nIf by design, it would reveal a non-transparent, activist-inspired agenda of shifting America away from the Enlightenment era paradigm of science premised on probability, risk assessment, prevention, causation and \u201chard\u201d quantitative evidence of foreseeable harm toward the postmodern anti-Enlightenment era paradigm of science based on possibility, hazard assessment, precaution, correlation, coincidence and \u2018soft\u2019 qualitative evidence of possible and unforeseeable harm.\n\nAs the European experience demonstrates, the legal and economic consequences flowing from such a paradigm shift are real and present their own significant dangers. This new postmodern regulatory science paradigm relies more on politics and notions of policy-based science informed by environmental and social justice concerns rather than on science-based policy.\n\nAs a second question, one would ask how this shift is coming about. Mr. Holdren\u2019s response would likely be more complex and nuanced. There are multiple mechanisms at play, ranging from moral suasion to fear mongering to nudged behavior modification to weakened scientific peer review processes.\n\nEPA\u2019s 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment findings: Less than stellar job of conducting proper and robust peer review\n\nIn an ideal world, Mr. Holdren and other Administration officials would acknowledge the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have done a less than stellar job of conducting proper and robust peer review of the climate science underlying EPA\u2019s 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment findings. But we do not live in such a world. Indeed, they seem to have forgotten or conveniently explained away their obligation under the federal Information Quality Act to ensure each of the 28 highly influential scientific assessments summarizing and synthesizing IPCC \u2018climate science\u2019 supporting those findings had been adequately validated. This would not have been an insignificant undertaking yet it was required to detect serious systemic violations of the letter and spirit of the Act and is a serious omission.\n\nOverwhelming evidence produced by the nonprofit Institute for Trade, Standards and Sustainable Development (ITSSD) demonstrates how EPA and NOAA, under Mr. Holdren\u2019s stewardship of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy-led interagency US Global Change Research Program, systematically circumvented the Information Quality Act\u2019s most rigorous and least discretionary peer review, objectivity/bias, transparency and conflict-of-interest standards. Such evidence is contained in a recast 145-page annotated FOIA request ITSSD filed with EPA on June 30, 2014, and in a clarified FOIA request ITSSD filed with NOAA in May 2014.\n\nAs InsideEPA reported, the new EPA FOIA request seeks disclosure of \u201cdocuments reflecting four different levels at which EPA should have followed IQA requirements\u201d. By comparison, the EPA Office of Inspector General\u2019s 2011 investigation of agency GHG endangerment finding data quality processes had been limited to only one of these levels. And as we previously reported in the Washington Times, the clarified NOAA FOIA request described how the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science had hand-selected scientists affiliated with universities receiving NOAA climate research grant monies to peer review six NOAA-developed climate assessments, presenting a significant appearance, if not actual conflict-of-interest in violation of the IQA.\n\nEPA\u2019s decision to circumvent the requirements of the Information Quality Act\n\nITSSD\u2019s findings and analysis demonstrate that EPA\u2019s decision to circumvent the requirements of the Information Quality Act likely originated from within and beyond the agency itself. While the full breadth of EPA\u2019s actions date back to before the beginning of the Obama administration, a 1989 law review article written by Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe with the assistance of the then editor-in-chief of the Harvard Law Review, B. Obama (\u201cCurvature of Constitutional Space\u201d) provides a window into the president\u2019s views on the future of public policy and science.\n\nIt reveals the president\u2019s long-held skepticism about the intersection of science and the law especially where matters of environmental and social justice are concerned. It also sheds light on the president\u2019s long-held view that science and the law can be finessed, where necessary, to suit policy ends.\n\nWe arrive, then, at a point where ends seem to justify means, fair and transparent processes fall by the wayside, and critics become villains. Partisans lob amusing but ultimately unsatisfying barbs at each other while the rules of science shift behind the curtain. Given the global economic and environmental challenges faced by our nation, we should expect and demand better.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nLawrence A.
