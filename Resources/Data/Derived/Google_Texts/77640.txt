For nearly three decades, the Minnesota Sinfonia has offered free concerts by professional musicians, music education and community programs. That was more than enough of a reason to host a Spring Fling fundraiser, which helps to ensure that the nonprofit’s concerts and classes remain free. In addition to complimentary hors d’oeuvres, desserts and champagne at Vic’s at St. Anthony Main in Minneapolis, the fun-filled event boasted games, auctions and, of course, music.
