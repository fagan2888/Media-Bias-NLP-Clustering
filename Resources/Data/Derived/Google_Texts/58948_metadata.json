This explainer was inspired by a personal experience. One of our contributors pays a whopping $485 a month for auto insurance in Detroit. For no-fault. If they moved across 8 Mile for the same coverage? Quoted by the same company for $169. Although on the high side, it\u2019s in line proportionally with multiple stories our readers have told us.\n\n$3,798 extra bucks a year for the privilege of living in the City of Detroit and following the law by having insurance where you actually live.\n\nIt\u2019s open secret that many move into Detroit, but not quite, by keeping their voting and registration address outside the city. There aren\u2019t exact numbers, but it\u2019s often talked about that when you move into the city that you keep your legal address at a relatives house.\n\nBecause of the motor voter law, those folks cannot vote in city elections, and because their address isn\u2019t from a legal perspective in the city, and they might not be paying resident property taxes \u2014 but on the other hand, they\u2019re physically in the city, paying rent, going out, buying services, using services, all of that. Long term, that\u2019s not a sustainable option, and encourages the churn of people who move to the city for a few years then leave as soon as life gets more settled down.\n\nIf city, state and business leaders truly want to stem the tide of people leaving and encourage people to come here, car insurance is one of the issues that needs to be handled. For today, we\u2019re going to focus on auto insurance.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get rid of the most common misconception \u2014 that car insurance rates are high because of theft. When it comes to numbers, theft has little to do with the cost.\n\nTheft makes up just 18 percent of your car insurance premium, on average. Also, for a basic no-fault plan, theft of the vehicle isn\u2019t included in your coverage.\n\nWhat about collision? Do cars in drivers in Detroit crash more?\n\nSimply, no. The average collision rate, according to a recent report, is about the same. Detroit drivers do not crash into each other more than other places.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly about the PIP \u2014 Personal Injury Protection. And there are multiple factors making the price so high.\n\nWhat is PIP? It\u2019s medical coverage in case you have an accident. Michigan law mandates lifetime care, over and above whatever health insurance you may carry. But that\u2019s not all.\n\nThere are double the number of PIP claims in the city of Detroit \u2014 and they\u2019re for almost double the claim amount than in the suburbs. About $59,000 per claim in the city vs. $30,000 in the suburbs.\n\nWhy? There\u2019s not one answer here, either. But here are a couple of causes of prices of auto insurance in Detroit to be so high.\n\nThere are some lawyers who are making a lot of claims \u2014 for instance one notable out-of-state firm is 411-Pain. Their ads are on the pink buses, and they\u2019ve been cited as a reason there are more claims. As stated in the Michigan Auto Law blog:\n\nMichigan\u2019s No Fault insurance laws are a tempting plum for out-of-state personal injury law firms, who see big opportunity here. And when combined with massive advertising and targeting of Detroit automobile accident victims, this has now also become a big driver in No Fault costs and No Fault lawsuits. It is a particular problem for cities such as Detroit, which is what Mayor Duggan described last Tuesday.\n\nAs Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan told the Free Press in the spring:\n\nThere are large numbers of Detroit-area billboards placed by lawyers seeking to be retained by accident victims and the legal industry has figured out how to get Detroit accident victims \u201cinto the maximum number of treatments they can get.\u201d\n\nOh, but it\u2019s not just lawyers. Hospitals are in on the fee feast, too.\n\nWhen it comes to bad stuff happening to you, not all situations are made equal. If you get banged up outside of a car accident and are on Medicare or what\u2019s commonly called Obamacare, a hospital can only charge about 10 cents on the dollar.\n\nBut, if you\u2019re injured in an auto accident?\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of financial incentive to rack up charges that fall under no-fault reimbursement in Detroit, as you can see in the graph below.\n\nHealth care costs in general are like if you go out to eat and if you come in the side door of the restaurant it\u2019s $10, but if you come in the front door the same item on the menu is $30. Same food. Same place. But vastly different prices, depending on how you ended up at the restaurant.\n\nAll of this is exacerbated by the fact as many as 60% of Detroit motorists are driving without insurance.\n\nIt\u2019s illegal to drive without insurance \u2014 but for many Detroiters in a region with unreliable mass transit, it\u2019s a reality for many poor Detroiters that their choice is possibly get caught for having no insurance, or not being able to go to work.\n\nTo get around this, by using weeklong policies, or starting a month of insurance but not renewing, people just slip off insurance by the thousands. And when an uninsured motorist gets into an accident, everyone else picks up the tab. It is from a practical perspective, a situation where you have poor people between a rock and a hard place.\n\nAt the average wage in this state of $21.70, Michiganders are working an extra 51 hours each year just to pay for our higher car insurance. Wayne County residents are working almost 91 more hours than if they had car insurance that was priced at the national average.\n\nIt\u2019s not just auto insurance in Detroit. As a state we\u2019re paying the most in the country.\n\nAuto insurance in Detroit is also affected by Michigan\u2019s laws that are almost unique in the level of coverage they provide. You get lifetime, unlimited medical coverage in case of a catastrophic accident.\n\nBut that coverage, over and above your private or Obamacare insurance, comes at a steep cost. A report by InsuranceQuotes.com says Michigan drivers pay more than double the national average of $815 a year at $1,923. Wayne County drivers, with their numbers skewed by Detroit\u2019s high rates, pay on average $2,789.\n\nThat\u2019s money that\u2019s going right out of Michiganders pockets when they can afford it least. Looking back since 2003, the 2015 Alec-Laffer economic competitive index outlined Michigan as the worst-performing state in the union economically.\n\nBack to Detroit\u2019s auto insurance situation.\n\nD-Insurance is the current plan, stalled in the legislature as of this writing, to try to address this at least in Detroit. It\u2019s a start.\n\nD-Insurance will not bring insurance rates in parity to the suburbs, but it would make a dent \u2014 some estimates say $600, others $3,000 per year. It would accomplish this by putting a cap on the health coverage \u2014 currently $250,000 per incident, same as the State of New Jersey, and on the high side nationally \u2014 instead of unlimited. One could also opt for a higher deductible to help bring the monthly payments down.\n\nAuto insurance is expensive in Detroit, but it\u2019s more expensive in Michigan than the rest of the nation, too. And until both sides of 8 Mile realize this and pressure lawmakers to make real change, we\u2019re all going to continue paying a lot for it.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "auto insurance in detroit, car insurance costs explained, detroit car insurance, michigan car insurance, why is car insurance so high in detroit, detroit, headlines", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Daily Detroit Staff", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Detroit", "description": "One of the barriers of\u00a0people moving into (and a catalyst to move out) of the city is the cost of auto insurance in Detroit.\u00a0This explainer was inspired by a personal experience.
