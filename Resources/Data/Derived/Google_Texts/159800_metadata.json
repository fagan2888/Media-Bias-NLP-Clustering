Imagine that.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Hillary Clinton, remarks during an MSNBC/Telemundo Democratic town hall in Las Vegas, Feb. 18, 2016\n\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s plan for private Social Security accounts \u2014 which died a quick death after even congressional Republicans balked at the idea \u2014 remains a favorite bogeyman of Democrats. Even more than a decade after the plan\u2019s demise, the claim that the GOP will \u201cprivatize\u201d Social Security still pops up in attack ads.\n\nWe have explained before that \u201cprivatization\u201d is one of those pejorative political labels used by opponents of the Bush plan, akin to the bogus Republican claim that the Affordable Care Act is a \u201cgovernment takeover\u201d of health care. Just as the health-care law preserves the private health-care system, private accounts in Social Security would have been established as part of the current system.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else about Clinton\u2019s claim that was wildly off. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nThe Facts\n\nSocial Security has two trust funds \u2014 one for retirement benefits and one for disability benefits \u2014 that are are currently invested in Treasury securities, one of the safest investments possible. (Some argue that\u2019s an accounting fiction, but that\u2019s not right. For more information, see The Fact Checker\u2019s Guide to Social Security.)\n\nIn the late 1990s, as the federal government started running unexpected budget surpluses, Democrats and Republicans argued about what to do with the projected trillions of dollars in extra money. Republicans began pushing for a big tax cut, while then-President Bill Clinton countered with \u201cSave Social Security First.\u201d\n\nThe old-age retirement program was expected to face financial stress with the pending retirement of the baby boom generation. The leading edge of that generation would reach retirement age around 2008, and today some 10,000 Americans retire each day.\n\nIn his 1999 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed transferring $2.7 trillion of the budget surpluses to the Social Security trust funds \u2014 and investing 20 percent of the funds in the stock market, most likely in index funds. Clinton\u2019s goal was to have about 14.5 percent of all trust fund assets in stocks. By 2014, it was estimated, the government would own nearly $1 trillion of the shares of U.S. corporations.\n\nThe hope was that the higher returns from stock investments would help extend the solvency of the program as baby boomers moved into retirement.\n\nAs a technical matter, Clinton proposed to invest general revenues in the stock market in order to bolster Social Security; he did not propose diverting payroll-tax revenue destined for the trust funds. Tapping general revenues, however, was also controversial because it would break the link between Social Security and workers\u2019 paychecks. In any case, one could certainly say that the first president who wanted to \u201cgive the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street\u201d was Bill Clinton.\n\nClinton\u2019s proposal was met with horror by Republicans, who feared government manipulation of the securities markets. (Then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was an especially strong foe.) Republicans countered with an alternative proposal \u2014 allowing individuals to direct a portion (about 15 percent) of their Social Security payroll taxes to individual retirement accounts. These were called \u201cpersonal accounts,\u201d in that Americans would have a choice of investment options modeled on the retirement program for federal workers.\n\nIn response to the GOP demand for \u201cpersonal accounts,\u201d Clinton floated an alternative system called Universal Savings Accounts, in which each American would receive an identical chunk of money from the government to be invested.\n\nIn essence, the two parties split this way: Republicans proposed to \u201ccarve out\u201d personal accounts within the existing Social Security system, while Democrats proposed to \u201cadd on\u201d personal accounts while leaving the current defined-benefit system of Social Security in place.\n\nWhen Bush ran for president in 2000, advocating personal accounts, he specifically rejected the idea of government investing any funds earmarked for Social Security in the stock market. Instead, he laid out broad principles for a \u201ccarve-out\u201d plan, such as saying current retirees and anyone over 55 would stay in the current system, that participation for younger workers would be voluntary and that the investment choices would be limited to a few broad-based investment options, such as stock and bond index funds.\n\nBush\u2019s Social Security agenda was sidetracked by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but when he was reelected in 2004, he pushed forward with a version of a personal-account plan, declaring, \u201cI earned capital in this campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it.\u201d\n\nUnder Bush\u2019s Personal Retirement Account (PRA) plan, the payroll-tax diversion was relatively small, starting out with a cap of $1,000 per year and eventually expanding to no more than one-third of payroll taxes. The investment options were modeled on the ones in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for federal employees, with a bias toward \u201clife cycle\u201d plans that shift investments from stocks to bonds as a worker nears retirement. A key feature was that participation was voluntary; even people who chose the PRA option would not have been compelled to invest any of it in the stock market.\n\n\u201cTSP was our model for account administration, and TSP has a quasi-government entity managing account administration,\u201d said Keith Hennessy, director of the White House National Economic Council under Bush. \u201cIt is true that our PRAs would have allowed you to take on (limited) investment risk, but that\u2019s a different meaning than \u2018giving the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street.\u2019 That\u2019s an absurd and patently false claim.\u201d\n\nGene Sperling, who was director of the National Economic Council under Bill Clinton, suggested The Fact Checker was being nitpicky about Hillary Clinton\u2019s language. \u201d \u2018Wall Street\u2019 was clearly her shorthand for the fundamental conflict between Republicans and Democrats over whether to carve out personal accounts from payroll taxes that now are dedicated to the Social Security trust funds,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone watching had any question what she was talking about.\u201d\n\nIn any case, for all the effort Bush put into crafting and promoting his concept, it went nowhere. Bush could not even get a committee vote on his idea, even though Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, as Republicans were wary of embracing a concept under furious assault by Democrats.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nWe realize that Clinton was speaking off the cuff at a televised forum, but her language on this issue is still very sloppy.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s \u201cwhole plan\u201d was not to put Social Security\u2019s trust funds into the stock market. It was designed as a voluntary program, in which individuals could choose to direct a relatively small portion of their payroll taxes to investment options besides Treasury securities. Ironically, it was Clinton\u2019s husband who actually had proposed to invest money earmarked for Social Security in the stock market.\n\nShorthand or not, there is also little excuse for referring to the Bush plan as privatization. Clinton earns Three Pinocchios.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check page\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actually, it was Hillary Clinton's husband who wanted to invest monies for Social Security in the stock market.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Actually, it was Hillary Clinton's husband who wanted to invest monies for Social Security in the stock market.", "title": "Clinton\u2019s claim that Bush wanted to \u2018give the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/22/clintons-claim-that-bush-wanted-to-give-the-social-security-trust-fund-to-wall-street/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/20/Others/Images/2016-02-19/___hrc_401455934271.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/22/clintons-claim-that-bush-wanted-to-give-the-social-security-trust-fund-to-wall-street/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hillary clinton; hillary 2016; hillary for president; social security; clinton social security; bush social security; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton; hillary 2016; hillary for president; social security; clinton social security; bush social security; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker"}, "article_summary": "\u2026 And you know what, their whole plan was, their plan was to give the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street.\nIn any case, one could certainly say that the first president who wanted to \u201cgive the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street\u201d was Bill Clinton.\n(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\u201cAfter Bush got reelected in 2004, the first thing he said was, let\u2019s go privatize Social Security.\nEven more than a decade after the plan\u2019s demise, the claim that the GOP will \u201cprivatize\u201d Social Security still pops up in attack ads.\nIronically, it was Clinton\u2019s husband who actually had proposed to invest money earmarked for Social Security in the stock market."}
