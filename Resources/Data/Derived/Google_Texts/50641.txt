A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Obama administration has unconstitutionally spent federal money on ObamaCare, marking a major win for the House Republicans who brought the charge. The House argued that Congress did not specifically allot the Obama administration the $175 billion the government has been using to reimburse health insurers. The reimbursements are necessary to reduce co-payments for people of a lower income. The House claimed Congress had in fact denied the White House's request for the money but that the administration is spending it nonetheless. The Obama administration is expected to appeal the case.
