The subject dominated both the Q&A; and the exit chatter, and the commitment to the bit alone makes the film a must-see.\n\nIf only the rest of the movie compared to the carnal acrobatics.\n\nDirected by Bryan Buckley (a commercial director known for his Super Bowl ads), \u201cThe Bronze\u201d is a lively, occasionally funny portrait of a terrible human being on a dubious path to redemption, or at least something like it.\n\nRauch\u2019s character Hope is a foul-mouthed, scrunchie-wearing gymnast who captured America\u2019s heart after competing with a just-torn Achilles, earning a bronze medal for her efforts but losing her body in the process.\n\nThe film catches up with her about a decade later and finds her in a state of bitter arrested development, still riding whatever laurels she has left in her Amherst, Ohio, hometown, and being generally awful to everyone in the process, including, most devastatingly, her father (an excellent Gary Cole).\n\nA series of events puts Hope in the coach\u2019s chair for a promising young talent, Maggie (Haley Lu Richardson), and Hope has to figure out whether she can ever care about anything but her own rusting glory.\n\nStandout supporting performances aside (including Sebastian Stan as a sniveling rival), \u201cThe Bronze\u201d wants to be shockingly dark and unsentimental, but also make us care about Hope. Both goals are only half-achieved.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/ldbahr", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Gymnast sex\" is mentioned early on in \"The Bronze,\" a darkly comedic look at the world of a washed-up Olympian starring and co-written by Melissa Rauch of \"The Big Bang Theory,\" but it's not until the movie is almost finished that the audience gets a glimpse at what that might entail, and it's a doozy.", "Author": "LINDSEY BAHR", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u201cGymnast sex\u201d is mentioned early on in \u201cThe Bronze,\u201d a darkly comedic look at the world of a washed-up Olympian starring and co-written by Melissa Rauch of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d but it\u2019s not until the movie is almost finished that the audience gets a glimpse at what that might entail, and it\u2019s a doozy.", "title": "\u2018The Bronze\u2019 and the explicit scene everyone\u2019s buzzing about", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/23/the-bronze-and-the-explicit-scene-everyones-buzzin/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/23/72787ad1b4a605036c0f6a706700165e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/23/72787ad1b4a605036c0f6a706700165e.jpg", "title": "\u2018The Bronze\u2019 and the explicit scene everyone\u2019s buzzi", "description": "\"Gymnast sex\" is mentioned early on in \"The Bronze,\" a darkly comedic look at the world of a washed-up Olympian starring and co-written by Melissa Rauch of \"The Big Bang Theory,\" but it's not until th", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "___Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/ldbahr\nThe explicit, highly choreographed simulation of two gymnasts doing their thing elicited both gasps and hearty belly laughs from the packed Sundance Film Festival premiere Thursday.\nStandout supporting performances aside (including Sebastian Stan as a sniveling rival), \u201cThe Bronze\u201d wants to be shockingly dark and unsentimental, but also make us care about Hope.\nThe subject dominated both the Q&A; and the exit chatter, and the commitment to the bit alone makes the film a must-see.\nRauch\u2019s character Hope is a foul-mouthed, scrunchie-wearing gymnast who captured America\u2019s heart after competing with a just-torn Achilles, earning a bronze medal for her efforts but losing her body in the process."}
