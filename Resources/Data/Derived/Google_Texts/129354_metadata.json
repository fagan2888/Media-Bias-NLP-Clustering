However, in the six months ended June 30 (PDF) , Medicaid as a percentage of SCL Health\u2019s gross patient revenue increased slightly from 9% to 10%, while self-pay and uninsured patients decreased from 5% to 2%.\u201cIn Colorado, (Medicaid expansion) had a big impact on the system, and in many ways a positive impact,\u201d Jumonville said. Some of its previously uninsured patients may be gaining coverage through the state\u2019s insurance exchange, as well, she noted.SCL Health realized $28.5 million in operating surplus on $1.19 billion in revenue in the first six months of this year. That\u2019s a 6.9% decline compared with the $30.6 million operating surplus on $1.16 billion in revenue it reported in the previous six-month period. The operating margin fell to 2.4% from 2.6%.The system\u2019s total surplus rose 27% to $93.6 million, thanks to significant investment gains from a booming stock market.SCL Health is the middle of a multiyear effort to strip between $350 million and $400 million of costs out of the system. Components of the cost-cutting initiative include labor benchmarking, shifting patients to lower-cost settings such as ambulatory surgery centers and improving the efficiency of billing and coding. Jumonville said the executive team realizes lower reimbursements will continue to be the norm, which is putting pressure on systems to keep operating expenses down.\u201cWe are really trying to look at what the gap would be if you\u2019re trying to live on Medicare-type reimbursement from all payers,\u201d Jumonville said.The system\u2019s acute admissions dropped 3.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2014, compared with the same period a year ago. When factoring in outpatient services, admissions decreased 2% year-over-year. Surgeries, meanwhile, increased 0.6%, and emergency department visits were up 3.1% in the first half of 2014.SCL Health sold three hospitals in the past year, but also created a joint venture that Jumonville said has been doing well thus far. National Jewish Health, Denver, created a jointly owned entity to provide inpatient and outpatient services at Saint Joseph Hospital, SCL\u2019s flagship facility.Follow Bob Herman on Twitter: @MHbherman", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "SCL Health's operating margin fell slightly in the first half of its fiscal year, but the Denver-based system believes new healthcare reform efforts such as Medicaid expansion will help it in the long run.", "title": "SCL Health's margin slips, but Medicaid expansion fuels optimism", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "SCL Health's operating margin fell slightly in the first half of its fiscal year, but the Denver-based system believes new healthcare reform efforts such as Medicaid expansion will help it in the long run.", "title": "SCL Health's margin slips, but Medicaid expansion fuels optimism", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140819/NEWS/308199962", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "SCL Health's operating margin fell slightly in the first half of its fiscal year, but the Denver-based system believes new healthcare reform efforts such as Medicaid expansion will help it in the long run.", "title": "SCL Health's margin slips, but Medicaid expansion fuels optimism", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140819/NEWS/308199962", "published_at": "2014-08-19", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s a 6.9% decline compared with the $30.6 million operating surplus on $1.16 billion in revenue it reported in the previous six-month period.\nChief Financial Officer Lydia Jumonville said it\u2019s still somewhat early to have reliable figures on how Medicaid expansion is affecting the system.\nNational Jewish Health, Denver, created a jointly owned entity to provide inpatient and outpatient services at Saint Joseph Hospital, SCL\u2019s flagship facility.Follow Bob Herman on Twitter: @MHbherman\nComponents of the cost-cutting initiative include labor benchmarking, shifting patients to lower-cost settings such as ambulatory surgery centers and improving the efficiency of billing and coding.\nSome of its previously uninsured patients may be gaining coverage through the state\u2019s insurance exchange, as well, she noted.SCL Health realized $28.5 million in operating surplus on $1.19 billion in revenue in the first six months of this year."}
