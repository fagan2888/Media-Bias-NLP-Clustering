Police in Georgia have made five arrests in connection with the discovery of a teenage boy imprisoned behind a wall for four years. The 13-year-old boy was found inside of the house of his father in Clayton County, Georgia.

Police arrested the teenage boy’s father and four other people, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was reunited with his mother shortly after he was found by the police early Saturday morning, about 2:00 a.m.

The boy’s father and the boy’s stepmother have been charged with cruelty to children, false imprisonment and obstruction. The police have also arrested three juveniles in connection with the case.

According to WSB, in 2010, the teenage boy visited his father. Then, the father refused to return the teenage boy and kept him hidden away behind a false wall in the house for the past four years.

Authorities had to perform two searches on the house before they found the 13-year-old teen and then he made a phone call to his mother, who lives out of state. The teenage boy has been reunited with his mother.
