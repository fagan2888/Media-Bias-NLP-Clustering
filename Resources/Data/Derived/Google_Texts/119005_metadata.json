Most minimum wage workers aren\u2019t teenagers these days. They\u2019re major breadwinners who need a higher minimum wage in order to keep their families out of poverty.\n\nAcross America, the ranks of the working poor are growing. While low-paying industries such as retail and food preparation accounted for 22 percent of the jobs lost in the Great Recession, they\u2019ve generated 44 percent of the jobs added since then, according to a recent report from the National Employment Law Project. Last February, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that raising the national minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 would lift 900,000 people out of poverty.\n\nSeattle estimates almost a fourth of its workers now earn below $15 an hour. That translates into about $31,000 a year for a full-time worker. In a high-cost city like Seattle, that\u2019s barely enough to support a family.\n\nThe gains from a higher minimum wage extend beyond those who receive it. More money in the pockets of low-wage workers means more sales, especially in the locales they live in \u2013 which in turn creates faster growth and more jobs. A major reason the current economic recovery is anemic is that so many Americans lack the purchasing power to get the economy moving again.\n\nWith a higher minimum wage, moreover, we\u2019d all end up paying less for Medicaid, food stamps and other assistance the working poor now need in order to have a minimally decent standard of living.\n\nSome worry about job losses accompanying a higher minimum wage. I wouldn\u2019t advise any place to raise its minimum wage immediately from the current federal minimum of $7.25 an hour to $15. That would be too big a leap all at once. Employers \u2013 especially small ones \u2013 need time to adapt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former labor secretary on why American cities should follow suit and raise the minimum wage to $15", "title": "Robert Reich: Seattle has set the bar for living wages", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former labor secretary on why American cities should follow suit and raise the minimum wage to $15", "title": "Robert Reich: Seattle has set the bar for living wages", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/robert_reich_seattle_is_leading_a_long_overdue_movement_toward_a_living_wage_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former labor secretary on why American cities should follow suit and raise the minimum wage to $15", "title": "Robert Reich: Seattle has set the bar for living wages", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Labor Secretary, living wage, Minimum wage, Robert Reich, RobertReich.org, Seattle", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37ea\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Labor Secretary, living wage, Minimum wage, Robert Reich, RobertReich.org, Seattle, Working Ahead News, Business News, News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogBy raising its minimum wage to $15, Seattle is leading a long-overdue movement toward a living wage.\nThey\u2019re major breadwinners who need a higher minimum wage in order to keep their families out of poverty.\nMost minimum wage workers aren\u2019t teenagers these days.\nThe gains from a higher minimum wage extend beyond those who receive it.\nSome worry about job losses accompanying a higher minimum wage."}
