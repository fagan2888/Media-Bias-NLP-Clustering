But next year they have to defend 24 seats while Democrats are defending only 10. And they will be playing defense in a presidential election year when minorities, young people and women \u2014 major Democratic constituencies \u2014 are likely to turn out in big numbers.\n\nThe bottom line for Republicans is holding control of the Senate. The Democrats will be busy trying to win five seats to gain the majority \u2014 and only four will be required if a Democrat wins the White House, since her or his vice president would then hold the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.\n\nThe danger posed to Republicans by Tea Party politics is on display right now.\n\nEarlier this month, the Republican majority in the Senate reacted to Tea Party passions by voting to defund Planned Parenthood, the national women\u2019s health care service and abortion provider. The effort failed because they failed to get enough Democrats to join them to overcome a filibuster. Polls show most Americans support abortion rights.\n\nIllinois Sen. Mark Kirk was the lone Republican senator to vote against the GOP\u2019s defunding bill. Kirk bolted from his party\u2019s official line because the vote would have hurt his chance of re-election. He is widely seen as the most vulnerable GOP incumbent in the country.\n\n\u201cIn other states, tissue donation programs should be investigated, but in Illinois there is no similar program,\u201d Kirk said in a statement to The Hill. \u201cI do not plan to cut access to basic health care and contraception for women, the majority of whom have no other resources.\u201d\n\nKirk won his seat by less than 2 percentage points in 2010, during the Republican-wave election. His likely Democratic opponent will be the popular Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth \u2014 a pro-choice, highly decorated Iraq War veteran and double amputee. The University of Virginia\u2019s Larry Sabato now has Kirk\u2019s race listed as a likely win for Democrats in his Crystal Ball political predictions.\n\nKirk is not the only vulnerable Republican moderate in the Senate. There are seven Republican-held seats up for re-election that are located in states that President Obama won in both 2008 and 2012: Illinois, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nRepublican senators elected as part of the Tea Party wave in 2010 are starting to draw formidable Democratic challengers.\n\nEarlier this month, Pennsylvania\u2019s incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Toomey drew a seasoned Democratic opponent \u2014 Katie McGinty, the chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf (D). Though Toomey has tried to position himself as a moderate on issues such as gun control, the former president of the right-wing Club for Growth faces an uphill climb. In 2014 \u2014 another great year for the GOP nationally \u2014 Wolf defeated the incumbent Republican Gov. Tom Corbett by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nSimilarly, Wisconsin\u2019s first-term GOP incumbent Ron Johnson is getting a rematch from former Sen. Russ Feingold (D). Feingold earned a reputation as a strong progressive who led the charge against the influence of money in politics. With increased attention on liberal voices such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and increased Democratic anger over the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, Feingold has a strong liberal base of activists and donors willing to work for him.\n\nThe difficulty facing Republican moderates in 2016 may be compounded if the party\u2019s presidential nominee brings attention to polarizing issues such as gay marriage and abortion. And there will be another set of problems if the candidate is personally polarizing.\n\n\u201cThe Trump phenomenon perfectly represents the culmination of populism and anti-intellectualism that became dominant in the Republican Party with the rise of the Tea Party,\u201d veteran Republican aide Bruce Bartlett recently wrote in Politico. \u201cI think many Republican leaders have had deep misgivings about the Tea Party since the beginning, but the short-term benefits were too great to resist. A Trump rout is Republican moderates\u2019 best chance to take back the GOP.\u201d\n\nBut first they would have to suffer losses for the White House and in the Senate.\n\nThe alarms for Senate Republicans are already ringing as fundraising for the cycle gets into gear.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) raised $1.6 million more than the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee (NRSC) in June.\n\nThe candidates, the parties and powerful political interests are already gearing up for a costly, negative campaign.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jerry Seib recently reported that, a year and a half ahead of the elections, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is so concerned about holding the GOP Senate majority that they have run advertising for four Senate Republicans.\n\nIt is no secret that the right-wing base of the GOP is unhappy with Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as Majority Leader. But if they keep up the extreme rhetoric, they may well be longing for the days of McConnell\u2019s leadership \u2014 that is, when Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) becomes Majority Leader instead.\n\nJuan Williams is a co-host of FNC's \"The Five,\" where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/OPINION", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-18 09:54:20 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "The bad news for the few moderate Republicans still in Congress is that they face long odds in the fast-approaching 2016 elections.", "twitter": {"description": "The bad news for the few moderate Republicans still in Congress is that they face long odds in the fast-approaching 2016 elections.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/18/tea-party-could-lose-senate-for-gop.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2015/08/18/tea-party-could-lose-senate-for-gop/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446955831307.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Tea Party could lose Senate for GOP", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/OPINION\"],\"author\":\"Juan Williams\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"Tea Party could lose Senate for GOP\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2015/08/18/tea-party-could-lose-senate-for-gop/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446955831307.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-18T13:41:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/18/tea-party-could-lose-senate-for-gop.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"d33f3a5c-95fa-48cd-bba5-b39f7926c39c\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "The bad news for the few moderate Republicans still in Congress is that they face long odds in the fast-approaching 2016 elections.", "dc.identifier": "d33f3a5c-95fa-48cd-bba5-b39f7926c39c", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "opinion", "description": "The bad news for the few moderate Republicans still in Congress is that they face long odds in the fast-approaching 2016 elections.", "prism.section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "Fox News", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Tea Party Could Lose Senate For Gop", "dcterms.created": "2015-08-18 09:54:20 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "The bad news for the few moderate Republicans still in Congress is that they face long odds in the fast-approaching 2016 elections.", "title": "Tea Party could lose Senate for GOP | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/18/tea-party-could-lose-senate-for-gop.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2015/08/18/tea-party-could-lose-senate-for-gop/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446955831307.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-08-18", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/OPINION\"],\"author\":\"Juan Williams\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"Tea Party could lose Senate for GOP\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/opinion/2015/08/18/tea-party-could-lose-senate-for-gop/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1446955831307.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-18T13:41:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/08/18/tea-party-could-lose-senate-for-gop.html\",\"post_id\":\"d33f3a5c-95fa-48cd-bba5-b39f7926c39c\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "dc.creator": "Juan Williams"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Trump phenomenon perfectly represents the culmination of populism and anti-intellectualism that became dominant in the Republican Party with the rise of the Tea Party,\u201d veteran Republican aide Bruce Bartlett recently wrote in Politico.\nThe danger posed to Republicans by Tea Party politics is on display right now.\nEarlier this month, the Republican majority in the Senate reacted to Tea Party passions by voting to defund Planned Parenthood, the national women\u2019s health care service and abortion provider.\nRepublican senators elected as part of the Tea Party wave in 2010 are starting to draw formidable Democratic challengers.\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jerry Seib recently reported that, a year and a half ahead of the elections, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is so concerned about holding the GOP Senate majority that they have run advertising for four Senate Republicans."}
