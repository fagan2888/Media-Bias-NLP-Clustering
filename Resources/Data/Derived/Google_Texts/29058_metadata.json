He aims not only to bring more federal resources to cancer research but also break down often self-imposed barriers toward greater collaboration in the medical field.\n\nBiden\u2019s visit to the Vatican served as an opportunity to plum an unexpected channel of support for his anti-cancer effort: foreign governments.\n\nWhile he has traveled to leading research centers throughout the U.S. this year, he said it has been a surprising topic of conversation abroad as well.\n\n\u201cThe number of world leaders that have contacted me who want to collaborate and work together \u2013 they sense exactly what we sense: the enormous possibilities,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden used his address at the Vatican to outline the principles for such international cooperation, beginning with addressing preventable forms of cancer, particularly in the Third World.\n\nThe vice president also called for more government-funded cancer research to back up the administration\u2019s proposed $1 billion increase.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats have expressed support for that expanded federal investment in cancer research. Last year, Congress backed a budget deal to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, even at a time when other federal agencies are struggling with flat budgets.\n\nSenior lawmakers from both parties have also been cooperating on major legislation to speed approval of drugs and medical devices and boost funding for medical research.\n\nThe House overwhelmingly passed a version of the legislation last summer \u2013 the 21st Century Cures Act, which would commit $8.75 billion to the initiative. And the Senate health committee has been working on a package of its own bills.\n\nSee more of our top stories on Facebook >>\n\nThe congressional effort complements Biden\u2019s initiative, according to senior administration officials as well as House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), one of the architects of the House bill.\n\n\u201cThere is a good probability that we\u2019ll be able to marry the two together,\u201d he said, noting congressional leaders and the administration have had \u201ca lot of very productive discussions.\u201d\n\nLast month, Biden met with Upton as well as other senior lawmakers working on the medical research initiative, including Senate health committee chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and the committee\u2019s ranking Democratic, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.).\n\nBut funding for the effort remains a major hurdle, particularly among conservative Republicans who have committed to slash federal spending.\n\n\u201cScientific and cancer research should be a national priority,\u201d said House Budget Committee chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.). \u201cSadly, we have an administration which refuses to prioritize. It simply wants more and more tax dollars and borrowed money to be spent, without regard for the fiscal consequences.\u201d\n\nThe White House has asked for more than $750 million in new funding to support medical research next year, though it is unclear how that would be paid for.\n\nAlso controversial on the Hill is the president\u2019s request that the new funding be made mandatory, which would exempt it from the appropriations process that Congress is supposed to use every year to fund the federal government.\n\nAdministration officials have argued that Congress\u2019 budgeting has been so dysfunctional in recent years that it would threaten scientific research, which depends on more stable funding.\n\nBut many Republicans, already furious over their inability to control mandatory spending in other parts of the federal budget, such as the Affordable Care Act, reject this out of hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not realistic. And I can\u2019t believe anyone at the White House thinks it\u2019s realistic,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees health spending. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing that the president is pushing something on cancer that they know can\u2019t happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Joe Biden is spending his last year in office trying to help cure the disease that killed his son", "date": "2016-04-29", "Description": "A few months after Vice President Joe Biden's eldest son died of an aggressive form of brain cancer, he traveled to Philadelphia to see off Pope Francis after", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "A few months after Vice President Joe Biden 's eldest son died of an aggressive form of brain cancer, he traveled to Philadelphia to see off Pope Francis after his first U.S. visit.", "title": "Joe Biden is spending his last year in office trying to help cure the disease that killed his son", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-biden-cancer-vatican-20160429-snap-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-57236e90/turbine/la-fg-biden-cancer-vatican-20160429-snap", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/87017695", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "The vice president also called for more government-funded cancer research to back up the administration\u2019s proposed $1 billion increase.\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats have expressed support for that expanded federal investment in cancer research.\n\u201cScientific and cancer research should be a national priority,\u201d said House Budget Committee chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.).\nSenior lawmakers from both parties have also been cooperating on major legislation to speed approval of drugs and medical devices and boost funding for medical research.\nHe aims not only to bring more federal resources to cancer research but also break down often self-imposed barriers toward greater collaboration in the medical field."}
