Two weeks after accusing Democrats trying to convince women they need the government to help them "control their libidos," former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) returned to that topic Friday.

In an appearance on Fox News' "Cavuto," Huckabee clarified his late January remarks, saying it was his "colorful expression" about what God gave us.

“My point was, not that I believe this, but I said the Democrats act as if women are only concerned about these reproductive issues,” Huckabee said.

Huckabee added that he would not take back what he said, telling Cavuto that there was nothing "unholy or untoward" about the word libido.

"It’s a wholesome thing," he said. "God gave us sexual drive. It’s not something dirty. It isn’t vulgar. It’s a wonderful gift from God in the context of a relationship between a man and a woman who have committed to each other as life partners."

A little more than a week ago, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus distanced the party from the reverend's words. In a Jan. 27 interview with MSNBC's "Daily Rundown," Priebus said that was not where the GOP stands.

"It isn't really even what Mike Huckabee meant to say," Priebus added. "I mean he had a pretty good message, and it was overshadowed by a choice of words that was just a little bit off, that's all."
