Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) is said to be standing in the way of a bipartisan bill aimed at sanctioning human rights abusers in Venezuela, where anti-government protesters have come under violent attack by supporters of its socialist government.\n\nThe bipartisan bill introduced in March by Sens. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) and Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) would impose sanctions on those responsible for violently targeting Venezuela\u2019s anti-government protesters who are seeking to depose Socialist President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe bill had been sent last month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Menendez serves as chairman.\n\nHowever, Corker is currently obstructing Menendez from adding the bill to the committee\u2019s mark-up agenda, effectively delaying any action on it and preventing it from moving forward, according to Senate insiders familiar with the situation.\n\nRubio hinted that the bill was hitting delays during a recent interview on the Hugh Hewitt radio show.\n\nAsked by Hewitt how the sanctions legislation is proceeding, Rubio responded, \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of been tied up a little bit in the Foreign Relations Committee.\u201d\n\nRubio noted that some senators may be experiencing \u201csanction fatigue,\u201d a reference to the pitched battle earlier this year to impose new sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cI think some of our members have what I would call sanctions fatigue, but I don\u2019t think, we don\u2019t have the luxury of getting tired when it comes to foreign relations and foreign policy,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis is a big world, and America is involved in every part of it. It has to be because of who we are and what it means to world stability.\u201d\n\nWhen reached by the Washington Free Beacon, Corker said in a statement that he is seeking to have a hearing on the bill before it goes to mark-up.\n\n\u201cWith ongoing diplomatic efforts to support dialogue in Venezuela, the committee needs to hear first from the administration about what the U.S. strategy is and how targeted-sanctions would help advance that strategy,\u201d said Corker, who is the foreign relations committee\u2019s ranking member.\n\nLawmakers such as Rubio and Menendez say that the bill is being considered at a critical time in Venezuela\u2019s history.\n\nAnti-Maduro protesters who have been rallying in the streets have been met with violence by pro-government forces, who have already killed dozens.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Venezuela has responded to antigovernment protests with violence and killings perpetrated by public security forces, and by arresting and unjustly charging opposition leader Leopoldo Lopes with criminal incitement, conspiracy, arson, and intent to damage property,\u201d the bill text states.\n\nThe opposition movement\u2019s leader was ousted from the country earlier this week, sparking further outrage at Maduro\u2019s government for undermining the rule of law.\n\nThe Menendez-Rubio bill would sanction any person associated with persecuting opposition forces. The sanctions include the blocking of assets, economic penalties, and the revocation or denial of visas for those implemented in human rights abuses.\n\nHouse lawmakers such as Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R., Fla.) have slammed the Maduro government and called on Congress to take greater action against the Venezuelan government.\n\n\u201cIt has been very difficult for us to get a clear answer from the administration about what they will or won\u2019t do in Venezuela,\u201d Ros-Lehtinen recently said. \u201cRight now Maduro\u2019s acting with impunity because the United States is not paying attention.\u201d\n\nShe has authored her own bill that also would impose sanctions on Venezuela.\n\nEuropean nations have already begun to take action.\n\nSpain announced on Friday that it had canceled the sale and distribution of anti-riot gear to Maduro\u2019s government.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Sen.
