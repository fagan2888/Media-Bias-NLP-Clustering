(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAlmost everyone agrees that Obama\u2019s new federal EPA mandates to control carbon dioxide emissions will cause energy prices to increase and a variety of activities and products (food, fuel, travel, manufacturing) will be more costly.\n\nOn the world stage, we will be less competitive and jobs and manufacturing will continue to go overseas.\n\nState mandates are not new. During Obama\u2019s first term, when he was unable to establish climate change mandates using accepted legislative procedures, he signed an executive order requiring EPA to use so-called divide and conquer procedures. These procedures have been surprisingly successful in pressuring liberal states into attempting to reduce carbon dioxide levels.\n\nNow with the help of environmentalists and the press, he has raised the stakes. He announced the first ever federal limits on power plant carbon emissions. Now states must reduce emissions to 32 percent of their 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nThe requirements also mandate that 28 percent of the nation\u2019s power must come from renewable resources. If states are not able to meet these mandates, the EPA would impose a federal plan that the states would be required to implement.\n\nPart of the public relations on carbon dioxide mandates involves the deal Obama made with China. This turns out to be a typical administrative giveaway. We agreed to begin immediate reductions while China can continue to build coal-fired power plants until 2030. Then maybe they will address the problem.\n\nAm I the only one that is unable to find a realistic discussion on the enormous cost of this latest mandate? Where has the EPA discussed how much these new regulations will reduce world carbon dioxide levels?\n\nIn addition, how much will this experiment on climate change reduce world temperatures? What about emissions from countries like Russia and India?\n\nDean W.
