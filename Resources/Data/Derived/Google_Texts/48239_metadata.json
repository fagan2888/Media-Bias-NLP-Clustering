Although the story turned out to be an exaggeration of a very small sample size and a perfect representation of clickbait journalism, that doesn\u2019t mean you should abandon proper beard maintenance. Greg Foot from Brit Lab explains why fecal matter isn\u2019t the only thing men in the Lumbersexual group should be worried about.\n\nIt should be no secret that men with beards run into a little bit of a dilemma while eating foods that produce crumbs. Not only does facial hair trap food particles, but it\u2019s also a breeding ground for sweat and bodily fluids. So now we have a cluster of bacteria in its ideal environment that also has tiny Dorito crumbs to feed off. There is, however, a solution to bacteria buildup: washing your beard regularly and using conditioner.\n\nAccording to the Simmons National Consumer Survey, 35 percent of men from the age of 18 to 24 and 17 percent of all men have facial hair today. Compare that to 2009 when 31 percent of men from 18 to 24 and 14 percent of all men had facial hair. It also appears that most men growing beards these days are not worried about grooming their face fuzz. Fifteen percent of men between the ages of 18 to 24 said they don\u2019t use any shaving products compared to 13 percent in 2009.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "facial, hair, might, not, have, poop, it, theres, probably, plenty, other, bacteria", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Your facial hair isn't covered in poop, but there could be other types of bacteria hiding in your beard.", "title": "What's Really Hiding In Your Beard (Hint: It's Not Poop) [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/facial-hair-might-not-have-poop-it-theres-probably-plenty-other-bacteria-355342", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/10/01/facial-hair-might-not-have-poop-it-theres-probably-plenty-other-bacteria.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Your facial hair isn't covered in poop, but there could be other types of bacteria hiding in your beard.", "title": "What's Really Hiding In Your Beard (Hint: It's Not Poop) [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/facial-hair-might-not-have-poop-it-theres-probably-plenty-other-bacteria-355342", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/10/01/facial-hair-might-not-have-poop-it-theres-probably-plenty-other-bacteria.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/01/facial-hair-might-not-have-poop-it-theres-probably-plenty-other-bacteria.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-10-01T17:14:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-01T17:14:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Your facial hair isn't covered in poop, but there could be other types of bacteria hiding in your beard."}, "article_summary": "Not only does facial hair trap food particles, but it\u2019s also a breeding ground for sweat and bodily fluids.\nCompare that to 2009 when 31 percent of men from 18 to 24 and 14 percent of all men had facial hair.\nYou may remember a recent report claiming that the majority of men sporting lumberjack-like beards are unaware that tiny poop particles are swimming around their mass of facial hair.\nAccording to the Simmons National Consumer Survey, 35 percent of men from the age of 18 to 24 and 17 percent of all men have facial hair today.\nSo now we have a cluster of bacteria in its ideal environment that also has tiny Dorito crumbs to feed off."}
