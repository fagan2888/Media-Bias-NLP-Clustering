As the tax year draws to a close, the charitable tax deduction beckons.\n\nAmerica\u2019s wealthy are its largest beneficiaries. According to the Congressional Budget Office, $33 billion of last year\u2019s $39 billion in total charitable deductions went to the richest 20 percent of Americans, of whom the richest 1 percent reaped the lion\u2019s share.\n\nThe generosity of the super-rich is sometimes proffered as evidence they\u2019re contributing as much to the nation\u2019s well-being as they did decades ago when they paid a much larger share of their earnings in taxes. Think again.\n\nUndoubtedly, super-rich family foundations, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, are doing a lot of good. Wealthy philanthropic giving is on the rise, paralleling the rise in super-rich giving that characterized the late nineteenth century, when magnates (some called them \u201crobber barons\u201d) like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller established philanthropic institutions that survive today.\n\nBut a large portion of the charitable deductions now claimed by America\u2019s wealthy are for donations to culture palaces \u2013 operas, art museums, symphonies, and theaters \u2013 where they spend their leisure time hobnobbing with other wealthy benefactors.\n\nAnother portion is for contributions to the elite prep schools and universities they once attended or want their children to attend. (Such institutions typically give preference in admissions, a kind of affirmative action, to applicants and \u201clegacies\u201d whose parents have been notably generous.)\n\nHarvard, Yale, Princeton, and the rest of the Ivy League are worthy institutions, to be sure, but they\u2019re not known for educating large numbers of poor young people. (The University of California at Berkeley, where I teach, has more poor students eligible for Pell Grants than the entire Ivy League put together.) And they\u2019re less likely to graduate aspiring social workers and legal defense attorneys than aspiring investment bankers and corporate lawyers.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of supporting fancy museums and elite schools, but face it: These aren\u2019t really charities as most people understand the term. They\u2019re often investments in the life-styles the wealthy already enjoy and want their children to have as well. Increasingly, being rich in America means not having to come across anyone who\u2019s not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The wealthy aren't donating to food shelters.
