Generally, consumers told WNYC they were happy with the plan\u2019s affordable options available at so-called Tier 1 hospitals, while doctors and hospitals in the Tier 2 category said they were nervous about losing patients. The debate rages on, with multiple lawsuits still underway.\n\nBelow is a brief timeline of events surrounding the controversial plan.\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state\u2019s largest insurer, unveils the OMNIA Health Alliance, a partnership of six hospitals and the state\u2019s largest doctors group. Horizon says it intends to roll out a health plan that offers lower deductibles and co-pays for providers in a \u201cTier 1,\u201d or preferred, provider category.\n\nCritics react to the announcement, focusing on the perceived lack of transparency in how alliance members were chosen.\n\nState Senators State Nia Gill and Joseph Vitale call on Attorney General Robert Lougy to block the controversial tiered insurance plan before it\u2019s planned launch in November.\n\nOctober 2015\n\nOMNIA criticism heats up. The Senate Commerce and Health Committees dissect the OMNIA plan during a joint hearing. Horizon claims it used six broad categories to identify partners, but says all other criteria is considered proprietary.\n\nNovember 2015\n\nCommissioner Richard Badolato of the Department of Banking and Insurance denies a request to block the rollout of OMNIA. Horizon says it expects roughly 250,000 members to enroll over the next two months for health insurance beginning Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nSeventeen Tier 2 hospitals take the state to court. They allege that the Department of Banking and Insurance approved the plan before making sure OMNIA met state requirements. The department is responsible for approving new plans and protecting consumers.\n\nDecember 2015\n\nSeven hospitals sue Horizon, alleging it breached in-network contracts by assigning hospitals lower tier designations without advance notice.\n\nThe 2015 enrollment period for purchasing a plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace comes to a close.\n\nMarch 2016", "article_metadata": {"description": "The largest health insurer in New Jersey has changed the rules of the game by clustering hospitals into tiers for ...", "og": {"site_name": "WNYC", "description": "The largest health insurer in New Jersey has changed the rules of the game by clustering hospitals into tiers for some patients.", "title": "Horizon's Tiered Hospital Plan Pleases Some, But Not All", "url": "http://www.wnyc.org/story/horizons-tiered-hospital-plan-pleases-some-not-all/?utm_source=sharedUrl&utm_medium=metatag&utm_campaign=sharedUrl", "image": "https://media2.wnyc.org/i/1200/627/c/80/1/OMNIA_photo.png", "video": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.wnyc.org/media/audioplayer/facebook_embed.swf?file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnyc.org%2Faudio%2Fxspf%2F602417%2F&autostart=true", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 29}, "type": "video.episode"}, "is_article": "True", "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 470219771, "googleplay": "org.wnyc.android"}}, "image": "https://media2.wnyc.org/i/1200/627/c/80/1/OMNIA_photo.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@WNYC"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=470219771", "fb": {"app_id": 151261804904925}, "keywords": "npr, new york, WNYC, arts, culture, news, public, radio", "overhaul/config/environment": "%7B%22wnycURL%22%3A%20%22http%3A//www.wnyc.org%22%2C%20%22googleAPIv3Key%22%3A%20%22AIzaSyCDbxxvbl0Zj6af28IfWjJ-S0SKxwDXnkc%22%2C%20%22renderGoogleAds%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22modulePrefix%22%3A%20%22overhaul%22%2C%20%22ember-metrics%22%3A%20%7B%22includeAdapters%22%3A%20%5B%22google-analytics%22%2C%20%22data-warehouse%22%5D%7D%2C%20%22something%22%3A%20%22test%22%2C%20%22metricsAdapters%22%3A%20%5B%5D%2C%20%22contentSecurityPolicy%22%3A%20%7B%22script-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%27unsafe-inline%27%20%27unsafe-eval%27%20data%3A%20%2A%22%2C%20%22img-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20data%3A%20%2A%22%2C%20%22frame-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A%22%2C%20%22style-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%27unsafe-inline%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20%2A.wnyc.org%20cloud.typography.com%20fonts.googleapis.com%20www.google.com%20platform.twitter.com%22%2C%20%22connect-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20ws%3A//%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%22%2C%20%22object-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20%2A.wnyc.org%20%2A.moatads.com%20%2A.googlesyndication.com%22%2C%20%22font-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20data%3A%20fonts.gstatic.com%22%7D%2C%20%22featureFlags%22%3A%20%7B%22embedded-components%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22django-page-routing%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22persistent-player%22%3A%20false%7D%2C%20%22ember-cli-mirage%22%3A%20%7B%22usingProxy%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22useDefaultPassthroughs%22%3A%20true%7D%2C%20%22EmberENV%22%3A%20%7B%22FEATURES%22%3A%20%7B%7D%7D%2C%20%22locationType%22%3A%20%22auto%22%2C%20%22APP%22%3A%20%7B%22version%22%3A%20%220.0.0%2B%22%2C%20%22name%22%3A%20%22overhaul%22%7D%2C%20%22sentry%22%3A%20%7B%22development%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22whitelistUrls%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22includePaths%22%3A%20%5Bnull%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22dsn%22%3A%20%22https%3A//62cc19caee0944219c038a6287eff1c5%40sentry.wnyc.org/3%22%2C%20%22debug%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22ravenOptions%22%3A%20%7B%22ignoreUrls%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22ignoreErrors%22%3A%20%5B%22adsafeprotected%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%20%22baseURL%22%3A%20%22/%22%2C%20%22googleAnalyticsKey%22%3A%20%22UA-283599-12%22%2C%20%22wnycEtagAPI%22%3A%20%22https%3A//www.wnyc.org/api/v1/browser_id/%22%2C%20%22environment%22%3A%20%22production%22%2C%20%22exportApplicationGlobal%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22wnycAccountRoot%22%3A%20%22https%3A//account.wnyc.org%22%2C%20%22wnycStaticURL%22%3A%20%22//media.wnyc.org/static/%22%2C%20%22wnycAPI%22%3A%20%22//api.wnyc.org%22%7D", "has_audio": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "revision": "38c95afd1495bd1d3d3aac5bf07d20e1"}, "article_summary": "Horizon\u2019s new OMNIA tiered insurance plan may be the biggest thing to divide New Jersey\u2019s healthcare industry since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act.\nState Senators State Nia Gill and Joseph Vitale call on Attorney General Robert Lougy to block the controversial tiered insurance plan before it\u2019s planned launch in November.\nThe 2015 enrollment period for purchasing a plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace comes to a close.\nThe Senate Commerce and Health Committees dissect the OMNIA plan during a joint hearing.\nThey allege that the Department of Banking and Insurance approved the plan before making sure OMNIA met state requirements."}
