Yet, Louisa Thomas infuses her writing with alliteration, sibilance and rhythm \u2014 all literary tactics which poet Wallace Stevens used in his works, and all of which Thomas learned in a Harvard poetry seminar that made her fall in love with writing, and Stevens, at age 18.\n\nI always think I have a wellspring, like a kind of current, that runs underneath the surface of what I have to say.\n\n\u201cStevens has a precision that I really like,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cYou can tell that there\u2019s a living intelligence underneath whatever is going on, and I find that tension really directive. I always think I have a wellspring, like a kind of current, that runs underneath the surface of what I have to say.\u201d\n\nThomas writes and edits for Bill Simmons\u2019 Grantland, a website named after Grantland Rice and funded by ESPN. Along with blog posts, Grantland publishes long-form stories and in-depth analyses of sports and pop culture. Thomas has worked for the site since its founding in 2011.\n\nThomas finds the human drama of sports stories, and reproduces it in highly intellectualized, often poetic prose. Dan Fierman, Grantland\u2019s editorial director, called Thomas one of the most thoughtful writers he\u2019s ever met, and Thomas\u2019 father, journalist Evan Thomas, said he envies the vividness that infuses her writing.\n\nGrantland writer Brian Phillips, for whom Thomas edits, said Thomas\u2019 prose is weighted and balanced exactly as it should be. One of Thomas\u2019 greatest strengths, he said, comes from paying attention to movement.\n\nWhen I write, I hear something, I don\u2019t see it. I think a lot of that has to do with having read so much poetry.\n\n\u201cI think she is better than just about anyone at describing action,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cShe will take a passage of play and really give the physical action space in a piece. She can really make you see what\u2019s happening and also take you into the mind of the players.\u201dWhen writing \u201cRocket Science\u201d on Stanford offensive tackle Cameron Fleming in 2014, Thomas stood unassuming and quiet during her reporting, watching Fleming and his friends, taking notes, and interjecting now and then to ask questions. She was looking for moments that would reveal the stakes of the story, an approach she takes with all her pieces. Only after an event, when she\u2019s in the car or on a run, will the full spectrum of a narrative begin to form out of these moments. Sometimes it\u2019s a first line, or a scene, movement, or idea. Always, it\u2019s in her head, just as Stevens wrote his poetry.Picture a petite, 5-foot-7, blonde 33-year-old woman running the streets of Los Angeles. For the first mile, she struggles, ready to quit. Then, she says, the endorphins kick in, she gets into a rhythm and running becomes pleasurable rather than a chore. This is when the writing comes.\n\n\u201cWhen I write, I hear something, I don\u2019t see it,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI think a lot of that has to do with having read so much poetry.\u201d\n\nEverything is heightened in sports \u2026 You know something is going to happen, you know there\u2019s something at stake. I never want to forget that this is about hope and joy and sadness and drama. That\u2019s the formula.\n\nIn the Harvard pre-orientation poetry seminar before her freshman year, Thomas read poetry and attempted to dissect the nuances of word choice, imagery and syllable use. After that week, Thomas decided to major in English.She remembers tracing dolphin imagery through history in Robert Lowell\u2019s \u201cDolphin,\u201d and examining syllables in each word of J.S. Woodsworth\u2019s \u201cRolled Round in Earth\u2019s Diurnal Course.\u201d\u201cIt was just amazing,\u201d she said, \u201clooking at and learning to notice how those things worked.\u201dIn dissecting Thomas\u2019 writing, a reader may notice the abundance of poetic influences. In her lead of \u201cCross My Heart,\u201d a Grantland story about cross-country skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics, Thomas wrote: \u201cI am alone in this, it appears. I\u2019m in the woods. I look for birds but the birds are gone. I listen to snow, but the snow is silent.\u201d This prose mirrors Wallace Stevens\u2019 \u201cSnowman.\u201dThomas also depicts salient issues in her stories, issues not just abound in the microcosm of sports. In \u201cTogether We Make Football,\u201d Thomas addresses the problem of domestic violence both in the National Football League and throughout society. Fierman called this story one of the pieces that he is most proud of running in his four years at Grantland.Thomas enjoys analyzing the psychology of situations. She reports thoroughly so that she can write from inside the mind of an athlete. She focuses on how athletes push their bodies, respond to pressure and negotiate obstacles.\u201cEverything is heightened in sports,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cYou know something is going to happen, you know there\u2019s something at stake. I never want to forget that this is about hope and joy and sadness and drama. That\u2019s the formula.\u201d\n\nThomas grew up immersed in sports. As a kid she swam and played soccer, tennis and softball. She made her parents tape the Olympics, and required her mother to save the VHS tapes to watch later on.\n\n\u201cIt was really important to her,\u201d her mother, Oscie Thomas, said, \u201cbecause she thought they were part of her life. It turns out she was right about that. They touched something deeper in her life than I recognized at the time.\u201dThomas\u2019 father worked as a journalist at Newsweek and Time Magazine, and though he never encouraged Thomas to become a journalist, he placed high value on storytelling. Storytelling thus became instrumental to Thomas. In sports, she said, there\u2019s always a story to tell.After jobs at Slate and The New Yorker, Thomas published a nonfiction World War I novel titled \u201cConscience\u201d about her great-grandfather Norman Thomas, a political pacifist and six-time presidential candidate of the Socialist Party. She did not begin sportswriting until she completed \u201cConscience\u201d in 2010 and began to play tennis again. A friend of Thomas\u2019 \u2014 an editor for \u201cThe Paris Review\u201d \u2014 asked her to cover the U.S. Open for the magazine\u2019s website.\u201cIt was tremendous fun,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThere was a freedom in it to write about the mind, the body, competition and psychology.\u201dIn 2011, when Grantland was two weeks old, an editor of the site who read Thomas in \u201cThe Paris Review\u201d approached her to cover Wimbledon. After the tournament, Thomas began writing part-time as a contributor, and became a full-time writer for Grantland on Jan. 1, 2014.Last August, Thomas also became an editor. Now, she both writes articles and edits stories at Grantland ranging from sports to pop culture, all of which, Thomas said, are usually on the more literary side of the site. She also edits her father\u2019s books, and, occasionally, his articles. Evan Thomas called Thomas the best editor he\u2019s had in his 33-year career.Editing helps Thomas fine-tune her writing. She keeps her audience in mind in a way she thought unnecessary before, and focuses on the structure and clarity of her work.\u201cIt\u2019s very rare to find somebody at Louisa\u2019s caliber who does both editing and writing at the same time at the level that she does it,\u201d Fierman said. \u201cI have never met anybody in my career who can move so seamlessly between both things.\u201dIn the midst of her roles at Grantland, Thomas completed a biography of Louisa Catherine Adams, wife of John Quincy Adams. The book, she said, is the piece she is most proud of writing in her career.Thomas says she is not proud of many of her works. Though she loves writing, journalism is still a job. Thomas\u2019 father and great-grandfather were writers, and her grandfather was a book editor, but her family treated journalism as simply another way to earn a paycheck.\u201cYou have deadlines,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSometimes you just have to get your work done.\u201dThomas\u2019 job happens to be in a male-dominated field. One of few females on staff at Grantland, she is often the only woman in the press box. Yet, more than Thomas\u2019 gender distinguishes her as a sportswriter. A Harvard degree and a literary background shape a resume that differs greatly from those of her cohorts.In covering the 2014 National Football Conference Championships in Seattle, Thomas arrived early to explore the city and sat down in a bookstore to read a novel. Her final story, \u201cLoud Noises,\u201d includes many observations from that day.\u201cNot many reporters are probably running to the bookstore and reading novels and reporting,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cbut I think that kind of stuff all seeps in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Grantland's Louisa Thomas finds the human drama of sports stories and reproduces it in highly intellectualized, often poetic prose.", "title": "Grantland\u2019s literary connoisseur Louisa Thomas is not your average sportswriter - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/louisaheadshot.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-29T10:31:34+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/04/24/louisa-thomas-grantland/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Sports", "tag": "sportswriters", "published_time": "2015-04-24T09:21:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T10:31:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Grantland's Louisa Thomas finds the human drama of sports stories and reproduces it in highly intellectualized, often poetic prose.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/louisaheadshot.jpg", "title": "Grantland\u2019s literary connoisseur Louisa Thomas is not your average sportswriter - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd293f\"", "article_summary": "Evan Thomas called Thomas the best editor he\u2019s had in his 33-year career.Editing helps Thomas fine-tune her writing.\nGrantland writer Brian Phillips, for whom Thomas edits, said Thomas\u2019 prose is weighted and balanced exactly as it should be.\nIn the Harvard pre-orientation poetry seminar before her freshman year, Thomas read poetry and attempted to dissect the nuances of word choice, imagery and syllable use.\nDan Fierman, Grantland\u2019s editorial director, called Thomas one of the most thoughtful writers he\u2019s ever met, and Thomas\u2019 father, journalist Evan Thomas, said he envies the vividness that infuses her writing.\n\u201cI have never met anybody in my career who can move so seamlessly between both things.\u201dIn the midst of her roles at Grantland, Thomas completed a biography of Louisa Catherine Adams, wife of John Quincy Adams."}
