There is little evidence so far that the epidemic is losing momentum. \u201cThe speed at which things are moving on the ground, it\u2019s hard for people to get their minds around. People don\u2019t understand the concept of exponential growth,\u201d said Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (snip) \u201cThe virus is moving on virus time; we\u2019re moving on bureaucracy or program time,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe virus is actually picking up the pace. Even as we add resources, we get farther behind.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just assume that treatment of each infected person requires care by, say, five people---maybe it\u2019s four, maybe it\u2019s many more.\n\nNevertheless, each person requires a hazmat suit.\n\nHazmat suits are disposed of after one use.\n\nThat means that 5,000,000 suits will be required each 8-hour shift. That\u2019s 15,000,000 per day---in Africa alone.\n\nThat\u2019s 450,000,000 per month.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen when, as some predict, there are thousands of infected people elsewhere in the world by then?\n\nWhat happens when we run out of hazmat suits?\n\nWhat happens when we run out of ways to dispose of all those used hazmat suits?\n\nAnd soiled linen?\n\nAnd IVs?\n\nAnd cleaning supplies?\n\nAnd people to monitor those people who had contact with the infected?\n\nJust askin\u2019.\n\nThe author is retired, his profile may be found on LinkedIn, and he may be argued with at bilschan@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/10/ebola_and_hazmat_suits_do_the_numbers_.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2014-10/193267_5_.jpg", "title": "Blog: Ebola and Hazmat Suits: Do the Numbers"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hazmat suits are disposed of after one use.\nWhat happens when we run out of ways to dispose of all those used hazmat suits?\nWhat happens when we run out of hazmat suits?\nThe number of Ebola cases in West Africa has been doubling about every three weeks.\nMany news reports predict that there will be more than a million people infected with Ebola in West Africa alone by year\u2019s end."}
