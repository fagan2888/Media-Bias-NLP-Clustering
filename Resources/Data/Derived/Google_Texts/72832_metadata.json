A substantial slowdown in its industrial sector and clumsy management of the country\u2019s stock market and currency have given investors pause and critics ammunition. On Monday morning, leading Republican presidential contender Donald Trump took to social media to predict that China could drive the U.S. into a depression.\n\nHowever, things might not actually be as bad as they seem in China, according to David Dollar, a senior fellow in the Brookings Institution\u2019s John L. Thornton China Center.\n\nRelated: As Stocks Tanks, Trump Warns China Could \u2018Bring Us Down\u2019\n\nThere is no question that the industrial sector of the Chinese economy is suffering, Dollar said, which the economic data for the first half of the year made pretty obvious.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the first half data what you saw in the first half was a weak industrial sector, but growth in service and consumption,\u201d he said. In fact, most of the job growth in the first half of the year was centered not in industry, but in the service sector. Analysts looking at the immediate state of the economy though, have limited data, most of which is focused on the performance of the industrial sector.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s painting a fairly glum picture because industry is really weak in China,\u201d said Dollar, who served as the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s economic and financial representative to China from 2009 to 2013, and formerly served as the World Bank\u2019s country director for China and Mongolia. \u201cIndustry\u2019s in trouble, but that\u2019s just one part of the economy,\u201d Dollar said.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is whether services are holding up well and whether household income and consumption are up.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why China\u2019s Slowdown Will Lead to Sustainable Growth\n\nThis is extremely important, because China\u2019s economy is in the midst of a critical transition from one based almost completely on industrial production to one in which the service sector, with its better-educated workforce and higher salaries, plays a much more important role.\n\nPart of the trouble in trying to assess the health of the Chinese economy, he said, is the lack of reliable data on the service sector.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Open Market Committee at the Federal Reserve processes reams of regularly-produced survey data about the state of all sectors of the economy, including household data that provides detailed information about employment, income and spending. There doesn\u2019t appear to be anything comparable available to Chinese policymakers at this point, he said.\n\nThat means that the best information available to assess the true state of the Chinese economy is available only quarterly.\n\nRelated: China Worries Send Dow on Biggest Intraday Swing in History\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Dollar said, the Chinese government isn\u2019t taking the sort of actions that many economists would expect it to if it were seriously concerned about an economy-wide slowdown.\n\nThere are multiple options available to the Chinese government for injecting financial stimulus, Dollar said, all of which the government could easily afford from a fiscal perspective.\n\n\u201cThey actually have a very conservative fiscal policy,\u201d he said. He added that measures such as a temporary lowering of the country\u2019s high Value Added Tax could prompt a surge of spending, as could investment of state funds in new education and healthcare initiatives. (Unlike the U.S., where infrastructure spending is one of the go-to areas for economic stimulus, there are many economists who believe that China has, for now at least, overbuilt its infrastructure and should focus spending elsewhere.)\n\nAnd while the country\u2019s stock market has been hit hard in recent weeks, that doesn\u2019t mean the same thing in China as it would in the U.S.\n\nRelated: China Stock Collapse Spreads Panic Selling Worldwide\n\n\u201cStock market capitalization is about 60 percent of GDP in China,\u201d said Dollar. \u201cThat\u2019s less than half the level of the U.S. and other economies. The market is not a major source of funding for companies or a place for families to put their wealth.\u201d\n\nDollar said that he thinks it is \u201clegitimate\u201d for people to be nervous about the state of the Chinese economy, and to wish that the Chinese government was better at communicating its evaluation of the economy and its future plans.\n\nThe bottom line, Dollar said, is that there isn\u2019t enough information to make a reliable estimate of the condition of China\u2019s economy. However, he added, \u201cOnce we get all the information in, I think the picture is brighter than people realize,\u201d Dollar said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Monday morning, leading Republican presidential contender Donald Trump took to social media to predict that China could drive the U.S. into a depression.
