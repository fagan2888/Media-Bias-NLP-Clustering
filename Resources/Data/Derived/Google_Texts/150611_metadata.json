The government has obligated a total of $13,932,914 for the \u201cAffordable Care Act (ACA) and Health Care Priorities Educational Initiative\u201d thus far.\n\nThe initiative gives funding to the health website WebMD to provide information to doctors and consumers about the \u201cbenefits\u201d of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law on March 23, 2010,\u201d the contract document states. \u201cAs a result, the Act requires that CMS educate consumers about the benefits now available through that legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealth Care Providers (HCPs) are important partners to assist in this outreach as they interact with the patient in the most crucial time for decision making on health care,\u201d it said. \u201cAdditionally, CMS handles education on many priority health topics. This task order will allow CMS to reach a broader consumer and HCP audience on the aforementioned topics.\u201d\n\nWebMD was first awarded the contract in September 2011. The document released on Tuesday authorizes the company to receive approximately $650,000 more for the \u201ccontinued education\u201d of consumers through Sept. 15, 2015.\n\nWhen the government\u2019s deal with WebMD was first revealed last November, the contract was reportedly worth $4.8 million.\n\n\u201cThe goal of this task order is to encourage providers and consumers to turn to official information sources regarding the ACA and to create an accurate perception of the ACA among health care providers and consumers,\u201d the document said.\n\nHHS decided to stay with WebMD since it has already provided services under the contract for three years, has the greatest reach to doctors, and is \u201cwell versed on the intricacies of ACA.\u201d They added that a \u201cconsistent source of information is critical to the success of the ACA and Marketplace Exchanges.\u201d\n\nWebMD devotes a special section to Obamacare on its website, which includes quizzes, videos, and guides to signing up for health insurance on the exchanges.\n\nA \u201cmyth or fact\u201d quiz on Obamacare includes answers such as, \u201cIn the past, insurance companies didn\u2019t treat men and women equally,\u201d and relates that \u201cyoung adults\u201d can stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until they are 26.\n\nAnother answer describes the federal marketplace as \u201csort of like an online travel site for booking tickets.\u201d The quiz says that Obamacare will \u201cprobably make it harder for people to find a doctor,\u201d though the law \u201cdoes try to help\u201d the doctor shortage.\n\n\u201cFor instance, it rewards doctors who work in underserved communities and funds training for new primary care doctors,\u201d WebMD says. \u201cHowever, even with these incentives, some people may still have trouble finding doctors.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for WebMD told the Washington Free Beacon the health care reform section is not part of the contract.\n\n\u201cIt is first important to point out that no government agency, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Health & Human Services (HHS) or any other third party funded the creation of WebMD\u2019s editorial content (videos or otherwise) that appears in the WebMD Health Care Reform Center,\u201d said Michael Heinley, vice president of corporate communication for WebMD. \u201cThe WebMD Health Care Reform Center provides original, independent editorial content produced by WebMD.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith regard to editorial content, WebMD has strict editorial practices that ensure the content we produce is unbiased and done so independent of any third party involvement or control,\u201d he said.\n\nHeinley said the editorial section is completely separate from \u201csponsored programs,\u201d for which they have been paid as part of its contract with HHS.\n\nThe contract has funded educational initiatives through Medscape, WebMD\u2019s sister site that provides information for health professionals. The initiative provides programs for doctors on how to talk to patients about the law.\n\n\u201cIn the first quarter of this year, CMS sponsored a campaign for consumers on WebMD comprised of two CMS-sponsored content pages that included links to Healthcare.gov,\u201d Heinley said. \u201cAgain, these pages were clearly marked as sponsored content.\u201d\n\nThe contract is responsible for the \u201cUnderstanding the Affordable Care Act and Women\u2019s Health\u201d on WebMD, which is identified on the website as an \u201ceducational collaboration\u201d with HHS.\n\nThe women\u2019s health site includes a FAQ on birth control, and an article on coverage for new mothers, which includes information on \u201clactation consultants,\u201d a breastfeeding hotline, and how under Obamacare employers have to \u201coffer a private place for you to pump.\u201d\n\nHeinley said HHS has to approve all the content that is funded through the contract.\n\n\u201cAs with any contract with a government agency, for any funded programs, WebMD must adhere to the federal government\u2019s content clearance policy and requirements,\u201d he said. \u201cIn developing funded content for CMS or any other federal agency, WebMD adheres to this policy, which requires government agencies to review and approve materials before they are made available in the public domain.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "HHS gets editorial approval over sponsored content", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "WebMD has received nearly $14 million to promote Obamacare, as part of a government initiative designed to get Americans to turn to \u201cofficial information\u201d on the health care law.
