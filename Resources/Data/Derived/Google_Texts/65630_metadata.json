We know that Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders long has favored a single-payer system.\n\nBut voters want more specifics, right? Right? (Sometimes it\u2019s questionable.) Healthcare Executives Network has compiled video clips from some of the leading 2016 presidential candidates \u2014 as well as a few also-rans \u2014 and is taking an informal poll of readers through Nov. 13, asking which presidential hopeful has the \u201cbest\u201d position on healthcare.\n\nThe videos come from presidential debates, stump speeches, voter forums, TV interviews and the campaigns themselves. Not every candidate is represented, but, let\u2019s face it, the ones who are missing really don\u2019t have much chance at winning their party\u2019s nomination anyway.\n\nThe poll is sure to be unscientific, but it could be fun. The videos certainly are, particularly Donald Trump\u2019s.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample from Republican Dr. Ben Carson.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what Democrat Hillary Clinton had to say.\n\nDon\u2019t hate us if your favorite candidate isn\u2019t here or if one of the above videos makes your blood boil with rage.
