When Marvin Lail was confronted by a mugger while pumping gas at a 7-Eleven in Orlando, Florida the 79-year-old refused to cower in fear.

"He said, 'Give me your wallet, old man,'" Lail told the Orlando Sentinel. "The main thing going on in my mind is, 'You aren't going to get my wallet.'"

And he didn't.

Lail, an Army veteran, fought back.

"He wasn't getting my money, and he wasn't getting my wallet and he had to kill me to get it," Lail told ClickOrlando.com.

Lail kept fighting the robber even after the suspect pulled out a gun.

"I think I could have kicked it out of his hand. I was watching every move he made and I think I could have taken him."

The crime was thwarted when 7-Eleven employee Shion Pierre-Charles came out to the parking lot to see what was happening. At that point, the suspect left the crime scene. Lail ran inside to call 911.

“I didn’t know the suspect had a gun in his hand when I went outside the store,” Pierre-Charles told ABC News. “I just told him to leave the property.”

Lail did suffer some minor scuffing on his hand in the encounter and also lost some cash.

The suspect is still on the loose. He is described to be between 28 years old and 35 years old about 5 feet, 8 inches, weighing 160 pounds, MyNews13 reports.

Anyone with information is asked to call CrimeLine at 800-423-TIPS (8477).
