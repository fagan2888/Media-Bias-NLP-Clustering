Bloomberg Billionaire activist Nelson Peltz was seeking seats on DuPont’s board

DuPont Co. defeated Trian Fund Management LP’s campaign to land seats on the chemical giant’s board, dealing a landmark setback to one of the most influential activist investment firms.

DuPont’s DD, -1.86% shareholders on Wednesday re-elected all of its sitting directors, rejecting the criticisms of Trian and its chief executive, Nelson Peltz, that the 212-year-old maker of Kevlar fibers and Pioneer corn seeds suffered from a bloated corporate structure and sagging profits.

Trian issued a statement Wednesday morning confirming the outcome.

Peltz, speaking briefly at DuPont’s shareholder meeting ahead of the results being announced, thanked investors for their support and said he was proud of Trian’s analysis, no matter how the vote went. He reiterated arguments that DuPont would miss earnings targets this year and said Trian would keep watch.

The vote, after two years of private and public jousting, is a victory not only for DuPont and its chief executive, Ellen Kullman, but for others in corporate America concerned that activist investors’ influence has grown too strong and that companies have capitulated to their demands too readily.

At the company’s annual meeting, Kullman received a standing ovation at the vote was announced.
