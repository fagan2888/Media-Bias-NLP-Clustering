For Parts I and II of the journal, go here and here.\n\nIn recent years, Maine has been very hard hit by drugs. A headline in 2011 read, \u201cMaine tops nation in prescription drug abuse.\u201d In the wake of prescription drugs have come heroin and meth. Dealers from Brooklyn and other such places find a ready market here. People are overdosing in increasing numbers \u2014 dying.\n\nPoliticians and others speak of an \u201cepidemic,\u201d and that is not an exaggeration. All the New England governors are devoting more and more time to this problem, this crisis. In fact, there was a gubernatorial summit on drugs in Waltham, Mass., earlier this summer.\n\nTraveling around Maine, and hearing about it, I think, \u201cThis is a textbook example of what Charles Murray is talking about.\u201d Two years ago, the famed political scientist wrote Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960\u20132010. It\u2019s about economic and moral decline. Of course, there are textbook examples all over the country . . .\n\nIn February, I was in my home state, Michigan, visiting Hillsdale College \u2014 an elite college in a rural area. Someone told me that local stores have trouble getting and keeping help: Too many citizens are hooked on meth.\n\nTwo months later, I was in Nebraska, doing a story from a lovely farming community. My host pointed out all the meth houses.\n\nMay I ask a question? When exactly did America become a continental ghetto?\n\nIn his State of the State address last February, Maine\u2019s governor spoke of the drug epidemic. \u201cIt is tearing at the social fabric of our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile some are spending all their time trying to expand welfare, we are losing the war on drugs.\u201d He went on to say that \u201c927 drug-addicted babies were born last year in Maine. That\u2019s more than 7 percent of all births.\u201d\n\nThe governor is Paul LePage, a conservative Republican. He is the most controversial, colorful, and quotable governor in America. His political incorrectness is spectacular. The liberal press doesn\u2019t know whether to be outraged or amused. Politico ran a story titled \u201cHow Did Mild-Mannered Maine Get America\u2019s Craziest Governor?\u201d\n\nA long way from crazy, LePage knows many things. Poverty, for one. He was born in Lewiston in 1948. The family was French-speaking, and Paul was the first of 18 children. His father was a mill worker and a drunk. He beat the hell out of Paul, who escaped home at age eleven. He lived on the streets for two years. With the help of some caring and responsible adults, he rose.\n\nLePage has an advantage that few politicians do: You can\u2019t out-poor him. You can\u2019t lecture or guilt him on the subject of poverty. His tongue is amazingly free. He reminds me a little of black conservatives, talking to black audiences, and to white liberal audiences, for that matter. They have an invaluable freedom.\n\nIn his State of the State address, LePage said, \u201cThere is no excuse for able-bodied adults to spend a lifetime on welfare at the expense of hard-working, struggling Mainers. That is not what I call compassion.\u201d\n\nHe is trying to crack down on welfare abusers. He said, \u201cI will not tolerate the abuse of welfare benefits. Maine\u2019s limited resources must be reserved for the truly needy. . . . Every dollar that goes to buy cigarettes, alcohol, or lottery tickets is a dollar taken away from a needy child . . .\u201d\n\nAnd, \u201cIf you want to ask the taxpayers for money, you should make a good-faith effort to get a job first.\u201d\n\nSee what I mean?\n\nI think of the Rockefellers, some of whom went to poor states to have their careers: Winthrop became governor of Arkansas; Jay became a U.S. senator from West Virginia. If a Rockefeller tries to reform welfare, the headline may well read, \u201cRockefeller Snatches Bread from Urchin\u2019s Mouth.\u201d Try that with LePage: He is the urchin.\n\nLet me do some more quoting:\n\nI know generational poverty. But I escaped generational poverty, and lived the American Dream. Some caring Maine families took me in from the streets of Lewiston and gave me the guidance I needed to succeed. I have said it many times: Education saved my life. Throwing money at poverty will not end poverty. Education and mentoring will end poverty.\n\nHe is incredibly blunt about economics and the size of government, as he is about everything else. Have some more, from that State of the State address: \u201cHigher taxes and bloated government have not improved our lives. Higher energy costs have not attracted major investments to Maine. More welfare has not led to prosperity. It has not broken the cycle of generational poverty.\u201d\n\nA bit more: \u201cRecruiting job creators to come to Maine is not easy. The global competition is fierce. Investment capital goes where it is welcomed and stays where it is appreciated.\u201d\n\nThe street urchin sounds a lot like Mitt Romney, the rich kid.\n\nLePage quoted Churchill, to wit, \u201cSome people regard private enterprise as a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look on it as a cow they can milk. Not enough people see it as a healthy horse, pulling a sturdy wagon.\u201d\n\nHave some more bluntness, more essential LePage:\n\nLiberal politicians are taking us down a dangerous path \u2014 a path that is unsustainable. They want a massive expansion of Maine\u2019s welfare state. Expanded welfare does not break the cycle of generational poverty. It breaks the budget. In 1935, during the height of the Great Depression, FDR \u2014 the father of the New Deal \u2014 warned against welfare dependency. He said, \u201cTo dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit. . . . The federal government must and shall quit this business of relief.\u201d\n\nYou know who used to quote this frequently? Reagan. It drove his Democratic critics crazy. He also quoted JFK, which also drove them crazy.\n\nIn his State of the State, LePage quoted JFK, too. On the subject of welfare, he whipped out, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you . . .\u201d That took nerve, I think.\n\nHe also called for \u201cOpen for Business Zones,\u201d which remind me of Jack Kemp\u2019s \u201centerprise zones.\u201d (By the way, why isn\u2019t all of America, or most of America, an enterprise zone?) Said LePage, \u201cEmployees in these zones will not be forced to join labor unions. They will not be forced to pay dues or fees to labor unions. This will allow Maine to compete with right-to-work states.\u201d\n\nOne last chunk of that speech, or blast of bluntness:\n\nWe are working hard to combat Maine\u2019s reputation as a high-tax state. We passed the largest tax cut in Maine\u2019s history. Two-thirds of Maine taxpayers will get income-tax relief. Liberals call it a \u201ctax break for the rich.\u201d But 70,000 low-income Mainers will no longer pay income tax. We cut taxes for the working poor. This is compassion.\n\nDespite some nice lines above, in that formal speech, LePage must be the least polished politician in America. He is what journalists call a \u201cgaffe machine.\u201d Thing is, he talks like a normal person \u2014 a normal Joe, who does not weigh every word before it comes out of his mouth. Sometimes, he is crude. So are people.\n\nA couple of years ago, he said that, under Obamacare, the IRS would be \u201cthe new Gestapo.\u201d A more polished or practiced politician would think this: Gee, I can\u2019t call it a Gestapo, because you cannot compare anything to Nazism, and I don\u2019t want to deal with the Anti-Defamation League and so on. But LePage? He wanted to describe something as a really bad police force \u2014 so he said \u201cGestapo,\u201d just like a normal person would. And landed in hot water.\n\nHe is also called a racist, as pretty much every conservative politician, and conservative person, is. He has this advantage: He and his wife took in a black teen from Jamaica, whom they regard as their adopted son. So the governor can tell his accusers to kiss his big white French butt.\n\nLePage won with a narrow plurality in 2010 \u2014 he got 38 percent. An independent candidate, Eliot Cutler, got 36 percent. The Democratic nominee, Libby Mitchell, was far behind with 19.\n\nThere is another gubernatorial race this year \u2014 another three-way, between LePage, Cutler, and the Democratic nominee, this time Mike Michaud, a congressman.\n\nWhat an interesting race. Consider the three personalities. LePage, you know: the Franco-American kid from the streets of Lewiston. Cutler could hardly be more different: a graduate of Harvard College and Georgetown Law; the founding partner of an important firm; a former aide to Ed Muskie; etc. Michaud is a working-class Franco-American who never went to college and belongs to the steelworkers union. And is openly gay.\n\nYes, an interesting race, in an interesting state. I\u2019ll continue this journal tomorrow, and wrap it up.

For Parts I and II of the journal, go here and here.\n\nIn recent years, Maine has been very hard hit by drugs. A headline in 2011 read, \u201cMaine tops nation in prescription drug abuse.\u201d In the wake of prescription drugs have come heroin and meth. Dealers from Brooklyn and other such places find a ready market here. People are overdosing in increasing numbers \u2014 dying.\n\nPoliticians and others speak of an \u201cepidemic,\u201d and that is not an exaggeration. All the New England governors are devoting more and more time to this problem, this crisis. In fact, there was a gubernatorial summit on drugs in Waltham, Mass., earlier this summer.\n\n Traveling around Maine, and hearing about it, I think, \u201cThis is a textbook example of what Charles Murray is talking about.\u201d Two years ago, the famed political scientist wrote Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960\u20132010. It\u2019s about economic and moral decline. Of course, there are textbook examples all over the country . . .\n\nIn February, I was in my home state, Michigan, visiting Hillsdale College \u2014 an elite college in a rural area. Someone told me that local stores have trouble getting and keeping help: Too many citizens are hooked on meth.\n\nTwo months later, I was in Nebraska, doing a story from a lovely farming community. My host pointed out all the meth houses.\n\nMay I ask a question? When exactly did America become a continental ghetto?\n\nIn his State of the State address last February, Maine\u2019s governor spoke of the drug epidemic. \u201cIt is tearing at the social fabric of our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile some are spending all their time trying to expand welfare, we are losing the war on drugs.\u201d He went on to say that \u201c927 drug-addicted babies were born last year in Maine. That\u2019s more than 7 percent of all births.\u201d\n\nThe governor is Paul LePage, a conservative Republican. He is the most controversial, colorful, and quotable governor in America. His political incorrectness is spectacular. The liberal press doesn\u2019t know whether to be outraged or amused. Politico ran a story titled \u201cHow Did Mild-Mannered Maine Get America\u2019s Craziest Governor?\u201d\n\n#ad#A long way from crazy, LePage knows many things. Poverty, for one. He was born in Lewiston in 1948. The family was French-speaking, and Paul was the first of 18 children. His father was a mill worker and a drunk. He beat the hell out of Paul, who escaped home at age eleven. He lived on the streets for two years. With the help of some caring and responsible adults, he rose.\n\nLePage has an advantage that few politicians do: You can\u2019t out-poor him. You can\u2019t lecture or guilt him on the subject of poverty. His tongue is amazingly free. He reminds me a little of black conservatives, talking to black audiences, and to white liberal audiences, for that matter. They have an invaluable freedom.\n\nIn his State of the State address, LePage said, \u201cThere is no excuse for able-bodied adults to spend a lifetime on welfare at the expense of hard-working, struggling Mainers. That is not what I call compassion.\u201d\n\nHe is trying to crack down on welfare abusers. He said, \u201cI will not tolerate the abuse of welfare benefits. Maine\u2019s limited resources must be reserved for the truly needy. . . . Every dollar that goes to buy cigarettes, alcohol, or lottery tickets is a dollar taken away from a needy child . . .\u201d\n\nAnd, \u201cIf you want to ask the taxpayers for money, you should make a good-faith effort to get a job first.\u201d\n\nSee what I mean?\n\nI think of the Rockefellers, some of whom went to poor states to have their careers: Winthrop became governor of Arkansas; Jay became a U.S. senator from West Virginia. If a Rockefeller tries to reform welfare, the headline may well read, \u201cRockefeller Snatches Bread from Urchin\u2019s Mouth.\u201d Try that with LePage: He is the urchin.\n\nLet me do some more quoting:\n\n\nI know generational poverty. But I escaped generational poverty, and lived the American Dream. Some caring Maine families took me in from the streets of Lewiston and gave me the guidance I needed to succeed.\n\nI have said it many times: Education saved my life. Throwing money at poverty will not end poverty. Education and mentoring will end poverty.\n\n\n#page#He is incredibly blunt about economics and the size of government, as he is about everything else. Have some more, from that State of the State address: \u201cHigher taxes and bloated government have not improved our lives. Higher energy costs have not attracted major investments to Maine. More welfare has not led to prosperity. It has not broken the cycle of generational poverty.\u201d\n\nA bit more: \u201cRecruiting job creators to come to Maine is not easy. The global competition is fierce. Investment capital goes where it is welcomed and stays where it is appreciated.\u201d\n\nThe street urchin sounds a lot like Mitt Romney, the rich kid.\n\nLePage quoted Churchill, to wit, \u201cSome people regard private enterprise as a predatory tiger to be shot. Others look on it as a cow they can milk. Not enough people see it as a healthy horse, pulling a sturdy wagon.\u201d\n\nHave some more bluntness, more essential LePage:\n\n\nLiberal politicians are taking us down a dangerous path \u2014 a path that is unsustainable. They want a massive expansion of Maine\u2019s welfare state. Expanded welfare does not break the cycle of generational poverty. It breaks the budget.\n\nIn 1935, during the height of the Great Depression, FDR \u2014 the father of the New Deal \u2014 warned against welfare dependency. He said, \u201cTo dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit. . . . The federal government must and shall quit this business of relief.\u201d\n\n\nYou know who used to quote this frequently? Reagan. It drove his Democratic critics crazy. He also quoted JFK, which also drove them crazy.\n\nIn his State of the State, LePage quoted JFK, too. On the subject of welfare, he whipped out, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you . . .\u201d That took nerve, I think.\n\n#ad#He also called for \u201cOpen for Business Zones,\u201d which remind me of Jack Kemp\u2019s \u201centerprise zones.\u201d (By the way, why isn\u2019t all of America, or most of America, an enterprise zone?) Said LePage, \u201cEmployees in these zones will not be forced to join labor unions. They will not be forced to pay dues or fees to labor unions. This will allow Maine to compete with right-to-work states.\u201d\n\nOne last chunk of that speech, or blast of bluntness:\n\n\nWe are working hard to combat Maine\u2019s reputation as a high-tax state. We passed the largest tax cut in Maine\u2019s history. Two-thirds of Maine taxpayers will get income-tax relief. Liberals call it a \u201ctax break for the rich.\u201d But 70,000 low-income Mainers will no longer pay income tax.\n\nWe cut taxes for the working poor. This is compassion.\n\n\nDespite some nice lines above, in that formal speech, LePage must be the least polished politician in America. He is what journalists call a \u201cgaffe machine.\u201d Thing is, he talks like a normal person \u2014 a normal Joe, who does not weigh every word before it comes out of his mouth. Sometimes, he is crude. So are people.\n\nA couple of years ago, he said that, under Obamacare, the IRS would be \u201cthe new Gestapo.\u201d A more polished or practiced politician would think this: Gee, I can\u2019t call it a Gestapo, because you cannot compare anything to Nazism, and I don\u2019t want to deal with the Anti-Defamation League and so on. But LePage? He wanted to describe something as a really bad police force \u2014 so he said \u201cGestapo,\u201d just like a normal person would. And landed in hot water.\n\nHe is also called a racist, as pretty much every conservative politician, and conservative person, is. He has this advantage: He and his wife took in a black teen from Jamaica, whom they regard as their adopted son. So the governor can tell his accusers to kiss his big white French butt.\n\nLePage won with a narrow plurality in 2010 \u2014 he got 38 percent. An independent candidate, Eliot Cutler, got 36 percent. The Democratic nominee, Libby Mitchell, was far behind with 19.\n\nThere is another gubernatorial race this year \u2014 another three-way, between LePage, Cutler, and the Democratic nominee, this time Mike Michaud, a congressman.\n\nWhat an interesting race. Consider the three personalities. LePage, you know: the Franco-American kid from the streets of Lewiston. Cutler could hardly be more different: a graduate of Harvard College and Georgetown Law; the founding partner of an important firm; a former aide to Ed Muskie; etc. Michaud is a working-class Franco-American who never went to college and belongs to the steelworkers union. And is openly gay.\n\nYes, an interesting race, in an interesting state. I\u2019ll continue this journal tomorrow, and wrap it up.
