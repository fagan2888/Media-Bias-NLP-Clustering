They agree on many things \u2014 except who to vote for. Could Washington take a lesson from these two friends who listen to each other with open minds?\n\nThey were both raised by New England liberals who make Barack Obama appear conservative. Their friendship blossomed in college, where they both were \"older\" students. Now the two women thrive in work usually dominated by men: money and cars. The lives of Susan-Anne Terzakis and Anna Hayes are separated by a few miles on the Granite State's famed Route 3, but even more so by an ideological divide. In November, one will vote Republican, the other Democratic. The two friends are, in many ways, like so many other women in New Hampshire, a proudly purple state that abides by its motto: \"Live Free Or Die.\" They are well aware that their state is the first in the nation to elect an all-female congressional delegation. The governor is also a woman, Maggie Hassan. As Terzakis put it: \"We are rockin' it in this state.\" Voices of New Hampshire women Rossina Moran Rossina Moran I don't care what language you talk, what music you like or what color you are.

Jeanne Shaheen Sarah Koski Sarah Koski (Democrats) assume all young women favor abortion.

Jeanne Shaheen six years ago and will again this time How women here cast their votes is key in the upcoming midterm elections, especially for Senate candidates Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic incumbent, and her Republican challenger Scott Brown, a former senator from neighboring Massachusetts who lost his seat in 2012 to a woman, Elizabeth Warren. The New Hampshire Senate race has tightened to the \"too-close-to-call\" category and could help determine whether Democrats maintain control of the upper chamber on the Hill. It's all come down to women in a state where women rule, literally. On a brisk fall day last week, I found conservative women at a pumpkin regatta on the Piscataquog River in Goffstown discussing their fears about America's borders. They're the so-called \"security moms\" Brown is courting, talking Ebola and ISIS and trying to make the vote a referendum on Obama and his foreign policy. About this series Women candidates, women voters and women's issues could decide which party controls the U.S. Senate next year. CNN travels to three battleground states \u2014 New Hampshire, West Virginia and Colorado \u2014 to explore the age-old question: What do women want? And not far away, at the University of New Hampshire's commuter campus in Manchester, female college students expressed shock at the idea that anyone in 2014 would oppose a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. They've watched Shaheen, a former New Hampshire governor, stand firm on women's issues and force Brown to publicly discuss abortion. Terzakis, 49, and Hayes, 33, agree on many philosophical questions. They view their mothers as role models. They worry for their children's future. Where they part ways is how to make government work best for the people, female and otherwise.\n\nTerzakis meets me on a dreary New England morning in the lobby of my hotel in Manchester. She is wearing a dress made of gray suit material, maroon patent leather pumps and a smile that can erase stress instantly. I'd found Terzakis through a women's business networking organization, and she introduced me to her \"liberal friend,\" Hayes. Though they'd both grown up in Democratic households, their outlooks diverged somewhere along their life journeys. Terzakis asks about my dinner the night before with Hayes, who'd spoken openly about how she overcame a long and destructive battle with bipolar disorder and alcohol. \"She didn't allow her circumstances to define her,\" Terzakis says of her friend. \"She stuck it out. She's not a quitter. I think that dynamic is incredible in women.\" Her remarks set the tone for our conversation. She makes herself comfortable in an armchair and says that Washington could learn a lesson or two from her relationship with Hayes. All that partisan bickering and allergy to compromise is ruining America. Though she disagrees with Obama \u2014 she'd like to tell him to do an all-systems halt and think about why Americans are screaming \u2014 she says he \"can't catch a break on golden wings.\" In her childhood, she recalls, politics was honorable. As a young woman, she idolized Tip O'Neill, the outspoken liberal speaker of the House from Massachusetts. \"He was a master in the art of the deal. He sat down and respectfully listened to you, she says. \"I've never defined a person by one note.\" All boats are lifted when a woman is empowered to own her own business. \u2014 Susan-Anne Terzakis, 49, of Bedford Executive director of a business coaching firm\n\nGrew up working in her parents' sandwich shop, where her mother steered the ship\n\nAdmired her mom's entrepreneurial spirit and believes empowerment comes from within\n\nCame from a family of uber-liberal Democrats but admired Ronald Reagan and has voted GOP since the mid-1980s\n\nShe's a fiscal conservative who has issues with candidates who are against abortion and gay marriage.\n\nBut it's all about compromise and moving forward one step at a time: \"You can't have everything you want all at once\"\n\nLiked the idea of the Affordable Care Act but hated the way it was \"rammed down our throats\"\n\nShe carries hairspray in her purse and calls herself an \" '80s chick\"\n\nWorries younger women don't appreciate how hard-fought their rights were That's why Terzakis, who considers herself a moderate, can support more socially conservative politicians like Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire's other senator for whom Terzakis worked briefly. Or congressional candidate Marilinda Garcia, a \"rising star in the Republican Party\" and a staunch foe of same-sex marriage and government funding for abortions. Those positions bother many Republican women in New Hampshire, who think like Terzakis. She describes herself as a Ronald Reagan-inspired fiscal conservative who believes in American exceptionalism. But the tea party, she says, is out of step with the nation. \"I am clearly pro-choice.\" And gay marriage? \"I think it's absolutely ridiculous that we are even having that conversation in 2014. It is a basic human right. You may disagree on religious grounds but that does not trump rights under the Constitution. \"Look, you can't have everything all at once,\" she says. \"I genuinely admire Senator Ayotte as a strong, tenable leader. I mean, the girl is getting it done!\" That's the way Terzakis operates. She wakes up before sunrise at her house in Bedford, a conservative town just west of Manchester teeming with suburban mansions and coiffed lawns. From her offices there and in Nashua, 20 minutes south on Route 3, Terzakis operates her own financial coaching firm, advising clients on small business strategies. She likes nothing more than to help a woman stand up her own company. \"All boats are lifted,\" she says, when a woman-owned business succeeds. Women, she believes, are more inclined to hire locally and give back to their own communities. \"It's an amazing dynamic.\" Terzakis carries a tomato-red Dooney & Bourke shoulder bag stocked with a matching wallet, business cards, Ray Bans and a 2.2 ounce can of L'Oreal Elnett Satin hairspray to tame her blond tresses. She makes it a point to leave her cell phone in the car when she's in a business meeting. Her clients' time is too valuable for her to interrupt it with calls. \"This pretty much sums Susan up,\" she says of herself, spilling the contents of her bag on a table. \"I can take on any meeting with this.\" She recognizes aerosol hairspray is not in vogue and without prompting says, \"Come on. I'm a chick from the \u201880s.\" It's Terzakis' libertarianism that repels her from Democrats. She acknowledges the role of the state in helping those in true need but too often, she says, social programs become economic crutches for people who could be working harder. \"I'm a huge advocate of personal responsibility,\" she says. \"You gotta get in the fight. It's tough to see women around you use abortion as a method of birth control. \"Sometimes life gets ahead of you. That's when government is at its best. But I think we really lose when we say, \u2018Don't try. We got you.' You stifle that burning desire to achieve.\" She actually liked the intent of Obama's Affordable Care Act, but when I mention Obamacare to her now, her head begins shaking before I've finished the question. \"Look, the system was broken, but I don't like how it was rammed down our throats,\" she says. \"Obama did a top-down implementation on a policy not truly embraced by the American people. It was contrary to the Granite State way of doing things.\" She heard one of Shaheen's town hall meetings on Obamacare and got even more turned off to her candidacy. Terzakis learned about hard work from her mother, Maureen, who ran the family-owned Ye Olde Sandwich Shop across from the historic Hawthorne Hotel in Salem, Massachusetts. Maureen was tapped by her Irish Catholic family to become a nun. She told her family to keep looking. From a tender age, Terzakis interacted with tourists from all over the world who visited the town that gained infamy for its witch trials. She waitressed, ran the cash register, bused tables at the restaurant. \"It was all hands on deck. It was a laboratory to see how stick-to-itness materialized,\" she says. At the dinner table, she was made to take responsibility for her opinions and actions. \"What my mom found most abhorrent was to be an accidental tourist in your own life. She was always questioning why.\" After college, Terzakis married Andrew, an Air Force officer. \"He was my first and only blind date. I still get butterflies when I see him.\" She looks back at her life through the lens of a military spouse \u2013 through all the places her husband's job took them. Hawaii, Arizona, Nebraska, New Mexico, Illinois, Virginia, Washington D.C. When she lived on Route 123 in Lorton, Virginia, she took her daughters \u2013 then in middle school \u2013 to a memorial honoring suffragettes at the local prison. In 1917, more than 70 women were jailed there, beaten and force-fed. It became a turning point in the struggle for women to gain the right to vote. She wanted Jessica, now 26, and Rachael, 24, to see the price women paid to give them the rights they have today. She thinks too many young women lose sight of the struggle. \"Our vote is less than a hundred years old,\" Terzakis says. \"I don't believe they understand my mom didn't have everything they do.\" Despite the gains made by women, Terzakis worries about what kind of future awaits her daughters. \"We had so many options,\" she says about her generation. \"It seems like our kids don't have that.\" So, who are the role models of today? Which women inspire her? Terzakis points to the cleaning woman vacuuming a rug in the hotel lobby. \"There's a lot of honor here in these women who show up every day and get it done.\"\n\nUnlike Terzakis, Hayes never abandoned her liberal roots, formed strongly in her upbringing in tiny Canterbury, about half an hour north of Manchester. The one dream I have to make happen is to become a mom. \u2014 Anna Hayes, 33, of Manchester Works at a Chevy dealership\n\nInspired by her mom, who made every sacrifice a true labor of love\n\nHer mother personifies feminism, she says, which is about equality, opportunity, voice and power\n\nStruggled with bipolar disorder for many years and finished college at an older age\n\nIs gay and lives with her partner; had her eggs frozen so she can have a baby one day\n\nBelieves in the importance of public assistance programs\n\nHas always voted for Democrats and will this time, too\n\nShe worries she won't be able to give to her children what her parents gave her\n\nSays it's important to have women in the halls of government because they think differently than men Her father was a doctor. As a child, Hayes made house calls with him, pretending to be his assistant. She wanted to become a cardiovascular surgeon, except she was no good at math. Her mother, Martha, was a nutritionist who for a while stayed at home to take care of Hayes and her younger brother. Later their mom became a teacher. \"Growing up, I looked up most to my father. He was the one everyone in town knew. He was more inspirational than my stay-at-home mom.\" Hayes played outdoors with her brother and with imaginary friends. She kept a journal and made up names for the children she hoped to have one day: Brianna, Michaela. They were always girls. When she was 11, she attended a Bill Clinton rally in Concord, the state capital, and felt a political energy that awakened her. She knew she could grow up to make a difference; that she was a part of something much larger. \"I haven't ever voted for a Republican candidate,\" she says. \"And probably never will.\" Hayes' troubles in life began as a teenager when she was diagnosed as bipolar. \"It changed how my family perceived me,\" she says. \"And I wasn't on board with counseling or medication.\" Instead she self-medicated with alcohol and sought out trouble. She enrolled at Hollins University in Virginia, an all-girls school. \"Subconsciously, it appealed to me,\" she says, though she did not acknowledge she was gay until many years later. But college didn't work out so well. She felt sick all the time and didn't take her medication. She flunked out, returned home to her support system and started working at a local Target. At 27, she found herself headed for the altar with a man. She broke off that relationship, came out to her family as a lesbian and aimed to get her life under control. A large part of that was getting back on her medications and finishing college.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "CNN", "title": "In New Hampshire, cut from same cloth but torn by politics", "og": {"url": "http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2014/10/politics/women-midterms/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141028132542-nh-women-friends-split-story-top.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "One is a \"chick from the '80s.\" The other is a lesbian in her 30s.
