The city\u2019s proposed $32 million remediation plan would have put a treatment plant in McDermott Park. As part of this plan, the city needed to run a lake water supply line under the northern part of WLA\u2019s property.\n\nWLA sent a letter to the city Feb. 8, 2005, saying they would grant an easement for the pipe. In return, they asked for a 30-year lease on about 1 acre of the park. They mentioned installing a chain link fence for their baseball diamond and also the right to extend their parking lot into the park.\n\nFond du Lac city council resolution No. 7702 adopted March 23, 2005, authorizes the \u201cproper city officials\u201d to execute a lease with WLA .\n\n(Resolution No. 7702 is the only document that the City of Fond du Lac has produced concerning this 2005 agreement. Public Works Director Jordan Skiff stated at the 27 July 2015 Advisory Parks Board meeting that they have searched the city files and cannot find a copy of this lease. The copy of the 2005 lease that was attached to the agenda came from WLA\u2019s files.)\n\nThe next day, the Fond du Lac Reporter had an article headlined \u201cCity Council grants easement for WLA baseball fence.\u201d This article on the council meeting says, \u201cThe school will receive a 30-year lease to build the fence, there are escape clauses for both parties, and no fees are involved.\u201d\n\nOne week after the resolution, the city human resources manager resigned amid accusations of inappropriate behavior. A month later, April 28, the city manager resigned. On May 25, 2005, the permanent utility easement is recorded on the WLA property at the Fond du Lac County Register of Deeds. The initial date of the lease is June 1, 2005.\n\nOn June 19 the following headline appears in The Reporter, \u201cResidents invited to attend McDermott Park meeting.\u201d The article begins, \u201cA concerned citizens group will hold a meeting Monday night to discuss the City of Fond du Lac\u2019s plans to build a new groundwater treatment facility in McDermott Park.\u201d\n\nOn the day after the meeting, June 21, The Reporter article is titled, \u201cWater pump station opposition may be too late.\u201d The article says \u201cabout 200 people attended the Monday meeting... city council President, Lindee Kimball,...said \u2018maybe this isn\u2019t a done deal.\u2019 Public Works Director Mark Lentz said in a phone interview after the meeting that the City Council is powerless to stop the current plans.\u201d\n\nOn June 23, The Reporter headline is, \u201cMore time sought after outcry over water project.\u201d\n\nOn July 1, The Reporter headline is: \u201cMcDermott park removed as site for water project.\u201d \u201cWe're going to look elsewhere,\u201d Public Works Director Mark Lentz said Thursday afternoon. When asked for the reason behind the decision, Lentz said simply, \u201cPublic outcry.\u201d\n\nThe citizens of Fond du Lac let their city council members know they did not want to lose McDermott Park to a water treatment plant and their elected representatives acted quickly. It didn\u2019t even take two weeks.\n\nWhat happened to the lease written with WLA in exchange for the easement? Thirty days after it was signed, the city no longer needed the easement over the WLA property. With 30 years to go on that lease, doesn\u2019t it seem reasonable that the two parties should have annulled the agreement?\n\nI am concerned that 10 years later, WLA is ready to execute the part of that poorly written lease that lets them put a parking lot in McDermott Park with the approval of only the director of public works.\n\nWhat should we do when we have a lease that should have been voided and torn up 10 years ago?\n\nThe city and WLA should void it now.\n\nMary B. Hayes is a resident of Fond du Lac.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1Jc2Isl", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "City, WLA should void lease", "og": {"site_name": "Action Reporter Media", "description": "City, WLA should void lease", "title": "City, WLA should void lease", "url": "http://www.fdlreporter.com/story/opinion/2015/08/22/city-wla-void-lease/32189001/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/fdlreporter.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "City, WLA should void lease", "title": "City, WLA should void lease", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a5cf7f7213064b85a9a44053fc4494a7f68ac919/c=35-0-223-188&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/22/WIGroup/FondduLac/635758287257098787-mcdermott.PNG", "creator": "@fdlreporter", "site": "@fdlreporter", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884281456", "fb": {"app_id": 175275349169565}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "7702 adopted March 23, 2005, authorizes the \u201cproper city officials\u201d to execute a lease with WLA .\nMcDermott Park (Photo: File)Do you wonder how Wisconsin Lutheran Academy came to have a lease with the city of Fond du Lac in 2005 for part of McDermott Park?\nThe copy of the 2005 lease that was attached to the agenda came from WLA\u2019s files.)\nWLA sent a letter to the city Feb. 8, 2005, saying they would grant an easement for the pipe.\nThe city and WLA should void it now."}
