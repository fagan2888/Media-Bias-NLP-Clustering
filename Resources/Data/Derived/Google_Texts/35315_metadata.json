Less hand-checking and physical play. All designed to speed up the game of men\u2019s college basketball, encourage scoring and make it more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe rule changes implemented this season were the most dramatic to hit the sport since the introduction of the 3-point arc, and they were accompanied by a seismic shift in how the game was to be officiated.\n\nBut the great irony has been this: Men\u2019s college basketball now looks very much like it did 20 years ago \u2014 an elegant, free-flowing game rather than a rough-and-tumble sport.\n\n\u201cThe rules changes are supposed to improve the game,\u201d Texas Tech coach Tubby Smith said, \u201cbut also give players more freedom to express themselves and play the game the way we wanted it played.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an entertainment field as well as an educational field,\u201d he added.\n\nThere\u2019s not much entertainment in a low-scoring, foul-filled game.\n\nField-goal percentages have been on the decline for years. Possessions too. Scoring dropped to 67 points on average last season, the lowest since the 1950s. Attendance plummeted right along with it, hurting the pocketbooks of many athletic departments.\n\nThat\u2019s why the NCAA men\u2019s basketball rules committee \u2014 made up of coaches, athletic directors, conference administrators and NCAA officials \u2014 brought about a slew of reforms this season. Most notable was changing the shot clock for the first time since before the 1993-94 season, when it went from 45 seconds to 35 seconds. It\u2019s now 30 seconds. The committee also expanded the restricted area in the paint, and eliminated one timeout by each team in the second half to help plodding games to a conclusion. Six weeks into the season, the changes seem to have worked.\n\nScoring has increased by more than six points per team for each game, while teams have gotten about four more possessions and taken nearly five more field-goal attempts. According to the NCAA, about 75 percent of those additional points have been due to improved pace of play.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Men\u2019s college basketball rule changes make game more aesthetically pleasing", "title": "Men\u2019s college basketball rule changes make game more aesthetically pleasing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/25/mens-college-basketball-rule-changes-make-game-more-aesthetically-pleasing/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__2da1644dc7b586398b0f6a7067006afdp1.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151225__2da1644dc7b586398b0f6a7067006afdp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-25T18:02:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:25:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "All designed to speed up the game of men\u2019s college basketball, encourage scoring and make it more aesthetically pleasing.\nThat\u2019s why the NCAA men\u2019s basketball rules committee \u2014 made up of coaches, athletic directors, conference administrators and NCAA officials \u2014 brought about a slew of reforms this season.\nBut the great irony has been this: Men\u2019s college basketball now looks very much like it did 20 years ago \u2014 an elegant, free-flowing game rather than a rough-and-tumble sport.\nAccording to the NCAA, about 75 percent of those additional points have been due to improved pace of play.\nScoring has increased by more than six points per team for each game, while teams have gotten about four more possessions and taken nearly five more field-goal attempts."}
