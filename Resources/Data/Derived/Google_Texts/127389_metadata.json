Amass over 20 million fans across various platforms, have an audience with Barack Obama, and appear on the cover of a major magazine and still leave most of the country hearing your name and wondering, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\n\nBut with YouTube supernova Tyler Oakley leading the way\u2014his luminescent shock of white-gold hair and megawatt Cheshire Cat grin surely the guiding lights\u2014#TeamInternet, as he affectionately calls his peers and their loyal fans, is steadily marching towards legitimacy.\n\n\n\nThe 26-year-old openly gay Michigan native posted his first video on YouTube eight years ago, an awkwardly shot greeting card meant for just his close friends that accidentally amassed around 100 views. Now, he may be the first person to have screamed, \u201cYaaas queen!\u201d at Michelle Obama while interviewing her with blue hair.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I started doing it in 2007, nobody had a million views,\u201d he tells The Daily Beast, rambunctious after a flight back home from Australia, where he concluded the international leg of his Slumber Party tour, on which he meets fans and chats with them while everyone wears pajamas. \u201cThe most subscribed person I remember when I first started might have had 40,000 subscribers or something. Now you can really be in charge of your own trajectory.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor Oakley, that means an unexpected career as the gay BFF of millions of hashtag-wielding Internet fiends, the majority of whom might be found beaming with their glistening orthodontics at the two \u201cvlogs\u201d\u2014video blogs\u2014Oakley posts each week. It\u2019s a following that\u2019s led to Oakley being named one of TIME\u2019s Most Influential People on the Internet and described by OUT magazine as the leader of \u201cThe Cult of Oversharing.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith his name garnering a bit of media omnipresence and Oakley himself appearing on traditional TV outlets and even as a guest on Ellen\u2014Oakley refers to DeGeneres as \u201cmy queen and also my doppelganger and we are twinsies for life\u201d\u2014it\u2019s hard to shake a feeling that #TeamInternet is on the cusp of a mainstream crossover.\n\n\n\nCertainly an indication of this is this year's Streamy Awards, which recognizes excellences in online video and is in its fifth year. This year\u2019s lineup is the best example yet of the marriage between this community of online stars and old-school Hollywood entities, with names like James Franco, Weird Al Yankovic, and James Van Der Beek joining Oakley and his Internet famous brethren as nominees.\n\n\n\nFor the first time, the awards will be broadcast on actual television, with its telecast airing Thursday night on VH1, a curious case of online awards airing on actual TV. Oakley, who won Entertainer of the Year at last year\u2019s ceremony, will co-host the proceedings with fellow YouTube-to-mainstream crossover success Grace Helbig.\n\n\n\nAnd the timing of the awards is certainly noteworthy, too, taking place just days before the 2015 Emmy Awards, which honors more traditional television entertainers. Are we on the verge of an old vs. new turf war?\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s been pretty evident for a while now how traditional [media] has wanted to go a little digital and digital has wanted to go a little bit traditional,\u201d Oakley says about the awards shows\u2019 timing. \u201cI think we\u2019re all meeting in the middle. The lines are getting blurred, and the fact that the Streamys are on TV this year shows how much that audience is there.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a pure numbers game, it should make total sense that the Streamys are getting a telecast as legitimate as the Emmy Awards. Oakley alone has over 7.5 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, which is multiple times the average viewership for most of the shows that are nominated for Emmys. Mad Men averaged just 2 million viewers in its last season, for example.\n\n\n\nIn an entertainment industry fraught over the splintering of viewers and declining ratings, #TeamInternet has an astronomical reach.\n\n\n\nBut numbers don\u2019t always add up to credibility. (Donald Trump is leading the GOP polls, after all.) Despite his millions of followers, sphere of influence, and validation in various business pursuits\u2014Oakley has a book, Binge, set to be released next month and turned his predilection for Taco Bell into a legit business relationship\u2014there are still hurdles to jump before he\u2019s taken seriously, at least in some circles.\n\n\n\nPerhaps a modicum of skepticism from \u201ctraditionals,\u201d as Oakley refers to those who are dubious of the influence of digital media stars, is justifiable when one considers how hard it is to really describe what exactly he and hordes of YouTube personalities like him do for a living.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s a self-described \u201cprofessional fangirl,\u201d with many of his vlogs dedicated to quick-witted and ebullient gushing over his favorite celebrities, chiefly Darren Criss and One Direction. You know when your mom says things like, \u201cWhy would I join Twitter? I don\u2019t need people to know what I ate for dinner.\u201d Oakley\u2019s YouTube channel is, in some respects, just like that.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s mastered the art of the confessional, and figured out the power of authenticity and dialogue. Oakley\u2019s videos alternate between breathless recaps of his week and Q&As with his followers about everything from whether he will see a movie coming out the next weekend to what age he was when he lost his virginity\u2014he was 18 and it was on St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\n\n\n\nBasically, it\u2019s just giddy talking, but with a candor, accessibility, and sunniness that vacillates wildly between silly and serious with nimble ease. It\u2019s a quality that online communities clearly crave from role models and weren\u2019t getting from the PR-controlled TV and movie stars who stand on glamorous pedestals. It may be all the more powerful coming from Oakley, a person who is unabashed and unapologetic about his gayness.\n\n\n\nSure, it\u2019s nice to have the Tiger Beat poster pulled out of the magazine and plastered onto your wall, but it\u2019s even better when the person on the poster will talk to you\u2014like, directly to you and share, or at least be willing to talk about, all of your concerns.\n\n\n\nIn a video uploaded just last week, Oakley posits, \u201cme being me may have even helped some of you guys be you.\u201d It\u2019s almost insufferably cheesy, were it not completely accurate. (Again, this guy has an international tour to prove this.)\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an influence he takes seriously, too, having parlayed his YouTube influence into advocacy for the Trevor Project, not just speaking on behalf of the organization, which fights bullying and prevents suicide of LGBTQ teens, but often fundraising for it through his channels. Two years in a row, he raised $500,000 for the organization.\n\n\n\n\u201cI understand that with the audience comes a sense of responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m there to entertain, I also want to make sure I\u2019m using my opportunity in the best way possible. Because although I don\u2019t have an obligation, necessarily, I feel like it would be a missed opportunity if I didn\u2019t try using it for good.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s especially true when it comes to young gay people. He thinks about being from a small town now versus when he was growing up and coming out. There may have been no opportunity to seek guidance from an openly gay person then. \u201cNowadays if somebody in America is feeling alone and wants to find a coming out story, they just search \u2018coming out\u2019 and they\u2019ll find millions of first-person examples of people telling their story,\u201d Oakley\u2019s included.\n\n\n\nIf it sounds a little bit like teenage self-help, it might be just that. The swift rise of Oakley\u2019s YouTube channel\u2014and his fame and sponsorship deals (watch how seamlessly he weaves product integration into his videos)\u2014might be simply because teenagers are rabid for self-help, or at least affirmation or acceptance, and thrilled to have found easy access to it on the smartphones their thumbs never leave.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think social media has amplified a lot of voices that maybe traditional media hasn\u2019t perfectly portrayed,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nFurther proof of this community\u2019s influence on the culture at large\u2014not just the thriving online community that turned these personalities into stars\u2014is the conversations the content created by these people are starting.\n\n\n\nThere certainly was evidence of that with the response to Oakley\u2019s \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d video, but it\u2019s never been more evident than with the current firestorm surrounding YouTube comedian Nicole Arbour, whose \u201cDear Fat People\u201d video has been criticized for its aggressive fat shaming.\n\n(Sample line: \u201cI don\u2019t feel bad for you because you are taking your body for granted\u2026What are you going to do, fat people? What are you going to do? You going to chase me? I can get away from you by walking at a reasonable pace.\u201d)\n\n\n\nArbour has since defended the video, which seems a cardinal sin according to the Bible of positivity and anti-bullying that #TeamInternet seems to worship and live by. Oakley himself had just spoken about his own past eating disorder to Seventeen magazine when Arbour\u2019s video was published.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs somebody who has gone through body image issues and who has been pretty vocal about all that and trying to amplify voices in other communities going through that, it\u2019s disheartening that somebody could make content like that and deny responsibility,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel like everybody, whether you have one follower or a million followers, has an opportunity to either positively or negatively affect people,\u201d he goes on. \u201cI\u2019m the first to appreciate and accept growth, if that were to come from that creator, but from what I\u2019ve seen I haven\u2019t seen anything like that. But it can take time. Not everyone is born with a sociology degree. It\u2019s just disappointing sometimes when people who have a lot of influence are a little bit resistant to growth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt seems appropriate, particularly with the Streamy Awards\u2014basically the online Oscars\u2014approaching, that Oakley, the event\u2019s co-host is speaking a sort of State of the Union on all issues related to YouTube.\n\n\n\nThe medium is a red-hot conflagration kindled by all the ambitions that seem to drive young people today: confession, community, candor, self-branding, and self-marketing. It\u2019s selfishness and selflessness rubbing together like sticks: I going to make money by just being me; also, I\u2019m going to help people. And if the community is generating heat, Oakley is the star that is most on fire.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama seemed to have gotten the smoke signals. He invited Oakley to the White House as part of a group of YouTube influencers he hoped would help his administration get more young Americans signed up for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nBut more visibility breeds even more criticism, as Oakley has learned throughout his ascent (he says he\u2019s been accused of \u201cacting gay and putting on a lisp\u201d for views), and so his White House visit brought even more scrutiny to the idea that he should be taken seriously.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo me it was like, oh my god, the most powerful person in the world cares about me and my peers and what we do and how we connect with our audiences and is wanting to learn from us? It boggled my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a cool moment, but even then people were like, \u2018Why is he wasting his time with YouTube blah blah blah?\u2019 Whatever the success might be, there will always be people that don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\n\n\nThursday night\u2019s Streamy Awards then, in which Oakley is not just hosting, but hoping to repeat his Entertainer of the Year then, is one more crucial step in that direction.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "kpfallon"}, "keywords": "Entertainment-Celebrity, entertainment, YouTube Inc", "publicationDate": 201509171904, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "description": "The YouTube phenom talks the Streamy Awards, the reaction to the controversial \u2018Dear Fat People\u2019 video, and #TeamInternet\u2019s struggle for credibility in the mainstream world.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "It Is Time to Take YouTubes Tyler Oakley Seriously", "tags": "article:entertainment-celebrity,topic:entertainment,entity:company/youtube_inc", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"It Is Time to Take YouTube\u2019s Tyler Oakley Seriously\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/17/it-is-time-to-take-youtube-s-tyler-oakley-seriously.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/17/it-is-time-to-take-youtube-s-tyler-oakley-seriously/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48083957.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/17/it-is-time-to-take-youtube-s-tyler-oakley-seriously\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-09-17T19:04:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"author\":\"Kevin Fallon\",\"tags\":[\"entertainment-celebrity\",\"entertainment\",\"youtube_inc\"]}", "news_keywords": "EntertainmentCelebrity, Entertainment, YouTube Inc", "sectionTaxanomies": "entertainment", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Kevin Fallon", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2015-09-17T19:04:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/kevin-fallonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/17/it-is-time-to-take-youtube-s-tyler-oakley-seriously", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The YouTube phenom talks the Streamy Awards, the reaction to the controversial \u2018Dear Fat People\u2019 video, and #TeamInternet\u2019s struggle for credibility in the mainstream world.", "title": "It Is Time to Take YouTube\u2019s Tyler Oakley Seriously", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/17/it-is-time-to-take-youtube-s-tyler-oakley-seriously.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/09/17/it-is-time-to-take-youtube-s-tyler-oakley-seriously/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1442518739224.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/k/kevin-fallon", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9954\"", "article_summary": "I don\u2019t need people to know what I ate for dinner.\u201d Oakley\u2019s YouTube channel is, in some respects, just like that.\nCertainly an indication of this is this year's Streamy Awards, which recognizes excellences in online video and is in its fifth year.\nIt may be all the more powerful coming from Oakley, a person who is unabashed and unapologetic about his gayness.\nFor the first time, the awards will be broadcast on actual television, with its telecast airing Thursday night on VH1, a curious case of online awards airing on actual TV.\nOakley, who won Entertainer of the Year at last year\u2019s ceremony, will co-host the proceedings with fellow YouTube-to-mainstream crossover success Grace Helbig."}
