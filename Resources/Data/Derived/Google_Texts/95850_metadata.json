The former co-founder of Southport Lane Management \u2014 he resigned from the firm in early 2014 \u2014 attended a December 2012 holiday reception at the Governor\u2019s Mansion Complex in Columbia, where he was photographed with Gov. Nikki Haley. He came as the guest of an invitee. \u201cMr. Burns never requested assistance with any insurance matters from the administration,\u201d Haley spokesman Rob Godfrey said in a statement Friday. Burns also held a fundraiser for Haley at his New York office on Sept. 24, 2013, to support her re-election campaign. The event raised $26,500. The figure was reported last weekend by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThere was no state business discussed or asked of the governor or her team,\u201d Godfrey said. Ray Farmer, director of the S.C. Department of Insurance, said he thinks he met Burns once, shortly after Haley appointed Farmer to run the state agency in November 2012. \u201cIt was a conversation of no more than five minutes,\u201d Farmer said Thursday. \u201cIt was a meet-and-greet.\u201d\n\nBlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina has fired an aggressive legal volley to recover perhaps tens of millions of dollars a subsidiary lost in a disastrous series of investments. The money evaporated over the past two years in deals involving a New York firm that\u2019s now on life support.\n\nBlueCross filed court papers on behalf of its former Companion Property & Casualty Insurance unit about a week ago. The Columbia-based company unloaded that division in January, but it retained the rights to sue the only deep pockets left in the dispute. The complaint alleges US Bank NA shirked its fiduciary duties by allowing high-grade bonds and other Companion holdings valued at nearly $180 million to be swapped out for a hodgepodge of mostly obscure investments that have been found to be either difficult to value or entirely worthless.\n\nAmong the questionable investments: a biblical painting.\n\nThe case also involves New York\u2019s Southport Lane Management, a foundering private equity firm that was led by Alexander Chatfield Burns until early last year. That company\u2019s dealings and financial troubles were detailed in a front-page article last weekend in The Wall Street Journal. Burns, 28, now lives in downtown Charleston. Efforts to reach him at his apartment building off King Street last week were unsuccessful. He and his former company are not named in the BlueCross lawsuit.\n\nFormed in 2010, Southport invested in insurance companies. Its businesses included a pair of entities that established a \u201cfronting\u201d relationship with BlueCross in late 2012. Under that deal, Southport-owned Redwood Reinsurance and Dallas National Insurance were paid a fee to take on some of the risk from Companion\u2019s policies. New accounts were set up to hold stocks, bonds and other liquid investments that could be quickly sold to pay claims and other obligations in the event Redwood or Dallas National ever became insolvent.\n\nUS Bank was the trustee, sort of a third-party referee. In that role, it was responsible for ensuring any assets Redwood and Dallas National bought, sold or otherwise transferred in the accounts were of \u201ccomparable value,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Also, Companion said US Bank was required to provide accurate monthly statements showing the fair-market value of the investments.\n\nBy last March, the holdings either were \u201cworth far less\u201d than reported or appeared \u201cto have little or no value,\u201d the BlueCross subsidiary said in the lawsuit. Its lawyers are alleging US Bank was negligent for allowing the accounts, including \u201creputable\u201d bonds and stocks, to \u201cbe depleted.\u201d The original $84 million cash contribution is down to $369,000,\n\nAbout $86 million in assets were transferred into a handful of obscure businesses, with names like Vapor Holdings, Termite Offshore Services and Xtreme Gas & Oil, now known as Massive Interactive, court records show. Companion money also was put into a fund known as Destra that claims to own, among other assets, the rights to a painting by 16th-century Italian master Michelangelo Caravaggio called \u201cDavid in the Act of Picking up Goliath\u2019s Severed Head.\u201d Both the authenticity and value of the purported work are in question.\n\nBurns and Southport Lane aren\u2019t named as defendants in the BlueCross complaint. Nor is Redwood or Dallas National. The latter, renamed Freestone Insurance, failed last year and is being liquidated.\n\nBlueCross didn\u2019t specify how much it\u2019s hoping to recover from US Bank. It\u2019s seeking actual, punitive and triple damages. Spokeswoman Patti Embry-Tautenham said in a statement that the company is \u201ctaking all necessary steps to protect our rights in this matter.\u201d\n\nUS Bank did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWilliam B. Kerr, Burns\u2019 attorney, said in a statement that his client \u201chas no involvement\u201d in the lawsuit \u201cand as a result, we do not think it appropriate for him to speculate upon what another party may or may not have done.\u201d\n\nA Bermuda company bought Companion on Jan. 27 and renamed it Sussex Insurance last month. The Wall Street Journal, citing financial filings it obtained, said the ex-BlueCross unit reported a $113 million loss before it was sold.\n\nRay Farmer, director of the S.C. Department of Insurance, said the red ink never threatened the solvency of either Companion or its now-former owner.\n\n\u201cThat was never in question,\u201d he said.\n\nContact John McDermott at 937-5572.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "South Carolina\u2019s BlueCross licks wounds from deal with a Charleston connection, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The state\u2019s largest health insurer is licking its wounds from a costly financial mishap.", "title": "South Carolina\u2019s BlueCross licks wounds from deal with a Charleston connection", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150329/150329390/south-carolina-x2019-s-bluecross-licks-wounds-from-deal-with-a-charleston-connection", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150329/PC05/150329390/AR/0/AR-150329390.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150329/PC05/150329390/AR/0/AR-150329390.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The state\u2019s largest health insurer is licking its wounds from a costly financial mishap.", "title": "South Carolina\u2019s BlueCross licks wounds from deal with a Charleston connection", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150329/PC05/150329390/AR/0/AR-150329390.jpg?201503290919", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150329390}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "South Carolina\u2019s BlueCross licks wounds from deal with a Charleston connection , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-29T08:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-03-29T09:19:00Z", "author": "John McDermott"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The state\u2019s largest health insurer is licking its wounds from a costly financial mishap."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1055\"", "article_summary": "Under that deal, Southport-owned Redwood Reinsurance and Dallas National Insurance were paid a fee to take on some of the risk from Companion\u2019s policies.\nBlueCross filed court papers on behalf of its former Companion Property & Casualty Insurance unit about a week ago.\nBurns never requested assistance with any insurance matters from the administration,\u201d Haley spokesman Rob Godfrey said in a statement Friday.\nMeet and greet Alexander Chatfield Burns is a recent South Carolina resident, but he\u2019s already met the state\u2019s chief executive at least twice.\nAlso, Companion said US Bank was required to provide accurate monthly statements showing the fair-market value of the investments."}
