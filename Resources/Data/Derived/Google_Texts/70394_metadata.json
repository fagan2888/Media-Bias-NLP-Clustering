That doorway. Next to this parking garage. Dozing against those trees.\n\n\u201cI always tell people that I\u2019m without a home, but that I\u2019m not homeless,\u201d said Alex, 22, who asked that his last name not be used. \u201cHomeless people are the ones who give up.\u201d\n\nAlex said he hasn\u2019t. But as Bay Area counties report the results of their most recent homeless counts, which for the first time were required by the federal government to focus on identifying young people, a worrisome trend has become apparent: the troubling number of homeless under age 25.\n\nThe census found that 17 percent of the total homeless population in Santa Clara County, Calif., now consists of young adults and unaccompanied minors. Advocates on the front lines say that\u2019s no surprise considering the brutally high jobless rate among young people \u2014 a key contributor to this largely unrecognized problem.\n\nTheir fear is today\u2019s youthful, still-optimistic street denizens will spiral into tomorrow\u2019s chronically homeless who become a drain on social services for decades to come.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing danger that this could become a lost generation,\u201d said Sparky Harlan, CEO of the Bill Wilson Center in Santa Clara. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a whole generation of young people who just don\u2019t get off life\u2019s launching pad.\u201d\n\nUntil this year, knowing just how many are stalled has been based mostly on anecdotal estimates and scattered statistics about trends in youth homelessness. The educated guess of the National Alliance to End Homelessness is that 550,000 young people nationally go without shelter for longer than one week each year.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to count people who tend to be invisible. Young people avoid encampments and traditional shelters. They \u201ccouch-surf\u201d with friends, sleep in cars, shower at schools. They are so adept at blending in that the California Homeless Youth Project titled a recent report \u201cHidden in Plain Sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dirtiest person in the park might go home to his house, and the cleanest person with the widest smile will have to crash in a sleeping bag,\u201d said Nathaniel, 23, a Redwood City native who did not want his full name used. \u201cThat was me. You just never know who is homeless.\u201d\n\nService-providers say the ranks of young homeless are growing due to a confluence of factors including a lack of jobs, poor funding for programs targeted at youths, and a broken foster-care system.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most of the public understands just how many young people are out there on the streets,\u201d said Bailey DeCarlo, 24, of San Jose, who was homeless for five years. \u201cIf you have a home, a family that cares about you, a job, you don\u2019t see it. But the last 10 years have been hard on young people. Just finding a job or going to school is difficult.\u201d\n\nSo is keeping a roof over your head. For Alex, and Nathaniel, there was no space at home with large families.\n\n\u201cI was going from the floor to the couch because there wasn\u2019t a lot of room,\u201d said Alex, one of four kids. \u201cIt was just too crowded, and I felt like I overstayed my welcome.\u201d\n\nOakland\u2019s Jarad Andrews and Lovelle, a San Jose native who asked that his last name not be used, had no place to go after aging out of regular foster care at 18. A favorite sleeping spot for Lovelle was an out-of-the-way spot between a wall and escalator inside the San Jose Convention Center.\n\nDeCarlo lost both her parents at a young age, yet still considers herself \u201cone of the lucky ones\u201d because she had friends who let her use their couches and made sure she was eating.\n\n\u201cBut I was on the streets part of the time, and that was scary because if you\u2019re a single white female, you always have to be worried about being victimized,\u201d said DeCarlo, who has lived with her grandmother for about five months. \u201cSometimes I would ride the VTA 22 bus all night long. Most homeless people just call it the Hotel 22. I would ride from Palo Alto, get off at Eastridge Mall for 10 minutes or so, and get on a bus heading back.\u201d\n\nAndrews, 21, is blunt about what it\u2019s like to be homeless.\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d said Andrews, who lived in a shelter and occasionally slept in a parking lot and train station before being helped into an apartment by the Oakland-based First Place for Youth. \u201cHaving to be outside all the time, nobody wants to live like that.\u201d\n\nAndrews, like all the young people interviewed for this story, somehow has maintained a relatively positive outlook on life. None believes he or she is destined for a future on the streets.\n\n\u201cMost don\u2019t even think of themselves as homeless,\u201d said Deanne Pearn, co-founder of First Place for Youth. \u201cThey\u2019re just hanging out. It hasn\u2019t sunk in yet. They don\u2019t identify with adult homeless. It\u2019s almost like they are too early in their homeless career, if you want to call it that.\u201d\n\nThe struggling economy has hit young people particularly hard. According to KIDS COUNT, a 2012 report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, nearly 6.5 million \u201cdisconnected youth\u201d between ages 16 and 24 are not in school or the workforce nationally, with 850,000 in California alone. Also, Generation Opportunity, a nonpartisan youth-advocacy group, estimates the unemployment rate for people ages 18 to 29 \u2014 when you include those no longer looking for work \u2014 is at 16 percent.\n\nFor young people without a safety net, the result can be homelessness. That\u2019s what a sampling of California counties found in the biennial homeless counts for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nWhile some counties previously counted 18-to-24-year-olds separately, HUD for the first time required all communities to break the group out in this year\u2019s census, which took place in January.\n\nIn Santa Clara County, 1,266 unaccompanied minors and young adults younger than 25 were identified \u2014 a rise from 762 two years earlier. In San Francisco County, 914 were counted. The number in Contra Costa County was much lower at 201, but even that was a jump from just 44 people in 2011.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, 4,863 young people were counted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a disproportionate number of kids in all the communities that we survey,\u201d said Peter Connery of Applied Survey Research, which oversaw this year\u2019s assessment in Santa Clara County and eight other California counties. \u201cIn some communities it\u2019s more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nEven those numbers likely underestimate the problem because HUD doesn\u2019t consider someone who is crashing with friends as homeless. But the long-term financial consequences could be devastating, said Dennis Culhane, a professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHe cites a historical precedent. Researchers have noted a large group of chronically homeless who were born between 1955 and 1965. They were young adults during bad economies and never found a toehold in the job market.\n\nIn addition to the personal toll, Culhane said, that older generation probably has led to \u201ctens of billions of dollars in terms of social costs over the years. Now, we have all of the same conditions playing out again due to the Great Recession. This is biggest issue in homelessness today. We just don\u2019t want to repeat that mistake.\u201d\n\nIt also would be a mistake to typecast young homeless as problem kids, said Nan Roman, president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.\n\n\u201cSo often we think they\u2019re homeless because of behavioral issues or they got in trouble with the law,\u201d Roman said. \u201cOften there are behavioral issues, but it\u2019s because they\u2019re upset that their family has just blown up. They were living with mom and then they lost their house and all the kids were just dumped out into the world.\u201d\n\nIf there is one positive sign in an otherwise gloomy picture, advocates say, it\u2019s that homelessness usually is temporary for young people. The Bill Wilson Center said 87 percent the young people who stay at its youth shelter eventually leave the streets.\n\nAn example of a potential success story is Nathaniel, who was homeless about five years and has just moved into an apartment with the center\u2019s help and is working at Walmart.\n\n\u201cIt just clicked for me one day that I didn\u2019t want to live like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI had always thought of myself as being young, living life, having fun. It was like never-never land and I was Peter Pan. But then I realized: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m 22.\u2019 I\u2019ve seen the hardship that older homeless are going through, and I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nThe prospects will be grim for those young people who remain homeless, Connery said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad when you have so many youth getting such a lousy start in life because we\u2019ve learned that the more time you spend on the streets, the worse everything becomes,\u201d he said. \u201cYour health goes down. Your mental health goes down. The chances of becoming a victim of crime goes up. You can\u2019t get a job. Everything just gets worse.\u201d\n\nAlex, who said he has slept all over San Jose, is determined that won\u2019t be his fate. He\u2019s working two jobs and is in a 90-day housing program with EHC LifeBuilders, and he sees it leading to a permanent home.\n\n\u201cI guess I could end up in an encampment if I\u2019m forced to one,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I hope not.\u201d\n\nFollow Mark Emmons at Twitter.com/markedwinemmons.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fears of another \u2018lost generation\u2019: Youth homeless numbers rising", "title": "Fears of another \u2018lost generation\u2019: Youth homeless numbers rising", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/13/fears-of-another-lost-generation-youth-homeless-numbers-rising/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__bc4dbb9e-2954-4eb5-ad29-d94ccc15b731lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 395}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__bc4dbb9e-2954-4eb5-ad29-d94ccc15b731lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-13T12:08:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:08:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdade4\"", "article_summary": "Everything just gets worse.\u201dAlex, who said he has slept all over San Jose, is determined that won\u2019t be his fate.\nA favorite sleeping spot for Lovelle was an out-of-the-way spot between a wall and escalator inside the San Jose Convention Center.\n\u201cMost don\u2019t even think of themselves as homeless,\u201d said Deanne Pearn, co-founder of First Place for Youth.\nThe Bill Wilson Center said 87 percent the young people who stay at its youth shelter eventually leave the streets.\nThe census found that 17 percent of the total homeless population in Santa Clara County, Calif., now consists of young adults and unaccompanied minors."}
