The first ObamaCare requests for 2017 premium hikes are now being filed and the initial news looks bad — at least in Virginia.

Anthem (ANTM) HealthKeepers, one of the biggest players in the state’s individual market, is seeking an average 15.8% rate hike for a projected 190,000 members, both on and off the exchange.

Anthem cited medical inflation, increased utilization, new specialty drugs for Hepatitis C; and the expiration of ObamaCare’s reinsurance program that covers a portion of claims for the costliest patients.

Innovation Health, a partnership in Virginia 50% owned by Aetna (AET), is seeking a 16.6% rate increase for 61,000 members.

UnitedHealth (UNH), which has dropped out of Arkansas and Georgia, is at least keeping its options open in Virginia. It submitted a filing requesting a 9.4% rate increase for its 6,900 members, according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.

Overall, the average weighted premium-hike request appears to be 17.9%, says Charles Gaba of ACASignups.

The rate increases may turn out to be quite small for those who qualify for subsidies. The average premium hike for the subsidized population was just 4% in 2016, the Obama administration said on Tuesday.

Consumers may be able to switch to cheaper plans, which might also hold down their premium increases. But all of the carriers except for UnitedHealth appear to be seeking double-digit increases in Virginia. A couple of carriers with a combined 40,000 customers, CareFirst BlueChoice and Optima Health, are seeking rate increases in excess of 30%.
