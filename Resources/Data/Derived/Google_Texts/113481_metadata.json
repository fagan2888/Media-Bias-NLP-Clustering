The online version is updated monthly, and the twice-yearly print edition compiles the staff\u2019s best work.\n\nFields saw a need for a publication like this one last spring, he said: \u201cI was reading an article from Stanford\u2019s political review, and I realized that we (Boston University) didn\u2019t have anything like that,\u201d he said.\n\nSo, he said, he came up with a business plan and obtained funding for the project through the university\u2019s Allocations Board and student government. He and the rest of the staff volunteer their time, he said.\n\nRecent articles explore more Supreme Court scrutiny for the Affordable Care Act, the current state of voting rights, and Fields\u2019 own take on the 2016 elections, \u201cThe Presidential Horse Race.\u201d\n\nFields said he is learning to be a manager as he goes, which seems to be his style: His years on the Mock Trial team at Redlands High gave him a good look at how groups work together toward a goal, he said, and he built on that experience last summer as an assistant manager for the primary campaign of Assemblyman Marc Steinorth, R-Rancho Cucamonga.\n\n\u201cTyler was a valued member of Team Steinorth,\u201d said staffer Heather Rouhana, who supervised Fields\u2019 work during the campaign. \u201cWe were very lucky to have a team of energetic, hard working young people who were instrumental in securing Assemblyman Steinorth\u2019s victory.\u201d\n\nHaving worked on the political campaign, Fields said, is helpful to him now\u2014the experience enhanced his people-management skills.\n\nAbout four months into creation of a forum for a variety of issues, voices and political outlooks, Fields said he and his staff are working very hard\u2014but it\u2019s satisfying and useful work in light of his career goals, which include public service, specifically in politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe publish work by anarchists, regular conservatives, liberals, socialists and more,\u201d Fields said. \u201cPitting these different political pieces against each other has opened dialogue\u2014 it\u2019s a lively debate, and that\u2019s what we like.\u201d\n\nFields, the son of Jerry and Staci Fields, is at home in Redlands on winter break. He said he enjoys keeping up with his Redlands High teachers, and has been known to drop in on the Mock Trial team.\n\nThe passage of time is on his mind, he said. The Boston Political Review is still a new publication, but he is not getting any younger. He\u2019ll be graduating in 2016, and wants to leave the Review in good hands.\n\n\u201cThe sustainability of the publication is important,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking about who we have on the staff, and how we can maintain our momentum as we go through changes every year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He never wrote for Redlands High School\u2019s paper, or laid out pages for the yearbook, or contributed to the literary magazine, but two and a half years after graduation Tyler Fields is editor in chief and publisher\u2014and founder\u2014of T", "title": "Tyler Fields, Redlands High School alumnus, starts political publication at Boston University", "og": {"url": "http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/social-affairs/20141218/tyler-fields-redlands-high-school-alumnus-starts-political-publication-at-boston-university", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.redlandsdailyfacts.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/redlandsdailyfacts_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Tyler Fields, Redlands High School alumnus, starts political publication at Boston University"}, "twitter": {"domain": "redlandsdailyfacts.com", "description": "He never wrote for Redlands High School\u2019s paper, or laid out pages for the yearbook, or contributed to the literary magazine, but two and a half years after graduation Tyler Fields is editor in chief and publisher\u2014and founder\u2014of T", "title": "Tyler Fields, Redlands High School alumnus, starts political publication at Boston University", "url": "http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/social-affairs/20141218/tyler-fields-redlands-high-school-alumnus-starts-political-publication-at-boston-university", "image": {"src": "http://local.redlandsdailyfacts.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/redlandsdailyfacts.png?052016"}, "site": "@RedlandsNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id575932950", "iphone": "id502960941", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.redlandsdailyfacts"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Education, Education news, Redlands Education news, CA Education news, US Education news, world Education news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Education, Education news, Redlands Education news, CA Education news, US Education news, world Education news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e5f\"", "article_summary": "The Boston Political Review is still a new publication, but he is not getting any younger.\n\u201cTyler was a valued member of Team Steinorth,\u201d said staffer Heather Rouhana, who supervised Fields\u2019 work during the campaign.\nHe said he enjoys keeping up with his Redlands High teachers, and has been known to drop in on the Mock Trial team.\nHe never wrote for Redlands High School\u2019s paper, or laid out pages for the yearbook, or contributed to the literary magazine, but two and a half years after graduation Tyler Fields is editor in chief and publisher\u2014and founder\u2014of The Boston Political Review, an online and print magazine at Boston University.\nFields saw a need for a publication like this one last spring, he said: \u201cI was reading an article from Stanford\u2019s political review, and I realized that we (Boston University) didn\u2019t have anything like that,\u201d he said."}
