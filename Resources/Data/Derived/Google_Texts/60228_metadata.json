More from Fox News:\n\nCommittee investigators also point to an analysis by H&R Block that found almost two-thirds of its filers receiving an ObamaCare tax credit owed the government at the end of the year. On average, those filers were required to repay more than $700 of their ObamaCare subsidies. The study found most customers claiming the credits were confused about the requirements.\n\n\n\nObamaCare offers eligible consumers government-funded tax credits to buy insurance on exchanges. The federal government sets the amount based on a recipient's stated income, family size and whether an applicant's job offers health coverage. Generally, the health care law offers larger subsidies to those earning less, and with larger families. If a customer finishes the year earning more than they stated on their ObamaCare insurance application, the law requires them to repay a portion of the credit.\n\n\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nAfter billions of dollars have been \"invested\" in the Obamacare sign up system, we're still seeing years later that the system is confusing and broken.\n\nThis news comes just one month before the Supreme Court will announce whether Obamacare subsidies in states without federal exchanges are legal under the law in King v. Burwell.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s statutory language seems to limit federal subsidies to people enrolled \u201cthrough an Exchange established by the State under section 1311,\u201d the ACA section directing states to establish health exchanges. The statute makes no mention of subsidies for enrollees on the federal exchanges authorized under a different ACA section, 1321. The plaintiffs in the case argue that this is no accident: Congress, they maintain, intended to encourage states to create their own exchanges by offering subsidies only to state-created exchanges.\n\n\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules Obamacare subsidies in states without federal exchanges are essentially illegal, Obamacare enrollees will no longer receive those subsidies. It isn't clear whether they will have to pay back subsidies already received under proper income requirements.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Glitches. .05/26/2016 1:45:35AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Glitches.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Oops: Obamacare Enrollees Forced To Unexpectedly Pay IRS For Billions in Subsidies Agency Improperly Gave Away", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/05/15/senate-digging-into-irs-giving-away-improper-obamacare-subsidies-n1999053", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/68/2015-03-09T134041Z_1_LYNXMPEB280KO_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Glitches.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Oops: Obamacare Enrollees Forced To Unexpectedly Pay IRS For Billions in Subsidies Agency Improperly Gave Away", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/05/15/senate-digging-into-irs-giving-away-improper-obamacare-subsidies-n1999053", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/68/2015-03-09T134041Z_1_LYNXMPEB280KO_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Oops: Obamacare Enrollees Forced To Unexpectedly Pay IRS For Billions in Subsidies Agency Improperly Gave Away, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15a1\"", "article_summary": "If the Supreme Court rules Obamacare subsidies in states without federal exchanges are essentially illegal, Obamacare enrollees will no longer receive those subsidies.\nOn average, those filers were required to repay more than $700 of their ObamaCare subsidies.\nThe statute makes no mention of subsidies for enrollees on the federal exchanges authorized under a different ACA section, 1321.\nGenerally, the health care law offers larger subsidies to those earning less, and with larger families.\nThe federal government sets the amount based on a recipient's stated income, family size and whether an applicant's job offers health coverage."}
