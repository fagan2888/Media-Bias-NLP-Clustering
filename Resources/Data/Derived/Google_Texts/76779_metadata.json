(REUTERS/Mike Segar)\n\n4753919\n\nFederal officials have a secret list of 11 Obamacare health insurance co-ops they fear are on the verge of failure, but they refuse to disclose them to the public or to Congress, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation has learned.\n\nJust in the last three weeks, five of the original 24 Obamacare co-ops announced plans to close, bringing the total of failures to eight barely two years after their launch with $2 billion in start-up capital from the taxpayers under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll 24 received 15-year loans in varying amounts to offer health insurance to poor and low income customers and provide publicly funded competition to private, for-profit insurers. The eight co-ops to announce closings served populations in ten states: Iowa, Nebraska, Kentucky, West Virginia, Louisiana, Nevada, Tennessee, Vermont, New York and Colorado.\n\nNearly half a million failing co-op customers will have to find new coverage in 2016. More than $900 million of the original $2 billion in loans has been lost.\n\nThe 11 unidentified co-ops appear to be still operating but are now on \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which manages the Obamacare program. The 11 received letters from CMS demanding that they take urgent actions to avoid closing.\n\nAaron Albright, chief CMS spokesman, said 11 co-ops \u201care either on a corrective action plan or enhanced oversight. We have not released the letters or names.\u201d He gave no grounds for withholding the information from either the public or Congress.\n\nCMS officials have stonewalled multiple congressional inquiries into the co-op financial problems. The latest congressional inquiry came in a September 30 letter to CMS acting administrator Andy Slavitt demanding transparency over the troubled program.\n\n\u201cWe have long been concerned about the financial solvency of CO-OPs,\u201d three House Ways and Means committee members wrote to Slavitt. \u201cWhich plans have received these warnings or have been placed on corrective plans,\u201d the congressmen asked. To date, they have received no reply.\n\nInsurance commissioners in Vermont were the first to refuse to license the federally approved co-op there in 2013 because they feared those financial plans were unrealistic. But then the dominoes began to fall this year, resulting in at least eight co-op failures. And if CMS officials are to be believed, more failures may be on the way.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley , a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee who has been an outspoken critic of the troubled co-op program, said transparency should be a top priority for the faltering program.\n\n\u201cSince the public\u2019s business generally ought to be public, CMS should have a good reason for not disclosing which co-ops are troubled,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Adrian Smith , is a member of the House Ways & Means health subcommittee who has been pressing to know which co-ops are in trouble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for CMS to stop shielding these failures from the public and start identifying faltering co-ops. Taxpayers deserve more accountability and consumers deserve to know whether the insurance they are forced to buy will still exist at the end of next year,\u201d he said.\n\nIn creating the co-ops under Obamacare, Congressional Democrats exempted the co-ops from public disclosure rules that apply to publicly traded insurance companies and other publicly traded corporations on such exchanges as the New York Stock Exchange. Those rules require immediate disclosure of materially important financial details.\n\nAny materially \u201csignificant event\u201d by publicly traded corporations have to be disclosed in \u201creal time,\u201d according to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission identifies 18 \u201cmandatory disclosure items,\u201d for private corporations including \u201cany material impairment of a company\u2019s asset.\u201d\n\nThe double standard rankles critics of the co-op experiment undertaken by the Obama administration. \u201cThe nonprofit co-ops advertise themselves as having a \u2018market approach,\u2019\u201d said Sally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a market approach, they are responsible to their shareholders and to the taxpayers to reveal the status of their business.\u201d\n\nGrassley agreed, saying \u201cdisclosure requirements on publicly traded companies would be a good guidepost for CMS on co-ops.\u201d\n\nPipes said taxpayers are stockholders in the non-profit health insurance co-ops. \u201cWe are paying for it. We have a right to know. They don\u2019t like to release things unless they\u2019re forced to, particularly if it shows them in a bad light or their program to be in a bad light.\u201d\n\nTaxpayer groups also expressed anger over the government secrecy.\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse why taxpayers should not know the names of the people and groups who misspent and wasted tax dollars on publicly financed health insurance co-ops,\u201d said David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.\n\n\u201cWhen anybody receives tax dollars, they have a responsibility to spend those dollars wisely and be held accountable for the expenditures. Transparency is the first step. CMS has a responsibility to all Americans to publish this information,\u201d Williams said.\n\nGrover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said \u201cas Obamacare continues to fail, those failures point right back to CMS. They don\u2019t want people to see that failure and think if they hide it somehow we won\u2019t hear about it.\u201d\n\nFollow Richard on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
