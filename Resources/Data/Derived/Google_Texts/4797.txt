>> Gregory: WE GOT SOME SAD NEWS AROUND HERE FRIDAY MORNING -- THAT WE LOST A GREAT JOURNALIST AND COLLEAGUE, GARRICK UTLEY. UTLEY�S CAREER SPANNED THE GLOBE. AS A FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, HE COVERED MAJOR MOMENTS IN HISTORY, FROM THE VIETNAM WAR TO THE SOVIET-LED INVASION OF PRAGUE AND, OF COURSE, POLITICS HERE AT HOME. HE MODERATED THIS PROGRAM FROM 1989 THROUGH 1991. DURING THAT PERIOD, HE REPORTED ON THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS IN CHINA AND THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL. >> Utley: THERE IS CERTAINLY NO MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO TALK ABOUT THE BREATHTAKING EVENTS OF THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS AND THE PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE THAN RIGHT HERE ON WHAT HAS BEEN THE FRONTLINE OF THE COLD WAR. >> Gregory: OUR FRIEND TOM BROKAW REMEMBERED UTLEY THIS WAY. GARRICK UTLEY WAS 74 YEARS OLD. YOU GO TO OUR WEBSITE AND WATCH UTLEY�S FINAL SIGNOFF AS MODERATOR OF "MEET THE PRESS" IN 1991. IT�S AT MeetThePressNBC.com.
