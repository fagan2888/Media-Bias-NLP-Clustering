Sailors have talked of dodging floating sofas, animal carcasses, and plastic trash bags that foul rudders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we did not use the games to get Guanabara Bay completely clean,\u201d Paes said in his first public admission that the problem will not be solved.\n\nRio\u2019s Olympics have faced mounting criticism over delays, with International Olympic Committee members saying openly the games are at risk and preparations are the \u201cworst\u201d in recent memory. In April the IOC sent special advisers to Rio to help organizers get on track.\n\nAny hope Brazil would be able to clean up the sewage-filled bay was quashed in a document obtained last month by The Associated Press.\n\nIn a May 7 letter to sports minister Aldo Rebelo, Rio\u2019s state environment secretary, Carlos Francisco Portinho, acknowledged in a best-case scenario that pollution flowing into the bay could be cut to \u201cover 50 percent\u201d \u2014 well below the promised reduction of 80 percent.\n\nPaes said he was \u201cnot afraid for the health of any of the athletes. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\nHe said sailing would take place in a part of the bay that was less polluted.\n\nSome parts are worse than others, but water movements and tides make it difficult to predict the trajectory of human waste and floating debris. The medal races for the Olympics are planned off Flamengo beach, where warnings are posted telling people not to swim. The few swimmers there appear to be children from neighboring slums.\n\nAsked if the government would be morally or legally responsible for any athletes who became ill, he replied: \u201cSure, I think it\u2019s our responsibility. Yes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mayor: Rio will fail to keep pledge to clean bay", "author": "Stephen Wade", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mayor: Rio will fail to keep pledge to clean bay", "title": "Mayor: Rio will fail to keep pledge to clean bay", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/mayor_rio_will_fail_to_keep_pledge_to_clean_bay/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-oly-rio-2016-water-pollution.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mayor: Rio will fail to keep pledge to clean bay", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-oly-rio-2016-water-pollution.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Mayor: Rio will fail to keep pledge to clean bay", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mayor: Rio will fail to keep pledge to clean bay", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf29\"", "article_summary": "Cleaning the giant bay was part of the pitch Rio made in being awarded the games, saying this would form an important part of its legacy.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Rio de Janeiro will not keep its promise of cleaning polluted Guanabara Bay for the 2016 Olympics, Mayor Eduardo Paes said on Saturday.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we did not use the games to get Guanabara Bay completely clean,\u201d Paes said in his first public admission that the problem will not be solved.\nIt\u2019s going to be fine.\u201dHe said sailing would take place in a part of the bay that was less polluted.\nAny hope Brazil would be able to clean up the sewage-filled bay was quashed in a document obtained last month by The Associated Press."}
