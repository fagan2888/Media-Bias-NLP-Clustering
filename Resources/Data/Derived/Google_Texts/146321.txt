GwenJorgensen's amazing streak continued Saturday when she won the ITU World Triathlon Series event in Gold Coast, Australia, for her eighth consecutive victory in the elite series.

Jorgensen, a Waukesha native and former swimmer and standout runner at the University of Wisconsin, finished the Olympic distance of a 1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer cycle and 10-kilometer run in 1 hour, 56 minutes, 59 seconds on an all-American podium. Sarah Truewas second, 1:18 behind, and Katie Zaferesfinished third, 1:36 slower than Jorgensen.

Jorgensen served a 15-second penalty after the cycling leg for not racking her bike properly, but dominated the final run leg to win her third WTS event of 2015, following on from Abu Dhabi and Auckland last month.

New Zealander Andrea Hewittwas fourth Saturday, two minutes behind.

Jorgensen's eight consecutive wins is the longest streak of any elite woman since the World Triathlon Series began. The 28-year-old hasn't been beaten in nearly a full calendar year and has emerged as the clear favorite for next year's triathlon at the Rio Olympics.

Her last non-winning finish came in the Cape Town triathlon last April 26 in South Africa when she was third.

Jorgensen leads the overall series this season with 2,400 points ahead of Zaferes' 2,165.
