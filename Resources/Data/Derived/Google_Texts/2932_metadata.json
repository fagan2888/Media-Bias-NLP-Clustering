Stoddard and Steve Hayes argued Wednesday that Obama brought on his plummeting approval ratings by giving Americans the impression that he has given up on his job.\n\nIn a new Quinnipiac poll, Obama came in first as the worst president since World War II.\n\n\u201cThe president is giving Americans the sense that, as he gives up on Congress, he\u2019s kind of giving up on his job,\u201d The Hill\u2019s Stoddard said. \u201cThey know he\u2019s bolting from the building to go to Starbucks and Chipotle. He\u2019s getting bored in the cocoon, he\u2019s planning his post-presidency.\u201d\n\nFree Beacon editor Matthew Continetti made this argument several weeks ago, writing, \u201cI find nothing paradoxical about Obama\u2019s recent pattern of behavior, nothing mysterious about the golfing, partying, traveling. It is quite obvious: Obama has given up.\u201d\n\nAnd, like Continetti, Stoddard notes Obama\u2019s new habit of \u201chaving lots of dinner parties where he doesn\u2019t talk about policy or politics, but the NBA playoffs\u2013anything but his job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really troublesome for the American people,\u201d Stoddard concluded, \u201cnot only because of all the problems we have, but because we\u2019re with him for another more than two years.\u201d\n\nThe Weekly Standard\u2019s Steve Hayes concurred, adding, \u201cIt is largely because of the president\u2019s flippant attitude towards the presidency. \u2018So sue me\u2019\u2013what kind of a president would make that argument? And where he had been buoyed, I think, by the fact that people liked him or people wanted him to succeed, despite the fact that they might have had some questions about his policies, that no longer exists, because the president is behaving the way that he\u2019s behaving.\u201d\n\nCharles Krauthammer said that Americans are just now realizing that campaigning is what Obama does best, and \u201cThat could be his only great competence\u2013to campaign, to make speeches.\u201d As a result, \u201cHe gave people hope, but he doesn\u2019t know how to govern.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Fox News panelists A.B.
