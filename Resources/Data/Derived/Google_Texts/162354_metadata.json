Catholic schools, hospitals, and social service agencies immediately raised a ruckus. Dozens of Catholic nonprofits filed lawsuits against the government, arguing that because their tradition forbids them from using birth control, paying for it\u2014even indirectly through insurance\u2014would violate their religious liberty.\n\nThe cases that will appear before the highest court deal with a different question: whether the owners of corporations can claim religious liberty exemptions. But there\u2019s a stranger and less remarked-upon twist. The owners of both companies aren\u2019t Catholic at all; one is Mennonite, and the other is evangelical. While Catholic doctrine teaches that birth control undermines God by allowing couples to separate reproduction from sex, Protestants\u2014whether they\u2019re Presbyterian, Episcopalian, or Southern Baptist\u2014have no such theological objection.\n\nStrictly speaking, the Protestant entrepreneurs involved in the upcoming case aren\u2019t trying to get an exemption for all 16 forms of contraception covered under the ACA. They claim\u2014backed up by a growing multitude of pro-life activists\u2014that Plan B and the IUD cause abortion by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus. Every year, more scientific evidence piles up to support the opposite conclusion: that contraceptives only work before the egg has been fertilized, not after. This won\u2019t make a difference for the Supreme Court case, where the plaintiffs\u2019 religious opposition to these so-called \u201cabortifacients\u201d is accepted as fact.\n\nBut some evangelical leaders, perhaps tired of explaining what happens in the murky hours between sex and conception, are no longer relying on this intricate biological argument to shoo their followers away from birth control. In a recent blog post, Albert Mohler, the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, declared that evangelical acceptance of oral contraceptives happened \u201cwithout any adequate theological reflection.\u201d Evangelicals today, he wrote, are \u201cindeed reconsidering contraception.\u201d In Mohler\u2019s view, contraception isn\u2019t just problematic because it might cause abortion. Any attempt to artificially regulate fertility is at odds with a \u201cpro-life\u201d ethos.\n\nFifteen years ago, this position would have been unthinkable. But an about-face on contraception isn\u2019t unprecedented; in fact, evangelicals\u2019 growing doubt about birth control echoes their theological U-turn on abortion four decades ago.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine today that there was ever a moment when abortion wasn\u2019t at the crux of evangelical political consciousness. In the late 1960s, when the pro-life movement was just beginning to coalesce, animosity toward abortion was left to the Catholics. Well-known evangelical leaders rejected the Catholic notion of fetal personhood wholesale. \u201cI have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person,\u201d observed W.A. Criswell, then the president of the Southern Baptist Convention, in 1973.\n\nLittle more than a decade later, Criswell and others were leading the charge in an impassioned crusade against legal abortion, creating one of the first evangelical-Catholic coalitions in American political history. But birth control didn\u2019t come along for the ride; it remained, until recently, a matter of Catholic concern. Could the same evangelical reversal be taking place today\u2014this time, with contraception?\n\nCatholics and Protestants weren\u2019t always at odds over the morality of birth control. In the late nineteenth century, it was Anthony Comstock, a fiery Protestant crusader against vice, who lobbied to criminalize contraception as part of a heretical trifecta that included abortion and pornography. The \u201cComstock laws\u201d of the 1870s outlawed abortion and made it a federal and, in some cases, a state-offense to transport birth control through the mail or across state lines. The laws weren\u2019t dislodged until 1965, when the Supreme Court ruled in Griswold v. Connecticut that restrictions on birth control access violated the \u201cright to marital privacy, and 1973, when the Supreme Court legalized abortion in Roe v. Wade.\n\nWhile Comstock pontificated against the evils of contraception, most Protestants didn\u2019t heed his warnings. The Comstock laws reined in a booming DIY abortion business\u2014women frequently used pills and herbal extracts marketed obliquely as \u201cFemale Regulators\u201d or \u201cPeriodical Drops\u201d to terminate pregnancies\u2014but illicit abortions remained common. Decent Protestant women furtively sent away for cow-skin condoms, advertised in the back pages of major newspapers even after the Comstock laws went into effect, and used \u201cwomb veils,\u201d a kind of diaphragm.\n\nA virulent wave of anti-Catholicism helped convince Protestant reformers that birth control was a moral imperative. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Catholic immigrants from southern Europe were pouring into the country, and native-born Protestants were troubled by the legions of offspring that was the norm for these newcomers. To white-collar Protestants living in east coast cities, large families were unseemly; children, once crucial sources of farm labor, were an expensive investment. Birth rates among \u201cnative-born white\u201d (i.e. Protestant) women plummeted from 7.04 in 1800 to 3.13 in 1920, while the average Catholic woman was still having more than six children. If Catholics continued to reproduce at these rates, the country would be overrun by multitudes of \u201cpapists.\u201d \u201cThere was a growing concern among Protestants that the wrong people were having too many children,\u201d says Allan Carlson, a historian and the president of the Howard Center for Family, Religion, and Society. \u201cThey were thinking, maybe birth control is the best way to clean up the country and the human race.\u201d\n\nMargaret Sanger, the birth control activist and founder of Planned Parenthood, took advantage of anti-Catholic sentiment, casting the Catholic Church as a sneering villain in the struggle for women\u2019s reproductive autonomy. Slowly, the major Protestant denominations fell into line, beginning with the Anglican Communion in 1930. Some Christian hard-liners were less easily cowed. William Bell Riley, one of the scions of the fundamentalist movement, called birth control a \u201cmenace to society.\u201d\n\nBut by the time the pill went on the market in 1960, evangelical leaders had, on the whole, made their peace with contraception. In the wake of World War II, fears about overpopulation had supplanted anti-Catholicism as the social rationale for contraception. In 1959, Billy Graham told reporters that he saw \u201cnothing in the Bible which would forbid birth control.\u201d Some evangelical sex manuals even celebrated contraceptives as a way for couples to strengthen their marriage through frequent, satisfying sex, free of anxieties about unwanted pregnancies.\n\nWhen state legislatures like New York and California began to debate legal abortion in the late 1960s, evangelical leaders were caught off guard. Already anxious about the sexual revolution, they were concerned that the contraceptive pill\u2014which was just becoming available to single women as well as married couples\u2014would further encourage promiscuity. Abortion, meanwhile, hadn\u2019t been a relevant public policy issue for nearly a century.\n\nFaced with growing confusion about how evangelicals should approach abortion and reproductive technology, the editors of Billy Graham\u2019s flagship magazine, Christianity Today, convened the Protestant Symposium on the Control of Human Reproduction in 1968. The attendees, 25 scholars\u2014mostly with evangelical pedigrees\u2014overwhelmingly sanctioned birth control for married couples. They were more hesitant about abortion, but agreed that it should be legal, although it was rarely morally acceptable. Catholic notions of fetal personhood were dismissed out of hand. A professor at a conservative seminary in Texas summed up the consensus: \u201cGod does not regard the fetus as a soul, no matter how far gestation has progressed.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, the Southern Baptist Convention adopted a resolution calling on its followers to work for legal abortion in a broad range of circumstances that included not just rape and incest, but \u201cdamage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.\u201d Two years later, when the Supreme Court legalized abortion outright, there was little backlash from evangelical Christians. A reporter for the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s newspaper concluded that because the decision to terminate a pregnancy was now left to an individual woman\u2019s conscience, \u201creligious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.\u201d\n\nDespite the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s blas\u00e9 response to Roe, other evangelical scholars saw the decision as a moral catastrophe. Distressed by the immediate uptick in the number of abortions that followed the Supreme Court decision, Harold O.J. Brown, an editor at Christianity Today, exhorted evangelicals to see Catholics as their allies in the pro-life fight. Francis Schaeffer, a philosopher who spent many of his adult years presiding over a Christian commune in Switzerland, had returned to the U.S. in 1960s, convinced that because of the sexual revolution, the country was rejecting its Judeo-Christian values. There was, for Schaeffer, no clearer evidence of this decline than the legalization of abortion, which he saw as the final secular devaluation of human life.\n\nIn 1976, Schaeffer enlisted C. Everett Koop, a doctor who later served as surgeon general under President Reagan, to create a documentary series called Whatever Happened to the Human Race? In the films, Schaeffer and Koop warned that a society that tolerated abortion would soon make infanticide and euthanasia routine. One scene showed Koop standing along the shores of the Dead Sea, surrounded by thousands of abandoned baby dolls. The film\u2019s message, says Molly Worthen, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina, was that abortion represented the beginning of a tumble into cultural depravity, much like the Roman Empire\u2019s. \u201cSchaeffer and Koop preached to evangelicals that they should picket abortions clinics not just to save the unborn, but to save Western civilization.\u201d\n\nUnder pressure from its membership, the Southern Baptist Convention reversed its position on abortion in 1979, throwing its institutional weight behind a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortion unless it was necessary to save the mother\u2019s life. The following year, abortion was at the center of the Moral Majority\u2019s campaign to sweep conservative politicians into statehouses, Congress, and the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to underestimate how big this shift was,\u201d says Dan Williams, a professor of history at the University of West Georgia. \u201cAt the time of the Roe decision, no one saw it as a watershed moment. By the late 1970s, many evangelicals would say 1973 was a time when the government sanctioned legalized killing. It was the ultimate sign that the government had rejected God.\u201d\n\nTwo competing narratives explain why evangelicals\u2019 shift on abortion was so sudden and spectacular. The Christian Right\u2019s critics allege that Schaeffer and others calculated that abortion could be the issue that capture evangelical Christians\u2019 diffuse anxieties about the sexual revolution, the beginnings of the gay rights movement, and the Equal Rights Amendment\u2014and catapult them into political power. Its defenders argue that evangelicals\u2019 acceptance of abortion was conditional even before it was widely available. After a few years of legal abortion, evangelicals had seen enough to recognize it as a moral abomination. \u201cOnce the horrors of slavery became known and the humanity of African-Americans became evident, northern Christians increasingly become single-minded in their opposition to slavery,\u201d wrote Mark Galli, the editor of Christianity Today, in a blog post in 2012. \u201cThat has more or less been the history of contemporary evangelicalism regarding abortion.\u201d\n\nBoth explanations are, to a certain extent, true. Evangelicals were wary about abortion from the beginning; it didn\u2019t take much to convince them that legalizing the procedure was the harbinger of broader moral decay.\n\nBut in the 1970s, Republican strategists were also searching for ways to harness evangelicals\u2019 anger and fear about cultural change, from incursions on school prayer to the rise of feminism. Abortion was the issue that could both galvanize evangelicals and peel Catholic voters away from the Democrats. In the 1980 election, the Moral Majority helped topple pro-choice Democratic incumbents in the House and the Senate, and brought the first pro-life president into the White House. Although the face of Christian conservatism, which quickly formed the core of the Republican Party, was Jerry Falwell, a Southern Baptist pastor, the movement was ecumenical from the beginning. It was Paul Weyrich\u2014an Eastern Orthodox deacon who was born Roman Catholic\u2014who coined the phrase \u201cmoral majority.\u201d\n\nThe battle over the contraception mandate has only intensified the decades-long partnership between conservative Catholic leaders and evangelical Protestants. Support from evangelicals helps bolster the Catholic case that the secular supporters of the Affordable Care Act are bent on dismantling the treasured American ideal of religious liberty. \u201cWe recognize we have common cause with Catholic University of America and other Catholic institutions in defending religious liberty,\u201d said Wheaton College\u2019s president, Philip Ryken, when the lawsuit against the Obama administration was announced. \u201cWe're, in effect, co-belligerents in this fight against government action.\u201d\n\nJust as they adopted the Catholic notion of fetal personhood, evangelicals are now using Catholic rhetoric to argue that birth control is incompatible with a pro-life philosophy. Catholic doctrine teaches that sex can\u2019t be separated from procreation through artificial means. Although the Catholic Church sanctions natural family planning, a form of birth control that works by tracking a woman\u2019s fertility, pious couples must always be ready to accept an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nUntil recently, few evangelicals shared this view. The Quiverfull movement, where couples eschew family planning, leaving God to fill their \u201cquiver\u201d with children, is the best-known example of a group of evangelicals who openly embraced \u201cbe fruitful and multiply\u201d as a scriptural imperative. The Duggar family, the stars of the TLC show 19 Kids and Counting, gave the movement some cultural currency. But Quiverfull\u2019s goal is not just Biblical loyalty; they hope to use their large broods to overwhelm secular American culture.\n\nNow, qualms about contraception\u2014not just alleged abortifacients like Plan B and the IUD, but the pill as well\u2014are filtering into the mainstream. More and more evangelicals, especially women, are beginning to advocate for natural family planning. Artificial birth control methods, they argue, violate the openness to life that\u2019s central to a Christian existence. \u201cBeing pro-life isn't only about opposing surgical abortion,\u201d wrote Agnieska Tennant, an editor at Christianity Today. \u201cIt's about opening ourselves to the risk and mess and uncertainty that accompany any God-sent guest we allow into our lives. The least we can do is leave our doors unlocked.\u201d\n\nIs this shift organic, or merely politically expedient? Randall Balmer, a professor of religious studies at Dartmouth University and the author of Thy Kingdom Come: How the Religious Right Distorts the Faith and Threatens America, says that just as abortion served as a convenient symbol for evangelical anxiety with the cultural and political changes of the 1970s, the new opposition to contraception is a calculated move to strengthen evangelical arguments against the Affordable Care Act. Whether individual women use contraception is irrelevant; the goal is to convince evangelicals that a Democratic president is infringing on their religious liberty. \u201cThis is naked politics,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s jumping on the Catholic bandwagon to score points against Obama.\u201d\n\nAllan Carlson sees things a little different. According to him, evangelicals are spontaneously embracing a holistic approach to the \u201cculture of life\u201d that makes contraception less appealing. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing reconsideration of what birth control means,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about an openness to human life, and a new suspicion of why we would want to restrict human fertility in the first place.\u201d\n\nEven if more evangelical leaders and writers are publicly rethinking birth control, it seems unlikely that a radical shift is happening in individual couples\u2019 bedrooms. Surveys show that only two percent of Catholic women rely on natural family planning; 68 percent of Catholic women and 74 percent of evangelical Protestant women use an IUD or a hormonal form of birth control like the pill. Protestants are also more likely than members other religious denominations to opt for male or female sterilization.\n\nGiven its pervasive use, it will be much more difficult to convince evangelicals that contraception carries as much of a moral stain as abortion. But if more evangelical leaders begin to conclude that birth control does, indeed, violate the \u201cculture of life,\u201d they may have a more receptive audience than their Catholic counterparts. American Catholics routinely ignore doctrinal commands; majorities favor abortion and gay marriage. But right-leaning evangelicals are primed, after years of anti-abortion activism, to reconsider the uncertain boundaries about where life begins. A small but vocal minority of evangelicals could turn contraception from a foregone conclusion into a potent political force.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "[[nid:219945]]On March 25, lawyers representing the owners of a large purveyor of craft supplies and a much smaller cabinetry business will appear before the Supreme Court in what has become the corne", "title": "The Strange Bedfellows of the Anti-Contraception Alliance", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/strange-bedfellows-anti-contraception-alliance", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/ap409238737139.jpg?itok=0A6d7Pry", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "After a few years of legal abortion, evangelicals had seen enough to recognize it as a moral abomination.\nArtificial birth control methods, they argue, violate the openness to life that\u2019s central to a Christian existence.\nA virulent wave of anti-Catholicism helped convince Protestant reformers that birth control was a moral imperative.\nCatholics and Protestants weren\u2019t always at odds over the morality of birth control.\nBut birth control didn\u2019t come along for the ride; it remained, until recently, a matter of Catholic concern."}
