But unlike 2012, when Esty, seen as a moderate Democrat, squeaked past a moderate Republican, former state Sen. Andrew Roraback, this year\u2019s race features sharp ideological and stylistic differences between the candidates.\n\nGreenberg is pro-life, supported the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cHobby Lobby\u201d decision allowing employers to refuse to cover contraceptive coverage, and wants to require that women look at a sonogram of their unborn child before getting an abortion. He supports the death penalty and has been an opponent of gun control. He doesn\u2019t believe that climate change is being caused by human activity, and he supports the Keystone XL pipeline, offshore drilling, and investment in \u201cclean coal.\u201d\n\nEsty is a longtime advocate for reproductive and abortion rights and as an underdog swept through an extremely competitive Democratic primary two years ago with strong support from Emily\u2019s List, a national fundraising and political action group that backs pro-choice female candidates. She lost her seat in the state legislature in 2010 after voting to repeal the state\u2019s death penalty despite intense pressure in her hometown of Cheshire, where the triple murder of members of the Petit family had occurred a few years before. She was a strong advocate in Congress for stricter gun laws after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting happened, in her district, a month after she was elected. And she opposes the Keystone XL pipeline, offshore drilling and support for coal, blasting Greenberg for energy policies she believes would harm the environment.\n\nGreenberg would repeal the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, and \u201creplace\u201d it with more modest reforms based more on a free enterprise approach to health care, including allowing certain insurance policies to be sold across state lines and limiting lawsuits against doctors.\n\nEsty would preserve the law but continue to \u201cmake it better.\u201d Her first term included a controversial vote in which she sided with Republicans on a proposal to weaken certain parts of Obamacare.\n\nGreenberg takes a hard line on immigration and foreign policy and speaks frequently about the need to \u201csecure the borders.\u201d He also takes a hard line on support for Israel and fighting terrorists at home and abroad. Esty talks about a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country and has been more cautious about committing military resources overseas.\n\nGreenberg takes a traditional conservative Republican approach to government spending and taxes, wanting a downsized bureaucracy in Washington and a reduction in the corporate tax rate, capital gains taxes, and marginal rates for personal income taxes. He believes lower taxes will spur investment in the economy and lead to greater overall tax revenue.\n\nEsty, instead, follows a traditional Democratic playbook, stressing the need to \u201cinvest\u201d in transportation infrastructure and education to put manufacturers and other businesses in a better position to create jobs.\n\nDiffering Visions for Social Security\n\nBut it\u2019s Social Security that has dominated this year\u2019s campaign.\n\nRecognizing that 130,000 people in the 5th District receive Social Security benefits, more than half the total number of people who cast ballots in the last mid-term election for her seat, Esty went on TV early in the campaign to attack Greenberg on the issue.\n\nThose attacks, suggesting Greenberg wants to \u201cprivatize\u201d Social Security and \u201ctake benefits away from seniors,\u201d have been labeled \u201cfalse\u201d by the Hartford Courant and angrily denounced by the Greenberg campaign.\n\nBut they were repeated constantly on TV, with the help of hundreds of thousands of dollars of \u201coutside\u201d spending on Esty\u2019s behalf by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and House Majority PAC.\n\nThe key difference between the two candidates\u2019 positions on Social Security is that Greenberg wants to gradually raise the retirement age from 67 to 70, affecting people who are currently 52 and under. He says this is necessary to prevent the program from becoming \u201cinsolvent\u201d as soon as 15 years from now.\n\nEsty, instead, favors raising the $117,000 cap on income to which the country\u2019s 6.2 percent Social Security tax applies.\n\nDespite running a TV ad accusing Esty of wanting to \u201craise Social Security taxes,\u201d Greenberg says he\u2019d consider implementing part of her plan, too. He accuses her and other Democrats in Congress of refusing to engage in a \u201cserious conversation and debate\u201d about saving Social Security from insolvency.\n\nGun Control and Term Limits\n\nAsked at a recent high school candidates\u2019 forum what single issue they think they could influence the most if elected, Esty cited gun law reform following Sandy Hook, and Greenberg said he\u2019d advocate for term limits.\n\nGreenberg has pledged to serve no more than eight years in Congress if elected, and said he favors changing U.S. House terms from two to four years, and then limiting members to two terms. Politicians like Esty, he said, get elected and then immediately start raising money and warping their behavior and policy positions with an eye toward being re-elected. That prevents Congress from having tough discussions about and finding solutions for serious problems such as Social Security, he said.\n\nEsty said that she didn\u2019t choose the gun issue, but rather it \u201cchose her\u201d and \u201cchose the district\u201d when the Sandy Hook shooting happened.\n\nShe is vice chairwoman of a House task force on gun violence, and is focused on three specific changes to federal law \u2014 closing loopholes for online sales and gun shows so that the country has truly \u201cuniversal\u201d background checks on gun purchases, banning \u201cstraw purchases\u201d of guns at the federal level, and making the interstate transport of illegal guns a felony.\n\nGreenberg surprised many, including the National Rifle Association, when he said in their first debate together that he supported Esty\u2019s call for universal background checks.\n\nThe next day, after the NRA abruptly dropped its rating of Greenberg\u2019s candidacy from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF,\u201d he said that Sandy Hook had changed his mind about background checks and that it was critical to keeping people with serious mental illness away from guns.\n\nSince then, however, the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, which opposes universal background checks and has fought against a range of incremental gun restrictions since Sandy Hook, said that it was maintaining its support for Greenberg and believed that he\u2019d ultimately vote their way in Washington. Esty\u2019s campaign has criticized this and Greenberg\u2019s refusal to say whether he\u2019d support specific legislation on background checks that she has co-sponsored.\n\nA Vulnerable Incumbent\n\nAlthough the 5th District has been in the hands of Democrats since now-U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy upset 12-term Congresswoman Nancy Johnson in 2006, it has been considered a \u201cswing district\u201d that skews more conservative than the rest of the state and where independent voters greatly outnumber Democrats and Republicans.\n\nTwo years ago, Esty barely beat Roraback, who was very popular even among Democrats in his longtime state Senate district in Litchfield County.\n\nFearing a possible rematch in 2014, when they wouldn\u2019t have the benefit of presidential election year turnout in the 5th District\u2019s biggest cities, Democrats appointed Roraback to a Superior Court judge position soon after that election.\n\nOne of Esty\u2019s biggest concerns continues to be turnout in the cities. Roraback beat her by a net margin of 18,000 votes in the district\u2019s 37 other towns, but Esty\u2019s crushing 26,000-vote-margin in New Britain, Waterbury, Meriden, and Danbury carried her to victory in 2012.\n\nPresident Obama is not on the ballot this year, and doesn\u2019t generate the same enthusiasm among the Democratic base. Nor is Murphy, who had a massive get-out-the-vote operation in the urban areas of his old district in support of his U.S. Senate bid against Linda McMahon.\n\nFirst-term incumbent Gov. Dannel P. Malloy is on the ballot this time, and could be a serious drag on Esty\u2019s candidacy. He\u2019s in a dead heat statewide with Tom Foley, who he narrowly beat four years ago, but is expected to lose the 5th District by a significant margin. He lost the 5th by 30,000 votes four years ago.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Greenberg has ratcheted up his efforts to tie Esty to Obama and Malloy, and Esty has declined to appear with other Democratic candidates in rallies that First Lady Michelle Obama and President Obama planned to bolster Malloy\u2019s candidacy in New Haven and Bridgeport.\n\nEsty has also had to overcome a deep division in the Democratic base that emerged in her unlikely primary victory two years ago. She was opposed by the party\u2019s labor unions and more progressive wings because of budget votes she took as a state legislator, her early opposition to the state\u2019s paid sick leave law, and her involvement in the bipartisan, moderate \u201cNo Labels\u201d movement. And her primary against former House Speaker Chris Donovan, a hero of that wing of the party, turned very nasty.\n\nAlthough she had the nominal support of Donovan and labor union activists two years ago, they did not work enthusiastically on her behalf. Since then, Esty has co-sponsored federal paid sick leave legislation and has done a lot of fence-mending with liberal party activists, and it seems to have made a difference.\n\nBut the more Esty reaches out to the base, the less able she is to tout the \u201cno party allegiance\u201d persona she\u2019d like to have in reaching out to independents, and the more susceptible she is to criticism from Greenberg.\n\nEsty\u2019s answer, in part, has been to get out in front with attacks on Greenberg, hitting the Social Security issue repeatedly and attempting to paint him as a right-wing \u201cTea Party\u201d conservative who is too extreme for moderate independents and should get the liberal wing of the Democratic party firmly behind her.\n\nGary Rose, chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University, said Greenberg took far too long to \u201cfight back.\u201d He \u201cheld back\u201d and as a result may have turned what was a very close race into a more comfortable situation for Esty.\n\n\u201cHe was a punching bag there on the Social Security issue, veterans, pro-choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the counterattack might be a little late. He let her set the tempo on this race.\u201d\n\nIn the Democratic primary against Donovan two years ago, her victory over Roraback and the way she has had Greenberg \u201con his heels\u201d in this race, Rose sees a political acumen in Esty that could take her pretty far.\n\n\u201cI think this is just the beginning of her real entry into federal politics,\u201d he said.\n\nEsty\u2019s Path to Congress\n\nEsty frequently mentions on the campaign trail how her then 15-year-old daughter pushed her into politics. She was a \u201cPTA mom\u201d upset about what was happening in Cheshire, and her daughter told her to run for office or stop complaining.\n\nShe was elected to the town council, and then to a state representative seat. After losing that seat following her death penalty vote, she entered a 5th District congressional primary that was supposed to be Donovan\u2019s to lose. Esty accumulated a formidable campaign war chest, however, thanks to the national fundraising prowess of Emily\u2019s List and a last-minute personal loan of $600,000 from the candidate herself. And Donovan got caught up in an FBI investigation of campaign finance law violations that ultimately sent his finance director and campaign manager to prison.\n\nEsty is a Harvard University- and Yale Law School-educated attorney and has at times faced backlash over the perception that she is an elitist who defaults to lecturing others on policy questions.\n\nEsty was recently ranked as the 104th wealthiest member of Congress, joining fellow Connecticut delegation millionaires Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Rep. Jim Himes, in the top 20 percent.\n\nThe Greenberg campaign recently aired a TV ad using 12-year-old video of Esty speaking at a Cheshire budget hearing, before her days on the town council, telling senior citizens they could \u201cmove to another town\u201d if they didn\u2019t like how much was being spent on the school budget.\n\nHer husband, Dan, teaches at Yale and was a consultant to large utility companies before joining Malloy\u2019s administration as commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\n\nSeveral times during her first term in Congress, Esty was forced to return campaign contributions from lobbyists and executives at Northeast Utilities, and from developers who were facing a DEEP enforcement action, over criticism that they were an attempt to influence her husband.\n\nDan Esty stepped down as DEEP commissioner as his wife was gearing up for her re-election bid.\n\nIn addition to mending fences with labor unions, Esty has put a strong focus in her first term on bread-and-butter constituent service work and assisting local selectmen of both parties with legislation on issues such as a hydro-electric dam in Canton\u2019s Collinsville section and federal funding for transportation projects.\n\nGreenberg\u2019s Chance\n\nGreenberg, making his third straight run for the 5th District seat, made his fortune in residential and commercial real estate development in Connecticut and New York. He has estimated his personal net worth at between $20 million and $60 million, which would put him in the top 20 of wealthiest members of Congress should he be elected.\n\nGreenberg talks about being a \u201cdifferent kind of candidate\u201d in that he is running simply to \u201cgive something back to his country\u201d and not \u201cfor himself.\u201d He says that will free him to fearlessly advocate for tough solutions to problems and take votes that \u201cmight cost him re-election.\u201d\n\nWhile Esty\u2019s lecturing can rub people the wrong way, Greenberg, also an Ivy League alum (Cornell) can come off as unprepared or buying into Fox News talking points on certain subjects. He frequently addresses topics by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a scholar on this issue,\u201d and then makes a controversial statement such as doubting the existence of man-made climate change or saying he supports universal background checks for gun purchases but doesn\u2019t exactly know the particulars of the process.\n\nHe\u2019s a fiscal conservative with a generous side. He and his wife founded the Simon Foundation, a dog rescue shelter, in Bloomfield. And he\u2019s known for stopping his car on the side of the road to rescue stray animals.\n\nHe has also shown a more thoughtful side than the \u201ctrue believer\u201d ideologue reputation he developed in his first two runs for Congress. He changed his mind on the universal background check issue after Sandy Hook, and then reversed his position on raising the income cap on Social Security after discussing it with former 5th District Congresswoman Nancy Johnson.\n\nGreenberg finished third in a three-way 5th District Republican primary against Justin Bernier and nominee Sam Caligiuri in 2010, and then finished second in a four-way race with Bernier, Roraback and Lisa Wilson-Foley two years ago.\n\nA controversy over former Gov. John Rowland loomed over the 2012 primary and spilled over into this year\u2019s race as Rowland was tried and convicted this past fall on campaign finance corruption charges.\n\nRowland was convicted of conspiring with Wilson-Foley and her husband, Brian Foley, to secretly be paid through Foley\u2019s nursing home chain for work he was doing to help her campaign.\n\nWhen this first came out in a Register Citizen newspaper report during the 2012 primary campaign, Greenberg revealed that Rowland had approached him with a similar scheme \u2014 wanting to be paid through his animal shelter \u2014 in the run-up to the 2010 race.\n\nGreenberg rejected Rowland\u2019s offer, leading many to praise him for doing the honest thing when Wilson-Foley did not. But when the details of the situation were dissected at Rowland\u2019s trial, Esty pounced.\n\nUnder cross-examination by Rowland\u2019s attorney, it was revealed that Greenberg took some time to say \u201cno\u201d to Rowland. Greenberg described himself as \u201cessentially gutless\u201d in not wanting to offend the former governor or make him an enemy.\n\nIt also came out in the trial that Greenberg had paid someone else to do work at his animal shelter who, similar to Rowland, has peddled political influence and consulting to various candidates.\n\nThat someone was Ron Wilcox, a founder of the Connecticut Tea Party Patriots organization. He was paid more by the Simon Foundation to do fundraising work in 2012 than its executive director was paid at the time.\n\nWilcox supported Greenberg\u2019s candidacy at a rally in 2012 and helped arrange an appearance on Greenberg\u2019s behalf by political pundit, author and former Clinton administration advisor Dick Morris.\n\nGreenberg has refused to talk about the Rowland trial outside of his testimony, but Wilcox and people close to the Greenberg campaign have said that he did nothing for the campaign other than that one event.\n\nGreenberg said after losing the 2012 primary that he was unlikely to run again, but things changed when no strong alternative emerged to run for the Republicans. Party officials reportedly approached Dr. William Petit, whose personal tragedy in Cheshire led him to be a strong advocate for the death penalty \u2014 the very issue and situation that cost Esty re-election once before. But Petit declined, as did Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra, a Roraback ally who won national praise for handling her town\u2019s response to, and recovery from, the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\nGreenberg was unopposed for the Republican nomination this time, and social and fiscal conservatives finally felt they had someone who, unlike Roraback and some other past candidates, was a \u201ctrue believer\u201d on their issues.\n\nBut despite Greenberg\u2019s personal wealth (he has contributed all but about $300,000 of the $1.5 million that has gone into his campaign), he has been outspent by a more than 3 to 1 ratio by Esty and the outside groups working on her behalf. The timing of his testimony in the Rowland trial came after Labor Day, just as voters traditionally start paying attention to the fall political races, and it\u2019s unclear how his views on social issues will play in a district that embraced Chris Murphy and Nancy Johnson, a pro-choice, moderate Republican, for decades before him.\n\nPistone on the Ballot\n\nJohn Pistone, who describes himself on his website as an \u201cunaffiliated, conservative candidate,\u201d is also on the ballot this year but has not responded to efforts to contact him about his campaign.\n\nPistone\u2019s website says he\u2019s a Brookfield resident, and offers the slogan \u201cYou are not alone \u2014 when you vote Pistone.\u201d He has a site at www.pistoneforcongress.net and also at pistoneforcongress.org.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/5th_cd_profile_greenberg_tests_esty_in_her_bid_for_second_term_in_congress/", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "type": "article", "description": "Mark Greenberg, a conservative real estate developer from Litchfield, is challenging the re-election bid of Elizabeth Esty, a first-term congresswoman from Cheshire, on Tuesday for the chance to represent Connecticut\u2019s 5th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.", "title": "5th CD ELECTION PROFILE | Greenberg Tests Esty In Her Bid For Second Term In Congress | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "article_summary": "Those attacks, suggesting Greenberg wants to \u201cprivatize\u201d Social Security and \u201ctake benefits away from seniors,\u201d have been labeled \u201cfalse\u201d by the Hartford Courant and angrily denounced by the Greenberg campaign.\nThat prevents Congress from having tough discussions about and finding solutions for serious problems such as Social Security, he said.\nDespite running a TV ad accusing Esty of wanting to \u201craise Social Security taxes,\u201d Greenberg says he\u2019d consider implementing part of her plan, too.\nEsty, instead, favors raising the $117,000 cap on income to which the country\u2019s 6.2 percent Social Security tax applies.\nDiffering Visions for Social SecurityBut it\u2019s Social Security that has dominated this year\u2019s campaign."}
