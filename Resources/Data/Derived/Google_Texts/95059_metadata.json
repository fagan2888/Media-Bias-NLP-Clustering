It's going to cost ACOs more than they save,\" he said.\n\nThe changes, Keckley said, don't go far enough for existing participants and, if implemented as proposed, will likely mean more of the Medicare ACOs will drop out of the program.\n\nIndeed, a recent survey by the National Association of ACOs (NAACOS) conducted before the release of the proposed rule indicated that two out of three MSSP ACOs are \"highly unlikely\" or \"somewhat unlikely\" to remain in the ACO program.\n\nThe NAACOS said it is concerned about the significant investment ACOs must make to sustain operations, including administrative, data, compliance and care coordination costs. The survey revealed that ACO respondents report an annual mean of $1.5 million management costs directly attributable to ACO operations.\n\nThe CMS proposed rule changes are significant, NAACOS CEO Clif Gaus told MedPage Today, but he said they aren't enough to stop MSSP ACOs from leaving. \"I think this will keep some ACOs in the program,\" he told the publication, \"but it's certainly not going to keep them all.\"\n\nUnder the program, ACOs can share savings with Medicare when they deliver care more efficiently and meet or exceed performance benchmarks for quality care. MSSP currently includes 330 ACOs in 47 states and in its first year, 58 of the ACOs kept spending below their benchmarks by $705 million and earned shared savings payments of more than $315 million. Sixty ACOs also kept spending below their benchmark, but not enough to earn the shared savings.\n\nKeckley said CMS will likely make further changes to the program in the final rule, which is due at some point next summer. The public can comment on the proposed rule until Feb. 6.\n\nHe said there is hope that the program will survive. \"I don't think the rule will be the end of the ACOs. The majority will continue to operate, although some will drop out,\" he said. \"The reason they will continue to operate is that managing risk for payers is the long game, and managing risk for Medicare may be a small part of that.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the MedPage Today article\n\n- here are the NAACOS survey results\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCMS proposed rule delays ACO financial penalties another three years\n\nMedicare ACO quality, savings improve in second year\n\nCMS: Medicare and Pioneer ACOs saved $380M\n\nACO-style care linked to drop in inpatient use\n\n3 reasons for slowed ACO-growth\n\nACOs associated with integrated systems, not high medical spending\n\nGaps found in ACOs' use of medications to meet goals\n\nConfirmed: Nine Pioneer ACOs will exit program, including University of Michigan Health System\n\n123 ACOs join MSSP model\n\nHow ACOs can improve patient engagement\n\nMixed news, unclear future for ACOs\n\n4 lessons from Pioneer ACOs", "article_metadata": {"description": "The changes proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to the\u00a0Medicare Shared Savings Program\u00a0are an attempt to save\u00a0accountable care organizations\u00a0but they don't go far enough, says leading health economist Paul Keckley, Ph.D..", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The changes proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to the\u00a0Medicare Shared Savings Program\u00a0are an attempt to save\u00a0accountable care organizations\u00a0but they don't go far enough, says leading health economist Paul Keckley, Ph.D..", "title": "Paul Keckley: MSSP ACO proposed rule changes don't go far enough", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/paul-keckley-mssp-aco-proposed-rule-changes-dont-go-far-enough/2014-12-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs),ACO proposed rule,Care Delivery,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),Fierce exclusive,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Medicare Shared Savings Program,MSSP,Operations & Business Management,Paul Keckley", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf94b\"", "article_summary": "The CMS proposed rule changes are significant, NAACOS CEO Clif Gaus told MedPage Today, but he said they aren't enough to stop MSSP ACOs from leaving.\nThe public can comment on the proposed rule until Feb. 6.\nThe changes proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) are an attempt to save accountable care organizations (ACOs) but they don't go far enough, said leading health economist Paul Keckley, Ph.D.\nThe changes, Keckley said, don't go far enough for existing participants and, if implemented as proposed, will likely mean more of the Medicare ACOs will drop out of the program.\nKeckley said CMS will likely make further changes to the program in the final rule, which is due at some point next summer."}
