Zilch. Zippo.\n\nWednesday, the American Actuarial Society released an issue brief examining the proposed solutions House Republicans came up with to \u201cfix\u201d the ACA should the Supreme Court rule in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor in King vs. Burwell next month. The brief says their proposals don\u2019t fix the problem. Instead, they destroy any progress toward a solution.\n\nSo much for the Republicans being the party of small business entrepreneurs.\n\nGiven the highly inflammatory nature of the ACA debate, one would think that Democratic lawmakers would ensure that they went above and beyond the call of duty on matters of ethics and transparency when it comes to implementing all aspects of the legislation, in order to silence Republican talking points of government inefficiency and waste.\n\nSadly, as per usual in Connecticut, this doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. And it\u2019s a blindingly foolish mistake that plays right into naysayers\u2019 hands.\n\nAs reported by CTNewsJunkie earlier this week, Healthcare advocate Ellen Andrews of the Connecticut Health Policy Project asked the Citizen\u2019s Ethics Advisory Board for a ruling on whether the state\u2019s Code of Ethics for Public Officials applies to members of the Healthcare Innovation Steering Committee or its subcommittees, because the board hadn\u2019t yet voluntarily adopted a code of ethics.\n\nWithout such a code, taxpayers risk a fox-guarding-the-henhouse situation because members of the committee are in a position to apply for some of the $45 million that is overseen by the committee upon which they sit.\n\nIndeed, as Christine Stuart reported Wednesday, \u201cIn her request to the Citizen\u2019s Ethics Advisory Board, Andrews cited an application from St. Vincent\u2019s Health Partners for a yet-to-be-awarded $650,000 grant. A spokeswoman for St. Vincent\u2019s confirmed Tuesday that some of the medical practices in St. Vincent\u2019s network had applied for the \u2018patient-centered medical home\u2019 grant. But Andrews is concerned about the St. Vincent\u2019s application because the company\u2019s CEO, Thomas Raskaukas, is a member of the Steering Committee.\u201d\n\nA draft ruling by the Office of State Ethics dated May 14 recognizes potential ethical conflicts: \u201cMany members of the Steering Committee, its subcommittees and the Consumer Advisory Board (CAB) hold high-level positions in organizations that have interest in the proceedings and deliberations of the governance structures formed under the Innovation Plan.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Office of State Ethics recognizes that under current legislation as written, the members of the Steering Committee, its subcommittees and the CAB are not \u201cstate employees\u201d as defined in General Statues 1-79 (13) or \u201cpublic officials\u201d as defined in General Statutes 1-79 (11). This is because they were appointed by Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman, who is leading Connecticut\u2019s health insurance reform efforts.\n\nHowever, the Ethics office does recognize the potential for conflicts and recommends \u201cmembers of the entities discussed . . . adopt internal ethics policies to address any conflicts of interest concerns.\u201d\n\nThe potential for self-dealing becomes even more suspect when combined with the lack of transparency around committee activities.\n\n\u201cThe meeting to decide the entire payment reform plan was never noticed through the Secretary of [the] State . . . That is not how you plan total disruption in how healthcare is paid for, $30 billion dollars in Connecticut . . . If this is such a good thing why does it have to be such a secret?\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIf people knew about this it would be far more controversial than the Affordable Care Act. Nobody knows about it and they are being very careful about who they allow into these committees to make decisions.\u201d\n\nAndrews is still waiting for a hearing date on an outstanding complaint filed with the state Freedom of Information Commission last November regarding another body, the SIM Consumer Advisory Board. Andrews\u2019 complaint says the board conducted public business during an executive session, and the \u201ccircumstances of the meeting did not comply with the state statute allowing for executive sessions and should have been an open discussion.\u201d\n\nThese ethical question marks are particularly unsettling given that several members of the Healthcare Innovation Steering Committee are employed by organizations that gave money to the state Democratic Committee\u2019s federal campaign account. Funds from that account were used to pay for mailers in support of Gov. Malloy\u2019s election campaign last year \u2014 a controversial action that is still being litigated.\n\nReportedly, Cigna Corporation PAC gave $10,000, Wellpoint Inc. WellPAC (Anthem) gave $7,000, and Pitney Bowes Inc. PAC gave $3,500.\n\nState Ethics Director Carol Carson tells me she has spoken with Lt. Gov. Wyman\u2019s office and agreed to work with them over the summer \u201cto review the issue and come up with appropriate language for passage next session.\u201d\n\nThis is great news, of course, but who will keep an eye on the henhouse in the meantime? Are we supposed to place our trust in the better nature of parties with clear financial interests? You don\u2019t have to be a lifelong resident of Corrupticut to know how often that story has ended badly.\n\nSince the only way to fix this problem in the current session is by amendment, Republican Sens. Kevin Witkos, Michael McLachlan, and Minority Leader Len Fasano have proposed amendments on two bills. This is a start, although the amendments would only \u201ccure\u201d this one particular issue, rather than being an overall fix. If it\u2019s all that can be done in the time left, then there is no excuse for not doing it until the proper legislation can be created in the next session.\n\nAt a time when services are being cut to the most needy in the state, we simply can\u2019t afford to play games with ethics. And with so much at stake for Connecticut residents when it comes to healthcare, one has to ask: why all the secrecy?\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Karen O\u2019Driscoll, a spokeswoman for St. Vincent\u2019s Health Partners, called Friday to clarify that their practices applied for a portion of the $650,000 grant. Dr. Mark Schaefer, director of the Office of Health Reform, has not responded to repeated requests for information about the number of practices that applied for the grant.\n\nSarah Darer Littman is an award-winning columnist and novelist of books for teens.
