They don\u2019t know which strategies will get them through to the second round and haven\u2019t seen firsthand how the intensity will pick up starting Sunday at Chicagoland Speedway.\n\nIt may not be the worst thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been in this position before, so I\u2019m just taking it like I take every week,\u201d said Menard. \u201cI feel good about how we\u2019re approaching it. We\u2019re just going to put our heads down and go as far in this deal as we can.\u201d\n\nThe elimination format was implemented last year, and drivers used varying approaches to navigate their way through the three rounds that lead to the finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. A win in any of the first three segments guarantees a driver a spot in the next round; four drivers are eliminated every three races.\n\nConsistency can push a driver into the final round, as Ryan Newman proved last year by using solid finishes in a winless season to have a shot at the title.\n\nBoth McMurray and Menard are winless this year, and both used consistency to make it into the 16-driver field. McMurray thinks that will be good enough to get him out of the first round, which is made up of Chicago, New Hampshire and Dover.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at our strategy going in, we would love to win the first round. But mostly, we don\u2019t want a bad race,\u201d McMurray said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone selected (Newman) for getting to the final round. If we can do what he did, getting to Homestead would be a realistic goal.\u201d\n\nMcMurray and Menard have to pick up their performance, though, to make it through the first three weeks.\n\nMcMurray has just two top-five finishes this year, has led only 14 laps and only has seven top-10 finishes. Menard also has two top-five finishes, but only four top-10s and has led just one lap. His average finish is 16.7 through the first 26 races.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Being a rookie here may not be so bad for Jamie McMurray", "title": "Being a rookie here may not be so bad for Jamie McMurray", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/19/being-a-rookie-here-may-not-be-so-bad-for-jamie-mcmurray/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920__Jamie-McMurrayp1.jpg", "height": 610}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920__Jamie-McMurrayp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-19T19:32:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T19:04:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3e4\"", "article_summary": "McMurray has just two top-five finishes this year, has led only 14 laps and only has seven top-10 finishes.\nMenard also has two top-five finishes, but only four top-10s and has led just one lap.\nBoth McMurray and Menard are winless this year, and both used consistency to make it into the 16-driver field.\nBut mostly, we don\u2019t want a bad race,\u201d McMurray said.\nMcMurray thinks that will be good enough to get him out of the first round, which is made up of Chicago, New Hampshire and Dover."}
