The first practice in full pads is Thursday.\n\n\u201cI thought our players competed well today, they got after it,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cWe did a lot more aggressive team work. It taxed them a little bit. But I was pleased with the way they competed.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre praised the leadership of CU\u2019s seniors, including cornerback Greg Henderson and safety Jered Bell.\n\n\u201cI put a lot on the seniors, to make sure they are (setting an example by) doing the right things, and if they see a young player in the locker room who\u2019s down (emotionally), they go over and talk to him,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThose two guys are good at that, they really do. They\u2019re real personable. They\u2019re just quiet by nature.\u201d\n\nSophomore linebacker Addison Gillam, a team captain, sat out the morning practice with a virus. MacIntyre said Gillam lost five pounds on Sunday and then three more overnight. \u201cWe took him back (to the training room) to get fluids,\u201d the coach said.\n\nBell dinged an elbow but MacIntyre did not believe it to be serious.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffs weave in more team drills for third practice of August camp", "title": "CU Buffs weave in more team drills for third practice of August camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/04/cu-buffs-weave-in-more-team-drills-for-third-practice-of-august-camp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140804__cu-ffotball-practice-080414p1.jpg", "height": 475}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140804__cu-ffotball-practice-080414p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-04T12:43:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:42:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f1e\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019re just quiet by nature.\u201dSophomore linebacker Addison Gillam, a team captain, sat out the morning practice with a virus.\nColorado coach Mike MacIntyre was pleased with the way his players \u201cpushed through it.\u201d Players wore shoulder pads so there was some hitting above the waist.\nBOULDER \u2014 After focusing primarily on individual drills during the first two practices, Colorado mixed in more team drills Monday that resulted in a more physically demanding session.\nThe first practice in full pads is Thursday.\nBut I was pleased with the way they competed.\u201dMacIntyre praised the leadership of CU\u2019s seniors, including cornerback Greg Henderson and safety Jered Bell."}
