SB-967 threatens to withhold federal funding from California colleges and universities that do not have adequate sexual misconduct policies, including an affirmative consent standard.\n\n...\n\nJordyn Irwin \u201916, a Peer Health Educator (PHE) in Rinconada House, attended FMOTQ with one eye on how students, particularly freshmen, were handling affirmative consent. She said she did not hear of any problems regarding sexual misconduct that night, nor did she witness much conduct at all. \u201cIt seemed like not as many people were kissing as I remembered it being like my freshman year, and I was thinking about how that very well could be a product of all of the talk about affirmative consent,\u201d she said. \u201cI think mostly because when it becomes on people\u2019s radars, they start to realize how awkward it seems to kiss a total stranger.\u201d Freshmen, with only secondhand accounts of past events to compare this year to, still noticed fewer people kissing than was hyped. Harry Elliott \u201918 attended his first Full Moon this year and was surprised by the relatively low level of kissing, a tradition that goes hand in hand with the annual event. \u201cI was expecting a glorified makeout session, essentially just people wildly kissing each other,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more than half of the people there were seriously engaged in making out.\u201d In year\u2019s past, a countdown to midnight more or less commenced the kissing, while this year\u2019s event, running only from 10:45 p.m. to 12:15 a.m., omitted the countdown and began and ended earlier, limiting the window for kissing but also, as Irwin noticed, for pre-gaming.\n\n...\n\n\u201cThe fact that nobody got transported this year is just sheer luck,\u201d Kannappan said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do in terms of planning the event to stop people from pre-gaming. I do think something that helped this year was making the event time run shorter than it has in the past.\u201d\n\nSo, to recap, the Affirmative Consent policy, coupled with a shorter run time for the event, led to less drinking, fewer drunken hook ups, and, for the first time in years, no one going to the hospital.\n\nWhat is so bad about this policy again?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to California's Affirmative Consent law, there is now less drunken kissing Stanford.
