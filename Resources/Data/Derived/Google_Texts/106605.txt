WASHINGTON — Smile, you’re an ObamaCare navigator.

A confidential training manual for the government’s health-plan “navigators” has been posted online, revealing such secret instructions such as “smile” and “listen.”

The manual of standard operating procedures for navigators, who help Americans sign up for new mandatory health policies, advised the ObamaCare aides to “smile” even when on the phone with clients.

“Smiles are contagious; usually when you smile at somebody, they will smile back at you,” the manual says. “Do not pretend to smile, or produce a false smile; these are easy to spot and send the wrong messages. Relax, gain eye contact, and smile naturally.”

It says to keep smiling on the phone because “your voice sounds different when you smile and are happy.”

Each of the 217 pages in the manual includes the government warning:

“INFORMATION NOT RELEASABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY LAW: This information has not been publicly disclosed and may be privileged and confidential.”

The deadline to sign up for coverage that starts next year is Dec. 23.

The unofficial year-end enrollment target is 3.3 million, about 2.9 million more than had signed up at the start of December.
