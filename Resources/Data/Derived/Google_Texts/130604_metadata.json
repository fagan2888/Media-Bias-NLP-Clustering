Via the WSJ\u2019s Doug Cameron:\n\nThe Bell unit of Textron in partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp., and the team of Boeing and Sikorsky Aircraft Co. said Tuesday that they\u2019d been picked to each build a helicopter that flies much faster and further than existing models. The Joint Multi-Role, or JMR, program is part of a broader effort to eventually replace hundreds of workhorse Black Hawk and Apaches models. The Army plans to use the two prototypes as part of its evaluation of a wider helicopter replacement program known as Future Vertical Lift that the Pentagon estimates could cost $100 billion. The long-term plan wouldn\u2019t lead to new helicopters becoming operational before the mid-2030s, and the defense department could still decide the broader project is too complex or costly and opt to upgrade existing rotorcraft with technology harvested from the JMR program. The four companies are already the Pentagon\u2019s main suppliers of rotorcraft and onboard equipment. Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies, builds Black Hawks and the larger CH-53, while Boeing makes Apaches and Chinooks, as well the distinctive tilt-rotor MV-22 Osprey in partnership with Bell.\n\nAs you see in the tickers next to each of the companies above, today\u2019s news did not lead to investors rushing on the companies involved. That\u2019s mainly because there\u2019s no real money in this deal just yet, and there won\u2019t be for a long time\u2013longer than the horizon most in the market are thinking about.\n\n\u201cThe financial impact of this program is de minimus in 2014-18,\u201d Capital Alpha Partners wrote in late July, \u201cbut awards could shape investor perceptions of which firms can lead in rotary wing markets next decade.\u201d\n\nThere also wasn\u2019t much surprise at the choice, with the Pentagon choosing the four largest US players in military helicopters, and leaving the door open for Airbus Group to join in later. Also in the running were two smaller, closely held companies: AVX Aircraft and Karem Aircraft. Picking either of the smaller players to build the new helicopter could have signaled an eventual shake-up in the market, but for now, it\u2019s business as usual.\n\nSee the full story here\u2026", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The four biggest players in the U.S. helicopter business have been tapped to work on concepts for the next generation of choppers, with the Pentagon set to spend up to $100 billion on the project in the coming decades.", "title": "One Small Step Toward the Helicopters of the Future", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/08/12/one-small-step-toward-the-helicopters-of-the-future/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-XJ970_0508id_G_20130508073307.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "One Small Step Toward the Helicopters of the Future", "description": "The four biggest players in the U.S. helicopter business have been tapped to work on concepts for the next generation of choppers, with the Pentagon set to spend up to $100 billion on the project in the coming decades.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "The four biggest players in the U.S. helicopter business have been tapped to work on concepts for the next generation of choppers, with the Pentagon set to spend up to $100 billion on the project in the coming decades.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-12T21:57:25-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/08/12/one-small-step-toward-the-helicopters-of-the-future/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-5345", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The four biggest players in the U.S. helicopter business have been tapped to work on concepts for the next generation of choppers, with the Pentagon set to spend up to $100 billion on the project in the coming decades.", "title": "One Small Step Toward the Helicopters of the Future", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/08/12/one-small-step-toward-the-helicopters-of-the-future/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-XJ970_0508id_G_20130508073307.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-5345", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-12T21:57:58-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Boeing\u2019s Chinook heavy-lifting helicopters at work in Scotland in 2013 Getty ImagesA small step forward today in what will eventually become a very large Pentagon spending program: the $100 billion quest for the next generation of army helicopters.\nAlso in the running were two smaller, closely held companies: AVX Aircraft and Karem Aircraft.\nThe Army plans to use the two prototypes as part of its evaluation of a wider helicopter replacement program known as Future Vertical Lift that the Pentagon estimates could cost $100 billion.\nThe Joint Multi-Role, or JMR, program is part of a broader effort to eventually replace hundreds of workhorse Black Hawk and Apaches models.\nAs you see in the tickers next to each of the companies above, today\u2019s news did not lead to investors rushing on the companies involved."}
