Parents and organizations providing healthcare to kids sued the state, saying Florida\u2019s old Medicaid program wasn\u2019t serving kids. Now, they say, Florida has an opportunity to make the system better.\n\nThe Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics says it views one-on-one communication opportunities with state healthcare agencies as the biggest win in a settlement over a decades-long lawsuit over children\u2019s healthcare in Medicaid. Tommy Schechtman heads the academy:\n\n\"For 10-plus years we haven\u2019t been able to sit at the table with the state. And now we have that opportunity,\" he says.\n\nThe settlement calls on the state to find ways to increase the number of kids getting preventive care, and give providers a way to earn reimbursement rates near Medicare levels. That\u2019s closer to a market rate. The lawsuit began in 2005. In 2011, the state handed Medicaid over to HMO\u2019s to administer, privatizing the program. The new incarnation is called Medicaid Managed Care.\n\n\u201cSome companies have started with what we call pay for performance, or enhanced payments on metrics, he says. \"But it hasn\u2019t been consistent or across the board. And that\u2019s what this settlement will achieve.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s rate for uninsured children remains one of the highest in the nation. There\u2019s been tremendous progress in reducing that rate in recent years. But according to a report from Georgetown university, 378,000 kids don\u2019t have insurance. And Schechtman says about 70 percent of them are currently eligible for Medicaid. It\u2019s this group of kids that\u2019s proving hardest to reach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no statewide effort to do targeted outreach, and the settlement speaks to that, and states it\u2019s now an obligation of the health plans and the state.\u201d\n\nThe settlement deal calls on state agencies to find ways to get those kids into the system. Schechtman says while it\u2019s not a panacea\u2014expanding Medicaid to more adults could help. He says if parents get insured, they\u2019re more likely to get their kids coverage too. But the Florida\u2019s legislature continues to reject such an expansion under the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "A decade long fight over Medicaid has come to a close.
