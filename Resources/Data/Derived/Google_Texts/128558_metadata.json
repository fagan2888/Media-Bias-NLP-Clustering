Bloomberg\n\nIn a Midtown Manhattan storefront partially obscured by scaffolding, a crowd gathered Tuesday to welcome back Crumbs Bake Shop, the cupcake chain that shut its doors and filed for bankruptcy in July.\n\nTwo of the chain\u2019s new owners, self-styled turnaround guru Marcus Lemonis and Scott Fischer, whose company also owns Dippin\u2019 Dots, milled around the room. Employees, press reps and others from the new management team squeezed into the space not already occupied by hulking video cameras.\n\nThe crowd left little room for what some might call an important contingent\u2014the customers.\n\n\u201cOK, photographers, let people buy cupcakes,\u201d Mr. Lemonis shouted as some would-be customers walked in the door.\n\nCrumbs\u2019 revival includes plans to open 25 stores before the holidays in New York, New Jersey, Chicago and elsewhere, according to the company. And while the new owners are convinced they\u2019ll do better than Crumbs did before its trip to bankruptcy, Mr. Lemonis says he knows they have some work to do.\n\n\u201cWe were in a mad dash to get open,\u201d he says after wiping down a crumb-dusted table. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten the product right, but we still need to work on the process.\u201d (For the record, Mr. Lemonis says he\u2019s gluten-free and doesn\u2019t actually indulge in most of the Crumbs goods).\n\nThe new owners also concede that Crumbs\u2019 reliance almost exclusively on cupcakes contributed to the chain\u2019s downfall. Tuesday, the desserts on display included cake pops, macaroons, a freezer full of Dippin\u2019 Dots and two twists on the hybrid croissant trend: the crozel (pretzel-croissant) and the baissant (bagel-croissant).\n\nThe opening brought good news for Bronx-based Melita Bakery, a major supplier to Crumbs that had to lay off more than a third of its workforce when Crumbs shut down. Watching from outside the store, Melita owner Emanuel Darmanin said he was optimistic about the new strategy. \u201cI feel it, they\u2019ll do a better job with Crumbs,\u201d Mr. Darmanin said, adding that Melita\u2019s business is recovering and they expect to hire back a majority of the laid off employees.\n\nMany of the customers tentatively walking into the media fray Tuesday seemed more eager to take a selfie with Mr. Lemonis, who hosts a CNBC reality show centered on saving small businesses, than to eat a cupcake.\n\nOne such fan, Jonathan Ramsuchit, said he came to the opening for a photo op with Mr. Lemonis. With that mission accomplished, he sat down to split a treat with a friend. \u201cI like the chocolate cupcakes,\u201d he said.\n\nOne young woman waiting patiently in line came to the store seeking a bit more than a baked good. The woman, who preferred not to give her name, said that when Crumbs closed, the cleaning company she worked for got stuck with a $15,000 bill.\n\nIf Crumbs still refuses to pay, she said her employer had another suggestion: \u201cMy boss told me to come and get $15,000 in cupcakes.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com.
