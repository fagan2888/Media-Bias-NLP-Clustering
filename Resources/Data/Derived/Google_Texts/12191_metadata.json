Because some government bureaucrat didn\u2019t like homeschooling? Astounding.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, following a long and widely criticized legal process, an appeals court finally reversed a lower court decision that had concluded, based on extensive testimony of friends and family, that the Johanssons were good parents.\n\nChrister and Domenic Johansson\n\nThe appeals court severed all legal rights of the parents and placed Domenic up for adoption.\n\nAnnie and Christer, however, had not seen their son since before the ruling.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about our son \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen him nor talked to him since November 2010,\u201d Christer told WND. \u201cWe don\u2019t get any information whatsoever.\n\n\u201cNeither are we getting the documentation from the CPS workers so we can go further with our case to the European Court of Human Rights,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that attorneys involved in his case from Sweden and around the world have done a \u201cfantastic job.\u201d\n\nAfter citing homeschooling to justify the seizure of Domenic, which was not further restricted until 2011, authorities later pointed to some baby-teeth cavities that the family was planning to treat in India.\n\nOfficials also argued that the boy had not received all of his recommended vaccines, which are optional under Swedish law.\n\nLegal experts from around the world have told WND that the pretexts cited to seize Domenic do not stand up to scrutiny, especially because homeschooling was legal in Sweden at the time and the right to homeschool is guaranteed under multiple human rights treaties.\n\n\u201cNo legitimate justification has ever been produced to defend the seizure or the ongoing custody of the boy,\u201d HSLDA said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nADF has also been speaking out, rallying support and cooperating with the HSLDA in an effort to get the Johansson case heard at the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n\u201cThe treatment this family has received is inhumane,\u201d said Roger Kiska, senior counsel for the organization and director of its European office.\n\n\u201cThe fact that only one Swedish court has ruled in their favor is hard to understand,\u201d Kiska said. \u201cCriminals are treated with more humanity than the Johansson family. We will continue to seek review of this horrible situation in international courts and tribunals until justice is done.\u201d\n\nSo far, the European court has ignored the pleas.\n\nA chance for justice\n\nNow, with an unprecedented wave of child seizures by authorities on the island of Gotland, where the Johansson family lives, an official investigation into potential abuses is underway, local media outlets reported.\n\nChrister believes this may represent an opportunity to highlight what he described to WND as an extreme violation of his family\u2019s human rights \u2013 and a chance to be re-united with his son after four years of anguish.\n\nWorking together with other families on the island whose children have been seized for allegedly dubious reasons, Christer founded the group \u201cGotland Human Rights Protest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe social services board has raised concerns about the many state-nappings, so we dived into that discussion with force and will now demand our kids back,\u201d the distraught but hopeful father told WND last week, pointing to the recent probe into the surge in government seizures of children.\n\n\u201cI know this is the time for us to do what we can,\u201d he added. \u201cI am aiming to celebrate Christmas with my son for the first time since 2008.\u201d\n\nThe last time the Johansson parents met with a Swedish politician, \u201cit ended with, \u2018I am so sorry Annie what Sweden has done to you,'\u201d Christer said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d he continued. \u201cAnnie was relieved after that, but only for a while, now she\u2019s back concentrating on staying somewhat alive.\u201d\n\nStrategies for victory\n\nChrister said that his organization has already started to apply \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on child-welfare authorities, even getting the local press involved.\n\n\u201cWe demand a discussion with authorities to begin with,\u201d he said, adding that officials have mostly ignored the injustices thus far, but support is growing. \u201cWe feel that we need to shape this organization to our needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as responsibilities go about this error, we now demand to see empathy and justice from the Swedish authorities, a service we have paid for ten-fold,\u201d Christer continued.\n\nChrister said that working together with the growing numbers of concerned activists, experts, victims, homeschoolers, attorneys, politicians and reporters, authorities will no longer be able to ignore his pleas.\n\nAmong other efforts, Christer hopes to have local authorities investigate the case for misconduct, violations of human rights and abuses of power.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that some of our local politicians will look more closely into these abuses and take action to correct these injustices,\u201d Christer told HSLDA.\n\n\u201cWe have been without our only son for so long it is incredibly difficult for us,\u201d he added. \u201cEspecially my wife, whose health has been severely damaged by this ordeal.\u201d\n\nAll Christer and Annie want is their son back, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are just getting started,\u201d he added.\n\nLocal officials have repeatedly refused to comment to WND and other media outlets about the case, citing privacy laws.\n\nActions for international supporters\n\nWith recent changes in the local political situation offering a glimmer of hope to the family, the Johanssons\u2019 allies around the world are stepping up their efforts to re-unite the family.\n\nHSLDA put out a statement requesting that supporters call and e-mail local authorities.\n\nIn particular, the organization asked that concerned individuals around the world reach out to Gotland Regional Council Member Hanna Westeren at hanna.westeren@gotland.se. A telephone number also was listed on the HSLDA site.\n\nAnother official identified by HSLDA was Christina Godarve, chief of the Gotland social services board, who can be reached at christina.godarve@gotland.se.\n\n\u201cThose who communicate with Ms. Westeren may want to make the point that the treatment of the family is inhumane, and that she should do all she can in her power to correct this injustice,\u201d HSLDA said in the statement.\n\nOther actions the group mentioned include contacting the editors of two local newspapers, Gotland Tindingar and Gotland Allehanda, and asking them to investigate the case. The HSLDA also listed their contact details.\n\n\u201cPosting thoughts on the Facebook pages of these local newspapers [here and here] may make more people aware of this tragedy on their island and encourage citizens and the media to do more about it,\u201d HSLDA added.\n\nThe family is thankful for the outpouring of international support.\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful for the thoughts, prayers and intervention of others from abroad,\u201d Christer noted.\n\nThe big picture\n\nAs WND has been reporting for years, the Johansson family is hardly alone in battling Swedish authorities for the right to homeschool.\n\nDozens of families have already fled abroad, including Jonas Himmelstrand, the chief of the Swedish Homeschooling Association, ROHUS, who fled to Finland with his wife and children.\n\n\u201cWe are doing comparatively well. Our family is intact,\u201d Himmelstrand told WND recently in an interview about massive fines levied against him by Swedish authorities \u2013 even while living abroad in exile \u2013 for failing to send his children to government schools.\n\n\u201cDominic Johansson\u2019s family is a much more tragic case, and they are not alone either, unfortunately,\u201d he added.\n\nSweden, Himmelstrand continued, has reached a point where \u201cthe ignorance and immaturity of our government in family policy matters has come into open conflict with \u2026 more and more aware citizens, and the government chooses control and oppression.\u201d\n\nHSLDA\u2019s Donnelly echoed those concerns in comments to WND, saying authorities were violating fundamental rights of citizens.\n\n\u201cSweden is a signatory to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other human rights instruments \u2026 all of which recognize the critical role of parents in making education decisions for their children and which also require governments to respect the philosophical and religious convictions of families,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a nation Sweden is not living up to these obligations.\u201d\n\nGermany, too\n\nSweden is not alone among Western nations in oppressing homeschooling families, either, Donnelly continued.\n\n\u201cGermany continues to stand out as an aggressive persecutor of homeschooling families,\u201d he said.\n\nAs WND reported in August, one of the most extreme examples of the persecution featured a squad of armed police descending on the Wunderlich family to seize their four homeschooled children.\n\nWhile the children were rescued following three weeks of international pressure, the case is far resolved, with authorities returning the children only on the condition that they are sent to government school.\n\n\u201cJudges in the case have refused so far to let the family emigrate demonstrating the hostility to home education,\u201d Donnelly explained.\n\nHSLDA and other organizations involved in the cases said they hope to see officials in Sweden and Germany respect the rights of parents to educate their children.\n\nIf and when that may happen, though, remains uncertain.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "STOCKHOLM, Sweden \u2013 More than four years after Swedish authorities seized their son, Domenic, over homeschooling, parents Christer and Annie Johansson are unveiling a strategy they hope will reunite their family before Christmas.
