Hitting a target without full recognition of the brokenness of the overall health care scheme is nothing to be proud of.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nThe law has provided anything but economic security to Americans who need a buffer against life\u2019s unexpected circumstances. For instance:\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the law\u2019s incentives will slash our economy\u2019s total number of hours worked by the equivalent of around 2.5 million jobs by 2024, and its redefinition of the work week will force schools and small businesses to either cut employees\u2019 hours or lay them off entirely.\n\nPresident Obama said Americans could keep their doctors and insurance plans if they liked them, but it is estimated that more than 5.5 million U.S. residents have received cancellation letters from their insurers, including 185,000 Illinoisans. An economist from the American Enterprise Institute estimates that as many as 43 percent of Americans will face changes to their insurance plans.\n\nThe persistent claim that the law would \u201cbring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family\u201d has proven untrue. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office predicted in 2009 that premiums would increase 10-13 percent in the individual market and $2100 per family in the non-group market. A CMS study has predicted that 65 percent of small businesses may see their health premiums increase. And premiums have continued to rise for middle class Americans.\n\nOur leaders in the governor\u2019s mansion have jumped on the bandwagon, ignoring the challenge that the law poses to Illinois. While Gov. Quinn did not hesitate to push Illinoisians onto ObamaCare, enrollment has lagged. Only 13,733 Illinois residents signed up for coverage during the first five months of the enrollment period, more than 100,000 people short of the original goal. So Gov. Quinn decided to partner with the satirical news site, The Onion, to push enrollment. While The Onion is skilled at humor, losing your insurance or doctor is no laughing matter for Illinois families.\n\nThe administration\u2019s solution to the law\u2019s disastrous performance is to suspend the rule of law, and authorize a myriad of delays of some of the law\u2019s most unpopular provisions under a \u201cfix-of-the-day\u201d approach to public backlash. And it\u2019s no coincidence that some of these delays push the law\u2019s application until after the November midterm elections.\n\nWhile Democrats fight to delay the law\u2019s real consequences for health consumers until after they\u2019ve secured re-election, House Republicans have always fought for positive alternatives \u2013 not just repeals \u2013 that will provide economic security for Americans, while protecting patient choice and driving down health care costs.\n\nH.R. 3121, the American Health Care Reform Act, and H.R. 2300, the Empowering Patients First Act, both repeal the president\u2019s health care law but spur competition to lower health care costs and provide tax incentives for people to maintain health insurance.\n\nThese bills and others like them embody viable alternative models to ObamaCare.\n\nThese ideas include allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines, enabling small businesses to pool together and get the same buying power as large corporations, and allowing individuals to pool together to provide coverage through churches, alumni associations, trade associations, and other civic groups.\n\nSmart tax provisions would allow families and individuals to deduct health care costs, just like companies. Expanding, not retracting, access to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), would allow individuals to deposit even more of their income tax-free into savings accounts that they can use for health expenses.\n\nReforming medical malpractice laws would protect caring doctors who just want to practice medicine.\n\nAlternatives like these would also give greater flexibility to Medicare patients, tackle fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and address our doctor shortage by offering loans to medical students.\n\nThursday, the House will take up a bill I co-sponsored, H .R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, which will protect hard-working Americans from losing hours and wages as a result of the law\u2019s redefinition of the work week. American workers fought hard for the 40 hour work week. They shouldn\u2019t have to give it up just because the administration needs the money that would come to the federal government by way of fines to keep the ACA afloat.\n\nBut we should also keep what is good about the President\u2019s law by safeguarding individuals with pre-existing conditions through state-based high risk pools and extending HIPAA guaranteed availability protections. No one should be denied coverage based on a disease or ailment outside of their control.\n\nLike any piece of legislation, these ideas aren\u2019t perfect or complete. They need to be debated through the normal legislative process to fine-tune them to the needs of American health consumers. That\u2019s what was missing when the Affordable Care Act was passed four years ago: a thorough debate about what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nWhile the law was passed by one side of the aisle then, that shouldn\u2019t stop us from working together to truly reform our health care system. I hope Democrats will stop doubling down on promises that have proven impossible to keep, and join us in this fight to offer real economic security to struggling Americans.\n\nRandy Hultgren represents Illinois's 14th U.S. Congressional District.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31 01:04:37 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Thursday, the House will take up a bill I co-sponsored, H .R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, which will protect hard-working Americans from losing hours and wages as a result of the law\u2019s redefinition of the work week.", "twitter": {"description": "Thursday, the House will take up a bill I co-sponsored, H .R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, which will protect hard-working Americans from losing hours and wages as a result of the law\u2019s redefinition of the work week.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/04/03/why-am-co-sponsoring-save-american-workers-act.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/040314/0/0/hn_obamacare_040314.jpg?ve=1", "title": "No Republican alternatives to ObamaCare?
