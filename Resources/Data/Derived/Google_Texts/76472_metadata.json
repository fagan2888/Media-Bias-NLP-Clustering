Falls in the elderly cost $30 billion yearly to treat and can send them spiraling into poor health and disability.\n\nConventional efforts to prevent falls include exercises to boost strength and balance, but researchers at the University of Illinois in Chicago are trying a completely different approach. It\u2019s based on promising, preliminary results with a lab-built walkway that causes people to unexpectedly trip, as if stepping on a banana peel.\n\nNow the same scientists are testing a similar approach with computerized treadmills. If it works, they envision specially designed treadmills in doctors\u2019 offices, clinics and physical therapy centers for training people how to avoid falling.\n\nClive Pai, a physical therapy professor leading the research, calls the method a potential \u201cvaccine against falls.\u201d\n\nStandard fall prevention techniques aim to improve physical condition by strengthening certain muscles and improving range of motion. And they may require dozens of sessions to be effective, Pai said. His research is focusing on building subconscious learning, and evidence so far shows it can happen surprisingly fast.\n\n\u201cThis is all implicit learning. We don\u2019t give any instruction. They don\u2019t have to be motivated \u2014 they\u2019re naturally motivated because they don\u2019t want to be on the floor,\u201d he said.\n\nPai has a $1 million, five-year grant from the National Institute on Aging to study and develop the treadmill system, and plans to enroll 300 participants within the next five years.\n\nThe scientists demonstrated the technique recently in Pai\u2019s lab with 81-year-old Mary Kaye, who had participated in the preliminary walkway research. Graduate students taped little sensors to Kaye\u2019s arms and legs allow her movements to be tracked and analyzed. Then she was hooked up to a harness attached to an overhead cable to help her remain upright if needed.\n\nFirst, she used the walkway, striding several paces before a student clicked the computer mouse to make a sliding walkway section move suddenly under Kaye\u2019s feet. Kaye stumbled slightly, but kept her balance.\n\nPai\u2019s preliminary research, published in June, found that 24 similar \u201ctrips\u201d in just one walkway session taught older adults to learn to catch themselves and reduced their chances of falling outside the lab, during everyday living, by 50 percent up to a year later.\n\nBack in the lab, Kaye next tried the treadmill, set at a steady walking pace that was occasionally interrupted by sudden brief skips. Kaye stumbled at each jolt but managed to stay afoot. Pai thinks Kaye\u2019s training in the previous study may have helped keep her steady.\n\nRetired from the travel industry and public relations, Kaye is fit and healthy and looks a decade younger, but said she still occasionally falls \u2014 even after the training.\n\n\u201cI land on my face and it\u2019s usually quite disastrous \u2014 for my face. But I recover and I try to get through another season,\u201d she said.\n\nKaye tends to trip on Chicago\u2019s uneven sidewalks. The last time was earlier this year, when she landed on her face, splitting her lip and injuring her elbow \u2014 not bad enough to be hospitalized, but enough to scare her.\n\nKaye threw out all her ill-fitting shoes and said she hasn\u2019t fallen since.\n\nWHY PEOPLE FALL\n\nOlder people are at risk for falls for many reasons, including age-related muscle weakness, vision problems and medication issues including side effects and improper doses. Falls cause 95 percent of hip fractures, and one in five people with hip fractures die within a year of the injury, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Annually, falls among seniors are responsible for 20,000 deaths, 2.3 million visits to emergency rooms and more than $30 billion in direct medical costs.\n\nThe National Institute of Health announced in June that it is helping sponsor a $30 million study to test mostly conventional prevention techniques that can be tailored to older adults\u2019 individual risks and used in community settings. The government aims to enroll 6,000 adults aged 75 and up at 10 centers nationwide.\n\nPai\u2019s treadmill technique will likely need several years of study to prove whether it works. But Dr. Basil Eldadah of the National Institute on Aging said Pai\u2019s research is potentially very promising and the training technique might someday be incorporated into standard clinical care.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want older adults to learn the hard way,\u201d Eldadah said.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, death rates from falls rose 63 percent for men and 83 percent for women, according to the CDC.\n\nThere are hundreds of reasons why people fall; the CDC defines four categories: medicine, vision, environment, and balance and strength. But on an individual level, falling may have to do with specific medications, the way one\u2019s house is set up or something as simple as not taking off your reading glasses when walking.\n\nA study done at Britain\u2019s Nottingham University in 2010 looked at 204 adults older than 60 who had fallen and called an ambulance but were not taken to the hospital. Researchers concluded that screening those at risk and offering fall prevention services resulted in a sizable reduction \u2014 55 percent \u2014 in the rate of falls over the subsequent year.\n\nRita Wong, a professor of physical therapy at Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, says physical therapy can play a big role in helping prevent falls. When lecturing about fall prevention, she says, she finds some people who do not admit they are at risk and do not seek out resources.\n\nAnd there are others who have such a strong fear of falling that they stop functioning.\n\n\u201cThe logic is: If I don\u2019t get up, I\u2019m not going to fall,\u201d Wong said. \u201cAnd that is the worst thing you can do. If you don\u2019t move, you lose muscle tone, agility and balance, and it happens quickly. As you get older, it takes longer to recover.\u201d\n\nWong said it is important to show seniors not only how to exercise safely but also how to exercise more often. The old idea of keeping seniors in a chair for exercise was based on a fear of injury, she said, but even the most frail adults benefit from more vigorous exercise.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about falls in older adults \u2014 from age 60 to 100 \u2014 it is different building balance for someone 85 than someone 65,\u201d Wong said. \u201cIt is not just that they are older; it is also generational. The 85-year-olds never exercised, while most of the 65-year-olds have.\u201d\n\nHOW NOT TO FALL \u25a0 Get some exercise, including walking and stretching. Lack of exercise can lead to weak legs. Exercise programs such as tai chi can increase strength and improve balance. \u25a0 Review your medications; some medicines or combinations can have side effects such as dizziness or drowsiness. \u25a0 Get yearly vision exams to make sure eyes are healthy and glasses are the proper strength. \u25a0 Limit intake of alcohol, which can affect balance. \u25a0 Stand up slowly: Rising too quickly can sometimes result in a sudden drop in blood pressure, causing dizziness. \u25a0 Use a cane or walker if needed for steadiness. \u25a0 Eliminate hazards at home: Remove things you can trip over; install handrails and lights on all staircases; remove small throw rugs, or use double-sided tape to keep them from slipping; keep items you use often in cabinets you can reach easily without using a step stool; put grab bars inside and next to the tub or shower and next to the toilet; use non-slip mats in the bathtub and on shower floors; improve lighting; wear shoes both inside and outside the house; avoid going barefoot or wearing slippers.
