But over the years, districts have opted instead to keep those students on campus instead.\n\nAccording to the press release, the school districts and LifeCore \u201crealize how difficult this transition will be for everyone involved. LifeCore, Lee County Schools and Tupelo Public Schools will continue to work cooperatively as we transition students to their home districts. As we progress, our goal in these new settings will be to enhance the quality of services our students receive.\u201d\n\nemma.crawford@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @emcrawfordkent", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Emma Crawford Kent Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Students who attend the McDougal Center will move to classrooms on school campuses starting next school year as the center will close its doors after more than 40 years in Tupelo.
