Whether he hopes that involves winning the party\u2019s presidential nomination \u2013 and when \u2013 is less clear. But he\u2019s probably aiming at 2020, not 2016.\n\nThose are our takeaways from Monday\u2019s new chatter about the political future of the wunderkind speaker of the House, in any case.\n\nThe hallway talk we\u2019re referring to is the result of a lengthy piece in Sunday\u2019s New York Times that dubs Speaker Ryan the GOP\u2019s \u201cmirage candidate.\u201d It doesn\u2019t directly say that the Wisconsin member of Congress is positioning himself as a shiny savior for a deadlocked 2016 Republican National Convention. But it does imply that he\u2019s aiming to market himself as the face of the party if Donald Trump or even Ted Cruz emerges as the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nRecommended: So you think you know Congress? Take our quiz.\n\nRyan is drawing up a policy agenda that he\u2019ll roll out prior to the convention as a sort of shadow party platform, according to the Times. That will allegedly include a health plan to replace Obamacare and a new antipoverty program.\n\nAs the chairman of the convention he\u2019ll get a lot of airtime \u2013 and face time with delegates. If Trump emerges victorious he\u2019ll provide alternative party leadership for elected officials looking to hold onto their seats.\n\n\u201cMr. Ryan is creating a personality and policy alternative to run alongside the presidential effort \u2013 one that provides a foundation to rebuild if Republicans splinter and lose in the fall,\u201d writes the Times\u2019s Jennifer Steinhauer.\n\nThe key word there may be \u201close.\u201d Ryan, like many Republican lawmakers with ties to the donors, lobbyists and thinkfluencers who constitute the party elite, may well believe that 2016 is fast slipping away. If Mr. Trump wins the nomination, he\u2019ll get clobbered. If he loses it, Ted Cruz \u2013 or whoever else inherits the prize \u2013 will get clobbered as well, because Trump will split the party. Just imagine Trump\u2019s call-ins to \"Fox & Friends\" and the talk about \u201cstealing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why we discount the talk about Ryan stepping in as the party\u2019s savior at a contested convention in Cleveland. First, Ryan knows the prize might be damaged. Second, that\u2019s unrealistic \u2013 not just Trump, but Senator Cruz and even Ohio Gov. John Kasich would fight hard to keep someone who never ran in the primaries from being entered into nomination.\n\nThird, that\u2019s not Ryan\u2019s plan anyway. He\u2019s got a different date in mind. We agree with Paul Waldman at The Week: Everything Ryan is doing adds up to someone who has already decided to run in 2020 in the wake of an epic Trump disaster.\n\n\u201cRyan is running for president. Just not this year,\u201d writes Waldman.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ryan just traveled to Israel for a high-profile visit to build his foreign policy credentials, even as he can\u2019t get his own budget passed in the House at home. (The same conservatives that made John Boehner\u2019s life a living heck are blocking the Ryan-promoted budget because they think it spends too much.)\n\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s promoting a soon-to-arrive Obamacare replacement plan. Of course, he\u2019s been promising that for years, and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Maybe this time is the charm.\n\nOr maybe we\u2019re wrong, and Ryan is set to gavel in the convention, watch chaos unfold, and then deftly wrest the prize from Trump\u2019s commodious hands. We\u2019ve got a lobbyist friend who thinks we\u2019re naive to believe Ryan has little chance this time around.\n\nHmm. A consummate insider who believes in immigration reform of some type and free trade pacts, winning the party nomination in a year when a majority of GOP voters have backed anti-immigration outsiders? Nope. Still don\u2019t see it happening.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "5abc9227cfe3ce116d8a8798ea826c77", "sailthru.author": "Peter Grier", "description": "Everything Ryan is doing adds up to someone who has already decided to run \u2013 in 2020.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/04/974765_1_0409-ryan_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "Everything Ryan is doing adds up to someone who has already decided to run \u2013 in 2020.", "title": "Has Paul Ryan got his eye on 2016 \u2013 or 2020?", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2016/0411/Has-Paul-Ryan-got-his-eye-on-2016-or-2020", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/04/974765_1_0409-ryan_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/04/974765_1_0409-ryan_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "title": "Has Paul Ryan got his eye on 2016 \u2013 or 2020?", "description": "Everything Ryan is doing adds up to someone who has already decided to run \u2013 in 2020.", "card": "summary", "site": "@csmonitor"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-11", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-11T17:28:36-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/Decoder/2016/0411/Has-Paul-Ryan-got-his-eye-on-2016-or-2020", "sailthru.tags": "section-decoder,section-politics,section-usa,class-blog-post,storysource-monitor", "article": {"section": "Decoder", "published_time": "2016-04-11T17:28-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "J.
