This is especially important for Asian Americans, who get Type 2 diabetes at higher rates \u2014 and at lower weights \u2014 than their Caucasian counterparts.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem with diabetes is that people don\u2019t even know they have it,\u201d said Dr. Atul Butte, an associate professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine. With Dr. Keiichi Kodama and other study authors, he is trying to figure out how genetic differences might explain the higher incidence of this potentially deadly but preventable disease in some ethnicities.\n\nMany people develop Type 2 as adults due to a combination of age, weight and genetic predisposition. It is defined as insulin resistance: a body becomes unable to properly use insulin and, as a result, builds up excessively high levels of blood sugar.\n\nThe Stanford researchers found that ethnic background plays a surprisingly large role in how diabetes develops, concluding that the genetic risk is highest for Africans and decreases along the global path that the first humans took as they migrated out of Africa toward East Asia.\n\nBut the research raised a caution flag for East Asians, who were to found to have more difficulty secreting enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels, as well as low pancreatic beta cell function. As they get older and gain weight, the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases. Caucasians are in between Africans and East Asians when it comes to insulin sensitivity.\n\n\u201cIf Asians get even any little bit of insulin resistance, they plummet to diabetes because they don\u2019t have any reserve to make more,\u201d Dr. Butte said.\n\n\u201cRight now, we think of diabetes as one disease with one set of drugs, or one common panel of drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we\u2019re suggesting is that maybe there\u2019s two diseases here, two different ways to get diabetes. Instead of treating an African with diabetes the same as an Asian, maybe we should have specific therapies for each ethnicity.\u201d\n\nNeil Bhatiya, a policy associate at the Century Foundation in New York, has an Indian father and a European mother. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2004 while in college. He wasn\u2019t experiencing any worrisome symptoms at the time of diagnosis, which is common, but the disease was detected through blood work.\n\nNow when he goes to see new physicians, \u201cThey\u2019ll tell me that I\u2019m the thinnest Type 2 they\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Bhatiya said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to doctors about it before,\u201d he added, \u201cand have not gotten the best explanation for why that would be, other than them guessing that has something to do with genetics.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Dr. Greeshma Shetty of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston believes a barrier to early detection for Asian-Americans is that many appear at low risk based on their body mass index and weight. \u201cBut even with a slightly elevated weight, they carry a much higher risk for developing diabetes,\u201d she said.\n\nCheck out additional in-depth coverage of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s local impact: \u201cPeninsula Press Special Report, Obamacare on the Peninsula.\u201d\n\nFor recent immigrants, an abundance of U.S. junk foods and a reduction in physical activity can contribute to a rise in both obesity and diabetes, according to Dr Shetty. Add to that Asian diets high in rice and other carbohydrates, coupled with a dining style that favors family-size portions.\n\nAll experts agree that prevention is key. On the Peninsula, some members of the Asian-American community are working to help others access preventative health care, which will assist those at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nA Vietnamese community health fair in San Jose in early October saw long lines around a table dedicated to diabetes screening. Technicians spoke in Vietnamese and English as they poked fingers free of charge.\n\nThe outreach from San Jose-based Bascom Pharmacy was one example of how the local Asian-American community is acting to address the problem, which can be compounded by language barriers and limited understanding about diabetes in their country of origin.\n\nCommunity liaisons like Channary, a San Jose web designer and member of the Cambodian Women\u2019s Association, help bridge these gaps. \u201cWhen they immigrate to America, they have no knowledge of diabetes at all,\u201d Channary said of her fellow Cambodians, whom she assists with translating from Khmer to English during their doctor\u2019s visits.\n\nShe also has worked to sign up Cambodian community members for Covered California, the state\u2019s new insurance marketplace.\n\n\u201cMany of them have worked quite hard through their lives \u2014but their job was very low-paying, so they lived day to day, month to month,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no job anymore, they couldn\u2019t buy insurance, and they didn\u2019t qualify for Medi-Cal before, because they weren\u2019t sick or disabled. I think this gives them a chance to see a doctor.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared on the Peninsula Press\u2019 special report website, \u201cObamacare on the Peninsula.\u201d\n\nFollow the Peninsula Press on Facebook and Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Peninsula Press", "og": {"site_name": "Local: In The Peninsula", "description": "By Faine Greenwood, Peninsula Press At health fairs, community clinics and even 5K fun runs, preventative care is a refrain that Bay Area Asian Americans hear a lot these days.
