A Health and Human Services regulation defines \"full-time\" as 30 hours, rather than the typical 40-hour workweek, so the students and other part-time employees -- who used to work up to 35 hours a week -- are having their hours cut. (Ferguson said they're capping the weekly hours in 2014 even though the administration delayed the mandate until 2015 because Christendom's fiscal year runs from July 2014 to July 2015.)\n\nUnder the new policy, part-time employees of the college can work no more than 29 hours per week. \"All of our part time workers will be reduced to 29 hours as a consequence of Obamacare Employer Mandates,\" college spokesman Niall O'Donnell told the Washington Examiner. \"We are the largest employer in Warren County and this law will affect hundreds of employees and have a negative effect on the local economy as a consequence.\"\n\nAs Christendom students are having their hours cut due to Obamacare, so they also lost the health insurance provided by the college before the law's enactment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Christendom College students, along with the rest of the school's part-time employees, will have their hours cut as a result of the health insurance mandate in Obamacare.\nIt would bankrupt the college, chief operations officer Ken Ferguson told the Washington Examiner during a Wednesday phone interview.
