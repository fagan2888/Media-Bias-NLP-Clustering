President Barack Obama isn't making decisions on major world events because he isn't capable of doing so, retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters says.Peters, appearing Tuesday on Fox News Channel's "Hannity," said he had long complained that Obama wouldn't make a decision on the threat of the Islamic State (ISIS).Now, he said, "I'm starting to feel like he can't make a decision, that we have a president who has a real psychological problem, that he can't face responsibility."Peters said Obama has "remarkably little curiosity about the world," which may explain why he reportedly ignored his own daily briefings over the past year that ISIS was a growing threat.Obama was "throwing away the tremendously hard-won inputs our intelligence community was trying to send to the White House," Peters said. "We may just have a president who is just incapable of rising to the challenges of the office."As a result, the world sees the United States as weak and indecisive, he said. "They think we're afraid. They think the American people have turned into cowards."Obama won't call Russia's invasion of Ukraine an invasion because he had said there would be consequences if Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, and he won't say we are at war with Islamic terrorists even though the terrorists themselves say we are, Peters said.ISIS has now grown so strong in Syria and Iraq that even if the United States acts decisively now, the war will last "beyond our lifetimes because of the utter collapse of Middle Eastern civilization." he said. "It's gone over the cliff."
