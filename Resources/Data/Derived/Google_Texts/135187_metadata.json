Take, for example, the credo of the Space Frontier Foundation, an American nonprofit advocacy group \u201cdedicated to opening the Space Frontier to human settlement as rapidly as possible \u2026 creating a freer and more prosperous life for each generation by using the unlimited energy and material resources of space.\u201d Such rhetoric reveals an ideology of human spaceflight\u2014a set of beliefs about the nation\u2019s right to expand its boundaries, colonize other lands and exploit their resources.\n\nThis ideology rests on a number of assumptions about the role of the U.S. in the global community and American national character. According to this ideology, the U.S. is and must remain \u201cnumber one\u201d in the world community, playing the role of political, economic, scientific, technological and moral leader, spreading democratic capitalism. The metaphor of the frontier, with its associated images of pioneering, homesteading, claim staking and taming, looms large in this belief system.\n\nThe rhetoric of human spaceflight advances a conception of outer space as a place of wide-open spaces and limitless resources\u2014a space frontier. From John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama, U.S. presidents have embraced this rhetoric of frontier conquest and exploitation. So have nasa administrators, members of Congress and decades of expert panels.\n\nI have heard a White House official tout a concept for large-scale industrialization of the moon as \u201ca phenomenally inspiring long-term vision\u201d for the U.S. space program. The invitation-only Pioneering Space National Summit, held in February in Washington, D.C., yielded a declaration that \u201cthe long-term goal of the human spaceflight and exploration program of the United States is to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and to do so in a way that will enable human settlement and a thriving space economy.\u201d One of the groups that participated in this summit, the Tea Party in Space, advocates \u201capplying the core principles of fiscal responsibility, limited government, and free markets to the rapid and permanent expansion of American civilization into the space frontier.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Manifest destiny does not apply to the cosmos", "title": "Why is there so much toxic jingoism behind American spaceflight?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Manifest destiny does not apply to the cosmos", "title": "Why is there so much toxic jingoism behind American spaceflight?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/25/why_is_there_so_much_toxic_jingoism_behind_american_spaceflight_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/shutterstock_147184976-600x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Manifest destiny does not apply to the cosmos", "title": "Why is there so much toxic jingoism behind American spaceflight?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/shutterstock_147184976-600x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Linda Billings", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American Exceptionalism, innovation, Jingoism, Science, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07cd\"", "article_summary": "Topics: American Exceptionalism, innovation, Jingoism, Science, Scientific American, Innovation NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanThroughout the history of the U.S. human spaceflight program, a peculiarly American rhetoric of manifest destiny, frontier conquest and exploitation has dominated official and public discourse.\nThe rhetoric of human spaceflight advances a conception of outer space as a place of wide-open spaces and limitless resources\u2014a space frontier.\nI have heard a White House official tout a concept for large-scale industrialization of the moon as \u201ca phenomenally inspiring long-term vision\u201d for the U.S. space program.\nThis ideology rests on a number of assumptions about the role of the U.S. in the global community and American national character.\nFrom John F.
