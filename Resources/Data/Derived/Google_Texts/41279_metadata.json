Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Monday said the Republican Congress should replace Obamacare with a system he said the United States enjoyed for years, even though it has slipped into disuse.\n\n\u201cWe could try freedom for a while,\u201d Paul said on Fox News Monday night. \u201cWe had it for a long time. That\u2019s where you sell something and I agree to buy it because I like it. That\u2019s how we operate in most of the rest of the marketplace, other than healthcare.\u201d\n\nPaul simple reply was in response to a question from Fox host Greta Van Susteren, who asked him \u201cwhat would happen to the American people\u201d if Obamacare went away.\n\n\u201cWe could try freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it might work. It works everywhere else.\u201d\n\nPaul predicted that the Republican House and Senate would pass another bill to fully repeal Obamacare and send it to President Barack Obama. Even if that bill were vetoed, as is widely expected, Paul said Congress would likely try to repeal smaller parts of the law.\n\nHouse Republicans have already said they would call up two bills in the coming days that would repeal parts of Obamacare that the GOP says are bad for American workers.\n\nPaul said a full or partial repeal of Obamacare wouldn\u2019t mean the government completely stops helping Americans cover their health care costs. But he said it would stop an expensive expansion of that government assistance, which he said would have ruinous effect on the nation\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cWhat Obamacare did was take some of the things we did for the poor, and then they expanded government to basically the whole marketplace,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat, I think, will ultimately bankrupt the country and then nobody will have good healthcare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Sen.
