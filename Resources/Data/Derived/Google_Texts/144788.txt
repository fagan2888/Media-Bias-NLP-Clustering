Wedged between two boarded buildings at the North Prieur stop of the RTA 32 is 1931 Orleans Ave. -- a two-story building that, for as long as anyone who drinks there can say, has been a barroom: liquor on one side, music on the other.

The name was once Bocats Lounge and before that, the Be 4 Real. But times change and so does the neighborhood, shaken by Hurricane Katrina and its bulldozers. Now the name is the Ooh Poo Pah Doo Bar, for the call-and-response song hummed across the city by anyone who misses Carnival.

"Ooh Poo Pah Doo" may have been pressed into vinyl by generations of musicians, but the original was recorded a few blocks away by Jessie Hill. On Friday at 6 p.m., Hill's widow Dorothy smoked in the back while his daughter Judy tended bar in front, keeping time with a pack of Salem 100's. Hill's grandsons -- James and Troy Andrews (a.k.a. Trombone Shorty) -- have played their grandfather's song on a stage in the corner walled in by mirrors.

The smoking ban, which begins April 22, was hardly hanging over a barroom that no other event in the city's history has bruised. "We're going to pack our cigarettes like a suitcase and we'll smoke outside," said Judy Hill. "I'm going to roll however they roll."

Up and down the bar on Friday evening, Hill's regulars were ready to roll with her. Ernest Mack and Richard "Buster" Derbigny -- both 66, natives of the neighborhood -- couldn't imagine leaving the spot. Neither could Ernie Vincent, Judy Hill's cousin, who as a guitarist has spent much of his life in smoky barrooms.

Like the "Ooh Poo Pah Doo," which sounds different through every pair of lips, so too the bar has gotten a revamp with every owner. The jukebox, now digital with a touch screen, still stocks the old hits. And Hill can sing every lyric, every beat of Otis Redding's "Cigarettes and Coffee": "Just let me enjoy, help me to enjoy, this good time that we'll have, baby."
