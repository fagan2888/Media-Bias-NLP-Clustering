Collect $10.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, he finished runner-up in the celebrity-athletes golf tournament at Lake Tahoe and was irked again.\n\nWOODY\u2019S MAILBAG: Pose a question for Woody to answer on The Sports Show\n\nHe has been runner-up for the Heisman Trophy, the California high school player of the year, the NFL MVP, the league\u2019s executive of the year, the all-NFL team (three times), the starting quarterback at the Pro Bowl (four times), the AFC West title (three times) and in the Super Bowl as a player or the team\u2019s executive vice president of football operations (four times).\n\nJack Nicklaus finished second in 19 majors.\n\nBut he won 18.\n\nJohn doesn\u2019t accept losing, either. That\u2019s the fact, Jack. John was an NFL MVP, a Super Bowl MVP, the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, a first-team college All-American, a Parade magazine high school All-American, a Pro Bowl player (nine times), 1990s first-team all-NFL quarterback, a division champion (seven times), a unanimous first-ballot Hall of Famer and a world champion (twice).\n\nIf Elway isn\u2019t the executive of this year, Congress should order an investigation.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t care a whit. Elway has only one goal \u2014 the world championship.\n\nJohn is the sole NFL executive VP-general manager in the Super Bowl era to win a division title in each of his first four years. In Elway\u2019s regime since 2011, the Broncos have compiled a 45-17 regular-season record (19-4 in the AFC West) and an overall mark of 48-20 (70.6 percent).\n\nIn the draft, Elway, picking at 31, chose Bradley Roby, the last of five cornerbacks taken in the first round. Roby has produced the best season of the bunch. Twelve other rookies are on the Broncos\u2019 roster, injured-reserve list and practice squad.\n\nOf the 22 starters for the Cincinnati game Monday night, 19 have been brought to Denver by Elway and his staff. Eight are Pro Bowl contenders.\n\nTHE SPORTS SHOW: Watch Woody and Les on Monday-Friday, 1-3 p.m.\n\nEveryone was aware of the signings splash of the Big Three free agents (DeMarcus Ware, Aqib Talib and T.J. Ward), and The Steal Deal of Emmanuel Sanders, but the rescues of center Will Montgomery and defensive lineman Marvin Austin Jr. off the scrap heap also were inspired.\n\nThe Elway Entourage also was responsible for college free agents Chris Harris, C.J. Anderson and This Brandon Marshall. Oh, Elway got Pot Roast and Peyton too. And the Elway stamp came down hard on the coaches and players last month as the Broncos were blown out in New England and almost shut out at St. Louis.\n\nThere would be no more runner-up, second-class attitude.\n\nIt was either the El-Way or the highway. He ordered:\n\n\u2022 No more mess on the offensive line, particularly at right tackle. The Broncos would insert Montgomery at center and move Manny Ramirez to right guard and Louis Vasquez, an all-pro at any position, to tackle.\n\n\u2022 No more games of 57, 49 and 54 passes, and no more rushing days of 36, 43 and 28 yards. The Broncos would place significant emphasis on the run, as they did in the two seasons the team won the Super Bowl.\n\n\u2022 No more passive defense with fewer turnovers than the opposition. The Broncos would blitz and attack.\n\n\u2022 No more lousy special-teams play. The Broncos would change kickers and return men.\n\n\u2022 No more games of stupid double-digit penalties. The Broncos would play smart.\n\nIn the past four games the Broncos have rushed for more than 200 yards twice, more than 110 in the other two. They had 822 yards passing, 659 rushing. At 55.6 to 44.4, the percentage is much closer to the 60-40 sought.\n\nThe Broncos committed only nine, five, five and seven penalties and coerced one, three, three and two turnovers during that span.\n\nThe Broncos are blitzing, not Blitzen.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 offensive line has been stabilized and solidified, and no longer is \u201chorrible.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 new two-kicker system has been copacetic, Omar Bolden is outstanding on kickoff returns, and the Broncos aren\u2019t fumbling punts.\n\nThe Broncos have won four straight games.\n\nAs a softspoken Peyton Manning said last Sunday in San Diego, the Broncos are guaranteed a place in the playoffs and have a shot. Terrance Knighton was more outspoken, telling The Denver Post\u2019s Mark Kiszla the Broncos will \u201choist\u201d the Super Bowl trophy.\n\nJohn Elway wants champs, not runner-up chumps.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: To John Elway, runners-up don\u2019t have super seasons", "title": "Paige: To John Elway, runners-up don\u2019t have super seasons", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/paige-to-john-elway-runners-up-dont-have-super-seasons/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_103615_john-elway.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_103615_john-elway.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T19:34:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:37:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefac\"", "article_summary": "Terrance Knighton was more outspoken, telling The Denver Post\u2019s Mark Kiszla the Broncos will \u201choist\u201d the Super Bowl trophy.\nJohn is the sole NFL executive VP-general manager in the Super Bowl era to win a division title in each of his first four years.\nJohn was an NFL MVP, a Super Bowl MVP, the No.\nThe Broncos would place significant emphasis on the run, as they did in the two seasons the team won the Super Bowl.\nOf the 22 starters for the Cincinnati game Monday night, 19 have been brought to Denver by Elway and his staff."}
