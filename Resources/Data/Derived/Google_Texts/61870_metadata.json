John Kasich\u2019s cuts to local government funding have been nothing like the disaster critics describe, according to a report from the free market Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions.\n\nBuckeye Institute Statehouse Liaison and Policy Analyst Greg Lawson reviewed local tax data and found that 80 of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties have \u201crainy day\u201d funds of more than 5 percent of their previous fiscal years\u2019 general revenue funds, as do roughly nine of every 10 cities and villages.\n\nStatewide, municipal income tax revenue increased by $230 million in 2012 and municipal sales tax revenue increased by $80 million in 2013 \u2014 even though only a few new local tax levies or rate increases have been enacted since 2011.\n\nThe Kasich administration\u2019s largest cuts to local government support came from a fund that \u201crepresented less than five cents on every dollar of total state support for local entities\u201d and \u201conly a bit over 1 percent of the total local revenues\u201d when Gov. Kasich took office, Lawson explained.\n\n\u201cAdvocates of big government believe that economic growth is best achieved through the tax-and-spend powers of the state,\u201d Lawson wrote in Buckeye\u2019s Sept. 4 report.\n\n\u201cThus, they continue to champion revenue sharing schemes like the Local Government Fund (LGF), the Tangible Personal Property Tax (TPP), and the Public Utility Tangible Property Tax (PUTP) reimbursement programs that take tax revenues from throughout the state and redistribute those funds,\u201d Lawson continued.\n\n\u201cFor decades the state has used various subsidy programs like these to prop-up the dizzying labyrinth of over 6,000 different local governmental entities at the cost of significant prosperity and job growth. Unfortunately, these programs have proven time and again to be inefficient paths to economic growth, and have the dubious distinction of creating moral hazards and undermining local control and fiscal accountability,\u201d Lawson wrote.\n\nOhio Education Association and smaller labor unions have attacked Kasich\u2019s local government cuts with a drumbeat of op-eds, rallies and social media posts. Unions have been aided in these efforts by We Are Ohio and other labor front groups including Ohioans United, Moving Ohio Forward, and One Ohio Now.\n\nOne Ohio Now\u2019s \u201cCuts Hurt Ohio\u201d website, which is based on research from union think tanks Policy Matters Ohio and Innovation Ohio, lists a county-by-county breakdown of state spending cuts, imploring the state to \u201cinvest in our future!\u201d\n\nOhio Democrats, meanwhile, have campaigned on the unions\u2019 talking points, calling for fewer tax cuts and more state spending on local government.\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s cuts are squeezing budgets for our cities, towns, and villages,\u201d Democrat gubernatorial candidate Ed FitzGerald wrote in a September 6 Facebook post.\n\n\u201cSeen an increase in levies on your ballot? That\u2019s thanks to Kasich,\u201d FitzGerald asserted.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the long-term fiscal health of the state\u2019s local governments will be determined by Ohio\u2019s economic growth, not by perpetual state subsidies or the redistributive preferences embodied in revenue sharing,\u201d Lawson wrote in last week\u2019s Buckeye Institute report.\n\n\u201cBy slowly beginning to reform Ohio\u2019s revenue sharing system, Ohio policymakers are embracing a new approach to government spending that will empower local taxpayers to assert greater control over local decisions and facilitate local governments re-thinking how they operate,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cOver time, this shift should lead to more fiscal discipline from government at every level, and more space for the private sector to create the economic growth and opportunities Ohio needs.\u201d\n\nUpon taking office in 2011, Kasich, a Republican, refused to stop the phase-in of tax cuts initiated under Republican Gov. Bob Taft. In addition to signing a gradual repeal of the estate tax, Kasich reduced state funding of local governments to cover a shortfall left by Gov. Ted Strickland, his Democratic predecessor.\n\nStrickland\u2019s 2010-2011 budget was balanced using over $3 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Even as municipal tax revenues have rebounded from the 2007 recession, unions and Democrats have demanded state taxpayers fill the gap left in the wake of President Obama\u2019s \u201cstimulus.\u201d\n\nThe full Buckeye Institute report, \u201cRevenue Sharing Reform: On the Road to Ohio\u2019s Recovery,\u201d is available on the think tank\u2019s website.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio Governor John Kasich's cuts to local government funding have been nothing like the disaster critics describe, according to a new report from the free market Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions.", "title": "Buckeye Institute puts Ohio's local government cuts in context", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/we-are-ohio-facebook-2013-12-21.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-10T07:41:29+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/169041/buckeye-institute-puts-ohios-local-government-cuts-context/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Budget and Spending", "tag": "Bob Taft,Buckeye Institute,Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions,Budget + Tax,Ed FitzGerald,Greg Lawson,John Kasich,Local Government Fund,Moving Ohio Forward,Ohioans United,One Ohio Now,Ted Strickland,We Are Ohio", "published_time": "2014-09-08T08:32:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-10T07:41:29+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio Governor John Kasich's cuts to local government funding have been nothing like the disaster critics describe, according to a new report from the free market Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions.", "title": "Buckeye Institute puts Ohio's local government cuts in context", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/we-are-ohio-facebook-2013-12-21.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Ohio Governor John Kasich's cuts to local government funding have been nothing like the disaster critics describe, according to a new report from the free market Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6e5\"", "article_summary": "Statewide, municipal income tax revenue increased by $230 million in 2012 and municipal sales tax revenue increased by $80 million in 2013 \u2014 even though only a few new local tax levies or rate increases have been enacted since 2011.\nJohn Kasich\u2019s cuts to local government funding have been nothing like the disaster critics describe, according to a report from the free market Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions.\nIn addition to signing a gradual repeal of the estate tax, Kasich reduced state funding of local governments to cover a shortfall left by Gov.\nOhio Education Association and smaller labor unions have attacked Kasich\u2019s local government cuts with a drumbeat of op-eds, rallies and social media posts.\n\u201cAdvocates of big government believe that economic growth is best achieved through the tax-and-spend powers of the state,\u201d Lawson wrote in Buckeye\u2019s Sept. 4 report."}
