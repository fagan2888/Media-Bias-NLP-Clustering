At the end of the 1973 tearjerker The Way We Were, the estranged couple played by Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford reunite by chance outside the Plaza Hotel in New York. As the score swells and they stare reverently into each other’s eyes, Streisand’s Katie tells Redford, “Your girl is lovely, Hubbell,” revealing that essentially, Hubbell has become a deadbeat dad since the two divorced and that Katie has spent the intervening years raising their daughter without him. But Hubbell’s abandonment of his child is a mostly forgotten footnote to The Way We Were — his absenteeism is folded into the movie’s sentimental coda, and viewers tend to fixate not on Hubbell’s desertion but on the epic romance that once was.
