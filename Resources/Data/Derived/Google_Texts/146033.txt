President Obama is picking Kansas to win the NCAA’s men’s basketball title, hoping to correctly predict the champion for just the second time during his presidency.

"I'm putting Kansas in here,” Obama told ESPN’s Andy Katz in an interview that aired Wednesday. “I think the Jayhawks in a squeaker get past UNC.”

The president also picked Kansas to win in 2010 and 2011, but Duke and Connecticut won those years, respectively.

During his first year in office, Obama predicted North Carolina would win the tournament, but he has not forecasted accurately in the six years that followed.

Obama has Kansas knocking off three-seed Texas A&M in the Final Four and North Carolina defeating Michigan State on the other side of the bracket.

The president mostly picked favorites to win but penciled in one major upset in his bracket, picking 13th-seed Hawaii to beat four-seed California.
