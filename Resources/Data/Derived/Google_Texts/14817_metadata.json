Much larger Dayton, by comparison, paid 68 employees six figures last year.\n\n\"We did have an increase for firefighters in overtime last year,\" said city manager Mark Schwieterman in an interview this week.\n\nSchwieterman said the main factor fueling exploding growth in overtime pay for firefighters was staffing changes made to cope with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSchwieterman said the city got rid of volunteer firefighters in 2015 and had to cut hours to part-time firefighters to comply with federal healthcare mandates that employees on the clock for more than 28 hours a week -- even if they're on standby pay -- be provided health insurance.\n\nThis means the full-time firefighters had to work more overtime to maintain fire protection.\n\nOf the 105 city employees who made more than $100,000 last year, 34 were in the fire department.\n\n\"Unlike a position in an administrative office where you cover with other staff with no overtime, in fire if we have to fill a position, then we have to fill a position and have three people on the truck to meet those minimum standards,\" he said.\n\nThere were 43 Kettering police department employees among those making more than $100,000 last year, though they didn't get as much overtime as their fire department counterparts.\n\nA full story on the city of Kettering's payroll costs, how it compares to other governments, what's driving it and what's being done about it is coming this week.\n\nGo here for a searchable database of 2014 payroll for local governments, now updated with 2015 payroll with Kettering and many other local governments.\n\nThe I-Team will continue to add local governments to this database as they come in.\n\nCopyright 2016 - Dayton Daily News, Ohio", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kettering's manager can't hire part-time firefighters because of the Affordable Care Act, so overtime went up.", "og": {"site_name": "Firehouse", "description": "Kettering's manager can't hire part-time firefighters because of the Affordable Care Act, so overtime went up.", "title": "Payroll project: Kettering firefighters cash in on OT | Firehouse", "url": "http://www.firehouse.com/news/12186822/payroll-project-kettering-firefighters-cash-in-on-ot", "image": {"width": 50, "identifier": "http://r2.firehouse.com/files/media/www.firehouse.com/beta/site_logo_fb.png", "height": 50}, "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 231310240241402}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Go here for a searchable database of 2014 payroll for local governments, now updated with 2015 payroll with Kettering and many other local governments.\nThey were among the 105 city employees whose gross wages exceeded $100,000 last year, an increase from 69 in 2014.\nThe I-Team will continue to add local governments to this database as they come in.\nOf the 105 city employees who made more than $100,000 last year, 34 were in the fire department.\n\"We did have an increase for firefighters in overtime last year,\" said city manager Mark Schwieterman in an interview this week."}
