(Mr. Rubio, as the former speaker of the Florida House, was one of the exceptions to the 2010 citizen legislator trend.)\n\nThis year, Mr. Rubio added, the new senators seem driven more by policy. \u201cThey\u2019re coming up here not just to be against things, but to do things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very positive aspect of this class.\u201d\n\nIf the new Republican senators seem handpicked from a Republican establishment wish list, that is because in many cases, they were.\n\nDan Sullivan, who defeated Senator Mark Begich in Alaska, was backed early by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads. His pedigree includes an undergraduate degree from Harvard, two stints in the second Bush administration and tenures as Alaska\u2019s attorney general and commissioner of natural resources.\n\nWhen his campaign needed a jolt this year, he called in a favor from one of the most recognizable figures in the Republican Party: Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state. Ms. Rice agreed to film an ad in which she looked straight into the camera and said, \u201cAmerica needs Dan Sullivan.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is also Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who beat primary opponents who were more stridently conservative on issues with the help of party elders. Mr. Tillis, who defeated Senator Kay Hagan, is the speaker of the State House in Raleigh and has been in the legislature for four terms.\n\nPhoto\n\nMike Rounds, who will become South Dakota\u2019s new senator, was the state\u2019s governor for eight years and the majority leader of the State Senate for six years before that.\n\nBen Sasse, the senator-elect from Nebraska, has attracted a lot of attention on the right as a rising star of the Republican Party\u2019s conservative wing. National Review lionized him on its cover early this year as \u201cObamacare\u2019s Nebraska Nemesis.\u201d\n\nYet in many ways, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 does not fit the mold of an anti-establishment Tea Party politician. He went to Harvard, where he received a degree in government. After graduation, he spent time as a consultant, then eventually returned to school and earned a Ph.D. in history from Yale. (His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has some overlap with a fellow incoming Republican senator, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a congressman who also went to Harvard and was in the consulting business.)\n\nMr. Sasse held two jobs in the Bush administration, one with the Justice Department and another with the Department of Health and Human Services. In between, he was a Capitol Hill chief of staff, working for Representative Jeff Fortenberry, Republican of Nebraska. Mr. Sasse\u2019s most recent job was as president of a small liberal arts college.\n\nThat the new Republican Senate class will have so many members with deep government experience is somewhat by design. Republicans, under the direction of the incoming majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, sought early on to weed out candidates who were unpredictable and untested and could spoil their chances of winning the majority.\n\nMr. McConnell wanted to make sure that his prospective new senators were not going to prove as unmanageable as some of his more go-it-alone members like Ted Cruz of Texas, so he met with many of them early to talk them into running. Within days of the 2012 elections, in which Republicans failed to win the White House and lost seats in both houses of Congress, Mr. McConnell called Representative Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia into his office to press her to run for the Senate. He also sought out Mr. Cotton of Arkansas, a first-term congressman, not long after he was sworn in last year.\n\nLast week, as the freshmen toured the Capitol, found their way to their temporary offices and listened to seminars on Senate history as part of their orientation, the vetting was evident. Those who took questions from the news media were uniformly on-message: We are here to get things done, not to obstruct.\n\n\u201cAll of us, I think, have a real interest in getting results,\u201d Mr. Rounds said.\n\n\u201cGovern competently, govern maturely,\u201d said Representative Cory Gardner of Colorado, who defeated Senator Mark Udall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say we\u2019re opposed,\u201d said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, who will replace Senator Tom Coburn when he retires at the end of this Congress. \u201cBut just being opposed to things means you still have the same problem.\u201d\n\nThough Mr. Lankford was alien to politics before he was elected in 2010 \u2014 for a decade he ran a Baptist youth camp \u2014 he did not, like many in his class, turn into a Tea Party die-hard.\n\nMr. Gardner, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Cotton and Ms. Capito are four of the five Republicans in the House who will move to the other side of the Rotunda in January. The fifth is Steve Daines of Montana.\n\nJoni Ernst, a Republican Iowa state senator, will also join the freshman class. David Perdue, a former chief executive of Dollar General and the Republican who won the open seat in Georgia, will be the only new senator without a government background. Gary Peters of Michigan, the lone freshman Democrat, is now a congressman representing the Detroit area.\n\nMr. Daines and Mr. Cotton have been in Congress only one term. Ms. Capito was a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates before being elected to Congress in 2000. Mr. Gardner, too, served in Colorado\u2019s legislature for five years before he was elected to Congress in 2010. In an interview, Mr. Gardner said he was not na\u00efve about how quickly political fortunes could shift.\n\n\u201cThe temperament of the electorate is getting shorter,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American public is no longer giving people time to turn the ship around. They\u2019re wanting it done in two years. So in two years if we don\u2019t perform, the same kind of wave election is coming back in 2016 except in the opposite direction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141115153641, "twitter": {"description": "When Republicans take over the Senate in January, most of the members of the party\u2019s freshman class will be people whose careers blossomed in the government bureaucracy that some politicians loathe.", "title": "New Senators Tilt G.O.P.
