Greater Morristown will honor the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday with an interfaith breakfast, followed by a service. A Saturday discussion will focus on affordable housing, a subject that would have resonated with the martyred civil rights leader.

On the entertainment side, there also is plenty to see and do this weekend. Classical piano, a tribute to Ol’ Blue Eyes, and a bluegrass version of The Who’s Tommy are just a few of your choices.

Scroll down for details on all this and more. Peruse our handy calendar for additional activities — and add your own.
