Zhou Enlai and Vladimir Lenin make frequent appearances, and, of course, Mao Zedong himself fixes customers with his pensive gaze, even peering out from above the bathroom urinals. Under the watchful eyes of China\u2019s Communist forefathers, teenage waiters donning Red Guard outfits serve up Chongqing\u2019s distinctive, spicy hot pot. As customers line up to plunge their chopsticks into a communal rice bowl at the back of the restaurant, waiters periodically break into choruses of Communist Party folk classics such as \u201cThe East is Red\u201d or \u201cOde to the Plum Blossom,\u201d a reported favorite of former Chongqing Party chief Bo Xilai. Waiters constantly restock the beer fridge, which bears the phrase \u201cWeapons Chest,\u201d and a steady stream of imbibers line up for the restrooms, which are labeled \u201cLiberated Areas.\u201d Daily specials are scrawled by hand on a list called the \u201cPolitical Commissar\u2019s recommendations.\u201d The effect is like stepping into a time machine and waking up in rural China in 1968.\n\nBut beyond the flimsily plastered walls of Old Base, Chongqing\u2019s mega-market economy roars on. Across the street, a Sephora and Carrefour lure China\u2019s well-heeled consumers, while a Pizza Hut, Starbucks and two KFCs are a stone\u2019s throw away. Thomas Arne Strand Underlying the novelty and kitsch of Old Base is that contemporary Chinese characteristic: the place turns a profit. \u201cServe the People,\u201d a core Communist slogan that dates back to a 1944 Mao speech and is plastered all over the restaurant, now serves as a marketing ploy, emphasizing the waiters\u2019 dedication to service. It\u2019s as if today\u2019s version of the slogan has been revised with the caveat, \u201cServe the People \u2026 who have disposable income.\u201d The nostalgia served up by Old Base is by no means an isolated phenomenon. Under the leadership of now-imprisoned Party leader Bo Xilai, Chongqing garnered international attention for its promotion and re-popularization of red songs, a genre of Communist, pro-Party folk songs that were forcibly and feverishly embraced under Mao. In October 2011, more than 100,000 city residents reportedly congregated in Chongqing\u2019s Olympic Park to bellow the familiar tunes, marking the peak of Bo\u2019s popularity and, for many, recalling scenes from the Cultural Revolution. Thomas Arne Strand With Bo\u2019s encouragement, the movement swelled beyond mere melodies. In March 2011, the city-run Chongqing television station pledged to cut commercial advertisements, instead only broadcasting productions that \u201cpromote red ideas.\u201d Museums and theme parks paying tribute to the Maoist era popped up throughout the city, and dozens of revolution-themed hot pot restaurants, including Old Base, thrived. Now, more than a year after Bo\u2019s dismissal in China\u2019s biggest political scandal in a generation, part of Chongqing\u2019s \u201cred\u201d cultural movement has fallen alongside him. The Red Song Association, which was formed in July 2010 and flourished under Bo, had its operating license revoked in 2012; its 20,000-square foot office now lies empty. Across the street from my apartment in Chongqing\u2019s Shapingba neighborhood, students at Shuren Kindergarten do their morning exercise routine to the accompaniment of Justin Bieber; two years ago, a local resident told me, the students were swinging their arms to the tune of Communist refrains. Shortly after Bo fell, Chongqing TV reintroduced advertisements and canceled a two-hour nightly series on classic red songs.\n\nBut just as Chongqing\u2019s red culture hot pot restaurants long predate Bo Xilai, they show no signs of vanishing now that he\u2019s gone. Big Squad Captain (daduizhang), which opened its first branch in 2004, is widely considered the most popular of Chongqing\u2019s Maoist nostalgia eateries. Since 2004, it has expanded steadily, with 19 locations in the Chongqing area as of last year. Other imitation restaurants, such as the Red Detachment of Women, named after one of China\u2019s famous Communist-era operas, have also sprung up. Similarly-themed establishments can be found in cities across China, but nowhere are they more common than in Chongqing\u2014in Three Gorges Square, a commercial plaza in Chongqing\u2019s university district, at least three such restaurants can be found on a single block, each one brimming with diners during peak hours. Thomas Arne Strand Like all kitsch, the appeal and meaning of these red restaurants shift depending on the customer. For younger patrons who lack first-hand experience of the Mao era, the restaurants present a novel and entertaining window into the previous generation\u2019s history, which their textbooks gloss over. \u201cPeople in my generation barely ever hear or read anything about the Cultural Revolution, so restaurants like Big Squad Captain are really fun for us,\u201d said Wan Xiao, a visual art student and member of the \u201cpost-90s generation,\u201d constituting those who were born between 1990 and 1999. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Big Squad Captain, I would have no clue what a Red Guard looked like in real life.\u201d Others see the restaurants as an escape from China\u2019s cutthroat market economy, providing the disillusioned with a glimpse of a more egalitarian and community-oriented society. \u201cToday\u2019s China feels so cold and detached compared to the land that my grandparents lived in,\u201d said Wang Shuai, a 22-year-old realtor who frequents Old Base for the atmosphere (he isn\u2019t fond of the food). \u201cIt is a shame that people today are no longer accustomed to sharing and working together.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the massive central Chinese city, establishments with Red Guards, Maoist songs, and portraits of Communist luminaries have become popular.", "author": "Adam Century", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "In the massive central Chinese city, establishments with Red Guards, Maoist songs, and portraits of Communist luminaries have become popular.", "title": "Chongqing Restaurants Serve Cultural-Revolution Nostalgia", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/salute/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/11/Chongqing-Restaurants-Serve-Cultural-Revolution-Nostalgia/281100/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Thomas Arne Strand Like all kitsch, the appeal and meaning of these red restaurants shift depending on the customer.\nBut beyond the flimsily plastered walls of Old Base, Chongqing\u2019s mega-market economy roars on.\nUnder the watchful eyes of China\u2019s Communist forefathers, teenage waiters donning Red Guard outfits serve up Chongqing\u2019s distinctive, spicy hot pot.\nThomas Arne Strand Underlying the novelty and kitsch of Old Base is that contemporary Chinese characteristic: the place turns a profit.\nIt\u2019s as if today\u2019s version of the slogan has been revised with the caveat, \u201cServe the People \u2026 who have disposable income.\u201d The nostalgia served up by Old Base is by no means an isolated phenomenon."}
