In other words, the Affordable Care Act has failed to offer affordable care. Instead, most of ObamaCare\u2019s sign-ups are merely migrating over from an existing health-insurance plan\u2014in many cases involuntarily, after their plans were canceled for failing to comply with new ObamaCare regulations.\n\nSo what, then, was the point of ObamaCare?\n\nOne of the key architects of the law, Ezekiel Emanuel, has been starting to dish the inside scoop on how ObamaCare was put together, because he has a book to flog. Usually, this sort of thing is supposed to happen only years after the law takes effect, but that might be \u201cnever,\u201d given the administration\u2019s habit of deferring the law\u2019s key provisions year after year. So the insiders\u2019 books are going to come out first, and they\u2019re going to start saying some unexpectedly honest things about the law\u2019s purpose.\n\nEmanuel gives us one big answer to our question. What was the point of ObamaCare, if not to insure the uninsured? To destroy the insurance companies.\n\nTo be sure, Emanuel\u2019s answer is only semi-honest. In one of a spate of new articles touting his book, he proclaims: \u201cInsurance Companies as We Know Them Are About to Die.\u201d\n\nEmanuel begins by posing as a defender of the insurance companies who wants to protect them from being the man in the middle who gets blamed for implementing policies designed by politicians. But then he lets the truth slip: \u201cWhen people with cancer, heart attacks, or other diseases are denied insurance, we blame insurance companies; we do not blame the underlying voluntary insurance market that necessitates underwriting.\u201d So you see, it\u2019s not any particular insurance company. It\u2019s the entire concept of a \u201cvoluntary insurance market\u201d in the first place.\n\nWhat is going to replace private health insurance, he says, is something called \u201caccountable care organizations\u201d or ACOs, about which he makes some very glowing and optimistic predictions, which are easy to make because \u201cThis health delivery structure is in its infancy,\u201d so nothing has had a chance to go wrong yet.\n\nThe ACOs actually sound pretty much like a new and expanded version of the olds HMOs: an insurance company wedded to a network of preferred doctors and hospitals. And of course it will have many of the same problems. As Emanuel admits, \u201cSome people may be concerned about the prospect of having to choose among large integrated delivery systems with selective physician and hospital networks.\u201d By \u201cselective,\u201d of course, he means \u201crestricted.\u201d\n\nBut as he tells us in yet another new article, \u201cChoice Is Overrated.\u201d When we get to make lots of choices, you see, it\u2019s more expensive. And the purpose of ObamaCare is to prevent us from spending our own money on our own care. That\u2019s why it has to herd us into HMOs\u2014excuse me, ACOs\u2014that will limit our options.\n\nDespite Emanuel\u2019s glowing predictions in the previous article about the high-quality care that will be offered by the ACOs, he admits in this article that it is more a hope than a reasonable expectation.\n\nAs more people enter the ACA\u2019s new insurance exchanges, they will get to choose between a bronze plan with a narrow network and lower premiums and a platinum plan with a broader network and higher premiums. Inevitably, some insurance plans will offer narrow networks with poor-quality providers.\n\nYou don\u2019t say. So if ObamaCare doesn\u2019t offer affordable insurance, doesn\u2019t insure the uninsured, doesn\u2019t allow us to keep our existing plans, and doesn\u2019t even ensure high-quality care\u2014then what are its defenders counting on?\n\nGuess what? Emanuel shifts the burden back on to the insurance companies, the very ones he was just predicting aren\u2019t really going to exist any more. He reflects that insurance companies, or the ACOs that will supplant them, \u201cdesperately want to avoid repeating the managed-care backlash\u201d against HMOs.\n\n[H]ealth systems have learned from the managed-care backlash; just saying \u2018no\u2019 really aggravates people, especially well-off, powerful people. Although it may be cheaper in the short run, it can be expensive, especially in terms of reputation, in the longer term. There are better ways to approach this.\n\nHe then proceeds to list various things he hopes the insurance companies will do. So if the insurance companies know what\u2019s good for them, if they don\u2019t want to risk damage to their \u201creputation\u201d and a political backlash, then this time around they will make our new HMO scheme work\u2014somehow.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the scene in Atlas Shrugged when the politicians pile on a bunch of new regulations that will crush the steel industry. When Hank Rearden asks them what they\u2019re counting on, they reply: \u201cYou\u2019ll do something.\u201d It\u2019s the same pattern: vilify the insurance industry, crush it with new regulations, and then expect it to somehow make the new system work\u2014with the threat that if it doesn\u2019t, they will take the blame, not the bureaucrats.\n\nSo that\u2019s the goal of ObamaCare: to allow bureaucrats like Emanuel to redesign the health care system in a way that flatters their pretensions of being super-geniuses who know what\u2019s best for the rest of us\u2014while shifting responsibility onto others for the actual results.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 11 Mar 2014 04:23:03 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The lie of the year for 2014 is going to be the claim that ObamaCare would insure the uninsured.", "title": "What Was the Point of ObamaCare?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamacare1-e1382584474754.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-13T02:19:56+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/03/11/what-was-the-point-of-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The lie of the year for 2014 is going to be the claim that ObamaCare would insure the uninsured.", "title": "What Was the Point of ObamaCare?", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamacare1-e1382584474754.jpg"}, "creator": "@Tracinski", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "ACOs,Barack Obama,Ezekiel Emanuel,health care,health insurance,HMOs,Obamacare,uninsured", "published_time": "2014-03-11T04:23:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-13T02:19:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The lie of the year for 2014 is going to be the claim that ObamaCare would insure the uninsured."}, "article_summary": "So if ObamaCare doesn\u2019t offer affordable insurance, doesn\u2019t insure the uninsured, doesn\u2019t allow us to keep our existing plans, and doesn\u2019t even ensure high-quality care\u2014then what are its defenders counting on?\nWhat was the point of ObamaCare, if not to insure the uninsured?\nSo what, then, was the point of ObamaCare?\nObamaCare has failed to attract those who lack health insurance, seemingly because they have decided that the premiums are too high for the bare-bones coverage the exchanges offer.\nHe reflects that insurance companies, or the ACOs that will supplant them, \u201cdesperately want to avoid repeating the managed-care backlash\u201d against HMOs."}
