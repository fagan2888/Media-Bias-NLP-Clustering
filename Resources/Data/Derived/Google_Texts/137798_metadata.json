She spent more than $20 million on the three videos, including $9.4 million for \u201cExpress Yourself.\u201d\n\nJackson rounds out the top 5, with $6.9 million for his \u201cBlack or White\u201d video.\n\nEven combined, those productions don\u2019t hold a candle to Obama\u2019s spending on music videos.\n\nHis tab? $340 million and rising.\n\nWere you unaware of Obama\u2019s exorbitant spending on something so trivial? Many are, so let\u2019s step back in time a bit.\n\nIn late 2013, Cover Oregon, a state-backed and approved Obamacare exchange, began airing two totally hipster television ads that made national news because, well, they didn\u2019t actually advertise much of anything and they were really, really, really weird. Like, really weird.\n\nHere are the words of one of the ads:\n\nWe fly with our own wings. Care about the same things. We stand strong together. So let me hear you say. We fly with our own wings. Dreamin\u2019 all the big dreams. Long live Oregonians; we\u2019re free to be healthy. Long live Oregonians; we\u2019re free to be healthy.\n\nReady to buy Obamacare? We thought so.\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform called them \u201cacid-trip TV ads,\u201d and pundits across the country, including Obama apologist John Oliver, mocked the two ads produced.\n\nStill, Cover Oregon was hailed for its innovation and early progress in building a system that would eventually sign up people for subsidized health coverage.\n\nFast-forward to this week and you\u2019ll see a shocking story of waste, corruption and taxpayer abuse. Oregon\u2019s new governor, Democrat Kate Brown, dissolved Cover Oregon and transferred its duties to a state agency.\n\nFrom its onset, though, Cover Oregon was a dismal failure. It couldn\u2019t sign up Oregonians for months after its initial launch due to tech failures, which forced state residents to submit paper applications for coverage.\n\nWhen the agency ironed out some of its tech problems, it only signed up less than a quarter of its goal.\n\nThe dissolution comes after $340 million in total spending, including $300 million in federal dollars.\n\nBut the saga\u2019s not done yet. The state and federal government may pay up to $30 million to bring Oregon onto the federal exchange. A Cover Oregon vendor is also suing for as much as $23 million, which could add to the tab.\n\nOn the bright side, the state is suing that vendor, Oracle, for $5.5 billion in damages.\n\nCover Oregon\u2019s legacy, and Obama\u2019s in Oregon, will be of lawsuits, corruption, fraud, waste and, of course, really nifty music videos.\n\nThe Wallowa County Chieftain, Enterprise\u2019s newspaper of record, offered a scathing censure of the project:\n\nCover Oregon has now cost $300 million and did not benefit anyone. It signed not a soul up for health insurance. Heck, it didn\u2019t pave a road or build a bridge. We didn\u2019t even get to buy a Hawaiian island (like the one Oracle founder Larry Eillison purchased for $300 million in 2012) or throw an epic statewide parade. That makes the failed exchange a terrible disappointment and a waste of money, without even mounds of ticker tape to show for it.\n\nOuch. The paper also wrote this:\n\nIt will go down as Oregon\u2019s biggest tech debacle ever, and you could exclude the word \u201ctech\u201d and still make a credible case. The biggest debacle in Oregon government history? It is, as people like to say, in the conversation.\n\nWhen then-U.S. House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Congress needed to pass Obamacare to find out what\u2019s in it, very few probably imagined spending $400 million on music videos.\n\nIn case you\u2019re interested, here\u2019s John Oliver\u2019s take:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "His tab? $340 million and rising.", "title": "At $340 million, Barack Obama owns world record for most expensive music videos ever | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015_03_12_151007_2015-03-10T150400Z_1_LYNXMPEB290MP_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-EDUCATION.JPG", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/03/12/at-340-million-barack-obama-owns-world-record-for-most-expensive-music-videos-ever/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "His tab? $340 million and rising.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015_03_12_151007_2015-03-10T150400Z_1_LYNXMPEB290MP_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-EDUCATION.JPG", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "His tab? $340 million and rising."}}, "article_summary": "In late 2013, Cover Oregon, a state-backed and approved Obamacare exchange, began airing two totally hipster television ads that made national news because, well, they didn\u2019t actually advertise much of anything and they were really, really, really weird.\nA Cover Oregon vendor is also suing for as much as $23 million, which could add to the tab.\nStill, Cover Oregon was hailed for its innovation and early progress in building a system that would eventually sign up people for subsidized health coverage.\nThe dissolution comes after $340 million in total spending, including $300 million in federal dollars.\nCover Oregon\u2019s legacy, and Obama\u2019s in Oregon, will be of lawsuits, corruption, fraud, waste and, of course, really nifty music videos."}
