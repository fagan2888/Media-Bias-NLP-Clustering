SCARBOROUGH: why do you want to be president?



TRUMP: Because I want to make America great again. Very simple. I want to make America great again. And we can do it.



You know --



SCARBOROUGH: When did America stop being --



TRUMP: -- you see the crowds I’m getting.



SCARBOROUGH: When did America stop being great?



TRUMP: I was very unhappy with the Bush years. I was very unhappy with the fact that Bush went into Iraq. I was, as you know, in 2003, 2004, even though I’m a builder and deal guy, I got always a lot of publicity for whatever reason, OK? I didn’t have PR people, I just got for whatever reason.



And once somebody said about Iraq, and I said don’t do it because you’re going to destabilize the Middle East. That was a bad step. That was a horrible step.



Then Obama came in and it’s been a disaster. It’s been a disaster. We’re not a respected country anymore. Our military’s going to hell. Our veterans aren’t treated properly. Obamacare is a disaster; it’s got to be repealed. So many different things.



The whole persona of our country is different. And I said I’m going to do this. And it wasn’t something I really wanted to do. Frankly, I wish Obama were a great president. I would be happy. I’d be happy -- doing what I’m doing, Turnberry in Scotland. I’ve some of the greatest jobs in the world. I may never see it again. You know, if I win, I may never see these things again.



So I love what I’m doing. I love running. One thing I’ve learned is I get the biggest crowds by far. Much bigger than Bernie Sanders, much bigger than anybody. Not even close. And you know that. And he gets second, by the way. But mine are much bigger.



I will tell you, the people are incredible, of this country. And they’re really, really smart. They get it. And I’ve very impressed by it.
