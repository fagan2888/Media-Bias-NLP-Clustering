NEW YORK (MainStreet) â€” Ben Gagnon, an IT worker from Belchertown, Mass., doesn't think twice before checking and answering his work email, even during off-hours. Of course, it's not a requirement at his office.



"But I actually check and respond anyway, because I actually like my job," he says. He takes his penchant for responsiveness seriously.



Gagnon's behavior is part of the norm in the modern workforce: widespread Internet access in homes across the United States has enabled what Wendy Boswell, a professor at Texas A&M University's Mays Business School, has called "a new night shift."

In her new study with research partner, Marcus Butts, Boswell tried to assess how employee mindset and other factors played into the impacts (both positive and negative) of checking work email off-hours.



In other-words, we know off-hours email checking has grown like kudzu: one study reports more than half (52%) of American workers check their work emails outside of work--including on sick days--and some estimates put that percentage even higher--with one 2008 report contending that 96% of employees when remote still use internet, email, or cell phones to stay in touch with communications from work--about triple than those in 2002. But is the effect generally an adverse one, or are workers more like Gagnon and taking it all in stride?

Tonal Harmony

To find out, Boswell and Butts surveyed 341 working adults over a seven-day period--with study participants completing sampling surveys after the end of each of their workdays and after receiving a work-related electronic communication. Overall, 21% of electronic communications outside of work time were received from supervisors, 41% from coworkers, 16% from subordinates, and 22% from clients/customers.
