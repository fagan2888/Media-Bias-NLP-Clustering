Its northern Virginia clinic was closed, leaving it with two Washington, D.C.-based sites: the Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center and the Max Robinson Center.\n\nWith the passing of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Whitman-Walker had to address another challenge: what would its organization look like post-ACA? \u201cWe spent a lot of time on what that meant to Whitman-Walker and who we are, who we serve, and what we\u2019re trying to do in service to our community,\u201d Blanchon says.\n\nPart of that plan identified the need for a new, modern healthcare facility that would enable it to expand care, meet the needs of its growing population base, and offer greater financial diversity to ensure long-term viability.\n\nThe new 43,000-square foot building is expected to open in late spring 2015.\n\nHealthcare Design recently talked with Blanchon about the organization\u2019s transition, the challenges it faces, and its strategy for remaining a viable member of its community.\n\nHealthcare Design: Why was it important for Whitman-Walker Health\u2019s future to transition from an AIDS service organization to a community health center model?\n\nDon Blanchon: First and foremost, it was about the people we cared for. People with HIV were living longer because of the antiretroviral and they were dealing with other health issues, like hypertension and diabetes, and had other kinds of primary and preventive care needs.\n\nWe had patients getting their primary medical care somewhere else and their HIV care and other related services here, which led to a fair amount of fragmentation and poor outcomes. We wanted to make sure that we could do an integrated primary/HIV model so that we can take care of those individuals on a community basis here.\n\nThe second reason is the community role that Whitman-Walker has had over four decades. We were first a gay and lesbian center and, before the epidemic, our services were largely geared around gay men and lesbians and some direct care, mental health counseling services, and sexually transmitted disease or sexually transmitted infection testing. The board felt pretty strongly that in making the move back to a community health center model, it wanted to make sure that this was a place where the metro D.C. LGBT community could come and get care.\n\nThat was important because it reaffirmed who we were but it also helped destigmatize getting care here. If you are mainly providing HIV-only services and then you expand, you still have to have somebody cross the threshold and, in this day and age, there\u2019s still stigma associated with a diagnosis. The organization felt very strongly that the best way to help destigmatize HIV and AIDS was to become a community center and then allow people to come here whether they\u2019re positive or negative.\n\nWhat\u2019s your population base?\n\nWe served a total of 14,184 individuals in 2013. Seventy percent of them were from the District of Columbia, 16 percent were from Maryland, 11 percent from Virginia, and 3 percent from other jurisdictions.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "[page-title],[metatags-global-keywords-1],Interior Design Ideas,Furnishings,Facility Manager,Healthcare Reform,Leadership Strategies,Master Planning,Clinics,Patient Safety,Professional: Healthcare executive,Rooms: Patient/Exam,Rooms: Staff", "revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "[site-name],[site-mission]"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4c6\"", "article_summary": "In 2006, Don Blanchon was hired as executive director to lead Whitman-Walker\u2019s transition from a service organization to a community health center model.\nHealthcare Design: Why was it important for Whitman-Walker Health\u2019s future to transition from an AIDS service organization to a community health center model?\nTo start, Whitman-Walker brought in physicians through the Washington Free Clinic to provide primary care services.\nThe board felt pretty strongly that in making the move back to a community health center model, it wanted to make sure that this was a place where the metro D.C.
