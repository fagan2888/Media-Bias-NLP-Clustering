Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), said last week, \u201cFor 50 years we\u2019ve been fighting a war on poverty. For 50 years we\u2019ve spent trillions of dollars on massive federal welfare programs that have largely failed.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) released a much-discussed anti-poverty plan that would merge 11 fragmented programs into a single grant program for states. He claimed, \u201cFederal programs are not only failing to address the problem. They are also in some significant respects making it worse.\u201d Yet Ryan has also acknowledged that it\u2019s unfair to abruptly cut off recipients from federal assistance when they reach a certain income threshold, and that it\u2019s better to taper off the payments as income rises, reducing people\u2019s disincentive to find work.\n\nSome new research from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) offers another perspective on the ongoing debate.\n\nRelated: Businesses Upbeat About Jobs, Economic Growth\n\nExamining 2013 U.S. Census Data, CBPP senior research analyst Danilo Trisi determined that in that year alone, payments from the various programs that make up the social safety net lifted 39 million people out of poverty. That included 8 million children.\n\nPart of the disconnect is that the government\u2019s official poverty figure doesn\u2019t take all safety net benefits into account. It omits things like non-cash assistance and tax-based benefits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. That means people are considered to be below the poverty line even when federal and state transfer payments raise their total income above poverty levels.\n\nThe official poverty measure has created a convenient talking point for opponents of the safety net. They often cite that figure instead of the Census Department\u2019s more accurate Supplemental Poverty Measure, which takes all the benefits of the social safety net into account.\n\nBut Trisi\u2019s findings show that when all safety net programs are considered, they account for a drop in the poverty rate from 28.1 percent to 15.5 percent.\n\n\u201cNon-cash and tax-based benefits now constitute a much larger part of the safety net than 50 years ago, so the official poverty measure\u2019s exclusion of them masks the nation\u2019s progress in reducing poverty over the last five decades,\u201d Trisi writes.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Opponents of the social safety net often argue that transfer payments like food stamps and unemployment insurance do little to reduce poverty in the U.S. A recent analysis of U.S. Census data by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that\u2019s not true.", "title": "Social Safety Net Lifted 39 Million Out of Poverty in 2013", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/20/Social-Safety-Net-Lifted-39-Million-Out-Poverty-2013", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082011_Poverty4_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/20/Social-Safety-Net-Lifted-39-Million-Out-Poverty-2013", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11082011_Poverty4_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Opponents of the social safety net often argue that transfer payments like food stamps and unemployment insurance do little to reduce poverty in the U.S. A recent analysis of U.S. Census data by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that\u2019s not true.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0348\"", "article_summary": "Part of the disconnect is that the government\u2019s official poverty figure doesn\u2019t take all safety net benefits into account.\nThey often cite that figure instead of the Census Department\u2019s more accurate Supplemental Poverty Measure, which takes all the benefits of the social safety net into account.\nThe official poverty measure has created a convenient talking point for opponents of the safety net.\nBut Trisi\u2019s findings show that when all safety net programs are considered, they account for a drop in the poverty rate from 28.1 percent to 15.5 percent.\nRelated: Businesses Upbeat About Jobs, Economic GrowthExamining 2013 U.S. Census Data, CBPP senior research analyst Danilo Trisi determined that in that year alone, payments from the various programs that make up the social safety net lifted 39 million people out of poverty."}
