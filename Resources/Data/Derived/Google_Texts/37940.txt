DENVER -- A glitch with Colorado's state-run health insurance exchange accidentally canceled health coverage for 3,600 policy holders.

It happened during the recent open enrollment period on Connect for Health Colorado.

Customers eligible for auto-renewal policies inadvertently canceled just because they logged in and browsed other plans on the website.

Insurers say they will help anyone impacted and they will renew the old plans retroactive to January 1, so there's no actual gap in coverage.

Connect for Health Colorado is working to notify everyone affected, and help them renew their coverage as well. The organization was also working to correct the problem with the website.
