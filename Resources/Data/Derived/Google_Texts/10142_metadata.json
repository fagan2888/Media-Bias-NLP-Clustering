Photo: Anton Want/Allsport\n\nAYRTON Senna is unquestionably the finest sportsperson I have had the sheer joy of watching. A ruthless Shakespearean genius rated by the likes of Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso as history's greatest driver. In a formula one career spanning one short decade Senna won 41 grands prix in the course of securing three world championships. He started from pole a staggering 65 times, in an era when cars were 1200-horsepower beasts, devoid of the myriad technological driver aids on modern cars.\n\nThe 1994 San Marino Grand Prix race weekend was awful for formula one in biblical proportions - race day has since been described by legendary commentator Murray Walker as the sport's ''blackest''. During Friday's qualifying Senna's Brazilian compatriot Rubens Barrichello escaped a terrifying high-speed crash only moderately scathed. Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger was markedly less fortunate in final qualifying the following day.\n\nAlthough deeply shaken by Ratzenberger's death and advised not to drive, Senna started the race from pole on the Sunday. Seven laps in, and while in the lead, Senna's Williams FW16 left the road at Imola's Tamburello corner travelling faster than 310km/h. His car hit the crash barrier so hard that its concrete blocks were gouged beyond repair. A broken front-right suspension arm pierced Senna's helmet. His fate was instantly sealed.\n\nFormer NFL player Junior Seau whose suicide was linked to brain trauma. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe circumstances of Senna's death have magnified his legend. His and Ratzenberger's legacy, though, is that on that May weekend in 1994 it finally became clear that someone dying behind the wheel of a formula one car was patently unacceptable, whatever the inherent risks of motor racing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deaths at Imola brought about a shift in formula one safety. Race circuit architecture was remodelled to remove high-speed corners and increase run-off areas - Tamburello was never revisited in its 1994 configuration. The forced redesign of race cars involved changes including reduced downforce, engine size and power; increased weight; and a massive overhaul of drivers' seat and cockpit design.\n\nOne can only suppose what impact these regulatory changes have had in the intervening 19 years; however, it is difficult to argue against their necessity in ensuring driver safety. Senna was the last driver to die in formula one.\n\nNegligent manslaughter charges were unsuccessfully pursued by Italian prosecutors against Senna's mechanics as well as the owners of the Williams team and Imola circuit; however, nobody was sued over the deaths of either Senna or Ratzenberger. In contrast to that lack of legal resolution sits last month's settlement of the concussion lawsuits, started by some 4500 former players and their families, against the US National Football League.\n\nBy definition, a ''concussion'' is a mild traumatic injury, caused through the violent ricocheting of the brain inside the skull. The importance of the number of claimants is illustrated by the fact that about 12,000 players have played NFL football since 1967. One-third sued claiming brain injury as a result of football.\n\nCentral to the litigation was the plaintiffs' argument that the NFL had, for decades, been aware players were being exposed to an unacceptable risk of repeated concussions and connected traumatic and degenerative brain injuries by playing gridiron within the rules set by the NFL. The players contended that, despite being armed with such knowledge, the NFL knowingly failed to take steps to protect them from harm, in turn exposing players to the possible onset of diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (a degenerative brain disease only diagnosable post-mortem, which is often precipitated through repetitive concussions), manifesting in memory loss, depression, early-onset dementia and a propensity to suicide.\n\nIf Senna's death was formula one's blackest day, the NFL concussion lawsuit represented American football's ''big tobacco'' scenario, which conceivably could be replicated in Australia. This week, the difficulties suffered by the Roosters legend Kevin Hastings and others of his vintage have been in the news.\n\nThe resolution of the US lawsuits occurred very early in proceedings, which would otherwise have run for a decade. The $US765 million ($827 million) settlement is significant but, in context, the total payout represents a fraction of the NFL's $US9 billion annual income and less than half of what it receives just from the sale of its Monday Night Football broadcast rights. Moreover, the NFL's obligations are spread over the next 20 years.\n\nThe NFL's deal is without any admission of liability but laced with tacit recognition of responsibility. In fairness, the plaintiffs have been spared the incredibly difficult burden of proving with sufficient certainty the causal link between their professional football careers and the catastrophic afflictions from which they suffer. While ex-players can still ''opt out'' and sue the NFL independently, the task of taking on the NFL behemoth is practically insurmountable.\n\nBecause the proceedings were settled in the pre-discovery phase, it is almost certain that what the NFL knew, and when, will never be disclosed publicly. Given the value such information might have in terms of future research and the development of preventive strategies, the sealing of the NFL files is unpalatable, especially when considered against the reported examples of former NFL players suffering from brain injury ending their lives in such a manner so to preserve their brains for medical research.\n\nIn reality though, the NFL concussion settlement could have been $US800 billion and yet still painfully inadequate. It is a fanciful notion to suggest that any monetary settlement could properly compensate a person irreversibly damaged in the circumstances alleged in the NFL class action. The power of courts to award damages is a remarkably blunt tool, used only because no better solution exists.\n\nThe one beacon of hope is that a new era of concussion awareness has been born. In Australia, courts have traditionally shown real reluctance to find governing bodies liable for personal injuries sustained in dangerous collision sports, although the duty of care has not been conclusively tested in the fully professional era.\n\nIn a domestic context, sports such as AFL, rugby league and rugby union are rooted in the contest of the collision. Just as is the case in the NFL, it is fundamentally contradictory to the essence of a collision sport to think it possible to eradicate all reasonable risk.\n\nDistilled down to its most basic consideration, the issue is not one of eliminating risk but rather managing it comprehensively and intelligently. By way of illustration, while it is difficult to argue against the gladiatorial splendour of a sweetly executed shoulder charge in rugby league, it is a folly to suggest it reasonable to legalise that defensive technique given the level of risk of serious injury to the head of the ball carrier. Likewise, in the age of billion-dollar media rights deals, it behoves sports' administrators to invest significantly in clinical research and risk-minimisation initiatives.\n\nHead injury and concussion safety in Australian sport is a veritable powder keg. Any concussion policy, properly followed, that permitted George Smith to play on after being knocked senseless in his final Wallabies match in July is a recipe for disaster. If it is true the ageing former world champion ''Sugar'' Shane Mosley suffers from boxing-related brain injury, however severe, the question must be asked how it could ever be possible that he might be licensed to fight in Australia, the same country that bans for life any racehorse that twice bleeds from the nostrils.\n\nAfter Senna died, his doctors found an Austrian flag furled inside a pocket of his race suit in tribute to Ratzenberger. It will never be known whether Senna would have waved it on the podium that day had he won. The tragedy, though, is that he was in a position that he had to take the flag with him at all.\n\nDarren Kane is a sports lawyer based in Sydney\n\nTwitter: @sportslawyer7", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sport", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "AYRTON Senna is unquestionably the finest sportsperson I have had the sheer joy of watching.
