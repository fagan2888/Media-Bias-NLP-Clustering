She hoped it would be a wake-up call.\n\n\u201cI picked up his bags and put him out,\u201c she said in an interview. \u201cI never did that before.\u201d\n\nShe helped arrange for him to move into a facility with a promising sounding description: a \u201csober home.\u201d\n\nBut four months later, Billy DeVito was dead.\n\nHe had overdosed on heroin\u2014in a place where drugs and alcohol were supposed to be forbidden.\n\nThe home where DeVito died was one of hundreds of similar programs that have become a crucial \u2014 yet often dangerously unregulated \u2014 component of substance abuse treatment and prisoner re-entry in New York State.\n\nFor years, local officials have been struggling without success to convince the myriad state agencies that interact with these homes \u2014 also known as three-quarter houses \u2014 to effectively monitor them.\n\nIn March, the Suffolk Sober Home Oversight Board, a committee tasked by the county legislature with coming up with a solution, issued a request for qualifications (RFQ).\n\nThe board offered to pay $500 per resident \u2014 $200 more than the state\u2019s Department of Social Services currently pays \u2014 to any qualified firm that would agree to provide 24-hour supervision, a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol, and submit to regular inspections.\n\nNew Legislation\n\nOn October 15, the Board met to discuss the RFQ, as well as a new piece of legislation, \u201cThe Suffolk Healthy Sober Home Act,\u201d which would codify many of the board\u2019s qualifications and create an anonymous hotline for resident complaints.\n\nNeither the legislation nor the RFQ has gained much steam, members of the board noted during the meeting.\n\nThe board received only three responses and none promised to meet all the qualifications.\n\nRosemary Dehlow, chief program officer for Community Housing Innovations, told the board her firm wouldn\u2019t participate because the new restrictions are too costly.\n\n\u201cFive hundred dollars is not going to cut it,\u201d Dehlow said. \u201cEverything in this RFQ I believe in. You want solid housing; you want restrictions on certain things; you want to make sure they\u2019re clean.\u201d\n\nBut, Dehlow said, the legislation and the RFQ ignore the underlying void that sober homes have come to fill.\n\n\u201cWhy do sober homes have 20 people in a house? It\u2019s about affordable housing,\u201d Dehlow said.\n\nAn hour\u2019s drive away in New York City, where 50,000 people struggle with homelessness each day and the demand for affordable housing is especially high, three-quarter homes have become a critical part of the recovery and reentry landscape.\n\nA study of the New York City homes, published last month by the Prisoner Reentry Institute at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, reveals that \u201cbuilding code violations are rampant at the houses, which are funded almost entirely by public dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cTenants described small rooms with two to four bunk beds accommodating four to eight people. In some cases, bunk beds are placed in living rooms, hallways, and even kitchens,\u201d according to the study.\n\n\u201cInfestations of bed bugs, rats, mice, roaches, and other vermin often plague dwellings, and structural issues commonly remain in dangerous disrepair.\u201d\n\nDespite the squalid conditions, New York City housing advocates and officials are struggling against a system that critics say provides only two options for problem buildings: looking the other way, or perhaps worse, shutting them down wholesale.\n\nAccording to Jerilyn Perine, executive director of the non-profit Citizens Housing Planning Committee, that could mean a return to prison for parolees who must live at their declared addresses; for those hoping to avoid the city\u2019s notorious homeless shelters, it could mean a return to the street.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials have been struggling to monitor \"three-quarter homes\" for recovering addicts -- often to no avail", "title": "Overdosing rampant in sober houses", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Officials have been struggling to monitor \"three-quarter homes\" for recovering addicts -- often to no avail", "title": "Overdosing rampant in sober houses", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/09/life_and_death_in_a_three_quarter_home_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/drugs_depression.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Officials have been struggling to monitor \"three-quarter homes\" for recovering addicts -- often to no avail", "title": "Overdosing rampant in sober houses", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/drugs_depression.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Graham Kates", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, addiction, Alcohol, Crime, Drugs, halfway house, law, Law enforcement, New York, sober house, The Crime Report, three-quarter home, War on Drugs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1002\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhy do sober homes have 20 people in a house?\nIn March, the Suffolk Sober Home Oversight Board, a committee tasked by the county legislature with coming up with a solution, issued a request for qualifications (RFQ).\nIt\u2019s about affordable housing,\u201d Dehlow said.\nBut in the fall of 2010, 19-year-old Billy DeVito became too difficult to live with and she told him to leave.\nFor years, local officials have been struggling without success to convince the myriad state agencies that interact with these homes \u2014 also known as three-quarter houses \u2014 to effectively monitor them."}
