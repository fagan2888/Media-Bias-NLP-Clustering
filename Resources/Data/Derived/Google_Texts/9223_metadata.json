And not unexpected, given Maxwell\u2019s background.\n\nBefore joining the Obama administration, Maxwell was executive director at union front group American Rights at Work. Before that, Maxwell was a national field director for union front Jobs With Justice.\n\nSEIU and other labor unions sank $25.9 million into American Rights at Work from 2005-13, based on unions\u2019 annual financial disclosures. Of that total, $10.4 million was donated around the time Maxwell was appointed to the Department of Labor.\n\nAfter Maxwell\u2019s departure, American Rights at Work was folded into Jobs With Justice \u2014 one of several union-advocacy groups leading SEIU\u2019s current Fight for $15 campaign.\n\nIn her June labor department blog post, Maxwell focused on St. Louis fast-food worker Terrance Wise, \u201cone of an incredible group of leaders that are building their union and leading the fight for higher wages.\u201d\n\nWhat she didn\u2019t mention: Fight for $15 has been orchestrated by SEIU, whose public relations firm shops quotes from Wise to media outlets covering the union organizing campaign.\n\nWise has been cited by The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, USA Today and other national publications as a grassroots leader of the $15 minimum wage movement.\n\nIn March, Wise served as an international spokesman for the \u201cfight for $15 and a union,\u201d addressing Ireland\u2019s Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union in a video recorded by SIPTU\u2019s International Solidarity Committee.\n\nWise is a leader of Stand Up KC, a project of Midwest Center for Equality and Democracy. SEIU has funneled more than $400,000 to Midwest Center for Equality and Democracy through SEIU front group St. Louis Organizing Committee.\n\nRELATED: Union organizing machine targets St. Louis, Kansas City\n\nNationally, Fight for $15 and partner groups have received tens of millions from SEIU. Even the union-funded leftist magazine In These Times has expressed concern about the degree of SEIU\u2019s control over the campaign.\n\nMaxwell did not respond to a Watchdog.org request for comment.\n\nHer story noted Fight for $15 has the support of President Obama, who appointed Maxwell to her $164,000-a-year job shortly after taking office.\n\n\u201cIf I were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day\u2019s pay for an honest day\u2019s work, I\u2019d join a union,\u201d the president said during a 2014 Labor Day speech in front of a union crowd.\n\nThe lame-duck Obama administration seems to be making a serious effort to settle a debt to SEIU, an early backer of Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\n\u201cWe spent a fortune to elect Barack Obama \u2014 $60.7 million to be exact \u2014 and we\u2019re proud of it,\u201d former SEIU president Andy Stern told the Las Vegas Sun in early 2009.\n\nMaxwell\u2019s appointment in the labor department was meant to herald passage of the Employee Free Choice Act, a \u201ccard check\u201d law making it easier for unions to pressure workers into unionizing.\n\nCongress never passed EFCA, but Obama appointees have helped SEIU and other labor unions in meaningful ways.\n\nObama\u2019s National Labor Relations Board, stacked with former union attorneys, wants to make it easier for SEIU to target McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food companies for the actions of franchisees.\n\nAnd last year, NLRB passed \u201cambush election\u201d rules dramatically restricting employers\u2019 ability to counter union organizing drives; in March, the president vetoed an attempt by Congress to overturn the rules.\n\nThe successful unionization of just one in 10 of the food service industry\u2019s 4.4 million workers would mean tens of millions of dollars in yearly dues revenue for SEIU.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Service Employees International Union wants to take dues from fast-food workers, and the Obama administration wants to help.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Service Employees International Union wants to take dues from fast-food workers, and the Obama administration wants to help.", "title": "Obama admin promotes union fight for fast-food dues - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/fightfor15-twitter-2015-04-17-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-02T14:37:31+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/226579/obama-union-fight/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Service Employees International Union wants to take dues from fast-food workers, and the Obama administration wants to help.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/fightfor15-twitter-2015-04-17-300px.jpg"}, "title": "Obama admin promotes union fight for fast-food dues - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-07-06T04:00:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T14:37:31+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "mary beth maxwell, mary elizabeth maxwell, terrance wise, fight for 15, service employees international union, department of labor, american rights at work, jobs with justice, stand up kc"}, "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgService Employees International Union wants to take dues from fast-food workers, and the Obama administration wants to help.\nBefore joining the Obama administration, Maxwell was executive director at union front group American Rights at Work.\nCongress never passed EFCA, but Obama appointees have helped SEIU and other labor unions in meaningful ways.\nSEIU and other labor unions sank $25.9 million into American Rights at Work from 2005-13, based on unions\u2019 annual financial disclosures.\nRELATED: Union organizing machine targets St. Louis, Kansas CityNationally, Fight for $15 and partner groups have received tens of millions from SEIU."}
