Cast members of the popular 90s television series Baywatch recently got together on Entertainment Tonight to celebrate the show's 25th anniversary. Two actresses who proudly donned the infamous red Speedo let it slip that each cast member was encouraged not to gain any extra pounds by a weight clause in their contract.

"[There] was a five-pound fluctuation. You couldn't go up or down," Nicole Eggert said during the Q&A portion of the show.

Eggert appeared on ABC’s Extreme Weight Loss back in June 2012 to help her shed the extra weight she gained while giving birth to her second child, US Weekly reported.

“If you did anything to gain or lose weight, etc. you were in trouble,” Traci Bingham added.

The show’s most iconic beach babe, Pamela Anderson, was not on hand for the interview. David Hasselhoff, Parker Stevenson, Erika Eleniak, Brande Roderick, Gena Lee Nolin, David Chokachi, and Jaason Simmons were also on hand for the interview.
