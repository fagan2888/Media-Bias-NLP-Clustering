They\u2019ve simply said they don\u2019t have any figures.\n\nBut President Barack Obama apparently does and offered a glimpse on Thursday. He said 11,000 people have signed up for coverage in Kentucky since the Affordable Care Act exchanges went live in the states on Tuesday.\n\nThe updated number is actually higher and the president\u2019s decision to highlight the state is not likely random.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a reason he cited Kentucky and not, say, Louisiana, which the Times-Picayune reported on Thursday only had 12 enrollees. So many states have had trouble with the Healthcare.gov website.\n\nKentucky seems anecdotally to be one of the more successful exchanges, despite some early glitches.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal looked at this and concluded: \u201cState officials and outside experts attribute the smoother rollout to a variety of factors, including intensive testing of the system, a less-flashy but more-efficient website and strong coordination among state agencies involved in the effort.\u201d\n\nKentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services spokeswoman Jill Midkiff told CNN that as of 7 a.m. ET Thursday, 12,779 applications for health coverage were started and 8,309 were completed. She said 3,505 Kentucky individuals and/or families were enrolled in new health insurance coverage.\n\nThe website for the state has had 117,954 unique visitors viewing 1,825,779 web pages. Some 108,994 people conducted pre-screenings to determine qualifications for subsidies, discounts, or programs like Medicaid.\n\nRelying on information from the Advisory Board Company, Dan Diamond of Forbes reported that as of Wednesday afternoon, \u201conly seven state-based exchanges seemed to be fully functional, while D.C.\u2019s exchange, seven other state exchanges, and all 36 exchanges that relied on the federal government\u2019s system weren\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said glitches stemmed from an avalanche of interest. An Obama administration spokesman said in a statement that \u201coverwhelming interest is continuing to cause wait times\u201d but added \u201cthere will be continuing improvements in the coming hours and days.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have seized on the widespread tech issues as further evidence that Obamacare isn\u2019t fully ready \u2013 Obama notably delayed the employer mandate for that reason \u2013 and won\u2019t be competently administered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0CNN Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper Trying to get concrete Obamacare enrollment numbers from the White House has been impossible.
