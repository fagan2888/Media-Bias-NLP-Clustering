Ducks may take to water, but there are limits. All one has to do is Google “duckling storm drain” on the Internet to see a raft of duckling rescues.

Locally, during the early stages of what turned out to be a week-long soaking, Longmont authorities took the time to rescue some ducklings on Thursday.

A photo shows Longmont Animal Control officer Diane Milford struggling to hold onto eight ducklings after rescuing them from a storm drain along Sunset Street, near Pike Road. It took Milford about 90 minutes, and the help of a Longmont utilities employee, to remove them from the drain.

The ducklings were taken to Greenwood Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. “I like rescuing ducks,” Milford said.
