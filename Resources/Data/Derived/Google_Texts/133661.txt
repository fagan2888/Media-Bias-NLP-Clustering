Welcome to our feature highlighting the numerous Colorado tech companies that make cool stuff. These little snippets are intended for readers to explore the technology being made right here. One company at a time, of course.

JAB Broadband

Someone has to get Internet to those crazy people who willingly choose to live in a land with no broadband. JAB Broadband, a.k.a. Skybeam, Prairie iNet and others , targets remote areas with fixed wireless, a technology where fast Internet is beamed from central towers to homes up to 15 miles away. JAB, which are the initials of co-founder Jeff Kohler’s three children (awww), typically offers 5 to 20 mbps starting at $40 a month. Fastest speed? 1 Gbps — yes, gigabit — for businesses willing to pay $2,500 a month. JAB likes to call itself the biggest company you’ve never heard of. In 10 years, it’s acquired 107 companies, albeit with some growing pains. DSLReports has mixed reviews mostly about customer service. Consider JAB a work in progress as a company offering Internet to those with very few options. And if you need gigabit, you may have to move to the boonies!400 Inverness Parkway, Suite 330 in Englewood (technically in Douglas County)2006Jeff Kohler, Chief Development Officer800, with 200 in Colorado$125 million in 2014Ditching Skybeam brand in Texas and Colorado in favor of Rise Broadband(303) 705-6522
