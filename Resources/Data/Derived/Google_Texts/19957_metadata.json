He now works for the Obama administration as a senior counselor for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where one of his primary responsibilities is implementing the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature legislation.\n\nWhite House aides were allegedly given information during the initial investigation into Jonathan Dach that showed a prostitute was indeed a guest in the hotel room of a member of the President\u2019s advance team, The Post reported.\n\nBut the information was never \u201cthoroughly investigated or publicly acknowledged,\u201d according to the paper.\n\nMoreover, top White House officials, including then-Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler \u2014 now a leading contender to take over as U.S. Attorney General \u2014 interviewed Dach and other advance team members and repeatedly cleared them of wrongdoing, The Post reported.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House denied that any wrongdoing or interference had occurred during the investigation into the situation.\n\n\u201cAs was reported more than two years ago, the White House conducted an internal review that did not identify any inappropriate behavior on the part of the White House advance team,\u201d White House spokesman Eric Schultz told The Post.\n\nBut Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on national security, said Thursday that the response wasn\u2019t sufficient.\n\n\"All signs point to a cover-up but I want to give the White House a chance to explain itself,\" Chaffetz said, adding that he plans to hold hearings on the issue. \"The immediate question for the White House is whether or not they're going to share the information they have with the Congress.\u201d\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
