Milford plant creates protective armor for military



— From a single crystal, sheets of sapphire are being produced that provide increased protection for troops and for military and commercial equipment.



At Saint-Gobain Crystal’s Milford manufacturing plant, protective transparent armor is being created using sheets of sapphire grown from an existing crystal, according to Program Manager Russell Wooddell.

The crystal sheets are drawn from a pool of molten aluminum oxide and then pulled through a die to make plates that are then used in place of, or in conjunction with, glass, to produce windows and windshields that can withstand a great deal of abuse.

..

“Sapphire is second only to diamond in terms of hardness,” Wooddell said.



In the commercial world, Saint-Gobain’s sapphire is used in aviation and in the semi-conductor and industrial market because it is able to withstand challenging conditions and is chemically inert so it won’t interact with other chemicals during various manufacturing processes.

..

But recently Saint-Gobain has been working with the military to improve the windows on the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Launcher, beginning with the equipment used by the New Hampshire National Guard in Nashua.

..

Under contract with the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, Saint-Gobain has created windshields and door windows for the rocket launchers that allow the windows to be thinner and 50 percent lighter than traditional bulletproof glass without reducing the strength and performance of the windows, Wooddell said.

..

The windows are created using a combination of the sapphire sheets, polycarbonate and glass, all laminated together. Though the sapphire windows offer protection against bullets and explosives, they also make the windows more durable so that they can withstand harsh elements, including the deserts of the Middle East.

..

When the rockets are launched, said Wooddell, the dust and debris that is sent flying etches the glass and can make it difficult to see through the windows. But the sapphire sheets aren’t etched the way glass is, which means the windows remain transparent.

..

“The U.S. Army and Marine Corps engaged Saint-Gobain because its sapphire-glass armor solution met the Army’s demanding performance requirements and delivered a higher level of safety, durability and visibility for our service men and women,” said Lt. Col. Bryan Salyers, Army product manager for field artillery launchers, in a press release. “Ensuring our combat vehicles are equipped with the most advanced technology available is critical to the U.S. Army and Marine Corps mission and the safety of all military personnel.”

..

Saint-Gobain will retrofit 540 rocket launchers for the military through a three-year contract worth approximately $20 million, which was awarded in 2012.



The military contract has allowed Saint-Gobain’s Milford plant to increase its work force by 30 percent, and Wooddell, bringing the total employed by the company in New Hampshire to 100. Saint-Gobain, the parent company of Saint-Gobain Crystals, employs 19,000 people throughout its 265 locations in North America and reported sales in 2012 of $7.9 billion.
