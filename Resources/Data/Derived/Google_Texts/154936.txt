USC fans take aim at Stanford and talk smack about breakfast bars. Also, Lee Corso fights with swords and it doesn't end well.

Hey, Lee Corso picked USC. Let's give him Trojan gear and see what happens!





Annnnnnd he's bleeding. Great. Onto to the signs.

Oh, bravo. Why doesn't Brent have his own betting website or newsletter or whatever? He would dominate the market. Is it because he's not very good at betting? Because I would absolutely believe that too. Like, if you saw a report that says "Musburger loses $1500 a week on betting, doesn't care," would you even bat an eye?

Of COURSE a USC fan brings that sign. That's basically the most USC sign possible. Also in the middle, an "I WIPE WITH TREES" sign. Really? Really? Do you wipe with trees? Because that sounds horrendous.

They won't let us take our signs in bc we're in the Coke Zero section! The GusBus goes Hollywood #GameDaySigns pic.twitter.com/I3ddhzVpsm — Eric Dunlap (@eric_mark) November 16, 2013

Yes, this is a pair of Auburn fans going Full Malzahn at a GameDay... in Los Angeles. We approve so, so much.

Is that... is that Luna Bars shade? What the hell is wrong with Luna Bars?!

OK, there's a lot going on, so let's go left to right.

CORSO ASKS JEEVES: That's good. And the only reason I don't believe it's true is that it's just ask.com now. There's no Jeeves. I know, sad.

FIRE KIFFIN: DO IT AGAIN I DON'T CARE

DAVID SHAW BOWLS WITH BUMPERS: This is low-key brilliant. Like, what's the last acceptable age for bowling with bumpers? Six? Seven?

STANFORD SUPPORTS OBAMACARE: I mean, politics should generally stay out of sports—it doesn't end well—but when something the government does is its own punchline, yeah, go for it.

KEVIN HOGAN WEARS A SIZE 7 SHOE: I love this because it always feels creepy and gross whenever announcers are like, "[Player X] has a size 15 shoe! You should see his wingspan!" Uh, okay? Why not just slap him on the butt and compliment his sturdy hindquarters?

That book is huge!

I mean it is.

Corso! u look good bb!

Topical! And yet... you can totally see Kiffin as a Blockbuster manager, can't you? Like you're making six dollars an hour in 2002, miserable as all get out in your blue polo, and up walks Lane Kiffin saying something like, "gotta be pushing those Jujyfruits, really need to hit our goals on that." Classic Kiffin.

George Clooney Dies In Gravity is sneaky my favorite sign pic.twitter.com/tvmUsamAyh — Kmarko (@Kmarkobarstool) November 16, 2013

OH COME ON BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

And then these. Apparently there's a significant obsession with Stanford's female students at USC. I don't know how else to put it.

9 out of 10 California girls are hot. The 10th goes to Stanford! #GamedaySigns pic.twitter.com/X5Xnnd55ZH — Kari Van Horn (@KariVanHorn) November 16, 2013

Stanford girls are so bad Tiger left college early! #GamedaySigns pic.twitter.com/RLI9ibDF3B — Kari Van Horn (@KariVanHorn) November 16, 2013

Way to go?
