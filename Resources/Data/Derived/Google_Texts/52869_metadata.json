It is also about a half-century since the introduction of wide-body jets set off a runaway expansion of the aviation industry. About 3.8 billion people are expected to fly this year, 50 times as many as 50 years ago \u2014 making planes the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, although they have faced none of the limits set on cars or trucks. That is, until last week, when the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, finally proposed the first binding limits on aircraft emissions.\n\nThis is a welcome development, even if it has left many environmental groups disappointed. They have argued, not unreasonably, that the agency set the bar far too low. Existing planes wouldn\u2019t have to improve their efficiency, and aircraft under development would need do no more than meet the emissions goals set by manufacturers. Automakers in the United States, by contrast, must nearly double their fuel economy by 2025.\n\nBut planes are not cars; they take far longer to develop and are less adaptable to the sorts of electric or hybrid power sources that are reshaping the auto industry. That\u2019s not to say it can\u2019t happen \u2014 the budget carrier easyJet announced plans this month to test the use of a hybrid system when an aircraft is taxiing.\n\nFor now, however, what is important is that an industry that accounts for almost 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 about the same as Germany \u2014 and that is projected to double the number of passengers and flights by 2030 will finally join other major sources of greenhouse gas pollution that are subject to international emissions controls.\n\nThe proposed standards will at the least prevent airlines from backsliding on emissions as tens of thousands of large new aircraft enter service. The standards would require a 4 percent reduction in fuel consumption from 2015 levels for planes delivered in 2028 and beyond. And there are limits based on the size of the aircraft for planes already in production that are to be delivered after 2023.\n\nThe history of pollution controls has shown that the first step, however modest, is often the most important in raising confidence and creating momentum toward greater change. In this case, the timing is important, since the clock is running out on the Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United States accounts for half of all carbon dioxide emissions from planes, and limiting aviation emissions has been high on President Obama\u2019s environmental agenda. But the international agreement took more than six years to negotiate, and it still needs approval from the group\u2019s larger council and then its full assembly, followed by laws or regulations in each of the 36 member states. Mr. Obama has the authority to set the standards. That is about all he can hope to achieve on this front in his remaining months, and if it happens, it will be no mean feat.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160213143003, "twitter": {"description": "A U.N. agency has finally proposed the first binding limits on aircraft emissions.", "title": "Jets Will No Longer Get a Free Ride on Carbon Emissions", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/opinion/jets-will-no-longer-get-a-free-ride-on-carbon-emissions.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004201759"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/opinion/14sun3web/14sun3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/opinion/jets-will-no-longer-get-a-free-ride-on-carbon-emissions.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004201759", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/opinion/jets-will-no-longer-get-a-free-ride-on-carbon-emissions.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Jets Will No Longer Get a Free Ride on Carbon", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 13, 2016", "edt": "National", "org": "International Civil Aviation Organization", "keywords": "Editorials,Greenhouse Gas Emissions,United Nations,Fuel Emissions (Transportation),International Civil Aviation Organization,Airlines and Airplanes", "news_keywords": "Editorial", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/opinion/14sun3web/14sun3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A U.N. agency has finally proposed the first binding limits on aircraft emissions.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/opinion/14sun3web/14sun3web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "A U.N. agency has finally proposed the first binding limits on aircraft emissions.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 13, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-02-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Airlines and Airplanes", "published": "2016-02-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "14sun3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160222124605, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/opinion/jets-will-no-longer-get-a-free-ride-on-carbon-emissions.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/opinion/14sun3web/14sun3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A U.N. agency has finally proposed the first binding limits on aircraft emissions.", "title": "Jets Will No Longer Get a Free Ride on Carbon Emissions"}, "pdate": 20160213, "des": "Airlines and Airplanes", "articleid": 100000004201759, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Jets Will No Longer Get a Free Ride on Carbon Emissions", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe United States accounts for half of all carbon dioxide emissions from planes, and limiting aviation emissions has been high on President Obama\u2019s environmental agenda.\nThat is, until last week, when the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, finally proposed the first binding limits on aircraft emissions.\nAutomakers in the United States, by contrast, must nearly double their fuel economy by 2025.\nIt is also about a half-century since the introduction of wide-body jets set off a runaway expansion of the aviation industry.\nPhotoIt has been almost 50 years since the federal government began setting standards for automobile emissions."}
