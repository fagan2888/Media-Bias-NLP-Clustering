It's another sign of the economic slump seen on New Jersey college campuses in the dorms: empty beds.

At Ramapo College in Mahwah, 333 of 3,019 beds are empty this semester, The Record reports. At William Paterson University in Wayne, 300 of 2,700 beds are empty.

The vacancies started about three years ago and have grown, the report says. Some schools are still paying back the bonds used to build the new facilities.

Colleges like Ramapo have instead opted to turn turn triples into two-person rooms. William Paterson is considering razing or renovating its oldest dorms, the report said.

Meanwhile universities like Rutgers and Montclair State have increased enrollment. College officials say dorms are still in demand there.

However college officials at Ramapo and William Paterson argue that the downturn in demand is temporary.

"There's still a strong feeling that living on the college campus is a big part of the experience. But you need to watch closely in planning for building for the future," said Bonnie Prunty, a member of the executive board of the national association of college housing officers and directs housing at Ithaca College.

But for students like Ramapo senior Monika Losocha, her bank account dictates her decision.

“It was an economic decision — either get a car or live on campus,” the 21-year-old said. “I couldn’t afford to do both, and I needed a car to get to work.”
