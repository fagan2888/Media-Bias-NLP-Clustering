Our own daily round-ups here at PolitiFact Oregon are no exception.\n\nBut that\u2019s hardly a bad thing, given the long-term political and social stakes involved. Which is to say that today\u2019s scan around the country includes two claims related to health care and a third, in which the Rev. Al Sharpton, responding to a fact-check that we reviewed earlier this week, falls flat.\n\nThe White House, after a tough couple of weeks trying to defend what can politely be termed the balky rollout of Obamacare, gave itself a pat on the back, tweeting, \u201cThanks to #Obamacare, more than 500,000 Americans have already signed up for health coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler, wanted to know whether that half million figure was correct, given everything we\u2019ve read about broken websites and rampant confusion among those trying to sign up for coverage.\n\nThe actual numbers, released Wednesday, showed that only 106,185 people had selected a plan by clicking a button on the Web site page. Another 396,261, according to a tweet graphic from the administration, are getting coverage through Medicaid or the child\u2019s health program (CHIP).\n\nWhile Medicaid expansion was certainly part of the Affordable Care Act, Kessler wrote, Medicaid enrollments were not part of the original 500,000-person estimated disclosed by the Associated Press. The figure, according to the story, is \u201ca bit squishy.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have also sought to distance themselves from a prior statement by Kathleen Sebelius, Health and Human Services secretary, who predicted that \u201csuccess\u201d will equate to at least seven million people having signed up by the end of March 2014.\u201d\n\nWhen the AP story came out this week, in fact, administration officials suggested that number was merely one way to measure the rate of enrollment. They then pointed to Massachusetts, which created the first health-insurance law with an individual mandate, saying that Obamacare could likely match that state\u2019s enrollment rate.\n\nThe Fact Check story, however, found that Obamacare so far is fully 75 percent off that pace. Kessler gave the White House credit for publishing the raw data showing how many people have signed up to date, but concluded, \u201cHappy talk can only go so far. The first month\u2019s enrollment figures are nothing to crow about. The administration got One Pinocchio (out of a possible four) for its tweet.\n\nFor some needed perspective in the health care debate, PolitiFact National took a look at a claim by Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., who compared early problems with Obamacare to the sluggish rollout of the Medicare Part D, President Bush\u2019s prescription drug benefit plan.\n\nIsrael told MSNBC on Nov. 6 that Medicare Part D had plenty of problems of its own in the early going, but is now, eight years after it went live, widely popular among the seniors who use it.\n\nA check of facts surrounding the launch of the respective programs showed them to be eerily similar.\n\nBoth, for instance, faced difficult political battles. Both got low poll ratings in the early going. And both experienced numerous technical troubles.\n\nThe Medicare site, meant to help seniors pick drug benefit plans, was supposed to debut Oct. 13, 2005. It didn\u2019t go live until weeks later in November. Even then, \u201cthe tool itself appeared to be in need of fixing,\u201d the Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nThe PolitiFact item went on to list the many differences between Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act that make the challenges facing the exchanges different.\n\nIt concluded, \u201cIsrael said, \"Things went wrong with the Medicare prescription D plan that George Bush rolled out.\" There definitely were problems, and in some cases, the parallels between the prescription benefit program\u2019s introduction and the Obamacare marketplaces are strikingly similar. While we also found some serious differences in the laws, we can\u2019t find fault with Israel\u2019s fairly general statement.\n\n\u201cWe rate his statement True.\u201d\n\nOn a different note, the Rev. Al Sharpton used his MSNBC show to criticize former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for recently likening the national debt to slavery. But in doing so, PunditFact found, he made the common mistake of confusing the national debt with the deficit.\n\n\u201cThe debt has risen each year in terms of dollar amount and as a share of the economy since 2007,\u201d according to the piece, written by Katie Sanders. And it will continue to increase this year, according to Jason Peuquet, committee for a Responsible Federal Budget research fellow.\n\nWrote Sanders: \u201cWhat Sharpton likely meant to say is that the deficit \"has been reduced every year for the last five years.\" The deficit is the difference between what a government collects in revenues and spends in any one year. The debt is the accumulation of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not letting Sharpton off the hook for his words, especially because he should know the difference, but if he had said deficit he\u2019d be closer to the truth.\u201d\n\nAs it was, Sharpton\u2019s claim was rated False.\n\n\u2013 Dana Tims\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act,politifact oregon,politifact oregon truth-o-meter", "title": "Rev.
