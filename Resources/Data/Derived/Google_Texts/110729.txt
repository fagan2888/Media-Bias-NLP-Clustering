Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has died at the age of 46, according to multiple reports.

The ex-mayor, who received widespread attention in 2013 for his admitted drug use and erratic behavior, was in palliative care after battling cancer for two years, according to his chief of staff in a statement on Monday.

A statement from his family announcing Ford's death described him as a “dedicated man of the people” who “spent his life serving the citizens of Toronto," according to The Toronto Star

His family said last week that they were by his side as Ford battled cancer. His condition reportedly did not change over the past several days.

A website set up by his family, GetWellRobFord.com, showed thousands of messages of support from those wishing the former mayor well during his treatment.

Ford dropped his mayoral reelection bid in 2014 after his first cancer diagnosis. His controversial time in politics included admitting in 2013 that he once smoked cocaine "probably in one of my drunken stupors."

After ending his bid for another term as mayor of Toronto, Ford won his old Toronto City Council seat.
