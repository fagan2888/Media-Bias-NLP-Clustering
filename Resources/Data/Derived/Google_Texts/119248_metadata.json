(Washington\u2019s actual birthday is Feb. 22.)\n\nMatthew Spalding, a Heritage Foundation scholar, notes the history: \u201cAlthough it was celebrated as early as 1778, and by the early 19th Century was second only to the Fourth of July as a patriotic holiday, Congress did not officially recognize Washington\u2019s Birthday as a national holiday until 1870. The Monday Holiday Law in 1968 \u2013 applied to executive branch departments and agencies by Richard Nixon\u2019s Executive Order 11582 in 1971 \u2013 moved the holiday from February 22 to the third Monday in February. Section 6103 of Title 5, United States Code, currently designates that legal federal holiday as \u2018Washington\u2019s Birthday.\u2019 Contrary to popular opinion, no action by Congress or order by any President has changed \u2018Washington\u2019s Birthday\u2019 to \u2018Presidents\u2019 Day.\u2018\u201d\n\nFurthermore, to call the day \u201cPresidents\u2019 Day\u201d not only diminishes George Washington but elevates presidents like Barack Obama. Whereas Washington sought to keep his oath to \u201csupport and defend\u201d the Constitution, Obama undermines it at every turn. His unilateral alterations to ObamaCare, for example, are purely politically motivated and violate our constitutional order. Then again, we still hold that ObamaCare itself is unconstitutional.\n\nSo with that in mind, and in honor of and with due respect for our first and greatest president and arguably our nation\u2019s most outstanding Patriot, we include two quotes from George Washington that best embody his dedication to liberty and God. The first from his First Inaugural Address, April 30, 1789, and the second from his Farewell Address, September 19, 1796.\n\n\u201cThe preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the republican model of government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American People.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great Pillars of human happiness \u2013 these firmest props of the duties of Men and citizens.\u201d\n\nThese quotes aptly sum up The Patriot Post\u2019s mission and purpose.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In some circles, today is observed as \"Presidents' Day,\" but it is still officially recognized as the anniversary of \"Washington's Birthday.\"", "csrf-token": "y1v6RUEimjwteV07/VEZTwtp2oHcX8TcJFBBs/JcmDA=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "In some circles, today is observed as \u201cPresidents' Day,\u201d but it is still officially recognized as the anniversary of \u201cWashington\u2019s Birthday.\u201d", "title": "Washington's Birthday", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/23391", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2013-02-18-8cc0c242.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe220e\"", "article_summary": "Washington's BirthdayIn some circles, today is observed as \u201cPresidents' Day,\u201d jointly recognizing Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, but it is still officially recognized as the anniversary of \u201cWashington\u2019s Birthday\u201d \u2013 and that is how we mark the date in our shop.\n(Washington\u2019s actual birthday is Feb.\nSection 6103 of Title 5, United States Code, currently designates that legal federal holiday as \u2018Washington\u2019s Birthday.\u2019 Contrary to popular opinion, no action by Congress or order by any President has changed \u2018Washington\u2019s Birthday\u2019 to \u2018Presidents\u2019 Day.\u2018\u201dFurthermore, to call the day \u201cPresidents\u2019 Day\u201d not only diminishes George Washington but elevates presidents like Barack Obama.\nThe first from his First Inaugural Address, April 30, 1789, and the second from his Farewell Address, September 19, 1796.\nWhereas Washington sought to keep his oath to \u201csupport and defend\u201d the Constitution, Obama undermines it at every turn."}
