The Japanese firm could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nSharp paid $305 million in cash in 2010 to acquire Recurrent Energy. Selling the company now would help Sharp to raise capital as it struggles to raise its equity ratio to a healthy level.\n\nThis year, Sharp shut down its UK solar plant and also pulled out of a venture with Italian energy firm Enel SpA (ENEI.MI) to make solar panels and generate solar power.\n\n(Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_innovationNews": "USKBN0JL01Z20141207", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Japan's Sharp Corp (6753.T) is set to sell its U.S.-based solar energy development unit Recurrent Energy to Canadian Solar Inc (CSIQ.O) for about 30 billion yen ($247 million), the Nikkei business daily said on Sunday.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141207&t=2&i=997411347&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEAB6017", "title": "Sharp to sell U.S. solar unit to Canadian Solar: report", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
