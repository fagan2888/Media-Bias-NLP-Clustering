Bush, Iraq war, President Barack Obama, TomDispatch.com, News, Politics News\n\nThis piece originally appeared on TomDispatch\n\nIt\u2019s 1990. I\u2019m a young captain in the U.S. Air Force. I\u2019ve just witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall, something I never thought I\u2019d see, short of a third world war. Right now I\u2019m witnessing the slow death of the Soviet Union, without the accompanying nuclear Armageddon so many feared. Still, I\u2019m slightly nervous as my military gears up for an unexpected new campaign, Operation Desert Shield/Storm, to expel Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein\u2019s military from Kuwait. It\u2019s a confusing moment. After all, the Soviet Union was forever (until it wasn\u2019t) and Saddam had been a stalwart U.S. friend, his country a bulwark against the Iran of the Ayatollahs. (For anyone who doubts that history, just check out the now-infamous 1983 photo of Donald Rumsfeld, then special envoy for President Reagan, all smiles and shaking hands with Saddam in Baghdad.) Still, whatever my anxieties, the Soviet Union collapsed without a whimper and the campaign against Saddam\u2019s battle-tested forces proved to be a \u201ccakewalk,\u201d with ground combat over in a mere 100 hours.\n\nThink of it as the trifecta moment: Vietnam syndrome vanquished forever, Saddam\u2019s army destroyed, and the U.S. left standing as the planet\u2019s \u201csole superpower.\u201d\n\nPost-Desert Storm, the military of which I was a part stood triumphant on a planet that was visibly ours and ours alone. Washington had won the Cold War. It had won everything, in fact. End of story. Saddam admittedly was still in power in Baghdad, but he had been soundly spanked. Not a single peer enemy loomed on the horizon. It seemed as if, in the words of former U.N. ambassador and uber-conservative Jeane Kirkpatrick, the U.S. could return to being a normal country in normal times.\n\nWhat Kirkpatrick meant was that, with the triumph of freedom movements in Central and Eastern Europe and the rollback of communism, the U.S. military could return to its historical roots, demobilizing after its victory in the Cold War even as a \u201cnew world order\u201d was emerging. But it didn\u2019t happen. Not by a long shot. Despite all the happy talk back then about a \u201cnew world order,\u201d the U.S. military never gave a serious thought to becoming a \u201cnormal\u201d military for normal times. Instead, for our leaders, both military and civilian, the thought process took quite a different turn. You might sum up their thinking this way, retrospectively: Why should we demobilize or even downsize significantly or rein in our global ambitions at a moment when we can finally give them full expression? Why would we want a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d when we could leverage our military assets and become a global power the likes of which the world has never seen, one that would put the Romans and the British in the historical shade? Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer caught the spirit of the moment in February 2001 when he wrote, \u201cAmerica is no mere international citizen. It is the dominant power in the world, more dominant than any since Rome. Accordingly, America is in a position to reshape norms, alter expectations, and create new realities. How? By unapologetic and implacable demonstrations of will.\u201d\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t realize back then was: America\u2019s famed \u201ccontainment policy\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis the Soviet Union didn\u2019t just contain that superpower \u2014 it contained us, too. With the Soviet Union gone, the U.S. military was freed from containment. There was nowhere it couldn\u2019t go and nothing it couldn\u2019t do \u2014 or so the top officials of the Bush administration came into power thinking, even before 9/11. Consider our legacy military bases from the Cold War era that already spanned the globe in an historically unprecedented way. Built largely to contain the Soviets, they could be repurposed as launching pads for interventions of every sort. Consider all those weapon systems meant to deter Soviet aggression. They could be used to project power on a planet seemingly without rivals.\n\nNow was the time to go for broke. Now was the time to go \u201call in,\u201d to borrow the title of Paula Broadwell\u2019s fawning biography of her mentor and lover, General David Petraeus. Under the circumstances, peace dividends were for wimps. In 1993, Madeleine Albright, secretary of state under Bill Clinton, caught the coming post-Cold War mood of twenty-first-century America perfectly when she challenged Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell angrily over what she considered a too-cautious U.S. approach to the former Yugoslavia. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having this superb military that you\u2019re always talking about,\u201d she asked, \u201cif we can\u2019t use it?\u201d\n\nYet even as civilian leaders hankered to flex America\u2019s military muscle in unpromising places like Bosnia and Somalia in the 1990s, and Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, and Yemen in this century, the military itself has remained remarkably mired in Cold War thinking. If I could transport the 1990 version of me to 2015, here\u2019s one thing that would stun him a quarter-century after the collapse of the Soviet Union: the force structure of the U.S. military has changed remarkably little. Its nuclear triad of land-based ICBMs, submarine-launched SLBMs, and nuclear-capable bombers remains thoroughly intact. Indeed, it\u2019s being updated and enhanced at mind-boggling expense (perhaps as high as a trillion dollars over the next three decades). The U.S. Navy? Still built around large, super-expensive, and vulnerableaircraft carrier task forces. The U.S. Air Force? Still pursuing new, ultra-high-tech strategic bombers and new, wildly expensive fighters and attack aircraft \u2014 first the F-22, now the F-35, both supremely disappointing. The U.S. Army? Still configured to fight large-scale, conventional battles, a surplus of M-1 Abrams tanks sitting in mothballs just in case they\u2019re needed to plug the Fulda Gap in Germany against a raging Red Army. Except it\u2019s 2015, not 1990, and no mass of Soviet T-72 tanks remains poised to surge through that gap.\n\nMuch of our military today remains structured to meet and defeat a Soviet threat that long ago ceased to exist. (Occasional sparring matches with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia in and around Ukraine do not add up to the heated \u201crumbles in the jungle\u201d we fought with the Soviet leaders of yesteryear.) And it\u2019s not just a matter of weaponry. Our military hierarchy remains wildly and unsustainably top-heavy, with a Cold War-style cupboard of generals and admirals, as if we were still stockpiling brass in case of another world war and a further expansion of what is already uncontestably the largest military on the planet. If you had asked me in 1990 what the U.S. military would look like in 2015, the one thing I wouldn\u2019t have guessed was that, in its force structure, it would look basically the same.\n\nThis persistence of such Cold War structures and the thinking that goes with them is a vivid illustration of military inertia, the plodding last-war conservatism that is a common enough phenomenon in military history. It\u2019s also a reminder that the military-industrial-congressional-complex that President Dwight Eisenhower first warned us about in 1961 remains in expansion mode more than half a century later, with its taste for business as usual (meaning, among other things, wildly expensive weapons systems). Above all, though, it\u2019s an illustration of something far more disturbing: the failure of democratic America to seize the possibility of a less militarized world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In his farewell address, Ike famously warned about our military industrial complex.
