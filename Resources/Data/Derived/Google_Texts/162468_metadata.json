(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nMore than half the nation\u2019s attorneys general want the Supreme Court to revisit the Affordable Care Act in the coming months.\n\nAttorneys general in 29 states urged the court in filings this week to review lower-court decisions on the landmark health care law\u2019s contraception mandate, but they were split over which of two cases the court should focus on. Both involve employers who say the law\u2019s contraception mandate violates their freedom of religion.\n\nEleven attorneys general, along with the White House, want the court to review a lower-court opinion that found that the contraception mandate violates a business\u2019s freedom of religion. Eighteen other state attorneys general want the court to review another opinion, which found the opposite. Dozens of lawsuits on that mandate have been filed by nonprofits and corporations nationwide.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily an easy question with an easy answer,\u201d says South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley, who joined the 17 attorneys general seeking a review of the ruling that upheld the law\u2019s contraception mandate. \u201cIn other words, each side can cite supporting authority for their positions, which is why in and of itself it\u2019s important for the Supreme Court to solve this.\u201d\n\nThose 18 states, led by Ohio and Michigan, want the court to review a Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that upheld the mandate, which covers contraception that includes the morning-after pill. In that case, the Mennonite Hahn family of Pennsylvania, owners of the kitchen cabinet part manufacturer Conestoga Wood Specialties, sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, arguing that the law\u2019s mandate violated their religious beliefs.\n\nBut the case has implications beyond just the mandate, Jackley says.\n\n\u201cAt least from my perspective, it\u2019s bigger than that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is can a federal mandate force upon an individual or businesses something that is contrary to their religious beliefs? And I believe that is something that the First Amendment protects against.\u201d\n\nAnother case \u2014 in which the court found the mandate did violate a firm\u2019s religious expression\u2014may also have far-reaching implications, California Attorney General Kamala Harris argued in the separate filing with 10 other state attorneys general.\n\nIn that case, the Green family, which owns the nationwide Hobby Lobby arts and crafts chain of stores, sued the government just as the Hahn family had. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the family in June, arguing that the contraception requirement violates the religious rights of the Christian family and its businesses.\n\nCalifornia and the other states see a few big problems with that decision: It grants broad powers to corporations, restricts employee rights and limits states\u2019 power to protect public health and gender equity in health care access. There are also other complications, such as how to determine a corporation\u2019s religious views.\n\n\u201c[H]ow should a court determine the religion of a corporation where a minority of owners or shareholders does not share the religious views of the majority? Or where shareholders disagree on the obligations imposed by their commonly-held religion?\u201d the states ask in their filing.\n\nIf that ruling is upheld, the attorneys general argue, businesses could claim religious exemptions to all sorts of state and federal regulations in the areas of public safety, civil rights, social welfare, land use, housing, employment and public health.\n\nHarris was joined by the attorneys general from Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\n\nJackley was joined by his counterparts in Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The spotlight is on the law's contraception mandate.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/journalistniraj", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The spotlight is on the law's contraception mandate.", "title": "29 states want the Supreme Court weighing in on another Obamacare mandate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/10/24/almost-30-states-want-the-supreme-court-weighing-in-on-another-obamacare-mandate/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2013/10/Health_Care_Contraception_Mandate_0237a_image_982w.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@NirajC"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/10/24/almost-30-states-want-the-supreme-court-weighing-in-on-another-obamacare-mandate/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "supreme court, contraception, contraception mandate, obamacare, affordable care act, health care, healthcare, conestoga wood, hobby lobby, attorney general, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/journalistniraj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "supreme court, contraception, contraception mandate, obamacare, affordable care act, health care, healthcare, conestoga wood, hobby lobby, attorney general, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia,"}, "article_summary": "Both involve employers who say the law\u2019s contraception mandate violates their freedom of religion.\n(Alex Brandon/AP)More than half the nation\u2019s attorneys general want the Supreme Court to revisit the Affordable Care Act in the coming months.\nProtestors rallied against the health care law\u2019s contraception mandate in Philadelphia last year.\nHarris was joined by the attorneys general from Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\nAttorneys general in 29 states urged the court in filings this week to review lower-court decisions on the landmark health care law\u2019s contraception mandate, but they were split over which of two cases the court should focus on."}
