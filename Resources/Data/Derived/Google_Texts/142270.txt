EVERGREEN — If you get in a car accident in Evergreen and get assistance from the fire department, expect to pay for it.

The Evergreen Fire Protection District board of directors Tuesday night approved a fee schedule for 2015 to charge nonresidents for response to motor vehicle accidents and other emergencies.

The fees apply only to individuals who live outside of the district, and in the case of motor vehicle accidents, out-of-district residents who are at fault.

In addition, fees for building inspections, site plan reviews and other such services, as well as facility rentals, will increase in 2015.

The board decided to reevaluate fees in order to make up for a drop of 12.4 percent in property tax revenue for the district since 2010, said Evergreen Fire Chief Mike Weege.

“We want to leverage alternative revenue sources before we go to residents of Evergreen for a mill levy increase,” he said.

The fees new this year apply to motor vehicle accidents and hazmat situation standbys. The charges for individuals who live outside the district will be $500 for the first 90 minutes and $500 for every 90 minutes thereafter.

The district also will begin charging for use of its auditorium and classrooms at the Bergen Park fire station. The rates begin at $40 for four hours in a classroom with no audio/visual equipment usage to $100 for four hours in the auditorium or $150 for the auditorium with audio/visual equipment.
