(Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer)\n\n\"Patent reform.\"\n\nThe term sounds boring and conjures up images of thick stacks of documents, teams of lawyers and legal bills in the millions of dollars. But in Boulder and Longmont, communities brimming with creativity, innovation and new technology, patent reform is a big deal.\n\nDoing it right is an even bigger issue. Four major reform efforts are pending before Congress and each is raising serious concerns among patent holders and those who seek them.\n\n\"What we need is very serious patent reform. They (patents) are used today as weapons more than anything else,\" said Scott Converse, founder of TinkerMill in Longmont and a veteran of patent battles.\n\n\"The current patent laws hurt more than they help, and the proposed reforms address too little of the problem,\" he said.\n\n\"For instance, the approach to fee shifting, the heightened pleading standards, the way demand letters work (with no enforcement ability when abused) and the potential for confusion and contradiction from several additional laws being considered this year,\" Converse said.\n\n\"Reconciling all these proposed bills is virtually guaranteed to make patent law more confusing, not less so.\"\n\nDefensive measures\n\nConverse, who worked for decades at Motorola, is a veteran of patent development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We were developing WiMax (what became 4G, eventually) and I was in charge of software development. One day, we were told we were all going to an off-site meeting with three patent attorneys later that month. What we did (the entire engineering group) was sit around and think up new stuff we could patent. Over a three-day period, we came up with almost 200 patentable ideas. Out of the blue stuff. The lawyers applied for all of them, and got about 120 of them. That's why Motorola was once the world champion at filing patents each year,\" Converse said.\n\nWhy all those patents?\n\n\"As a weapon and a negotiation tool,\" Converse said. \"They would use these patents to shut down potential competitors with lawsuits.\"\n\nKilling trolls\n\nOne major patent issue is a practice known as trolling, when businesses buy up patents, particularly in technical areas such as computer chips, cloud computing and wireless routers, with the sole intention of filing lawsuits or demanding licensing fees from tech companies, particularly start-ups, around the time of their public offering.\n\nTo avoid long and costly legal fights, the defendants almost always settle even if they think they could win. It's a cycle: the more companies settle, the more lawsuits are filed. Patent trolls often do not actually manufacture products or supply services based upon the patents in question.\n\nFor example last year in Silicon Valley, Alex Haro and Chris Hulls raised $50 million for their mobile app, Life360. Soon thereafter they got a letter saying they had three days to pay licensing fees to a company they had never heard of because their app violated its patented technology.\n\nThe duo traced the company, Advanced Ground Information Systems, to a Florida phone number. The number belonged to a 76-year-old who had filed patents a decade ago on cell phone mapping. He said his attorney told him that he had a case against the start-up, even though the general technology had been widely used for years.\n\nIn the end, a jury sided with Life360 on all counts \u2014 after Haro and Hulls spent almost $1.5 million in legal fees.\n\nOne size?\n\nThat's one reason Longmont inventor and businessman Clint Bickmore wants to see a change. He's currently working on new technology for bicycle helmets.\n\n\"I do believe reform is essential. It is a tough issue, because we have trolls doing their scare tactics while at the same time we have inventors losing their investment by not protecting themselves properly, and we also have some that everything went as designed,\" Bickmore said. \"I don't see how the same one construct can protect all inventions, for example, we grant the same rights to people that have spent moments creating an ordinary widget to those that have done years of extensive development on complex inventions.\"\n\nThere are currently four serious proposals for patent reform in various stages of consideration in Congress. They are the Innovation Act; the TROL Act; the Innovation Protection Act; and the STRONG Patents Act.\n\n- Innovation Act\n\nThis legislation passed the House but then failed in the Senate last year. It was reintroduced this session. The Innovation Act provides that the loser of patent infringement litigation would have to pay the attorney's fees of the winner unless the loser's positions are found to have been objectively reasonable. Fee-shifting provisions have been a major stumbling block for this proposal. There is also a question about whether fee-shifting is necessary given recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings giving district courts broader discretion to award attorneys fees, and the reality that a large majority of defendants simply choose to settle rather than fight patent infringement lawsuits to a conclusion, which would be required to obtain fees.\n\n- TROL Act\n\nThis legislation addresses the sending of bad-faith patent demand letters, clarifying that such activity may violate the Federal Trade Commission Act. The act defines bad faith as making false or misleading statements or omissions, with reckless indifference to the truth, or with an awareness of a high probability that the statements or omissions would deceive the sender intentionally. The TROL Act also authorizes the FTC and state attorneys general to bring actions to stop the abusive behavior.\n\n- Innovation Protection Act\n\nThis bill would provide a source of permanent funding for the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). The fees collected by the USPTO would remain available to the USPTO until expended. Fee diversion is the practice of congressional appropriators' diverting patent application fees that innovators and entrepreneurs pay to other government programs.\n\nAppropriators have been unwilling to commit to allowing the USPTO to keep user fees, diverting over $1 billion in user fees from the USPTO since 1992 according to the Intellectual Property Owners Association.\n\n- STRONG Patents Act\n\nThe Support Technology and Research for Our Nations Growth Patents Act, or the STRONG Patents Act, was filed on March 3. This proposal would make a variety of changes to administrative proceedings that occur after a patent has been granted. These include requiring the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to abandon the broadest reasonable interpretation standard (BRI) and mandating that claims be presumed valid. The act would also eliminate fee diversion, make it easier to obtain willful damages, and give the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) greater ability to go after those who send fraudulent or misleading demand letters.\n\nDiscouraging investment\n\nMark Spiecker, CEO of Sharklet Technologies in Aurora, is deeply concerned about some of the patent reform measures, including the Innovation Act, because he believes it may increase individual liability and discourage investors.\n\n\"We have asked Congress to carefully craft targeted legislation to address patent abuse practices while maintaining the strength of the overall patent system in order to avoid any unintended consequences,\" he said.\n\nSpiecker said smaller companies in particular need these changes.\n\n\"Small companies need to move quickly. We can't afford to face overly lengthy discovery time periods and mountains of paperwork. The winner of a patent fight should not be the one with the deepest pockets because they can financially exhaust their opponent,\" he added.\n\nBioscience\n\nColorado's bioscience industry consists of some 600 small, early-stage companies, with roughly 28,000 direct employees. Patents are viewed somewhat differently here because of the many years it takes to get from patent to production.\n\n\"When a bioscience company is granted a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), they are likely not able to immediately capitalize on the value of the patent,\" said Leah Lindahl, vice president of Colorado Bioscience Association.\n\n\"Instead, they spend 10 years researching and conducting clinical trials to prove the patent is not only unique, but the treatment is also deemed safe and effective by the FDA. For these early stage bioscience companies, intellectual property and a company's patent rights are typically their most valued, and often only, asset.\"\n\nUniversities, others alarmed\n\nIn a letter co-signed by the Association of American Universities, American Council on Education, the Association of University Technology Managers, the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Council on Government Relations, Lindahl said that the Innovation Act would weaken the entire patent system making it more difficult, risky and costly for all patent holders to defend their rights in good faith.\n\n\"Patent legislation is extremely complex and any legislation should take into account the changes within the system as a whole as well as the various stakeholders who will be impacted by these changes,\" Lindahl said.\n\n\"We hope members of the House of Representatives will work with the various stakeholders, especially the small and early-stage companies, to understand these concerns, and carefully draft amendments and review language in order to ensure the legislation addresses patent abuse but does not hinder the overall patent system.\"\n\nFrivolous lawsuits\n\nMany in the science, technology and university arena are watching the patent debate in Washington closely.\n\nOne of them is Kate Tallman, associate vice president at the Technology Transfer Office of the University of Colorado - Boulder.\n\n\"There are still too many patents out there,\" Tallman said. \"This leads to trolling and frivolous lawsuits. That is what needs to be addressed.\"\n\nHer office, along with the University of Colorado, hundreds of universities, technology companies, bioscience firms and other organizations, recently sent a letter to the Senate explaining their growing concerns over patent legislation.\n\n\"It is our belief that the future of the U.S. economy and our ability to compete successfully in the global economy is dependent on Congress fostering a strong patent system that incentivizes innovators to invent,\" the letter states.\n\n\"We are concerned that some of the measures under consideration go far beyond what is necessary or desirable to combat abusive patent litigation, and, in fact, would do serious damage to the patent system. As it stands, many of the provisions assume that every patent holder is a patent troll,\" the letter adds. \"Drafting legislation in this way seriously weakens the ability of every patent holder to enforce a patent. This approach clearly favors a business model that does not rely on patents and tilts the balance in favor of patent infringers, thereby discouraging investment in innovation.\"\n\nWill reform work?\n\nPatent attorneys and others in Colorado have little confidence that reforms will succeed.\n\nRob Lyman, a Centennial-based patent lawyer, remains skeptical of the pending legislation.\n\n\"Overall, like any legislation, this will have all kinds of consequences that we can't know in advance, and it is virtually guaranteed not to work the way the drafters want or intend it to work,\" Lyman pointed out. \"Congress likes to think it has a lot of power, but people do what they want, in patent law as in life. This is especially true where there is money at stake.\"\n\nOver at TinkerMill, Scott Converse is on the fence over the proposed reforms.\n\n\"As they currently stand, we would be better off without them. Their original intent, to protect inventors with truly unique new inventions, was good. If we could get back to that, I'd be for patents,\" Converse said.\n\n\"However, with the speed of innovation now, patents are generally useless in business. Mostly because, by the time you get a patent, we're three years past where it's relevant. This again, makes them useful mostly as a weapon to sue people with and not very good for innovation.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nVince Winkel: 303-684-5291, winkelv@times-call.com or twitter.com/vincewinkel", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/ci_28424384/patent-reform-efforts-worrisome-boulder-county-inventors", "modificationDate": "2015-07-02T17:03:25-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0702/20150702__05TCCpatw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Vince Winkel \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "\"Patent reform.\"\nThe term sounds boring and  conjures up images of thick stacks of documents, teams of lawyers and legal bills in the millions of dollars.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28424384:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-04T14:00:40-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/ci_28424384/patent-reform-efforts-worrisome-boulder-county-inventors", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0702/20150702__05TCCpatw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\"Patent reform.\"\nThe term sounds boring and  conjures up images of thick stacks of documents, teams of lawyers and legal bills in the millions of dollars.", "title": "Patent reform efforts worrisome to Boulder County inventors"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "\"Patent reform.\"\nThe term sounds boring and  conjures up images of thick stacks of documents, teams of lawyers and legal bills in the millions of dollars.", "title": "Patent reform efforts worrisome to Boulder County inventors", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/ci_28424384/patent-reform-efforts-worrisome-boulder-county-inventors", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0702/20150702__05TCCpatw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-04T14:00:40-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-07-02T16:27:46-0600", "sailthru.title": "Patent reform efforts worrisome to Boulder County inventors", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Business", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Vince WinkelStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0702/20150702__05TCCpatw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-07-02T17:04:16-0600", "news_keywords": "Business, Technology, news, Longmont Colorado, Longmont Times Call, business news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1744\"", "article_summary": "Local inventors, attorneys worry that multiple reform measures will hamper rather than improve patent processMark Spiecker, CEO of Sharklet Technologies, is concerned about the direction of patent reform.\nBut in Boulder and Longmont, communities brimming with creativity, innovation and new technology, patent reform is a big deal.\nThey are the Innovation Act; the TROL Act; the Innovation Protection Act; and the STRONG Patents Act.\nThere are currently four serious proposals for patent reform in various stages of consideration in Congress.\n- STRONG Patents ActThe Support Technology and Research for Our Nations Growth Patents Act, or the STRONG Patents Act, was filed on March 3."}
