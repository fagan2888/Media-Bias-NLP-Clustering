But they made clear Washington will continue to challenge what it considers Beijing\u2019s unfounded maritime claims.\n\nThe United States has conducted what it calls \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises in recent months, sailing near disputed islands to underscore its right to navigate the seas. U.S. Navy officials have said they plan to conduct more and increasingly complex exercises in the future.\n\n\u201cOur long-standing position is unchanged \u2013 we do not take a position on competing sovereignty claims to naturally formed land features in the South China Sea,\u201d a senior Obama administration official said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe routinely conduct such operations throughout the world to challenge maritime claims that would unlawfully restrict rights and freedoms provided in international law. This applies to the South China Sea as well,\u201d said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe USS Stennis carrier strike group is currently operating in the South China Sea. The next freedom of navigation exercise is unlikely to be conducted by a carrier like the Stennis, but rather by a smaller ship, the source said.\n\nExperts predict the next U.S. challenge to the various claims in the South China Sea could occur near Mischief Reef, a feature claimed by the Philippines and which was submerged at high tide before China began a dredging project to turn it into an island in 2014.\n\nMischief Reef is now the site of one of three military-length airfields China has built on man-made islands in the Spratly Islands archipelago.\n\nU.S. Navy ships regularly patrol the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion of world trade travels every year. China claims most of the area, and Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims.\n\nIn recent months, with tensions rising around China\u2019s reclamation activities, U.S. ships have been frequently and routinely shadowed by Chinese ships and regular communications with Chinese vessels have often been tense.\n\nNews of the planned exercise came a day after U.S. President Barack Obama met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a nuclear summit in Washington.\n\nDuring the meetings, Xi told Obama that China would not accept any behavior in the disguise of freedom of navigation that violates its sovereignty, in a clear warning to the United States.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told Reuters on Saturday that China opposed any such exercise.\n\n\u201cChina consistently respects and supports the freedom of navigation and fly over that all countries\u2019 enjoy in the South China Sea under international law, but resolutely opposes any country using so-called \u2018freedom of navigation\u2019 as an excuse to damage China\u2019s sovereignty, security and maritime rights,\u201d Hong said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As turmoil rises in the Asian-Pacific sphere, the U.S. plans to send another armed flotilla near the contest Spratly Islands.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "title": "U.S. Navy to send third patrol near Spratly Islands.", "og": {"site_name": "TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles", "description": "As turmoil rises in the Asian-Pacific sphere, the U.S. plans to send another armed flotilla near the contest Spratly Islands.", "title": "U.S. Navy to send third patrol near Spratly Islands.", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 520, "identifier": "http://www.trunews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/r-547.jpeg", "height": 293}, "updated_time": "2016-04-02T15:05:23-04:00", "url": "http://www.trunews.com/u-s-navy-to-send-third-patrol-through-south-china-sea/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles", "description": "As turmoil rises in the Asian-Pacific sphere, the U.S. plans to send another armed flotilla near the contest Spratly Islands.", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. Navy to send third patrol near Spratly Islands."}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 107546629279454, "app_id": 107546629279454}, "msvalidate.01": "F6797679D7E81DB3F5C960F7552EF745", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/trunews", "section": "Featured", "tag": "Xi Jinping", "published_time": "2016-04-02T14:53:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-02T15:05:23-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "U.S. Navy ships regularly patrol the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion of world trade travels every year.\nThis applies to the South China Sea as well,\u201d said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n(TRUNEWS) As turmoil rises in the Asian-Pacific sphere, the U.S. plans to send another armed flotilla near the contest Spratly Islands.\nThe USS Stennis carrier strike group is currently operating in the South China Sea.\nChina claims most of the area, and Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan have rival claims."}
