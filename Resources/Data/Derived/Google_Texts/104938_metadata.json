Bill Nelson Bill NelsonSenators to House: FAA reauthorization would enhance airport security Dems discuss dropping Wasserman Schultz Grassley worried about FCC box proposal MORE (D-Fla.), who pushed to increase the cap for victims to $500 million after the Philadelphia Amtrak crash.\n\n\u201cThis agreement will go a long way toward helping the victims and their families get the compensation they deserve,\" Nelson continued.\n\nThe Amtrak train that derailed just outside of Philadelphia was traveling from Washington, D.C., to New York. The train was carrying more than 200 passengers and was traveling 106 miles per hour at the time of the accident, which was more than double the speed limit in the area of track.\n\nThe $200 million limit on settlements with Amtrak and other commuter railways was passed in 1997, during a period when the company's finances were on the rocks.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate previously tried to lift the rail settlement cap to $500 million after a 2008 commuter rail accident in California, but the measure was never brought up for a vote in the upper chamber.\n\nNelson's office said during earlier debate about increasing the liability cap that the lawsuit limit was set at $200 million in the 1990s because \"Congress decided the cap was necessary to keep Amtrak and a then-sagging rail industry from potential financial failure in the event of a major accident.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow anyone to suffer additionally due to an outdated cap based on mid-1990 dollars,\u201d Nelson said in a statement in May.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The measure allows victims of a the crash outside Philadelphia to sue for $295 million.", "description": "The measure allows victims of a the crash outside Philadelphia to sue for $295 million.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The measure allows victims of a the crash outside Philadelphia to sue for $295 million.", "title": "Highway bill raises cap on Amtrak lawsuits for May crash", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/262951-highway-bill-raises-cap-on-amtrak-lawsuits", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/amtrak_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/262951-highway-bill-raises-cap-on-amtrak-lawsuits", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-11T13:38-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Bill Nelson, Amtrak, Amtrak Philadelphia derailment, Amtrak liability cap, Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional,Bill Nelson,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-11T13:38:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/262951-highway-bill-raises-cap-on-amtrak-lawsuits", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The measure allows victims of a the crash outside Philadelphia to sue for $295 million.", "card": "summary", "title": "Highway bill raises cap on Amtrak lawsuits for May crash"}, "dcterms.title": "Highway bill raises cap on Amtrak lawsuits for May crash"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe092a\"", "article_summary": "The recently approved highway funding bill increases the amount for which victims of a deadly Amtrak train crash near Philadelphia earlier this year can sue the company.\nADVERTISEMENTSupporters of increasing the amount Amtrak could be sued for over the deadly Philadelphia crash said the liability increase that was included in the highway bill is long overdue.\nThe lawsuit cap would be adjusted for inflation for all other Amtrak accidents going forward under the highway funding legislation.\nThe Amtrak train that derailed just outside of Philadelphia was traveling from Washington, D.C., to New York.\nThe $200 million limit on settlements with Amtrak and other commuter railways was passed in 1997, during a period when the company's finances were on the rocks."}
