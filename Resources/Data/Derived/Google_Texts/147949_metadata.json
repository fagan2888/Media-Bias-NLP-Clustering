The video, featuring the poem \u201cJust a Common Soldier,\u201d has gone viral with the launch of a video campaign earlier this year.\n\nClouse gave the following message at the event: \u201cWe produced this video to get people thinking about veterans who have given so much for our country. So often we forget the sacrifice of ordinary citizens who do extraordinary things for our liberty and way of life.\u201d\n\nWith the launch of the project during Memorial Day weekend, a goal was set to reach 21 millions \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cshares\u201d of the video on social media, in honor of the approximately 21 million living vets, between Memorial Day and Veterans Day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply moving experience,\u201d Clouse said in Times Square. \u201cAnd no less than our veterans deserve to keep them from fading from our memory.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Tony Lo Bianco reads the poem.\n\n\u201cI heard Tony Lo Bianco, Hollywood actor of stage and television, read this magnificent poem called \u2018Just a Common Soldier\u2019 to friends on several occasions,\u201d Clouse said. \u201cIt was a moving tribute to the soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen who have served our great country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout fail, it moved my friends powerfully and even to tears. I was inspired to take Tony\u2019s read of the poem and show images of our honored vets, as they were on the battlefield, and as they are now. Little did I know that it would go viral over Memorial Day weekend and reach 6.9 million people in five days.\u201d\n\nAfter the New York event wrapped up, in a phone call, Clouse told The Daily Signal he was pleased with the turnout for the event.\n\nClouse would like the poem to come alive, especially for young people, and for people to \u201cnever forget the sacrifices of America\u2019s military.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think [the video] inspired people, maybe like a paradigm shift, to think differently about the military and its role in keeping us safe and free.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply moving experience.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply moving experience.\"", "title": "This Veterans Video Went Viral.
