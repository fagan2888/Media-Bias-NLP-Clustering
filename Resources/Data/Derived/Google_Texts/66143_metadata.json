Terry McAuliffe poses in front of a sidewalk bookstore in Havana during his April 2010 trade mission. The books behind McAuliffe were displayed in crates that once held Virginia apples. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, determined to make his mark in an office once occupied by Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, heads to Cuba on Sunday, hoping to capitalize on a historic thaw between the United States and the communist island nation.\n\nThe timing for McAuliffe (D) is just as momentous.\n\nThe three-day trade mission comes as the term-limited governor reaches the midway point of his stint and as Republicans maintain a tight grip on the General Assembly. With the House and Senate firmly dug in against many of his top priorities, McAuliffe is staking his governorship on nonpartisan goals he can pull off largely on his own \u2014 chief among them, economic development and foreign trade. He is setting his sights not across Capitol Square as much as across oceans.\n\n\u201cNinety-five percent of the world\u2019s customers live outside of the United States of America,\u201d McAuliffe said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go where the customers are. . . . For many of these countries, you can\u2019t do it with a phone call.\u201d\n\n[Virginia farmers find an eager trading partner: Cuba]\n\nSince running for governor in 2013, McAuliffe has stressed the need to expand and diversify the state\u2019s economy, which is highly dependent on military and other federal spending.\n\nThat is a goal with bipartisan appeal, but building a legacy around those aspirations is proving to be a tremendous challenge, with McAuliffe up against stiff economic head winds and skeptical Republicans. The governor has turned off some GOP legislators by trying to sell partisan social policies as economic development.\n\nEnhancing gay rights or abortion access? That, the governor contends, would make the state more \u201copen and welcoming\u201d to new businesses. Expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, McAuliffe argues, would create 30,000 health-care jobs and shore up rural hospitals. So far, Republicans haven\u2019t bought it.\n\nSo now, as the governor heads off on his latest international trip, he has an opportunity to delve into economic development work in its purest form, the realm where he is most likely to shine. Away from Richmond, apart from his larger social agenda, McAuliffe will simply be selling Virginia.\n\n\u201cI think where he is most successful and where his legacy is potentially made, if he\u2019s going to have one, is going to be on economic development, and not just on bringing jobs to Virginia, but on transforming the Virginia economy, even just a little bit, from dependency on federal spending,\u201d said Quentin Kidd, a political scientist at Christopher Newport University. \u201cIn a funny way, it\u2019s a safe refuge from the fights in the General Assembly that he can\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nBut in Cuba, McAuliffe has not chosen an easy course. The small, relatively poor country still labors under most Cold War-era trade restrictions, even after a year of detente. Some of McAuliffe\u2019s GOP foes roll their eyes at the notion that Cuba can boost Virginia\u2019s fortunes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not where I\u2019d be going,\u201d said House Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights).\n\nDel.-elect Jason Miyares, a Virginia Beach Republican who in November became the first Cuban American elected to the General Assembly, was more pointed, calling on the governor to meet with dissidents.\n\n\u201cAs Governor McAuliffe decides to ring in the New Year in the only non-democratic nation in the entire Western Hemisphere, perhaps he should keep in mind the thousands of dissidents that are harassed, beaten and imprisoned each day in Cuba simply because they yearn for freedom,\u201d Miyares said in a statement Friday night.\n\nBut Del. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax) sees potential in Cuba. His brother and father once held a special State Department license to do telecommunications work on the island.\n\n\u201cMy brother says they\u2019ve got beaches that go for miles and miles,\u201d Albo said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s money to be made there, and the first person who gets in there wins.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe is not the first Virginia governor to see economic promise in an island that is just a three-day sail from the Port of Virginia. His three immediate predecessors have courted Cuba, starting with now-Sen. Mark R. Warner (D). Warner wanted to lead a Virginia trade mission to the island when he took office in 2002, taking advantage of liberalization that became law when President Bill Clinton signed the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. Advisers, worried about the optics of a potential sit-down with Fidel Castro, talked him out of it.\n\nWarner instead sent his commerce and trade secretary, who helped Virginia farmers sell about $800,000 in apples and soybeans to Cuba in 2003 \u2014 the first exports from Virginia to Cuba since President John F. Kennedy imposed a trade embargo in 1962.\n\nVirginia has been selling to Cuba ever since. The value of that trade \u2014 $25 million in sales in 2014 \u2014 is dwarfed by exports to Canada ($3.7 billion) and China ($2 billion), but it could add up, Kidd said.\n\n\u201cDiversifying the economy is about little bits here and little bits there,\u201d he said.\n\nInterest in Cuba has only grown since President Obama moved to normalize relations a year ago, raising hopes that in the not-too-distant future the trade embargo will be fully lifted and the country transformed. McAuliffe will be the fourth sitting U.S. governor to travel there since 2015, behind New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D), Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R). McAuliffe hopes to have a head start because of Virginia\u2019s relationships there.\n\n\u201cAs things are changing between us and Cuba, the foresight that four governors have shown \u2013 Mark Warner, Tim Kaine, Bob McDonnell and Terry McAuliffe \u2014 really does put Virginia in a good position to recapture business and grow business and, as we go beyond agricultural trade, give us the ability to be standing right at the front of the line to talk about the opportunities,\u201d said Todd Haymore, McAuliffe\u2019s secretary of agriculture and forestry.\n\nEven critics concede that McAuliffe has been an ebullient cheerleader for the state, one with an enormous network of national and international contacts amassed over decades in politics and business. A former Democratic National Committee chairman and close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton, McAuliffe had associates in Kuwait and Oman he could call on during a November trade mission to helped get bans on Virginia poultry lifted.\n\n\u201cListen \u2014 I sat down with the crown prince in Kuwait,\u201d McAuliffe noted. \u201cI said: \u2018Your highness, you\u2019re buying food from all over the globe. You\u2019re importing it. Buy your chickens from me.\u2019 It\u2019s not a hard sell. I have relationships with these folks. I\u2019ve known them forever and ever.\u201d\n\nAnd he does have a record of some success with his strategy. The governor often recites a list of gains over his first two years: New economic development projects worth $9 billion\u2013 more than any other governor in Virginia history and double what his past two predecessors achieved at the same point during their terms. And an unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, the lowest since August 2008.\n\nBut the picture is not all rosy in a state hit particularly hard by the recession and the automatic federal spending cuts known as sequestration.\n\nSince March 2008, Virginia has lost 293,400 private-sector jobs \u2013 each worth an average of $148,000 a year to the state\u2019s economy, said Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. So far, it has replaced 224,500 of those \u2014 but with positions worth an average of $113,000 a year. Economic growth flatlined in 2014, landing Virginia 49th among 50 states and the District.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, McAuliffe is pushing right uphill,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that you can just go out and do a reasonably effective job of raising the profile of the state and attracting investment. The home base is still bleeding. It isn\u2019t all net gain. It\u2019s serious triage which is needed, and I\u2019m not sure that some of the economies can be saved. And you can\u2019t just backfill them with investment from China.\u201d\n\n[Terry McAuliffe\u2019s Rolodex can pay off for Virginia]\n\nMcAuliffe also has led trade missions to China (twice), Japan, South Korea, Europe, India and the United Arab Emirates. Whenever the governor plays on the international stage, there are always suggestions that he is capitalizing on his connections to the Clintons, a former president and an aspiring one.\n\n\u201cThe Cubans understand that Mr. McAuliffe can give them perhaps some insight, a back channel to the Clintons,\u201d said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. \u201cWhen they talk to Governor McAuliffe, they can easily \u2014 and they should \u2014 picture him wearing one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pantsuits, because that\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s going to come out of his mouth. He\u2019s going to be the channeler-in-chief.\u201d\n\nThe island is not entirely new territory for McAuliffe. After losing the Democratic primary in 2009, he volunteered to sell Virginia apples and wine in Cuba. He came away with nothing but a tongue-lashing from a Cuban official about the perceived injustices of the U.S. trade embargo.\n\nIt is not unusual for first-timers to return from Cuba empty-handed, said Kirby Jones, a Cuba trade consultant who accompanied McAuliffe on that April 2010 visit.\n\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t click and pan out at that time,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis trip could be totally different.\u201d\n\n[ Virginia didn\u2019t wait to have a relationship with Cuba ]\n\nOnce McAuliffe won the governorship in 2013, he began cultivating a relationship with Cuba\u2019s top Washington-based diplomat, Jos\u00e9 R. Caba\u00f1as, who was then chief of the Cuban Interests Section. (Caba\u00f1as only officially became ambassador as relations were normalized.) McAuliffe has visited Caba\u00f1as several times at the Cuban Embassy in Washington and twice entertained him in Richmond.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve gone up to the embassy. I\u2019ve sat, had a Cuban cigar with him,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a glass of rum with him. This is how you build relationships with folks.\u201d\n\nThat approach has worked better with foreign leaders at times than with some Richmond Republicans. McAuliffe put out the welcome mat for the GOP in his first session, upgrading the mansion bar at his own expense and inviting legislators over for nightly receptions. Cox and some other Republican leaders continue to scoff at his \u201ccocktail party\u201d outreach.\n\n\u201cCandidly, it\u2019s probably one of the more difficult relationships I think I\u2019ve had with a governor,\u201d Cox said. \u201cHis personality \u2014 it\u2019s different. It\u2019s very over the top, and in some ways that plays well for him. People like enthusiasm. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. [But] the constantly claiming credit, the constant \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s just something legislators and others are turned off by.\u201d\n\nCox and other GOP leaders have worked well with McAuliffe on some critical issues, including plugging a projected $2.4 billion budget hole in 2015. And some Republicans have warmed to McAuliffe personally while remaining cool to his more partisan goals. Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. (R-Buckingham), one of the legislature\u2019s most conservative members, joined the governor for a beer at the mansion in December.\n\n\u201cI like him as well as anybody I know that I don\u2019t trust,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nWhen McAuliffe unveiled his $109 billion spending plan in December, Republican budget leaders had nice things to say about its focus on K-12, higher education and economic development \u2014 even as they flatly rejected his latest call for Medicaid expansion. The governor\u2019s office saw that as progress \u2014 as well as a good reason to keep hunting for wins overseas.\n\n\u201cThe governor has forged great working relationships with many Republicans in the General Assembly, and that has produced real results on key issues,\u201d said his spokesman, Brian Coy. \u201cThose relationships will continue to bear fruit. The governor also recognizes that he has a unique opportunity and a unique skill set when it comes to bringing new jobs to Virginia and finding new markets for Virginia products. And he\u2019s going to pursue that task just as vigorously as he does his legislative agenda.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Saddled with an opposition legislature, Gov.
