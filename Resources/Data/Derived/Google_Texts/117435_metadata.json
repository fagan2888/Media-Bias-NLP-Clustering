Her article is \u201cA slight case of bastardy.\u201d It elaborates on points made elsewhere by others in a useful and thought-provoking way.\n\nEmery does not mention any of the foundational lies of Obamacare that have been central to this series, but I think they bear on her point as well. These are certainly among the basic lies that were repeated over and over by Obama and the Democrats leading up to passage of the law:\n\n1. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. 2. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 3. Families will on average save $2500 annually. 4. Obamacare won\u2019t add a dime to the deficit.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive, but it seems to me to hit the highlights. Lies all, central to the passage of the law, and colossal in their falsity.
