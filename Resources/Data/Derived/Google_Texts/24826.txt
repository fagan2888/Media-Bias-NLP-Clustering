MILFORD, Maine â€” An 18-wheeler at Randall Madden Trucking on the Stud Mill Road was destroyed by fire early Tuesday, according to officials.

The building did not suffer significant damage, Milford Fire Chief Chris Matson said, but the truck was completely burned out by the time firefighters arrived shortly after 2:30 a.m. No one was injured.

Matson said only that one truck was lost in the fire, and the cab was completely burned. Firefighters cleared some smoke and combed through the structure after discovering the burnt-out truck.

Matson said everything was under control by 3 a.m. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

Crews from Milford, Old Town, Alton, Bradley and Greenbush responded, with the latter three providing tankers because there were no fire hydrants in the area.
