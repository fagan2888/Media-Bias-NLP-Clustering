The information also helps them to spot bad habits between they become harmful.\n\n\n\nPrivacy advocates and many patients aren't impressed. They say the new technology is invasive and hurts the doctor-patient relationship.\n\nBig doctor is watching you? A new program could track whether you buy cigarettes or fatty foods or let your gym membership lapse by tracking credit card purchases\n\nBloomberg News reports that several healthcare groups are beginning to use advanced demographic and spending data - from both credit cards and store loyalty cards - to track patient behavior, though the program remains in its infancy.\n\n\n\nThe changes can be chalked up to ObamaCare, which has put pressure on hospitals to keep patients health and out of emergency rooms. Hospitals can be fined if patients are re-admitted within a short time of treatment.\n\n\n\nCarolinas HeathcareSystem, a Charlotte-based company that operates 900 hospitals, clinics, doctor's offices and surgery center in North and South Carolina, is on the forefront of the trend.\n\n\n\n'What we are looking to find are people before they end up in trouble,' Dr Michael Dulin, who is in charge of the program for Carolinas, told Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n'The idea is to use big data and predictive models to think about population health and drill down to the individual levels to find someone running into trouble that we can reach out to and try to help out.'\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which has 20 hospitals in Pennsylvania and an insurance company, is using a less detailed model that collects general demographic information, like whether the patient has children or owns a car to make predictions about whether emergency room visits - which is one of the most costly ways to get treatment.\n\nBoth companies use the data to call patients before they ever come in for treatment. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center tries to set up its clients with a doctor or nurse practitioner appointment to get ahead of any health problems.\n\nJorjanne Murry, an accountant from Charlotte, North Carolina, with Type 1 Diabetes, said she is already getting regular phone calls from her insurance company, wanting to talk about how she is managing her disease.\n\n\n\n'It is one thing to have a number I can call if I have a problem or question, it is another thing to get unsolicited phone calls. I don\u2019t like that,' she told Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nIrina Raicu, an Internet ethics professor at Santa Clara University, blasted the new strategy as 'very paternalistic toward individuals, inclined to see human beings as simply the sum of data points about them.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "The,doctor,spy,Hospitals,insurance,companies,using,credit,card,data,monitor,patients,eat,belong,gym,smoke", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2671059/The-doctor-spy-Hospitals-insurance-companies-using-credit-card-data-monitor-patients-eat-belong-gym-smoke.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Sneak a pack of cigarettes, let your gym membership lapse or start eating unhealthy foods and you could get a scolding phone call from your doctor.", "title": "Hospitals using credit card data to spy on patients' diets, smoking", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2671059/The-doctor-spy-Hospitals-insurance-companies-using-credit-card-data-monitor-patients-eat-belong-gym-smoke.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/26/article-2671059-1F28A6A800000578-720_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2671059/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2671059/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2671059, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "The,doctor,spy,Hospitals,insurance,companies,using,credit,card,data,monitor,patients,eat,belong,gym,smoke", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-06-26T17:26:47.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Michael+Zennie", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T20:33:01.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "The doctor spy Hospitals insurance companies using credit card data monitor patients eat belong gym smoke"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Sneak a pack of cigarettes, let your gym membership lapse or start eating unhealthy foods and you could get a scolding phone call from your doctor.", "title": "Hospitals using credit card data to spy on patients' diets, smoking", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2671059/The-doctor-spy-Hospitals-insurance-companies-using-credit-card-data-monitor-patients-eat-belong-gym-smoke.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/26/article-2671059-1F28A6A800000578-720_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Sneak a pack of cigarettes, let your gym membership lapse or start eating unhealthy foods and you could get a scolding phone call from your doctor."}, "article_summary": "The companies that are using the new tracking programs say the data allow doctors to make sure their patients stay healthy in between visits.\nBoth companies use the data to call patients before they ever come in for treatment.\nSneak a pack of cigarettes, let your gym membership lapse or start eating unhealthy foods and you could get a scolding phone call from your doctor or insurance provider.\nThe changes can be chalked up to ObamaCare, which has put pressure on hospitals to keep patients health and out of emergency rooms.\nHospitals can be fined if patients are re-admitted within a short time of treatment."}
