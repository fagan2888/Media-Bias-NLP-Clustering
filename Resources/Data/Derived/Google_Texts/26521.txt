Former “Bush brain” Karl Rove published an editorial in the Wall Street Journal yesterday in which he complained about President Barack Obama’s “odd” decision to wish Americans “Merry Christmas” with foreign-sounding Hawaiian words, which he linked via juxtaposition to statements the president made about ISIS in an interview with NPR’s Steve Inskeep earlier this week.

“Before leaving for his annual Hawaiian Christmas vacation, President Obama found an odd way to wish Americans ‘Mele Kalikimaka!'” Rove wrote. “In an interview with National Public Radio, he discussed Islamic State, also known as ISIS. While admitting that ‘they can hurt our people and our families,’ the president once again played down the terrorist threat.”

Rove seemed particularly upset that Obama’s Christmas greeting was made around the same time he said that ISIS “is not an organization that can destroy the United States — this is a not a huge industrial power that can pose great risks to us institutionally or in a systematic way.”
