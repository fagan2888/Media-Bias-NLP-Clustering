Instead, they took employers' or societal perspectives.\n\nThe authors say analyzing those costs may not take into account ramifications throughout the economic system.\n\nFor example, Miller said, a person in an alcohol-related car accident may need hand surgery in a local hospital. If they weren\u2019t in the accident, they may instead buy a diamond ring, which would likely benefit another country\u2019s economy.\n\nIn that situation, the costs associated with an alcohol-related car crash may actually benefit the U.S. economy, because the money being spent on the surgery is staying in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThat was something that concerned me that having a cast on your finger rather than a ring may be good for the economy, but it turns out it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.\n\nThe researchers found that about 12 percent of people involved in U.S. car crashes in 2010 were involved in an alcohol-related crash.\n\nMiller said that\u2019s about half of the proportion involved in alcohol-related crashes in 1984 to 1986.\n\nThey found that Americans drove 25.5 billion miles in 2010 with blood alcohol levels exceeding 0.05. Almost 14 billion of those miles were at blood alcohol levels above the legal limit of 0.08. Each of those miles cut U.S. economic output by $0.80, the authors say.\n\nOverall, alcohol-related crashes reduced the U.S. GDP by $10 billion and cost 234,000 jobs, they found.\n\nHealthcare was the only business sector that benefited from alcohol-related crashes, because of the increased demand for medical services after traffic accidents.\n\nMiller said the economic growth is partially due to people not being out of work and being able to spend money on other services. It\u2019s also due to employers not having to pay benefits for disability, paid time off and additional workers.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening by reducing impaired driving, we\u2019re reducing the fringe benefit bill that employers have to pay,\u201d he said.\n\nThe researchers caution that their results are limited by the modeling they used. Also, they don\u2019t account for premiums paid for workers to take high-risk jobs, or for the cost of prevention efforts.\n\nSOURCE: http://bmj.co/1zkHas8 Injury Prevention, online April 29, 2015.\n\n(Story refiles to correct in paragraph 13, 0.80 to 0.08.)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "reducing, alcohol, related, car, crashes, may, help, economy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Five percent of the compounded annual growth to the US gross domestic product results from fewer drunk drivers taking the wheel.", "title": "Reducing Alcohol-Related Car Crashes May Help Economy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/reducing-alcohol-related-car-crashes-may-help-economy-331724", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/02/car-crash.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Five percent of the compounded annual growth to the US gross domestic product results from fewer drunk drivers taking the wheel.", "title": "Reducing Alcohol-Related Car Crashes May Help Economy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/reducing-alcohol-related-car-crashes-may-help-economy-331724", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/02/car-crash.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/02/car-crash.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-05-02T12:16:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-02T12:16:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Five percent of the compounded annual growth to the US gross domestic product results from fewer drunk drivers taking the wheel."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19d4\"", "article_summary": "The researchers write in the journal Injury Prevention that previous cost estimates of alcohol-related car crashes don\u2019t describe the effects to the economy.\n\u201cWe need to hold the course and keep expanding it.\u201dThe installation of breath-controlled ignitions or crash avoidance systems may help reduce alcohol-relate car crashes, Miller told Reuters Health by phone.\nHealthcare was the only business sector that benefited from alcohol-related crashes, because of the increased demand for medical services after traffic accidents.\nOverall, alcohol-related crashes reduced the U.S. GDP by $10 billion and cost 234,000 jobs, they found.\nThe researchers found that about 12 percent of people involved in U.S. car crashes in 2010 were involved in an alcohol-related crash."}
