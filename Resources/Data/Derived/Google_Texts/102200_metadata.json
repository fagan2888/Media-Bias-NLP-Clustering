Around here, though, people call those windstorms the Taku winds - and Juneau hasn\u2019t experienced much of them this year.\n\nBut why not? What are the conditions in which the Taku winds arise?\n\nFirst and most important, said Tom Ainsworth, Meteorologist in Charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service Forecast Office: It needs to be cold. After that, there are three main things that cause the Taku Winds.\n\nFirst, wind flowing perpendicular to the mountains; down the Taku Inlet and up against Salisbury Ridge, for instance.\n\nSecond, there needs to be a stable layer of air a little higher than the mountains, at which the cold air will rise no higher.\n\nThird, something called a \u201ccritical level\u201d - a level at which the wind will reverse direction, must also be present.\n\n\u201cIf one of them doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Ainsworth said, \u201cthe technical term is a \u2018busted forecast.\u2019\u201d\n\nCold air is dense, and it accumulates on the east side of the mainland mountains. It can\u2019t rise higher than a certain level. When it \u201cpiles up,\u201d it spills through gaps in those mountains, flows along the Taku River until a curve perpendicular to the mountain ridge, until it\u2019s accumulated enough to rise over a gap in the mountains and get funneled over Salisbury Ridge. What happens next is comparable to what happens to a river when it encounters a rocky section and turns to whitewater - air currents, too, develop waves, which is why the Taku winds are gusty.\n\nIn a stable atmosphere, that cold air gets squeezed between the mountains and the level at which they can go no higher, something Ainsworth compares to a thumb on a garden hose.\n\nThose factors causing that reaction are \u201cfairly large scale and robust,\u201d Ainsworth said.\n\n\u201cThe impact to you and me is very localized,\u201d he said. \u201c(But) this is not something that just originates over Mount Roberts. This is a big scale weather pattern.\u201d\n\nThe Taku winds are different from normal winds in that they don\u2019t take \u201cthe path of least resistance,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cIt\u2019s really something that\u2019s a really dynamic system and common in mountain areas around the world. Anywhere there are mountains, these things can happen . We know about the Taku because we live here, and we have people that feel it and are impacted by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Juneau phenomenon that definitely creates intense conditions,\u201d said Juneau Emergency Programs Manager Tom Mattice.\n\nMaritime weather is generally more stable than inland weather, Ainsworth said, which is why it\u2019s been raining in Juneau for the last three weeks.\n\n\u201cThe mountains really complicate a very simple system,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes forecasting in a mountainous region such a challenge, and so exciting.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Juneau (Alaska) Empire, http://www.juneauempire.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Google \"mountain wave windstorms\" and \"Juneau\" shows up immediately.
