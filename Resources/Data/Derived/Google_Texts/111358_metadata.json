LOUIS, Mo. \u2013 Protests occurred both inside and outside the Monsanto shareholder meeting in St. Louis on Tuesday as local activists, shareholders and citizens from across the country joined in 20-degree weather to demand the biotech giant label genetically-modified organisms, or GMOs.\n\nThe activists arrived accompanied by five colorful \u201cfishy cars\u201d representing the fishy food that has been genetically modified and consumed by Americans now for decades. Protesters hoped to make a single powerful statement: Label it.\n\nFor the first time ever, Monsanto shareholders convened to vote on a resolution to support GMO labeling \u2013 brought by shareholder and food safety activist Adam Eidinger of Occupy Monsanto, and presented by family farm advocate Dave Murphy of Food Democracy Now!\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just coming to their shareholder meeting as a response to what they\u2019ve been doing around the country,\" said Cesar Maxit, designer and architect of the five fish art cars. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the fight to their home, their shareholder meeting, saying we\u2019re sick of it.\u201d\n\nLast year, Maxit finished the construction of what have become nationally recognized faces in the fight for GMO labeling \u2013 half-fish, half-food sculptures mounted atop five cars. Paint jobs on the cars read \u201cLabel GMOs\u201d and encourage passersby to tweet about the \u201cfishy car\u201d they\u2019re standing near. Each sculpture has a \"unique personality\" representing a different GMO crop: Fishy Apple, Fishy Soybean, Fishy Tomato, Fishy Corn and Fishy Sugar Beet.\n\n\u201cWe need to label our food,\" added Maxit. \"The idea is that we\u2019re not trying to scare people \u2013 we\u2019re just trying to use humor and art\" to educate people about the importance of labeling GMOs.\n\nFood Democracy Now!'s Dave Murphy served as the proxy on Tuesday presenting the GMO labeling resolution to the Monsanto shareholders.\n\nGMOs are organisms, such as corn or tomatoes, whose genetic makeup have been modified in a laboratory and spliced using DNA from bacteria, viruses or even fish. Many believe the \u201cfishy food\u201d causes health problems such as cancer. Thorough, long-term studies have yet to be completed on the health impacts of GMOs.\n\nAnd until the products we consume get labeled, activists are worried it will be impossible to track the real effects of the food in our systems.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking that Monsanto stop fighting the will of the American people, 90 percent of whom want to know if their food has been genetically engineered in a laboratory,\u201d said Murphy, whose organization has bloomed into a grassroots movement of more than 650,000 farmers and citizens dedicated to reforming America's food system.\n\n\u201cIf Monsanto can profit off a patent in their products and label their foods in India, China, Russia and South Africa, they can certainly agree that Americans should have this basic right as well,\" he added.\n\nYet, \"In the past two years, Monsanto has spent more than $13.4 million to defeat GMO labeling efforts in California and Washington state. This is an outrageous fortune wasted.\u201d\n\nA second shareholder resolution that was to be voted on at the company\u2019s annual meeting, sponsored by activist investor John Harrington, dealt with Monsanto\u2019s potential liability to organic farmers.\n\nIn October, more than 700 activists descended on the company\u2019s St. Louis headquarters as part of the global March Against Monsanto. Protestors flooded onto the roadway, blocking traffic and overwhelming police on the road leading to their offices.\n\nThe city had previously seen large protests for the first March \u2013 an international day of action in May of last year, when some 2 million people participated in events in nearly 500 cities.\n\n\u201cThe thing about labeling GMOs is: what\u2019s wrong with transparency?\" said Shamal Halmat, 26, one of the activists gearing up to protest in 20-degree weather on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with transparency. That\u2019s really what\u2019s being asked for,\" added Halmat, \"so hopefully if they don\u2019t really have too much to hide, they\u2019ll be transparent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Protesters hoped to make a single powerful statement: Label it.", "title": "Occupy Monsanto Protesters Push Labeling Resolution at Annual Shareholder Meeting", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "Protesters hoped to make a single powerful statement: Label it.", "title": "Occupy Monsanto Protesters Push Labeling Resolution at Annual Shareholder Meeting", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/21592-occupy-monsanto-protesters-push-labeling-resolution-at-annual-shareholder-meeting", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/tologo.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"description": "Protesters hoped to make a single powerful statement: Label it.", "title": "Occupy Monsanto Protesters Push Labeling Resolution at Annual Shareholder Meeting", "image": "http://www.occupy.com/sites/default/files/field/image/4gx7heq.jpg", "creator": "@truthout", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "Jason Schloss", "keywords": "genetically modified, organisms, GMOs, Monsanto, Occupy Monsanto, March Against Monsanto, Food Democracy Now!, Food, GMO, Monsanto, Protest, Video", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ac2\"", "article_summary": "'s Dave Murphy served as the proxy on Tuesday presenting the GMO labeling resolution to the Monsanto shareholders.\nEach sculpture has a \"unique personality\" representing a different GMO crop: Fishy Apple, Fishy Soybean, Fishy Tomato, Fishy Corn and Fishy Sugar Beet.\nThe activists arrived accompanied by five colorful \u201cfishy cars\u201d representing the fishy food that has been genetically modified and consumed by Americans now for decades.\nYet, \"In the past two years, Monsanto has spent more than $13.4 million to defeat GMO labeling efforts in California and Washington state.\nFor the first time ever, Monsanto shareholders convened to vote on a resolution to support GMO labeling \u2013 brought by shareholder and food safety activist Adam Eidinger of Occupy Monsanto, and presented by family farm advocate Dave Murphy of Food Democracy Now!"}
