He was also charged with burglary, the New York Daily News reports.\n\nLei told the local police that after a few too many drinks he broke into the apartment, but was surprised to find the girl.\n\n\"To keep her quiet I told her I was really Superman and I'd soon be flying off back to my secret headquarters,\" he said according to the Mirror. \"She called my bluff and told me, 'If you're Superman show me you can fly or I'll scream.' I had no choice so I stripped to my pants to look more like a superhero and went to the window.\"\n\nLei saw another roof below and figured he could make it -- but it turned out to be farther than he thought.\n\n\"I know it doesn't make sense but it did to me when I was drunk,\" he allegedly told police.\n\nThe super-stupid suspect was taken to the hospital to be treated for injuries, but remains in police custody on burglary charges, LidTime.com reports.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Superhero Crimes Superhero Crimes\n\n1 of 1 Mark Wayne Williams Holy handcuffs!
