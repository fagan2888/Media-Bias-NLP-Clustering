What happens when you pass a law that (a) causes the health-insurance cancellation for millions and then (b) forces them and millions more to use a disastrously-built web portal as a middeman to replace that coverage? Answer: You end up with millions of people flooding into providers without any idea whether they have coverage or whether their doctor will accept it.\n\nThe New York Times confirmed this issue \u2026 for its Saturday edition, of course:\n\nIn addition to the difficulties many face in proving they have coverage, patients are also having a hard time figuring out whether particular doctors are affiliated with their health insurance plan. Doctors themselves often do not know if they are in the network of providers for plans sold on the exchange. But interviews with doctors, hospital executives, pharmacists and newly insured people around the country suggest that the biggest challenge so far has been verifying coverage. A surge of enrollments in late December, just before the deadline for coverage to take effect, created backlogs at many state and federal exchanges and insurance companies in processing applications. As a result, many of those who enrolled have yet to receive an insurance card, policy number or bill. Many are also having trouble reaching exchanges and insurance companies to confirm their enrollment or pay their first month\u2019s premium. Doctors\u2019 offices and pharmacies, too, are spending hours on the phone trying to verify patients\u2019 coverage, sometimes to no avail. \u201cThe system wasn\u2019t really built to handle this kind of glut of new patients,\u201d said Dr. Curtis Miyamoto, a radiation oncologist at Temple University Hospital who is president of the Philadelphia County Medical Society. \u201cSo it\u2019s resulting in us having some delays in getting people verified, and therefore delays in their care.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s leading to decisions like this being forced on the once-insured:\n\nIn Langley, Wash., north of Seattle, Erin Waterman was able to see a primary care doctor on Jan. 3 with a temporary identification card printed from the website of her new insurer, LifeWise Health Plan of Washington. But when Ms. Waterman, 47, tried to fill a prescription for a new asthma inhaler, the pharmacy could not verify her coverage even though she had paid her first month\u2019s premium on Dec. 23. Ms. Waterman was given the option of paying full price \u2014 $187, instead of the $50 co-payment required under her new plan \u2014 and eventually being reimbursed. But she decided to wait, and hope that she does not have an asthma attack in the meantime.\n\nBy the way, asthma attacks can kill. In 2010, asthma attacks killed over 3400 Americans, according to the CDC.\n\nBe sure to read it all. This issue extends well beyond whether an enrollment has been successfully concluded. As mentioned above, providers themselves aren\u2019t even sure whether they\u2019re in network on which plans, which means that their ability to get reimbursement is under question on every patient that comes through on anything other than a group plan. And even if they know that, providers aren\u2019t sure which procedures and treatments will be covered, thanks to a massive amount of confusion over the mandates in ObamaCare.\n\nThis, of course, is just the appetizer. When the employer mandate hits this fall, it will similarly scramble the coverage of tens of millions of Americans who end up in the ObamaCare exchanges when their employers simply decide to opt out of subsidizing the rapidly-escalating premiums in health insurance, and we\u2019ll get a crisis orders of magnitude larger one year from now.\n\nWith that in mind, Sen. Thad Cochran called for a New Year resolution to repeal ObamaCare in the GOP\u2019s weekly address to the nation yesterday, and questioned the honesty and integrity of the White House and its statistics on \u201cenrollments\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was supposed to be fully operational by January 1 of this year, but here we are two weeks into 2014, and the administration continues to struggle to implement the law\u2019s burdensome mandates,\u201d Cochran said in theweekly Republican address. \u201cThe law is not living up to the promises made by its supporters, and it is questionable whether the law will meet its fundamental purpose \u2013 to significantly expand health insurance coverage.\u201d The administration and congressional Democrats have recently been touting the law\u2019s expansion of coverage to roughly nine million Americans \u2013 three million young adults who have been able to stay on their parents\u2019 plan, two million consumers who have enrolled in the private insurance exchanges and four million low-income consumers who have been inducted into an expanded Medicaid program. Cochran, however, argued there may be less to those figures than meets the eye. \u201cThe administration\u2019s enrollment numbers don\u2019t paint a pretty picture,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t tell us how many of the enrollees have actually lost existing coverage and were forced into the exchanges; and the numbers don\u2019t tell us whether applicants have actually paid their premiums and received coverage. There is ample reason to be skeptical that those numbers will improve substantially.\u201d Cochran\u2019s other complaints about the law had a familiar ring: that it\u2019s booting people off of health plans they liked despite the president\u2019s promise that people could keep their current insurance; that it\u2019s forcing people to change doctors; that many consumers are finding their prices going up under Obamacare. \u201cIf the law can\u2019t keep its most basic promise, it should be repealed,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe should go back to the drawing board and draft commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will work better for all Americans, without spending billions of taxpayer dollars to support these failing policies.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope we don\u2019t have to make this New Year\u2019s resolution again for 2015.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Thad Cochran: Let\u2019s make repeal a New Year resolution.", "title": "NYT: Yeah, ObamaCare has made the healthcare system a mess in 2014", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/12/nyt-yeah-obamacare-has-made-the-healthcare-system-a-mess-in-2014/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-12T14:31:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-12T23:29:28+00:00"}, "keywords": "exchanges, healthcare.gov, ObamaCare, providers,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "NYT: Yeah, ObamaCare has made the healthcare system a mess in 2014posted at 9:31 am on January 12, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyThe Associated Press first reported this developing and completely predictable problem earlier in the week.\nMany are also having trouble reaching exchanges and insurance companies to confirm their enrollment or pay their first month\u2019s premium.\nDoctors themselves often do not know if they are in the network of providers for plans sold on the exchange.\nDoctors\u2019 offices and pharmacies, too, are spending hours on the phone trying to verify patients\u2019 coverage, sometimes to no avail.\nAs a result, many of those who enrolled have yet to receive an insurance card, policy number or bill."}
