Republicans appear ready to support some Democratic proposals only if the majority party concedes on land use.\n\nRep. Knute Buehler, a Bend Republican, said again this week the root cause of affordable housing issues is a lack of land supply because of landmark laws that promote density and limit sprawl.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cThe root cause of the problem is the lack of buildable affordable land.\u201d\n\nRep. Alissa Keny-Guyer, a Portland Democrat who chairs the House committee dealing with housing, said \u201cthere are multiple causes\u201d of what\u2019s become a statewide problem. Keny-Guyer is a strong proponent of allowing cities to require that developers keep up to 30 percent of new housing units at below-market rates for low-income residents.\n\nThe two are set to continue their debate next week when they visit Bend for an affordable housing tour that will lead into the Feb. 1 start of the short session of the Legislature.\n\nBut their disagreements, which represent a longtime and ongoing split between Oregon Republicans and the Democrats who control both chambers of the Legislature, received a public airing in a preview to a lightning-fast session that received its unofficial start in hearings this week in Salem.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Rep. Buehler and I are trying to do is trying to understand each other\u2019s different contexts,\u201d Keny-Guyer said of the upcoming visit.\n\nMeanwhile, she has proposed increasing a fee assessed by county clerks when processing certain housing documents, from $20 to $30. The hike would bring in an additional $5 million annually for affordable housing projects. The same bill would exempt from taxes the below-market-rate sales of housing units to housing authorities.\n\nAnother proposal seeks to prevent landlords from retaliating against tenants who make a housing complaint. Landlords would be prevented from increasing rents or evicting tenants within six months of the complaint.\n\nThe concept would also require that landlords who want to evict tenants must give them 90 days\u2019 notice if they have lived in a property for a year and are renting month-to-month. Landlords who violate the proposal would have to give the evicted tenants a month\u2019s rent to cover relocation costs.\n\nBuehler, along with Bend Republican Sen. Tim Knopp and many Oregon Republicans, believe the state needs to ease land use restrictions east of the Cascade Mountains as a way to address rising housing costs there.\n\nBuehler pointed to work by Jason Furman, a Democrat and top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, that has sounded an alarm about a growing national affordable housing problem.\n\nA speech Furman delivered in November seemed to address what Republicans in Oregon say is the underlying cause of the housing crisis that state housing experts say exists statewide.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear from the outset, some land use regulations can be beneficial to communities and the overall economy,\u201d Furman said, citing potential health and safety benefits. \u201cBut in other cases, zoning regulations and other local barriers to housing development allow a small number of individuals to capture the economic benefits of living in a community, thus limiting diversity and mobility.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such, land use regulations are an example of a broader range of situations that may give rise to (costs),\u201d Furman said, adding that zoning can place \u201cupward pressure\u201d on housing prices due to lack of supply.\n\nThere is work to get to a deal between powerful lobbyists for homebuilders on a Democratic priority for the coming legislative session: eliminating a 1999 law that prevents cities from requiring a percentage of new housing units to be priced at below-market rates.\n\nSen. Chris Edwards, D-Eugene, is leading work on a proposal to ease some land use laws. He met on Friday with Keny-Guyer, though he wasn\u2019t able to talk for this story, citing a death in the family.\n\nSen. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, has submitted a proposal that would let cities pass ordinances that require developers to set aside up to 30 percent of new housing units for low-income buyers or renters, a practice known as inclusionary zoning.\n\nIn exchange for the lost revenue for building below-market housing, cities would give developers a break on density requirements, fees, expedited processing of permit and approval, or property tax breaks.\n\nKnopp said he would support the measure only if \u201cit included incentives that matched dollar-for-dollar\u201d the revenue given up to develop the low-rate units. He said that\u2019s difficult to do unless developers are given land for free or possibly through tax abatements.\n\nAn inclusionary zoning proposal last session passed the House but stumbled in the Senate. Dembrow attributed that failure to senators\u2019 unfamiliarity with the subject. The 2016 bill more clearly targets rental properties as well, which may help it, Dembrow said. Oregon and Texas are the only states with bans on inclusionary zoning.\n\n\u201cI think more senators have an understanding of what (inclusionary zoning) is, although I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s not still a lot of work to be done,\u201d Dembrow said.\n\nIt\u2019s not a given that Senate Democrats will support the proposal this time around.\n\n\u201cI start from the basis of I don\u2019t like inclusionary zoning because I think it has the opposite effect on housing prices (of what) people think it does,\u201d Sen. Lee Beyer, D-Eugene, said Friday.\n\nDembrow was skeptical that loosening state or local land use restrictions would help with an affordable housing crunch that\u2019s become more acute for low- and middle-income workers.\n\n\u201cIf what\u2019s being talked about is expanding the UGB (urban growth boundary) so that you can have affordable housing out in the periphery, that\u2019s not going to help low-income people very well because a lot of them have transportation issues, etc.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that all of our neighborhoods have a mix of residents.\u201d\n\nKnopp, who sits on the Senate committee that will address housing, also repeated what has become a theme among Central Oregon Republicans.\n\n\u201cThey talk about other areas doing this, but other areas don\u2019t have Oregon\u2019s land use system that drives up the cost, because that\u2019s what happens: You constrict supply, demand continues, you have an artificial market, prices go up,\u201d Knopp said. \u201cThat\u2019s not rocket science, that\u2019s just reality.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 406-589-4347,\n\ntanderson@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALEM \u2014 Oregon\u2019s two parties are about to show just how much they disagree on the causes of the affordable housing crunch that\u2019s gripping much of the state.
