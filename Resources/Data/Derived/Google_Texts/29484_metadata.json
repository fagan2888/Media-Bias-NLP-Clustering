CDC seems to be getting it right.\n\nTravelers entering the U.S. from West African countries continue to come through five airports: Washington Dulles International, Chicago O\u2019Hare, John F. Kennedy in New York, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta and Newark Liberty.\n\nOfficials with Customs and Border Protection first isolate travelers coming from West African countries affected by the virus \u2014 Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Mali \u2014 and conduct a screening that includes a questionnaire and contact form. Individuals also have their temperatures taken.\n\nEight passengers were taken to medical facilities for additional screening, according to data compiled by the Department of Homeland Security. In most cases where symptoms of Ebola are present, Nordlund said, patients may test positive for the flu or malaria instead.\n\n>>> Ebola Czar to Leave White House in February\n\nThe CDC issued guidelines for state and local public health officials who are monitoring travelers from West Africa. Levels of such monitoring depends on a person\u2019s symptoms and exposure to the disease.\n\nFor example, a health worker who treated Ebola patients in West Africa and wore personal protective equipment would be freer to move around than a worker who did not.\n\nHowever, once individuals leave the airport, it becomes the responsibility of state and local officials at their destination to continue to monitor them.\n\n\u201cAll active monitoring \u2014 calling and following-up with in-person visits \u2014 happens at the state and local level,\u201d Nordlund said.\n\nMore than 7,300 have died from Ebola worldwide, and more than 19,000 cases were detected.\n\nThe first cases in U.S. citizens arose in late August, after two missionaries tested positive and were transported back to the U.S. to be treated. Both recovered.\n\nOn Sept. 30, a Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person to test positive for Ebola in the U.S. He went to a Dallas hospital after presenting symptoms but was sent home. Duncan returned several days later and was admitted. He later died.\n\nDr. Martin Salia, an American, contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone and returned for treatment in Omaha, Neb. He, too, died, becoming the second victim to be claimed by the virus in the U.S.\n\nA total of 10 persons tested positive for Ebola in the U.S.; Salia\u2019s case, identified in November, was the latest.\n\n>>> BioShield: Obama Diverted Funds from Its Fight Against Ebola, Other Threats\n\nSince then, media coverage of the Ebola outbreak has quieted down, as Sharyl Attkisson, senior independent contributor to The Daily Signal, noted in an interview Sunday.\n\nThe investigative reporter said infectious disease experts still worry about Ebola and the possibility of it spreading to the United States. Attkisson said the CDC told her earlier this month that the number of monitored persons was 1,400; the reason for the discrepancy of 300 isn\u2019t clear, although it could be normal fluctuation given the 21-day window.\n\nAttkisson contended the media shouldn\u2019t \u201chype\u201d the virus but should cover Ebola despite official efforts to limit the availability of information about it:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to screen passengers for Ebola, even as the media uproar surrounding the deadly virus fades.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to screen passengers for Ebola, even as the media uproar surrounding the deadly virus fades.", "title": "Officials Keep an Eye on 1,700 for Ebola", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven640858.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-23T16:36:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ztqrS9"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to screen passengers for Ebola, even as the media uproar surrounding the deadly virus fades.", "title": "Officials Keep an Eye on 1,700 for Ebola", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven640858.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "public health", "published_time": "2014-12-23T09:30:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-23T16:36:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ebola, Centers for Disease Control, Sharyl Attkisson, Thomas Eric Duncan, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Martin Salia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb726\"", "article_summary": "Local and state health officials actively monitor about 1,700 persons for symptoms of Ebola, although the number fluctuates daily as travelers move in and out of the 21-day monitoring window.\n>>> Ebola Czar to Leave White House in FebruaryThe CDC issued guidelines for state and local public health officials who are monitoring travelers from West Africa.\nOn Sept. 30, a Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person to test positive for Ebola in the U.S.\nIn most cases where symptoms of Ebola are present, Nordlund said, patients may test positive for the flu or malaria instead.\nThe investigative reporter said infectious disease experts still worry about Ebola and the possibility of it spreading to the United States."}
