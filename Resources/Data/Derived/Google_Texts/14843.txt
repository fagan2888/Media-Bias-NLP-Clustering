TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - It's the ultimate cure for senioritis - a free car.

Toyota of Tampa Bay promised a free car to a senior with perfect attendance in the first or second semester of the last school year.

More than 350 Hillsborough graduates recently participated in the giveaway to win a 2014 Scion XB worth nearly $19,000.

The Tampa Bay Times (http://tinyurl.com/ndwlky4) reports 12 car keys were put in a bowl. Only one unlocks the Scion's door. Students were randomly selected one at a time to pick a key and try to open the door.

Jose Sanchez-Flores, a 19-year-old Plant City student from Strawberry Crest High School, took a key and unlocked the door. He hasn't missed a day of school in two years.

Sanchez-Flores will attend Hillsborough Community College to become a nutritionist.
