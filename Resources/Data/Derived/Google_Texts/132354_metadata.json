It is 2:25 p.m., Sunday, Nov. 15, in Denver, and this is your wake-up call. Have a good day.\n\nGet up.\n\nAt the halfway juncture, Broncos, what are you?\n\nThe Broncos who trounced the Green Bay Packers two weeks ago or the Broncos who flittered away a victory in Indianapolis last Sunday?\n\nAre you at the head of the class with the New England Patriots and the Cincinnati Bengals, or in the middle row with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Buffalo Bills?\n\nAre you the defense that totally shut down an all-world quarterback, or the defense that let an all-wounded quarterback beat you in the fourth quarter? Are you the offense that produced 500 yards against the Packers, or the offense that didn\u2019t score a touchdown in Oakland?\n\nAre you the Donks that were outplayed by the Kansas City Chiefs for most of the first matchup, or the High Horses that somehow pulled out a miraculous victory in K.C.?\n\nWhich 7-1 Broncos are you reminiscent of, the 7-1 Broncos in 2014 who lost in the playoffs, the 7-1 team in 1997 that won the Super Bowl, or the other five 7-1 Broncos in 1977, 1984, 1986, 1996 and 2013? Seven-up-one-down Broncos have reached the Super Bowl in four seasons and lost in the first round of the postseason three times.\n\nThe Broncos will win the AFC West, but that\u2019s not enough in Denver. It\u2019s OK for the Chieftains.\n\nWe have been spoiled.\n\nThis is the 15th time since 1977 that the Broncos win the division, and the 22nd season the Broncos will be in the playoffs.\n\nBut Pat Bowlen wouldn\u2019t accept a cute little division championship banner. Nor will John Elway, who considers failure anything other than a Super Bowl. \u201cOur standard here is to win a championship,\u201d he has said. And not the division.\n\nCoach Gary Kubiak understood that pressure when he accepted the assignment. \u201cI know that each and every year this team is built, \u2026 it\u2019s with one reason and one reason only, and that\u2019s to win a championship.\u201d\n\nPeyton Manning didn\u2019t come back to hoist his final division flag. This will be Peyton\u2019s 13th with Indianapolis and Denver. He didn\u2019t come back merely to set the regular-season victory record and the passing yardage mark Sunday.\n\nHe returned to play in a fourth Super Bowl and win a second.\n\nBroncos season-ticket holders from 1960 and a sports columnist in Denver from 1974 got over 7-1 records long ago.\n\nIn this town, it\u2019s Super Bowl or Bust.\n\nRemember last year? There were no platitudes, proclamations and parades when the Broncos finished ahead of Kansas City, San Diego and Oakland.\n\nIf the Broncos want to celebrate something other than Manning\u2019s career accomplishments Sunday, they should realize that with a victory, the franchise finally will catch the Chiefs in victories in the all-time series. After Dallas-Kansas City dominated in the early years of the AFL to win 19 of the first 20, the regular-season and postseason results are now Chiefs 56, Broncos 55.\n\nA barbecuing of K.C. requires the defense to stop whining like Rodney Dangerfield \u2014 \u201cWe get no respect\u201d \u2014 and committing foolhardy penalties. The defense was outplayed in Indianapolis by a chum offense, and the defensive staff was outcoached by a first-game \u201cChud\u201d coordinator.\n\nThe offensive linemen have to put on big-boy football pants and create crevices; the running backs can\u2019t underachieve and be overwhelmed; the tight ends and wide receivers have to find seams and force separation; and a 39-year-old quarterback on pace for the most interceptions since he was a 22-year-old rookie has to throw accurately and for touchdowns. (Plus, there\u2019s the foot problem, and whether it will affect Manning as the thigh injury did a year ago.)\n\nThe coaches on offense should decide who\u2019s actually calling the plays: the coordinator in the press box, the quarterback coach on the sideline, Kubiak his own self or Manning.\n\nThese Broncos probably will trundle along and finally beat the vastly improved Chiefs in the fourth quarter.\n\nNew England, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati are looming large.\n\nThe Broncos must not hit the snooze button again.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get up and get right for the second half of the season.\n\nWoody Paige: wpaige@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: It\u2019s time for Broncos to look like a title team", "title": "Paige: It\u2019s time for Broncos to look like a title team", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/14/paige-its-time-for-broncos-to-look-like-a-title-team/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-14T18:34:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:06:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Woody Paige"}, "article_summary": "Which 7-1 Broncos are you reminiscent of, the 7-1 Broncos in 2014 who lost in the playoffs, the 7-1 team in 1997 that won the Super Bowl, or the other five 7-1 Broncos in 1977, 1984, 1986, 1996 and 2013?\nThis is the 15th time since 1977 that the Broncos win the division, and the 22nd season the Broncos will be in the playoffs.\nSeven-up-one-down Broncos have reached the Super Bowl in four seasons and lost in the first round of the postseason three times.\nThe Broncos who trounced the Green Bay Packers two weeks ago or the Broncos who flittered away a victory in Indianapolis last Sunday?\nNor will John Elway, who considers failure anything other than a Super Bowl."}
