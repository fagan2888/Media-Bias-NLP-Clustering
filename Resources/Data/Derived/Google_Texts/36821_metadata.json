The modern media cycle strips the flesh off of even the most minor occurrences with hyena-like intensity. I can\u2019t recall how many times I\u2019ve thought, \u201cThat happened just this year?\u201d The churn is so great that it\u2019s sometimes hard to remember.\n\nHorrors come with dizzying frequency. 2014 was routinely described as a \u201cterrible year,\u201d but every year feels terrible now. 2015 has been dire enough that Slate felt compelled to make a list of nice things that happened over the past 12 months, as if to remind us that there were pleasures to be found among the misery.\n\nAll of this might have something to do with why I keep returning to the idea of our place in history. I find myself wondering, over and over again, how this particular moment in the world will be remembered, 50 or 100 years from now (assuming, of course, that our species is still around at that point). It\u2019s always impossible to really step outside the precise time you are living in, but we are so overloaded these days that I\u2019ve noticed a certain comfort in making that attempt. The past 50 years were rotten in many ways, but they were also beautiful. We remember both of those things now.\n\nHistory has assigned overarching titles to huge chunks of time\u2014the Middle Ages, the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment\u2014but we don\u2019t live time in eras. We live it in days. What will they call this collection of days? How much of what we are experiencing right now will wind up mattering? When we\u2019re able to emerge from the wreckage and look back, what will seem important?\n\nIt does feel like we are going through a particularly wrenching bout of transformation. Its source is not difficult to discern. The Internet is bringing about a change as massive as anything we\u2019ve seen in centuries, and we are living right in the middle of that change. Everything, from our jobs to our brains, is being rewired. We are in the midst of shedding one world and introducing another. It is thrilling and terrifying and uncertain. Everywhere, the vast territory opened up by this massive shift in our lives is being fiercely contested.\n\nLike any revolution, it is provoking cycles of progress and backlash at record speed. The Internet is driving incredible, inspiring civil rights movements, but we\u2019re also dealing with Donald Trump. It\u2019s pushed discourse around feminism and queer issues to places it would have been astonishing to imagine even 10 years ago, but there\u2019s also an all-out war on women\u2019s reproductive rights taking place at the same time. It\u2019s made us more connected to each other, more able to share joy and sadness and solidarity from across borders than ever before, but we\u2019re also more spied on, more tracked, more collected than we\u2019ve ever been.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the end of 2015 approaches, we say goodbye to the worst year ever, and say hello to... the worst year ever?", "title": "We live in the golden age of awful news: Why every year seems so horrible in retrospect", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As the end of 2015 approaches, we say goodbye to the worst year ever, and say hello to... the worst year ever?", "title": "We live in the golden age of awful news: Why every year seems so horrible in retrospect", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/25/we_live_in_the_golden_age_of_awful_news_why_every_year_seems_so_horrible_in_retrospect/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/horrible2015.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the end of 2015 approaches, we say goodbye to the worst year ever, and say hello to... the worst year ever?", "title": "We live in the golden age of awful news: Why every year seems so horrible in retrospect", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/horrible2015.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jack Mirkinson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2015 year in review, Media Criticism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "History has assigned overarching titles to huge chunks of time\u2014the Middle Ages, the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment\u2014but we don\u2019t live time in eras.\nAll of this might have something to do with why I keep returning to the idea of our place in history.\nThe modern media cycle strips the flesh off of even the most minor occurrences with hyena-like intensity.\n2014 was routinely described as a \u201cterrible year,\u201d but every year feels terrible now.\nI can\u2019t recall how many times I\u2019ve thought, \u201cThat happened just this year?\u201d The churn is so great that it\u2019s sometimes hard to remember."}
