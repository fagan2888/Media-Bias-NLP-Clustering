As the candidates crisscross the nation, each will undoubtedly call for smarter, leaner, and (hopefully) smaller government. However, there is one government program that, despite being a paragon of government incompetence and mind-bending fiscal incontinence, will most likely be ignored by these champions of budgetary temperance: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. In so doing, these Republicans will abandon their principles and continue a long, bipartisan tradition of perpetuating the broader problems with U.S. defense spending that the troubled jet symbolizes.\n\nDuring the Obama years, the Republican Party magically rediscovered its commitment\u2014at least rhetorically\u2014to limited government and fiscal sanity. Criticizing the graft, incompetence, and cost of boondoggles like the 2009 stimulus bill, green-energy subsidies, or Obamacare, GOP politicians not only highlighted these programs\u2019 specific failings, but also often explained how such problems were the inevitable result of an unwieldy federal government that lacked discipline and accountability and was inherently susceptible to capture by well-funded interest groups like unions or insurance companies.\n\nThey railed against massive bureaucracies, like the Department of Energy, that paid off cronies with scant congressional oversight. And, in the case of well-publicized debacles like the botched, billion-dollar Healthcare.gov roll-out, many Republicans were quick to note that the root of the problem lay not in one glitchy website, but the entire federal procurement process, and even Big Government itself:\n\nBack in March, Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican and outspoken critic of the HealthCare.gov rollout, introduced the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act, which would give agency CIOs more control over their budgets\u2026.The bill would go a long way toward fixing IT contracting problems, Issa has said. In a Dec. 4 hearing, Issa suggested the problem with HealthCare.gov is related to an additional layer of rules and technology on top of the U.S. private insurance industry.\n\n\n\nHealthCare.gov was \u2018not a disaster of the making of one man or any one person,\u2019 he said then. \u2018In fact, in many ways it is a sign of a failed system that is often seen in the federal government.\u2019\n\nIssa and his GOP colleagues\u2019 criticism of Healthcare.gov and the broken, cronyist U.S. procurement bureaucracy were both accurate and precisely what limited-government advocates, backed by public-choice economics, have warned about for decades. Big Government, and in particular the administrative state, is incapable of managing large-scale projects over the long term without inevitably enriching cronies, breeding corruption, producing sub-par products and services, and, of course, wasting gobs and gobs of taxpayer dollars in the process. The examples of such failures extend to all corners of U.S. domestic policy, from health care to financial services to agriculture and everywhere in between.\n\nDefense Contracting Is Not an Exception to Big Government\u2019s Problems One wonders, however, if these Republicans\u2019 philosophical understanding of Big Government\u2019s inherent weaknesses extends to national defense and, in particular, the F-35. According to the latest (2012) estimate from the Pentagon, the total cost to develop, buy and operate the F-35 will be $1.45 trillion\u2014yes, trillion, with a \u201ct\u201d\u2014over the next 50 years, up from a measly $1 trillion estimated in 2011. For those of you keeping score at home, this means that the F-35\u2019s lifetime cost grew about $450 billion in one year. (Who says inflation is dead?)\n\nThe fighter system\u2019s cost grew by approximately one Manhattan Project every three weeks between 2011 and 2012. That number\u2014$1.45 trillion\u2014might be difficult to grasp, especially in the context of U.S. defense spending, so let me try to put it in perspective: the entire Manhattan Project, which took around three years and led to the development of the atom bomb, cost a total of $26 billion (2015), most of which went to \u201cbuilding factories and producing the fissile materials, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.\u201d By contrast, the F-35 will cost $29 billion. Per year.\n\nFor the next 50 years.\n\nIndeed, just the 12-month increase ($450 billion) in the F-35\u2019s lifetime estimate means that the fighter system\u2019s cost grew by approximately one Manhattan Project every three weeks between 2011 and 2012. Granted, A-bombs are far different from fighter jets\u2014for example, bombs don\u2019t need maintenance after use\u2014but these differences shouldn\u2019t obscure the F-35\u2019s simply astounding impact on the U.S. federal budget.\n\nF-35s Have Massive Technical Problems These crazy numbers still might be justifiable if the F-35 were part of a near-flawless weapons system that is destined to guarantee U.S. air superiority for the next half-century. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, the F-35 has been plagued by problem after problem. A 2013 Vanity Fair long-read depressingly explored the plane\u2019s long history of technical and budgetary failures, and of enriching U.S. defense contractors, and showed that the project couldn\u2019t provide a better case study in public-choice theory and regulatory capture if it were invented by James Buchannan himself.\n\nSince that piece was published, the F-35 has had even more problems. For example, in July 2014, Reuters reported that \u201c[t]he U.S. military has grounded all its new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters following an incident on June 23, when one of the high-tech warplanes caught fire on the runway of a Florida air base.\u201d The no-fly order affected \u201cat least 50 F-35s at training and test bases in Florida, Arizona, California and Maryland\u201d and resulted from a longstanding design flaw related to the plane\u2019s immense weight:\n\n\u2018The F-35 is double-inferior,\u2019 John Stillion and Harold Scott Perdue concluded in their written summary of the war game, later leaked to the press. The new plane \u2018can\u2019t turn, can\u2019t climb, can\u2019t run,\u2019 they warned.\n\nYet the F-35 is on track to become by far the military\u2019s most numerous warplane.\n\nThen, in December of last year, perhaps my favorite F-35 report emerged:\n\nAccording to the USAF, the troubled fighter cannot use gas from standard green colored USAF fuel trucks if it has been sitting in the sun. Considering that these jets will most likely find themselves operating in the desert or in somewhere in the scorching Pacific, this is a big problem.\n\n\n\nSadly, the answer for the F-35\u2019s fuel finicky conundrum, one of many heat related issues with the jets since their testing began, is being addressed outside of the F-35 aircraft itself, in the form of repainting standard USAF fuel trucks with bright white solar reflective paint.\n\nYou cannot make this stuff up. The F-35\u2019s constant problems actually would be pretty funny if, you know, it weren\u2019t for the fact that the system is robbing American taxpayers and jeopardizing our national security in the process.\n\nYou Can Support a Strong Defense And Not Wasteful Spending I don\u2019t mean to harp on the F-35, however. Instead, it\u2019s simply one of many examples (I admit, probably the worst) of the systemic problems facing U.S. military procurement and spending\u2014problems caused by the same fundamental issues with Big Government that Republicans constantly raise in the domestic policy sphere. These include byzantine bureaucracy; outdated laws; cronyism and regulatory capture; waste, fraud, and abuse; and, of course, massive overspending during an era of supposed fiscal restraint.\n\nOne must ask whether Republicans\u2019 much-deserved skepticism of government intervention in domestic policy will extend to national defense and a military procurement system that\u2019s been broken for decades. To be clear, these concerns have nothing to do with whether one is a foreign policy hawk or dove\u2014even the neoconniest of interventionist can and should hope that U.S tax dollars are being efficiently spent on the most capable of military systems (more bombs for fewer dollars, yay!). But they\u2019re not, as the F-35 debacle makes abundantly clear, and the administrative state\u2019s inherent flaws are the most obvious reason why. Thus, one must ask whether Republicans\u2019 much-deserved skepticism of government intervention in domestic policy will extend to national defense and a military procurement system that\u2019s been broken for decades (see this humorous take from the 1998 film, \u201cThe Pentagon Wars,\u201d for more).", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 06:59:27 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Republicans love defense spending, and that's why the F-35 will cost more than the Manhattan Project every year for the next fifty years.", "title": "Dear GOP: Big Government\u2019s Problems Extend To Defense Spending", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4019547907_a06e2f7b9a_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-04T07:34:56+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/02/25/dear-gop-big-governments-problems-extend-to-defense-spending/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Republicans love defense spending, and that's why the F-35 will cost more than the Manhattan Project every year for the next fifty years.", "creator": "@scottlincicome", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4019547907_a06e2f7b9a_b.jpg"}, "title": "Dear GOP: Big Government\u2019s Problems Extend To Defense Spending", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "National Security", "tag": "big government,Darrell Issa,defense,Defense Spending,GOP,Government Spending,HealthCare.gov,Manhattan Project,national security,Republican Party,Republicans", "published_time": "2015-02-25T06:59:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-04T07:34:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republicans love defense spending, and that's why the F-35 will cost more than the Manhattan Project every year for the next fifty years."}, "article_summary": "Defense Contracting Is Not an Exception to Big Government\u2019s Problems One wonders, however, if these Republicans\u2019 philosophical understanding of Big Government\u2019s inherent weaknesses extends to national defense and, in particular, the F-35.\nOne must ask whether Republicans\u2019 much-deserved skepticism of government intervention in domestic policy will extend to national defense and a military procurement system that\u2019s been broken for decades.\nIn so doing, these Republicans will abandon their principles and continue a long, bipartisan tradition of perpetuating the broader problems with U.S. defense spending that the troubled jet symbolizes.\nYou Can Support a Strong Defense And Not Wasteful Spending I don\u2019t mean to harp on the F-35, however.\nFor those of you keeping score at home, this means that the F-35\u2019s lifetime cost grew about $450 billion in one year."}
