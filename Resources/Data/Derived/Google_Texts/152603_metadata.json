While House Republicans took the brunt of the blame for the government shutdown, the president didn't escape unscathed. And, ever since the government reopened and the focus turned to the turbulent launch of HealthCare.gov and President Obama's misleading \"if you like your insurance, you can keep it\" statement, his numbers have been in free fall.\n\nIn hopes of providing a bit more perspective and context to the situation in which the president currently finds himself, we asked The Post's polling and graphics departments to put together an annotated chart of Obama's job approval numbers in four different polls -- WaPo/ABC, Pew, Gallup and Quinnipiac -- from 2009 through today.\n\nWhat the chart below shows is that the last genuinely good period President Obama enjoyed was in the immediate run-up to and aftermath of his reelection victory in November 2012. Since then, it's been a rapid fade for the president -- particularly over the last six weeks. The news about the small number of sign-ups on Obamacare insurance exchanges and suggestions that the administration will not be able to meet its self-imposed Nov. 30 deadline to have HealthCare.gov fully functioning seem likely to further Obama's current slide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president is having a very bad 2013.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The president is having a very bad 2013.", "title": "This chart does not look good for President Obama", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/11/13/this-chart-does-not-look-good-for-president-obama/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2013/11/w-fixchart.jpeg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thefix"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/11/13/this-chart-does-not-look-good-for-president-obama/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health care repeal, health care reform, health care repeal 2011, health care reform bill, healthcare reform, healthcare vote, healthcare legislation, health care debate, cbo heal care, repeal of health care bill, republicans try to change health care, health care bill costs, obama health care, obamacare, repeal health care, health care interest groups, healthcare legislation, health care insurance, heath care reform, obama, barack obama, obama news, obama election, president obama, obama 2012 elections, obama reelection campaign, obama romney, obama vs romney, president barack obama, president obama news,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health care repeal, health care reform, health care repeal 2011, health care reform bill, healthcare reform, healthcare vote, healthcare legislation, health care debate, cbo heal care, repeal of health care bill, republicans try to change health care, health care bill costs, obama health care, obamacare, repeal health care, health care interest groups, healthcare legislation, health care insurance, heath care reform, obama, barack obama, obama news, obama election, president obama, obama 2012 elections, obama reelection campaign, obama romney, obama vs romney, president barack obama, president obama news,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbc5\"", "article_summary": "President Obama is having a very rough last few months.\nWhat the chart below shows is that the last genuinely good period President Obama enjoyed was in the immediate run-up to and aftermath of his reelection victory in November 2012.\nWhile House Republicans took the brunt of the blame for the government shutdown, the president didn't escape unscathed.\nSince then, it's been a rapid fade for the president -- particularly over the last six weeks.\nAnd, ever since the government reopened and the focus turned to the turbulent launch of HealthCare.gov and President Obama's misleading \"if you like your insurance, you can keep it\" statement, his numbers have been in free fall."}
