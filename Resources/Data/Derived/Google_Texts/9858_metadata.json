The federal government had said earlier in 2013 it would discontinue support and the program would expire at the end of the year.\n\nUnder the agreement, about 8,000 people currently enrolled in the state program with incomes between 100 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty line will be covered under the federally created health insurance marketplace.\n\n\"We look forward to working with Oklahoma and all other states in bringing a flexible, state-based approach to Medicaid coverage expansion and encourage the state to explore these options,\" Health and Human Services spokeswoman Emma Sandoe said on Friday.\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Pence on Tuesday said the federal government had granted a one-year waiver allowing his state to continue operating its own health program, called the Healthy Indiana Plan, which has been operating since 2008.\n\nIndiana's plan offers health insurance to about 37,000 people who do not qualify for Medicaid, including childless adults aged 19 to 64. It is based on high-deductible health plans and tax-free health savings accounts.\n\nIowa and Arkansas have sought waivers to use funds available under Medicaid expansion to provide subsidies for buying insurance on the new state-based exchanges. These exchanges will open next month to sell insurance for 2014.\n\nAbout half of U.S. states currently offer programs similar to Oklahoma's that cover childless adults. Under Medicaid expansion, the federal government will pay for three years to extend benefits to people with incomes at 133 percent of the federal poverty level and pay 90 percent of the cost after that.
