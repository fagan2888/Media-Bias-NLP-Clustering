Sunday will make their first final in six years.\n\nThe Russia-U.S. semi was scoreless until more than seven minutes into the final frame, when Sergei Mozyakin wristed a shot over goaltender Connor Hellebuyck.\n\nAlex Ovechkin, making his first appearance in the tournament following the end of his NHL playoffs run, found space in between the goalie\u2019s pads three minutes later.\n\nVadim Schipachyov made it 3-0, and Evgeni Malkin finished it off with 1:25 to go into an empty net. Russia will seek its third title in four years.\n\nEarlier, Taylor Hall and Jason Spezza scored for Canada, which hasn\u2019t won the title since 2007.\n\n\u201cAt this point, everyone\u2019s mind is on winning,\u201d Canada captain Sidney Crosby said. \u201cHopefully, we can finish it off.\u201d\n\nWith yet another attacking display, Canada outshot the Czechs 41-23, and goaltender Mike Smith made some big saves for his second shutout.\n\n\u201cThey had some opportunities, especially early, and generated some good chances,\u201d said Crosby, who had one assist. \u201cToday\u2019s was a good test for us, a big challenge.\u201d\n\nThe Crosby-led Canadians have been dominating the tournament with a perfect record of nine wins from nine games, and 60 goals.\n\nLeft winger Hall scored 8:40 in after Jordan Eberle\u2019s pass from the right found him in front of the empty net, with goaltender Ondrej Pavelec unable to reach the puck.\n\n\u201cIt was a big goal for the team, to silence the crowd,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAt this point of the tournament, we know how we have to play no matter who the opponent is.\u201d\n\nSpezza wristed a shot through a defenseman\u2019s legs past Pavelec to stretch the lead 9:02 into the second. He tops the scoring chart with 14 points, from six goals and eight assists.\n\nCanada also beat the host team in the group stage, 6-3.\n\nWith 1:33 to go in the second, the Czechs had a goal by defenseman Michal Jordan disallowed after the referees ruled forward Petr Koukal was in the crease. A video replay didn\u2019t seem to confirm that.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d Czech veteran Jaromir Jagr said. \u201cWe went after them as we wanted to but we didn\u2019t score a goal in the first 10-15 minutes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Canada, Russia advance to ice hockey worlds final", "title": "Canada, Russia advance to ice hockey worlds final", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/16/canada-russia-advance-to-ice-hockey-worlds-final/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150516_114103_taylor-hall.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150516_114103_taylor-hall.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-16T11:38:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T22:16:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PRAGUE \u2014 Four final-period goals propelled defending champion Russia past the United States 4-0 in the semifinals of the ice hockey world championship on Saturday and set up a final with Canada.\n\u201cIt was a big goal for the team, to silence the crowd,\u201d Hall said.\nThe finalists are by far the most decorated in world championship history, with Russia (and the Soviet Union) having won 27 finals, and Canada 24.\nThe Russia-U.S. semi was scoreless until more than seven minutes into the final frame, when Sergei Mozyakin wristed a shot over goaltender Connor Hellebuyck.\n\u201cWe went after them as we wanted to but we didn\u2019t score a goal in the first 10-15 minutes.\u201d"}
