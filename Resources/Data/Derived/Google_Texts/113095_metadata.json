Michigan State has seven first-place votes. The last time the Big Ten held the top two spots in the AP poll was November 2006 when Ohio State and Michigan went into their annual rivalry game Nos. 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nNo. 3 Mississippi made a big jump from 15 after winning at Alabama. The Tide dropped from No. 2 to No. 12. The Rebels received 11 first-place votes.\n\nTCU is tied for third with Ole Miss and Baylor is No. 5.\n\nNotre Dame is sixth, followed by LSU, Georgia, UCLA and Florida State. The Tigers receive one first-place vote.\n\nPOLL POINTS\n\nOhio State is No. 1 for the 99th time, passing Notre Dame for second place all-time. Oklahoma has the most weeks at No. 1 with 101.\n\n101 \u2014 Oklahoma\n\n99 \u2014 Ohio State\n\n98 \u2014 Notre Dame\n\nCONFERENCE COUNTDOWN\n\nTwo weeks after having a record 10 ranked teams, the Southeastern Conference is down to six, matching the Pac-12 for the most of any league.\n\nSEC \u2014 6\n\nPac-12 \u2014 6\n\nBig 12 \u2014 4\n\nBig Ten \u2014 4\n\nACC \u2014 3\n\nIndependents \u2014 2\n\nUP\n\nNorthwestern moved up six spots to No. 17 after beating Duke on the road. The Wildcats\u2019 opening victory against Stanford is also looking a whole lot better after the Cardinal bounced back with two straight wins, including a 41-31 upset at USC on Saturday night.\n\nDOWN\n\nNo. 19 Southern California dropped 13 spots after losing at home to the Cardinal.\n\nIN\n\nStanford is back in the rankings at No. 21. The Cardinal win was part of a 6-0 Saturday for the Pac-12 North, which was considered the weaker of the two divisions.\n\nOUT\n\nAuburn, which started the season ranked No. 6, is out of the rankings after a losing to LSU. The Tigers probably qualify as the most disappointing team of September.\n\nRANKED VS. RANKED\n\nNo. 9 UCLA at No. 16 Arizona. Pac-12 South contenders start knocking each other off.\n\nNo. 18 Utah at No. 13 Oregon. Utes looking to score one for the Pac-12 South over the North.\n\nNEW VOTER\n\nDaniel Berk of the Arizona Daily Star has changed jobs and is no longer voting in the AP Top 25.
