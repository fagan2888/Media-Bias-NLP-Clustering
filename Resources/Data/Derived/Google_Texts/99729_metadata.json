Instead of spending his money on medicine, he used methods similar to those described in Barton\u2019s book to, as he puts it, \u201close 110 pounds of fat, get my own blood sugar under control, and completely reverse my type 2 diabetes.\u201d\n\nBut the informercial, with its promises to tell viewers the \u201ctruth\u201d about diabetes for just $19.97, has all the markings of a money-making scam:\n\n\"This reporter\" ordered Huckabee's diabetes \"cure'' kit. I ended up with extra $67 charge on my Visa. http://t.co/ASYM1AIcfi \u2014 Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) March 16, 2015\n\nA spokeswoman for the Huckster would not elaborate on the amount he was paid to appear in the infomercial; she told the New York Times that he ended his relationship with Barton several weeks back. Despite that, and despite the video\u2019s get-it-before-it\u2019s-gone warning \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re giving away so much free and hard-to-find diabetes remedy information that we may end up making this a paid membership website\u201d \u2014 the endorsement is still up and free to view as of this posting.\n\nA number of scientific organizations, including the American Diabetes Association and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), declined to provide an expert who could comment on what is and is not effective in treating diabetes; a representative from the Mayo Clinic explained that they didn\u2019t want to get drawn into what he viewed as a political story. But David Schardt, Senior Nutritionist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, was game to help set the record straight. Our conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity, follows:\n\nHave you encountered this company, Barton Publishing, before?\n\nOh, yes. Actually, a couple of years ago we looked into something they had about dissolving kidney stones with this homemade formula. It\u2019s a company that publishes a lot of different health materials, and it\u2019s sort of typical now of what goes on on the Internet and also with Kindle books and other ebook outlets, which is that this material on various topics is prepared by freelance writers or companies that then market them online or in infomercials.\n\nIf you look at the particular material that Huckabee and Barton are selling, it\u2019s anonymous. You look at the book and nobody\u2019s name is associated with it; that\u2019s probably because it was done by freelancers who really don\u2019t know much about the topic but can gather material from the Internet and put together an ebook, which is what he\u2019s basically selling. Joe Barton does a lot of these, and apparently he\u2019s successful. There are a lot of other people selling ebooks that they prepare based on what people want to buy; they find writers to write material and they sell it. And the quality may vary. When it\u2019s non-medical stuff, probably nobody\u2019s getting hurt, but when it\u2019s medical material it can be misleading or less than useful for people who, in this case, are suffering from diabetes.\n\nWhere does this claim that cinnamon or chromium picolinate can reverse diabetes come from? Is there any scientific merit to it?\n\nBoth of them have been studied for their effects on blood glucose levels. And there are some studies: in the case of chromium, there\u2019s a study in China done in 1997, so almost 20 years ago, and in the case of cinnamon there are a couple of studies overseas \u2014 one in particular in Iran \u2014 that show that it had at least short-term effects on blood glucose levels.\n\nThe thing is, most of the best research since then shows that neither has any impact on long-term blood glucose levels, which is what diabetics should be looking for; not something that will change something tomorrow, but something that will change something for months and years. When you look at that, chromium and cinnamon don\u2019t have that effect.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Huckabee was spotted shilling some very dubious treatments in an online infomercial", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mike Huckabee was spotted shilling some very dubious treatments in an online infomercial", "title": "We can\u2019t believe we have to explain this: Diabetes can\u2019t be cured with cinnamon rolls", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/16/we_cant_believe_we_have_to_explain_this_diabetes_cant_be_cured_with_cinnamon_rolls/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/huckabee_roll.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mike Huckabee was spotted shilling some very dubious treatments in an online infomercial", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/huckabee_roll.jpg", "title": "We can\u2019t believe we have to explain this: Diabetes can\u2019t be cured with cinnamon rolls", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "We can\u2019t believe we have to explain this: Diabetes can\u2019t be cured with cinnamon rolls", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, alternative medicine, Diabetes, Mike Huckabee, We can't believe we have to explain this", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe004f\"", "article_summary": "If you look at the particular material that Huckabee and Barton are selling, it\u2019s anonymous.\nWhen it\u2019s non-medical stuff, probably nobody\u2019s getting hurt, but when it\u2019s medical material it can be misleading or less than useful for people who, in this case, are suffering from diabetes.\nWhere does this claim that cinnamon or chromium picolinate can reverse diabetes come from?\nActually, a couple of years ago we looked into something they had about dissolving kidney stones with this homemade formula.\nWhen you look at that, chromium and cinnamon don\u2019t have that effect."}
