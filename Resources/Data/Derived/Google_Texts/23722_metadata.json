Junior and seniors who are enrolled in Tammy Fehringer's entrepreneurship class operate the cart. In the spring of 2013, Fehringer and Cox applied for the grant that was offered by the Young Americans Center for Financial Education.\n\nCurrently the operation only sells to staff and students, but is hoping to expand the business to community members as well. The cart is operated from 9:45 to 11 a.m. Monday through Friday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_24140848/peetz-high-school-peetz-perks-you-are-here-celebration-young-entrepreneurs", "modificationDate": "2013-09-20T20:41:00-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2013/0920/20130920_053318_09-21 Peetz Perks_300.jpg", "endDate": "2023-09-20T17:32:31-0600", "description": "PEETZ \u2014 On Sept. 10, Taive Cox, Josh Fiscus, and Megan Gillham of Peetz High School attended the \u201cYou are Here, Celebration for Young Entrepreneurs\u201d event in Denver.", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:24140848:view"}, "startDate": "2013-09-21T10:07:20-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_24140848/peetz-high-school-peetz-perks-you-are-here-celebration-young-entrepreneurs", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2013/0920/20130920_053318_09-21 Peetz Perks.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "PEETZ \u2014 On Sept. 10, Taive Cox, Josh Fiscus, and Megan Gillham of Peetz High School attended the \u201cYou are Here, Celebration for Young Entrepreneurs\u201d event in Denver.", "title": "Peetz High School students present at 'Young Entrepreneurs' event"}, "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "PEETZ \u2014 On Sept. 10, Taive Cox, Josh Fiscus, and Megan Gillham of Peetz High School attended the \u201cYou are Here, Celebration for Young Entrepreneurs\u201d event in Denver.", "title": "Peetz High School students present at 'Young Entrepreneurs' event", "url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_24140848/peetz-high-school-peetz-perks-you-are-here-celebration-young-entrepreneurs", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2013/0920/20130920_053318_09-21 Peetz Perks.jpg", "site": "@SterlingJA", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-21T10:07:20-0600", "sailthru.site": "journal-advocate.com", "sailthru.title": "Peetz High School students present at 'Young Entrepreneurs' event", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "2iNkVYi6fQKhylL0pQaJF4qvYsz3qMnvr9EdKrmIbvw", "verify-v1": "BXs3Tp/yfKM8u4D/sQH/llaXrumTjsEN3+pi+oLzohs=", "y_key": "b781c784225bf6e2", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2013/0920/20130920_053318_09-21 Peetz Perks.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-09-20T17:35:15-0600", "news_keywords": "Local News, Local News news, Sterling Colorado Local News news, Sterling Colorado news, Local News Sterling news, Local News Colorado news, US Local News news, world Local News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae71\"", "article_summary": "There the students showcased their business, Peetz Perks, talking to several business people mainly from the Denver area.\nCoffee and smoothie operation receives $1,500 grantTaive Cox, Josh Fiscus and Megan Gillahm of Peetz High School, showcase their business, Peetz Perks at the \"You are Here, Celebration for Young Entrepreneurs,\" in Denver.\nPeetz Perks is a coffee and smoothie operation that is run out of the Peetz School's Library.\n(Courtesy Photo)PEETZ \u2014 On Sept. 10, Taive Cox, Josh Fiscus, and Megan Gillham of Peetz High School attended the \u201cYou are Here, Celebration for Young Entrepreneurs\u201d event in Denver.\nThey received a $1,500 grant for their business."}
