Crews are working to restore water to a Grand Prairie ISD campus after a leak in the water line was discovered on Friday.

The water line feeds water to the ninth grade center of South Grand Prairie High School in the 300 block of West Warrior Trail, but Grand Prairie ISD spokesman Sam Buchmeyer said they are “confident” the problem will be fixed by Sunday night and classes will not be cancelled Monday.

In anticipation of possible delays, Buchmeyer said parents should give themselves extra time to drop their kids off Monday.

Crews broke up large portions of concrete to get about five feet down to tie two water line pipes together, Buchmeyer said.

“Hopefully this will create a scenario to where we won’t have this problem anymore,” Buchmeyer said.

Buchmeyer said there is no concern about the quality of drinking water going to the building.
