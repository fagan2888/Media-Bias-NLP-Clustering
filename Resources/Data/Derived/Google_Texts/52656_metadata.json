Many trees had limbs down, some trees were completely uprooted or snapped in half.\n\n\"I've been busy for three day straight,\" said Ernie Williams, owner of Williams Firewood & Tree Service.\n\nMassive piles of brush can be seen alongside many city streets. City crews were out the night of the storm to clear debris from roads.\n\nThe power for the majority of town has been restored. Remaining outages are expected to be repaired in the next few days.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "People living in Newton are cleaning up storm damage after 100 mph winds leave a path of damage.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "People living in Newton are cleaning up storm damage after 100 mph winds leave a path of damage.", "title": "Newton residents cleaning storm damage", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newton-residence-cleaning-storm-damage-298682621.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/571/9BE/5719BE82F268402CBEDC16D9E5E8B64F", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/EC6/729/EC67292DF31843DCBDDA016C6B782217.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "People living in Newton are cleaning up storm damage after 100 mph winds leave a path of damage.", "title": "Newton residents cleaning storm damage", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newton-residence-cleaning-storm-damage-298682621.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/newton_library.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Newton residents cleaning storm damage", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Newton residents cleaning storm damage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd830c\"", "article_summary": "More Video...A storm caused massive power outages and damaged many buildings in the town of Newton late Thursday night.\n\"I've been busy for three day straight,\" said Ernie Williams, owner of Williams Firewood & Tree Service.\nMuch of the town was without electricity for hours after 100 mph winds damaged the towns power grid.\nCity crews were out the night of the storm to clear debris from roads.\n\"It was swamped, we did about quadruple what we normally do,\" said Karen Walton, owner of Karen's Kitchen."}
