NEW YORK (MainStreet) — The cost of modern healthcare in America is baffling and exorbitant. Prices are the result of a hidden collusion between insurers and providers; the consumer has little recourse in determining the accuracy or equity of charges – much less the ability to gain enough information to make an informed purchase. But one consumer group in California is trying to change that.

PriceCheck, a crowdsourced database of healthcare costs, launched earlier this year through the efforts of two California public broadcasting stations and ClearHealthCosts.com. By soliciting information from listeners, the group has gathered hundreds of real-life charges for common medical tests and procedures into a free, searchable database.

"KQED and DPPC conducted on-air announcements to encourage members of our public radio audiences to share their price data for four specific procedures: screening mammograms, lower-back resonance imaging (MRI) intrauterine devices (IUDS) and diabetes test strips," writes Lisa Aliferis in the Journal of the American Medical Association's Internal Medicine. Aliferis was part of the team that launched the project.

"Because there was no database where consumers could easily look up costs, we created one," Aliferis adds. "These are not 'chargemaster' prices from physician or hospital billing systems because virtually no one pays those . These are not 'average' prices either. You do not use 'average price' to shop for a car or a computer – you want the real price. Instead, we asked members of our public media audience in California to share, anonymously, what they and their insurers actually paid."
