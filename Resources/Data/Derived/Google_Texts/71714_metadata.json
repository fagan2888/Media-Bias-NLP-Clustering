Just 5 percent of respondents said they had engaged in extreme binge drinking \u2013 defined by the researchers as having had 15 or more drinks in a row at least once in the previous two weeks.\n\nThe number of students reporting they had used cocaine in the previous year increased from 2.7 percent in 2013 to 4.4 percent in 2014. Johnston called the increase statistically significant, but said it was too soon to know if the drug was actually making a comeback on college campuses.\n\nParents sending their children to college this fall can take comfort in another of the survey\u2019s findings, Johnston said: Half of the survey respondents said they had not used any illicit drugs in the past year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More U.S. college students are making a habit of using marijuana, which has supplanted cigarettes as the smoke-able substance of choice among undergraduates who light up regularly, a study released Tuesday found.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "More U.S. college students are making a habit of using marijuana, which has supplanted cigarettes as the smoke-able substance of choice among undergraduates who light up regularly, a study released Tuesday found.", "title": "Study: Marijuana More A Habit For College Students Than Cigarettes", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/09/college-students-marijuana-cigarettes", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/09/0901_marijuana-620x408.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/09/college-students-marijuana-cigarettes", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/09/0901_marijuana-620x408.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Marijuana More A Habit For College Students Than Cigarettes"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-09-01", "date": "Tue, 01 Sep 2015 12:22:23 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "Study: Marijuana More A Habit For College Students Than CigarettesMore U.S. college students are making a habit of using marijuana, which has supplanted cigarettes as the smoke-able substance of choice among undergraduates who light up regularly, a study released Tuesday found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that for the past seven or eight years there has been an increase in marijuana use among the nation\u2019s college students,\u201d Johnston said.\nTwenty-one percent of the college students surveyed said they had used marijuana at least once during the previous month, and 34 percent said they had used it in the past year.\nJust under 6 percent of the full-time students surveyed by University of Michigan researchers for the annual \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d study reported using pot either every day or at least 20 times in the previous 30 days.\nThe number of students reporting they had used cocaine in the previous year increased from 2.7 percent in 2013 to 4.4 percent in 2014."}
