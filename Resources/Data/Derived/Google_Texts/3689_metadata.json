Each town has a board of education and its own elementary school, which feed a single high school in Deep River. The high school is governed by the Region Four Board of Education, and the administrative functions are overseen by what\u2019s called a Supervision District Committee. This is made up of three members from each town board and Region Four. Seidman is also chairman of the supervision committee.\n\nThe agreement helps the districts save money by sharing administrative services and it keeps the number of middle managers low.\n\nBut Seidman said that making decisions can sometimes be cumbersome. \"We spend a lot of time working together to get these things through, and that's fine, but it's slower than it should be,\" he said. \"Especially given how fast education is changing, we need to be much more agile in how we approach things.\"\n\nThe goal would be to have one school board that oversees all schools in each town. Recent legislation might give Region Four more flexibility to do that, Seidman said.\n\nAs enrollment in public schools is falling in nearly three-quarters of all Connecticut districts, regionalization is becoming a popular topic among school leaders.\n\nHover over the map below to see the changes in school enrollment for Connecticut towns.\n\nInteractive map by Charlie Smart/WNPR.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education", "description": "Thirty-three members of four different school boards from three towns get together twice a month to talk education.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/connecticut-school-districts-try-stay-ahead-declining-enrollment", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201506/valley_regional_high_school.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Thirty-three members of four different school boards from three towns get together twice a month to talk education.", "title": "Connecticut School Districts Try to Stay Ahead of Declining Enrollment"}, "story_id": 416411826, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@savingej"}, "author": "David DesRoches", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Connecticut School Districts Try to Stay Ahead of Declining Enrollment"}, "nid": 42271, "datePublished": "2015-06-22", "keywords": "The Daily, Connecticut, schools, students, demographics", "wordCount": 392, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Each town has a board of education and its own elementary school, which feed a single high school in Deep River.\nThe goal would be to have one school board that oversees all schools in each town.\nAs enrollment in public schools is falling in nearly three-quarters of all Connecticut districts, regionalization is becoming a popular topic among school leaders.\nHover over the map below to see the changes in school enrollment for Connecticut towns.\nThis is made up of three members from each town board and Region Four."}
