He added, \u201cWe like having shows that rate really well, and there\u2019s an instinct that you want it to go on forever. But it doesn\u2019t. \u2026 Going out at the right time is going to make your show last forever \u2014 we want to make shows that stand the test of time.\u201d Although the original Variety story pointed out that the show might run a little longer than that \u201cgiven the needs of the creatives,\u201d there\u2019s no reason not to take Grad at his word. He\u2019s laying the groundwork pretty early for Justified to end after six seasons and close to 80 episodes. In a lot of ways, this is indeed \u201cthe smart move and the brave move,\u201d since it allows for a graceful exit. But it\u2019s more than that: Every show should probably end sooner than you think it should.\n\nThe business model of American network TV is based on longevity. Studios and networks want to create and air series that will run for years, in part because longer-running shows are theoretically more popular, and more popular shows can charge more for commercial airtime, so you can get more bang for your production dollar over a show\u2019s run. Heat doesn\u2019t always correspond to a show\u2019s age, of course, but there\u2019s often a peak time in a popular show\u2019s life cycle when it can command certain ad rates. For instance, if you want to place a 30-second spot in Law & Order: SVU (which has been on for 15 seasons), you\u2019ll need $73,000 and change, but if you want a 30-second spot in The Voice (a decade younger and a much bigger ratings draw), you\u2019ll need almost $279,000. This stuff obviously fluctuates all the time, and the point of the annual TV network upfronts is to help establish these ad rates. It\u2019s a cruel and hilariously fickle business, which is why people at the executive level are looking for the surest bet on something that\u2019ll play for years, bring in good ad money, and be subsequently sold into syndication.\n\nThat\u2019s the business side, though. The artistic side has nothing to do with longevity and everything to do with how much time should really be spent on a given story, or in a given narrative world. And the truth is that that amount of time is shorter than we tell ourselves it should be. Much shorter.\n\nGrad\u2019s comments make perfect sense here: \u201cIf you\u2019re making a great, 80-hour movie, it has to have a beginning, middle, and end.\u201d The heavily serialized dramas and comedies that have come to dominate network and cable TV in the past 15 years are designed with such arcs in mind. The reason that series like Breaking Bad have earned such praise is that they\u2019ve never lost that momentum or forgotten that all stories must, by definition, end. Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan didn\u2019t know how the show would end when he started it, but he knew that it would come to a close. It would have to. Another drama that\u2019s rightly hailed as a modern classic, The Wire, included such arcs within each season, so that while the entire five-season run tells the whole story, the show itself could have stood tall had it ended earlier. (And it almost did: there was a two-year gap between the third and fourth seasons, meaning we almost missed out on one of the best seasons of television ever produced.) ABC\u2019s Lost painted itself into more than a few narrative corners over the course of six seasons, but unanswered mysteries are preferable to the dead-eyed, wheel-spinning confusion of the show\u2019s second season, when it was reeling from its status as a pop culture hit and had no idea where to go with its story. When the producers set a deal to end the show after six seasons, giving them a clear deadline and exit date, stories got much tighter and more focused. Battlestar Galatica, which started life as a soapy sci-fi adventure packed with political and spiritual allegories, ended in a sputtering heap that seemed to undo years of story at random. Etc., etc. And comedies aren\u2019t excluded from such considerations, either: among others, Parks and Recreation relies heavily on serialized stories, and its age is starting to show in some awkward ways as it crosses the 100-episode mark.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vince Gilligan understood what few Globe-nominated producers do: Series must be conceived with an ending in mind", "title": "What your favorite TV show can learn from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Vince Gilligan understood what few Globe-nominated producers do: Series must be conceived with an ending in mind", "title": "What your favorite TV show can learn from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/12/what_your_favorite_tv_show_can_learn_from_breaking_bad_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bb_girls_justified.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vince Gilligan understood what few Globe-nominated producers do: Series must be conceived with an ending in mind", "title": "What your favorite TV show can learn from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bb_girls_justified.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel Carlson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Battlestar Galactica, Breaking Bad, Editor's Picks, Justified, Pajiba, The Wire, Vince Gilligan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcea0\"", "article_summary": "This stuff obviously fluctuates all the time, and the point of the annual TV network upfronts is to help establish these ad rates.\nThe business model of American network TV is based on longevity.\nHe\u2019s laying the groundwork pretty early for Justified to end after six seasons and close to 80 episodes.\nBreaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan didn\u2019t know how the show would end when he started it, but he knew that it would come to a close.\nThe reason that series like Breaking Bad have earned such praise is that they\u2019ve never lost that momentum or forgotten that all stories must, by definition, end."}
