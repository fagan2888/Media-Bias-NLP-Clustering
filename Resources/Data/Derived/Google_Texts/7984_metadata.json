That architect says, if completed, the castle home will be the largest single family residence in the U.S.\n\nThe City of Edmond says the home is the idea of David Frayer, the owner of the Key Auto Group.\n\n\"He's hired an architect to make sure this is going to work. He's done quite a bit of research for a number of years to do this,\" says Schiermeyer.\n\n\"I think it's a just a family dream,\" says Schiermeyer about Frayer's motivation.\n\nCity records show that Frayer told planning commissioners that he and his family have visited castles in Europe while researching for the home. Frayer has purchased 140 acres at Sorghum Mill Road and Westminster Road.\n\nThe architect would not get into the cost of the home, but tells News 9 he hopes to begin construction in two months.\n\nNews 9 reached out to David Frayer, he declined our request for an interview.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "There are plans to build the country's largest single family residence in northeast Edmond.", "author": "Karl Torp", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24959146/edmond-mega-mansion-could-become-largest-home-in-us", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24959146_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "There are plans to build the country's largest single family residence in northeast Edmond.", "title": "Edmond Mega Mansion Could Become Largest Home In US"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24959146_SA.jpg", "description": "There are plans to build the country's largest single family residence in northeast Edmond.", "card": "summary", "title": "Edmond Mega Mansion Could Become Largest Home In US"}, "wnreadableurl": "edmond-mega-mansion-could-become-largest-home-in-us", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2014/03/12", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,mega,home,largest,edmond,plans,castle,frayer,news9.com,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,mega,home,largest,edmond,plans,castle,frayer,news9.com,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a03\"", "article_summary": "There are plans to build the country's largest single family residence in northeast Edmond.\nThat architect says, if completed, the castle home will be the largest single family residence in the U.S.\nLast year, the Edmond Planning Commission was asked to give approval to a mega mansion on the northwest corner of Sorghum Mill Road and Westminster Road.\nThe City of Edmond says the home is the idea of David Frayer, the owner of the Key Auto Group.\nThe architect would not get into the cost of the home, but tells News 9 he hopes to begin construction in two months."}
