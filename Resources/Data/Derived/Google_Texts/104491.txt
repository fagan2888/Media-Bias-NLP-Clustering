INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana’s GOP-controlled Legislature has approved a bill that would codify into law Gov. Mike Pence’s statewide expansion of Medicaid under President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul.

The measure was approved on a 65-35 vote Thursday. It now goes to Pence’s desk.

Indiana’s expansion of Medicaid is called the Health Indiana Plan, or HIP 2.0 for short. It has extended health insurance to thousands of people who didn’t previously have it. A waiver granted by the federal government allows the state to charge fees to low-income people for coverage.

Lawmakers also are expected to vote Thursday on a multimillion plan to boost state and local road funding. The deal also is expected to include an extra $42 million for regional economic grants.

Thursday is this legislative session’s planned adjournment day.
