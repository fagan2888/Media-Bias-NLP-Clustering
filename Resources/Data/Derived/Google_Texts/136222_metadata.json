I think what we have right now is some excitement, intrigue, and that\u2019s great, as long as you can contain it.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201ccontainment means jabs and a few elbows are great, but I think beyond that it can be problematic.\u201d\n\nRival camps do not expect Trump to be a serious contender for the nomination when voting starts early next year. But they also cannot predict what might drive him from the race.\n\nSo far, he has proved to be immune from what would be viewed as missteps by any other candidate. But those missteps are piling up.\n\nTrump was disinvited from a prominent conservative forum Saturday in Atlanta because of disparaging comments he made about Megyn Kelly, the Fox News moderator who had asked him tough questions in the debate.\n\nFor now, Trump\u2019s unexpected summer surge has vaulted him to front-runner status. It will be several days before public polling shows whether he was damaged by his caustic debate comments about women and refusal to rule out a third-party run.\n\nMost GOP strategists expect little shake-up in the rest of the field before the second debate next month.\n\n\u201cThe electorate is going to take time to think through this,\u201d said David Winston, a Republican pollster. \u201cSo I think everybody else is going to have to have patience.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the two candidates closest to Trump in early polls, escaped the first debate without damage, but also without any breakthrough moments.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich capitalized on a home-state crowd at the Cleveland debate to exceed expectations with an upbeat and optimistic performance. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was praised for a substantive showing.\n\nThe candidates made their case before a prime-time television audience of 24 million people, making the debate the biggest nonsports cable broadcast history.\n\nDuring the tumultuous 2012 Republican primary, a series of 13 debates before the kickoff Iowa caucuses kept the race in flux through its early months.\n\nFour years later, party leaders have cut in half the total number of approved debates \u2014 just six before the Iowa caucuses in February.\n\nSo fewer debate chances for breakout moments or disqualifying stumbles. On top of that, Iowa canceled its famed summer straw poll \u2014 a death knell for candidates in the past.\n\nThe growth of super political action committees, which can collect unlimited donations, means fewer candidates are at risk of having to shut down because they are out of money.\n\n\u201cAt this point in past cycles, there would be death watch coverage of a couple of the candidates,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, the former New Hampshire Republican party chairman. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen this time.\u201d\n\nBush maintains a massive financial advantage over his rivals, having raised more than $114 million in the first half of the year between his campaign and super PAC. Despite that haul and his political pedigree, he has not broken away from the pack as some thought he might.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to work hard, you\u2019ve got to earn it,\u201d Bush said Friday during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. \u201cA well-funded campaign is important \u2014 it\u2019s better than a nonfunded campaign \u2014 but it\u2019s not the only thing that matters.\u201d\n\nBush allies privately concede he underperformed in the debate. He appeared even-keeled but unremarkable amid Trump fireworks and showed signs of nerves in the opening moments of his first debate in more than a decade.\n\nSuggesting many voters still do not know Bush well, the son and brother of former presidents will devote much of the summer is to highlighting his accomplishments while governor of Florida, said campaign spokesman Tim Miller.\n\nBush will pay particular attention to New Hampshire, where his brand of politics is likely to play the best among the four early voting states. It\u2019s also where he will face increased competition from Kasich, a lesser-known Republican presidential contender who exceeded modest expectations in the debate.\n\nThe next debate is Sept. 16 in California. Host CNN has said it will use a similar model to select the candidates on stage as Fox News did for the first one: a grouping of the top 10 candidates, according to public polling, and a second that includes lower-ranked candidates.\n\nOne of the biggest questions to emerge is whether Carly Fiorina, the only woman in the GOP race, will break into the top tier.\n\nThe former technology executive impressed many in the party with her sharp, forceful performance before the prime-time debate, but it\u2019s not clear who she might dislodge from the top 10.\n\n\u2022 Associated Press writer Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are steeling themselves for a long period of uncertainty following a raucous first debate of the 2016 presidential campaign.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republicans are steeling themselves for a long period of uncertainty following a raucous first debate of the 2016 presidential campaign.", "title": "GOP steels itself for uncertainty in White House race", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/8/gop-steels-itself-uncertainty-white-house-race/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/08/a0eaf9e13f4363237e0f6a706700b247.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/08/a0eaf9e13f4363237e0f6a706700b247.jpg", "description": "Republicans are steeling themselves for a long period of uncertainty following a raucous first debate of the 2016 presidential campaign.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP steels itself for uncertainty in White House race"}, "Author": "Julie Pace, Steve Peoples", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Donald Trump, Republican Party, Jeb Bush, Atlanta"}, "article_summary": "Before the campaign got underway, Republican Party leaders developed a streamlined set of debates and a nomination calendar that aimed to avoid a messy fight.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are steeling themselves for a long period of uncertainty following a raucous first debate of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nOne of the biggest questions to emerge is whether Carly Fiorina, the only woman in the GOP race, will break into the top tier.\nMost GOP strategists expect little shake-up in the rest of the field before the second debate next month.\n\u201cAt this point in past cycles, there would be death watch coverage of a couple of the candidates,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, the former New Hampshire Republican party chairman."}
