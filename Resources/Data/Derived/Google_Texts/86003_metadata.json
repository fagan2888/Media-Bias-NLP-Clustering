The group\u2019s founder, John Podesta, served as Obama\u2019s White House \u201ccounselor\u201d and co-directed Obama\u2019s transition into the White House.\n\nA Time magazine article profiled the influence of Podesta\u2019s Center in the formation of the Obama administration, stating that \u201cnot since the Heritage Foundation helped guide Ronald Reagan\u2019s transition in 1981 has a single outside group held so much sway.\u201d\n\nWould \u2018push policy in a progressive direction\u2019\n\nAnother heavily influential progressive group, Demos, has now outright endorsed compulsory voting laws for the U.S., even allowing that such rules could virtually guarantee a \u201cprogressive\u201d government.\n\n\u201cObama Is Right: America Needs Universal Voting,\u201d reads a post on the Demos website.\n\n\u201cObama is right to point to voting as a mechanism to fight elite domination of politics,\u201d writes Demos\u2019 research associate Sean McElwee.\n\nMcElwee notes that \u201cnonvoters are more liberal than voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Obama is correct: compulsory voting would indeed dramatically change the country. It would push policy in a progressive direction and force both parties to put more emphasis on policies that benefit the working and middle classes,\u201d McElwee writes.\n\nAccording to Demos\u2019 own website, while Obama was a state senator in 1999, he served on the working group that founded Demos.\n\nThe group previously partnered with Project Vote, a voter registration drive run by Obama in 1992.\n\nDemos was actively involved in lobbying for Obama\u2019s stimulus legislation.\n\nObama\u2019s former \u201cgreen\u201d jobs czar, Van Jones, is a long-time Demos fellow.\n\nWND previously reported Demos may have been instrumental in the Obama administration\u2019s hiring of Jones, who resigned in 2009 after it was exposed he founded a communist revolutionary organization and called for \u201cresistance\u201d against the U.S. government.\n\nMonths before Obama took office, Jones was recommended for the environmental position in a report by business scholar Chuck Collins, director of the Tax Program for Shared Prosperity at Demos.\n\nCollins is an associate of billionaire George Soros and a longtime leftist activist linked to socialist causes.\n\nCollins penned a piece that listed his top picks for the Obama administration, including Jones, at the radical, Soros-funded Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nThe IPS, together with the Center for American Progress, has penned an annual Unified Security Budget, with specifics recommendations for the Defense Department\u2019s budget.\n\nThe 2012 Unified Security Budget itself recalled how the group\u2019s policy recommendations from some of its recent defense papers were been adopted by Obama\u2019s Sustainable Defense Taskforce, which has notoriously recommended $1 trillion in defense cuts over 10 years.\n\nBoasts the 2012 report: \u201cA majority, though not a supermajority, of the members of the President\u2019s Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform adopted the annualized figure of $100 billion, and many of the recommendations from this proposal.\u201d\n\nBrookings Institute\n\nMeanwhile, the Brookings Institution, which bills itself as a centrist think tank, previously endorsed the concept of mandatory voting.\n\nIn December 2014, the Institute published an article entitled, \u201cIs Compulsory Voting a Solution to America\u2019s Low Voter Turnout and Political Polarization?\u201d\n\nSenior Brookings Fellow William Galston, the center\u2019s Ezra K. Zilkha chair in Governance Studies, was quoted imagining a \u201cfuture in which Americans must vote, or face a penalty.\u201d\n\nSenior Fellow Thomas Mann, the W. Averell Harriman Chair in American Governance, labeled mandatory voting \u201cthe most promising\u201d of possible reforms aimed at increasing the size of the electorate, the Brookings article stated.\n\nMann told a Brookings podcast that mandatory voting means \u201cpolitical parties and candidates have no incentive to spend huge amounts of money trying to turn out their voters and to demobilize the opposition\u2019s voters.\u201d\n\nWith additional research by Brenda J.
