MOSCOW—Russia’s most popular search engine, Yandex, is transforming its product-search service Yandex.Market into an online marketplace as it looks to take a larger slice of Russia’s growing Internet retail sector.

From November, customers will be able to place orders via the search site, which allows them to find products from thousands of stores and then rank them by price or seller rating, landing Yandex 1% of the value of any transaction.

Yandex currently receives a fee of a few cents every time a customer clicks on a link to a seller’s website, regardless of whether they then buy the product.

Yandex.Market is Russia’s biggest aggregator of goods on the Internet, with 13,000 partner stores across several countries and 17 million users in Russia.

Only trusted Russian and Ukrainian Internet stores that have worked with Yandex.Market for at least three months and have a rating no lower than three out of five stars will be able to make a switch to the new model. Others will still pay Yandex per click.

Alexander Feoktistov, head of marketing at Yandex.Market, said the new model would be more convenient for users.

He declined to say whether he expected a revenue boost from the change. But Vladimir Baydin, from J’son & Partners Consulting, said the change could add up to $20 million to Yandex.Market’s annual revenue, which Mr. Baydin estimates at $60 million to $80 million.

Online retail is growing sharply in Russia as Internet use spreads and incomes grow. Morgan Stanley forecasts sales in the sector will hit $36 billion in 2015, triple last year’s figure.

Over half of all Russian consumers begin their search for a product through Yandex, according to Morgan Stanley.

Mr. Baydin said Yandex is looking to consolidate the online retail market as a way to stay ahead of global players such as eBay Inc., which this year launched a Russian-language website.
