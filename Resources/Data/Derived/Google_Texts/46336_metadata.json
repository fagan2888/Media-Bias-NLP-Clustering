He is crude, abrasive and so self-confident that he leads one to wonder if he shouldn\u2019t be locked up for severe narcissism. It is these very qualities, along with promising to force Mexico to pay for a wall and his \u201cyuge\u201d plans to \u201cMake America great again\u201d that have led thousands of Republicans to jump on the Trump bandwagon. But is he actually a conservative? No.\n\nIn 1987, Trump registered as a republican then decided the GOP wasn\u2019t his style and moved on to the Independence Party in 1999.\n\nIn 2001, Trump realized the Independence Party just wasn\u2019t good enough, so he switched to the Democratic party. In 2009, Trump felt like he wanted to try something new by going back to the Republican party after 12 years of unadulterated liberalism.\n\nA couple years later, he no longer wanted to be affiliated with any party. Then finally, in 2012, we were not so excited to welcome the reality TV star back to the Republican party.\n\nDuring that time, The Donald flip-flopped more my than my wife\u2019s pancakes on a Sunday morning.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Trump\u2019s indecisiveness on the value of human life in the womb.\n\n\u201cI believe it is a personal decision that should be left to the women and their doctors,\u201d Trump said in 1999.\n\nPro-abortion. Not really a core conservative value.\n\n\u201cI support a woman\u2019s right to choose, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures,\u201d Trump said in 2000. \u201cWhen Tim Russert asked me on Meet the Press if I would ban partial-birth abortion, my pro-choice instincts led me to say no.\u201d\n\nHe did later say he would support a ban on partial-birth abortion. Now that he is looking for votes, he is so pro-life you can\u2019t even comprehend it.\n\nAre you thinking that his \u201cpro-choice instincts,\u201d don\u2019t bode well for his other views on healthcare? You would be right.\n\n\u201cWe must have universal healthcare,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe has never come out and renounced that claim. Now he\u2019s all about repeal and replace. \u201cThe one thing I do tell people, we\u2019re going to have something great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total disaster.\u201d\n\nIf we look at his own words, his replacement for Obamacare sure sounds a lot like single-payer.\n\n\u201cI am going to take care of everybody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, he said he\u2019s just going to raise taxes on the eviln rich man.\n\n\u201cIf you look at actually raise, some very wealthy are going to be raised,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re going to have something that\u2019s going to be spectacular.\u201d\n\nIn summary, Trump is historically pro-abortion, for single-payer health care, has no problem raising taxes and despises our right to freedom of the press.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to open up our libel laws, so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles we can sue them and win lots of money,\u201d Trump said.\n\nDonald J. Trump is not a conservative. He never has been and never will be. He has no guiding principles, let alone conservative principles. He is a narcissist willing to say whatever he needs to win.\n\nI will never vote for Donald Trump nor will any true conservatives.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "BYU-I Scroll", "description": "Drumpf is by no means the classic presidential candidate.
