Swedish filed a cease and desist against the advocacy group last January, demanding its members stop harassing hospital staff, patients and visitors at its Cherry Hill campus.\n\n\u201cI think in the beginning they really tried to ignore us and hope it would go away,\u201d said Xochitl Maykovich, Washington CAN community organizer.\n\nJoelle Craft, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, became involved with Washington CAN when her debt with Swedish became unmanageable. She said hospital staff did not make her aware that charity care was an option, her debt eventually leading her to file for bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cI never would have to have gone bankrupt if they had told me,\u201d Craft said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even have signs anywhere, and I hadn\u2019t heard about it.\u201d Then she found out about Washington CAN and joined the cause. \u201cThat\u2019s when they were starting the campaign and talking about how the application was very difficult, and if you have cognitive issue, it\u2019s even harder, and when you\u2019re sick it\u2019s even harder.\u201d\n\nNot only was information about Swedish\u2019s charity care hard to find, Maykovich said, the application process was also complex and tedious. Craft said she struggled to provide all of the documentation, and a letter to Swedish explaining difficulties acquiring pertinent tax information went unanswered; her debt was turned over to collections.\n\nLast April, Washington CAN secured signatures from state and local elected officials on a letter to Swedish CEO Anthony Armada, which requested the nonprofit medical organization not only make its charity care program more transparent and easier to apply for, but also adjust income requirements to make the program accessible to more low-income patients. That list of officals included Seattle City councilmembers Kshama Sawant, Nick Licata, Mike O\u2019Brien and Bruce Harrell and state Sen. Pramila Jayapal.\n\n\u201cAfter that we were able to get a meeting with Swedish,\u201d Maykovich said. \u201cAt our first meeting, we presented our model charity care policy.\u201d That was based on Affordable Care Act requirements and comparisons to what other hospitals were offering. \u201cThat pretty much was what our demands were centered around.\u201d\n\nMaykovich said Swedish officials told Washington CAN members during a second meeting their concerns had been heard, but no \u201cconcrete commitments\u201d were made. Washington CAN communicated its campaign would continue, she said.\n\nThen Swedish made changes in January that satisfied most of Washington CAN\u2019s requests, which happened quietly, Maykovich said.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, they didn\u2019t tell us; they just posted it on the website in January,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to give people credit for pushing them.\u201d\n\nMireau said Swedish had always been very public about its charity care program, but there had been \u201csome feedback from patients and some external groups and some caregivers\u201d that \u201chaving more information out there on the website seemed like a good idea.\u201d\n\nAs of Jan. 1, the Swedish website began providing a more user-friendly interface, with a flyout to the right of the homepage advertising tools for patients that includes a link for financial assistance.\n\n\u201cWe put a lot more information out on the Internet than had been there before,\u201d Mireau said, adding accessing information about financial assistance went from several clicks to just one. \u201cDefinitely what I\u2019m hearing is people are finding it easier. \u2026 They\u2019re getting the necessary information, now that we\u2019ve simplified things, and finding things easier now that we\u2019re pushing it out there.\u201d\n\nSwedish also took the scale it uses for determining financial assistance and made it available online for patients to see where they fall in regards to income eligibility.\n\nMireau said people at admissions to Swedish hospitals now automatically receive a form detailing billing and financial assistance, and patient financial advocates are provided on site. Financial assistance information is available in 10 languages online.\n\nWhile there was input from patients, care providers, staff and community groups, Mireau said Swedish also made changes to meet IRS and ACA requirements for the hospital.\n\nPrior to Jan. 1, Swedish\u2019s charity scale fully covered qualifying patients at 0-200 percent of federal poverty guidelines and had a sliding scale of 30-90 percent for those at 201-400 percent. Now patients can receive a full write-off at 0-300 percent of poverty guidelines and 75 percent for those at 301-400 percent.\n\n\u201cThe coverage is a lot better and the transparency is through the roof,\u201d Craft said about the changes. \u201cBefore, it was very hidden and they were trying not to let people know about it.\u201d\n\nThe ACA guideline for full charity coverage is 250 percent, Mireau said.\n\n\u201cNot only are they following requirements of the Affordable Care Act, but they\u2019re going above and beyond,\u201d Maykovich said.\n\nOne IRS requirement is for hospitals to make it clear to patients which third-party care providers within the hospital will accept charity care, so they can \u201cmake more of an educated decision,\u201d Mireau said.\n\nMaykovich said she doesn\u2019t expect Washington CAN will ever receive credit for affecting changes to Swedish\u2019s charity care program, but the group feels the main goal of improving transparency and access to financial assistance has been accomplished.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably the best in the city, right now,\u201d she said of Swedish\u2019s revised financial assistance program. \u201cI would say even better than Harborview.\u201d\n\nMaykovich said Washington CAN will continue to monitor Swedish\u2019s charity care program for now, and expects patients to notify them if policies are not being followed.\n\nCraft said Swedish\u2019s new guidelines means she\u2019s 100-percent covered through charity care after insurance. She\u2019s convinced Washington CAN had a hand in the change.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious that if we didn\u2019t continue the pressure, this wouldn\u2019t have gone anywhere,\u201d Craft said. \u201cMe, I\u2019m like, \u2018Yay, I can go back to Swedish now, because their care is amazing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She said hospital staff did not make her aware that charity care was an option, her debt eventually leading her to file for bankruptcy.\n\u201cAt our first meeting, we presented our model charity care policy.\u201d That was based on Affordable Care Act requirements and comparisons to what other hospitals were offering.\nWashington CAN began a campaign to push Swedish to improve its charity care program back in 2014, after learning a number of patients were struggling with medical debt at the hospital.\nCraft said Swedish\u2019s new guidelines means she\u2019s 100-percent covered through charity care after insurance.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s probably the best in the city, right now,\u201d she said of Swedish\u2019s revised financial assistance program."}
