Ted Cruz all but 30 seconds to make that proclamation after taking the stage for a rally at Monroeville\u2019s Gateway High School Saturday.\n\nWith three days until the Pennsylvania primary, the Republican presidential candidate wasted no time playing up to a receptive crowd, which wrapped around the school in anticipation of the event hours earlier.\n\nThose in attendance varied in age and candidate preference \u2013 some, while waiting in line, acknowledged they were still undecided for Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nBut collectively, they welcomed Cruz with open arms, advocating for the senator\u2019s stringent constitutionalist approach to restoring America.\n\nBobby Fleegle (sophomore, finance), 20, of Johnstown, traveled from IUP to see Cruz at Gateway. He said there\u2019s a misconception among younger voters that Cruz, unlike, say, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, isn\u2019t an appealing choice for the White House.\n\n\u201cWhen they become adults, their eyes will be opened,\u201d Fleegle said of his fellow students. \u201cMaking everything \u2018fair,\u2019 it all sounds nice, but a lot of Democrats are more social, and Ted is more economical.\u201d\n\nFleegle particularly liked Cruz\u2019s proposed flat-tax system, which, as the candidate went on to explain, would allow taxes to be completed on a postcard-sized form.\n\nJanice Stricko, 64, of Westmoreland County, wasn\u2019t as adamant in her belief that Cruz could ultimately win a general election.\n\nBut Stricko, a Gateway graduate and teacher in the district for more than three decades, had no problem vouching for Saturday\u2019s local celebrity thanks to conservative ideals.\n\n\u201cThat scares me, beating Hillary [Clinton],\u201d she said. \u201cBut you support what you believe.\u201d\n\nRecent polls, including an April 21 survey by Franklin & Marshall College, show Cruz trailing GOP front-runner Donald Trump in the upcoming northeastern primaries. In an election season where a contested July convention seems increasingly likely, however, that didn\u2019t stop Cruz from drumming up interest in his conservative campaign.\n\nAmid chants of \u201cWe want Ted\u201d and \u201cPresident Cruz,\u201d the 45-year-old senator emphasized \u201cjobs, freedom, security,\u201d a slogan unveiled through onstage posters.\n\nHe reiterated his signature plans to repeal and reform the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, limit federal power in favor of state governments and small-business growth, as well as stand against radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nThrough it all, he also highlighted his movement as a contrast to Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump was writing checks to Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cI was still in grade school. Donald Trump is a Washington insider who has been supporting liberal Democratic politicians for 40 years.\u201d\n\nDespite his own congressional background, Cruz made it a point to lump Trump into the same category that his rival has been lauded for attacking: all-talk, no-action government.\n\nAlluding to presidents who have compromised on positions, Cruz said too many candidates \u201ctalk good on the campaign trail, and then they get in office and betray us.\u201d\n\n\u201c(But) I have to give Donald credit. He\u2019s betraying us before he got elected.\u201d\n\nOne particular example of Trump\u2019s alleged flip-flopping stirred the Monroeville crowd, bringing the seated audience to its feet in Gateway\u2019s auditorium.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago, Donald Trump went on The Today Show, and he agreed with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that grown men should be allowed to use the little girls\u2019 restroom,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s just nuts. Listen, this is not a matter of Republican or Democrat or conservative or liberal. It\u2019s a matter of basic common sense.\n\n\u201cAs the father of two young girls, I can tell you it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all to allow adult grown men \u2013 strangers \u2013 to be alone in a bathroom with little girls. That\u2019s just political correctness on steroids.\u201d\n\nTrump has since realigned his stance on contested bathroom laws, saying they should be left as they are.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t we had enough of this nonsense?\u201d Cruz asked, with applause erupting before he finished. \u201cDo we want to nominate a candidate who is a phony? Or do we want to get behind an optimistic, forward-looking, conservative campaign with real solutions?\u201d\n\nOne of three U.S. senators of Cuban descent, Cruz also drew ovations for comments on the Democratic presidential hopefuls, including former Secretary of State Clinton.\n\n\u201cWe started with a young, diverse field,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a contrast with the Democrats. The Democratic field consists of a wild-eyed socialist with crazy ideals, and then there\u2019s Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nBefore greeting fans, at the close of his rally, Cruz made the ever-important case for votes in Pennsylvania, identifying himself as Clinton\u2019s chief competition, with mentions of head-to-head victories against her in polls from Iowa and Ohio.\n\n\u201cHere in PA and other classic battle states, Donald loses to Hillary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming back here in October and November, and if we stand together, we are beating Hillary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Penn", "description": "MONROEVILLE \u2013 \u201cGod bless the Pittsburgh Steelers.\u201d It took Texas Sen.
