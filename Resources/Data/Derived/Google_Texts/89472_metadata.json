Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) denied it. Pundits explained that the lawsuit was actually a way to avoid impeachment. Wasn\u2019t that kind of Boehner? Too bad his lawsuit has no merit.\n\nBut the truth usually comes out, and when dealing with Republicans, the truth is often revealed by taking the logic behind their biggest fails from the past and applying it to today (former Speaker Gingrich ringing any bells?). Even as they deny reality and the political pundits bury thier heads in the sand and play \u201cboth sides do it,\u201d reality will speak for itself.\n\nReality says:\n\nA) The logical conclusion of suing the President is impeachment proceedings. This is how they started it when they worked to impeach Clinton; they got a court case going as the sticky trap and then waited to catch their fly. (Former President Bill Clinton walked right into their plan by lying in a deposition.)\n\nB) Republicans can\u2019t run on their records and they can\u2019t discuss the merits of the only activities they have spent time and money on over the past two years \u2013 trying to repeal Obamacare and trying to invent an Obama scandal that would stick. They haven\u2019t been doing the people\u2019s work, so they are stuck going negative.\n\nC) Boehner\u2019s lawsuit was a get out the vote (and a yellow coward flag of appeasement) tactic aimed at the same Tea Party that just took out Cantor. But the base wants impeachment of the President that Republicans have been telling them for years is not legitimate (you\u2019d be mad too if you believed that the President was a Muslim Kenyan Socialist Communist Nazi hell bent on taking over the U.S.).\n\nD) They won\u2019t rule it out. This is the old shell game trick where Republicans sell moderate GOP mask, but underneath is a Bircher rebranded as a Tea Party corporate puppet for the top 2%. In other words, the same old attempt to distract from their policies that only benefit the top 2%.\n\nAnd now we have E. E is for evidence. E is a roundup, courtesy of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, of Republican candidates and incumbents pushing for impeachment.\n\nE) Evidence of the GOP drum beat for impeachment and the reprehensible, egregious lies being told about this President\u2019s \u201cimpeachable offenses\u201d (\u201cboth sides do it\u201d appeasers please note that even when George W. Bush deserved to be impeached, there were only a handful of elected Democrats who dared to voice that opinion in public). This is not partisan bickering. Both sides do not do this:\n\nRepublican Candidates Support Impeachment\n\nMarilinda Garcia (NH-02): President Obama \u201chas Many, Many Impeachable Offenses.\u201d \u201dWhen asked if she would vote to impeach President Obama Garcia said, \u201cI would..He has many, many impeachable offenses it seems to me in terms of his disregard for our Constitution alone.\u201d [New Boston Republican Committee Debate, 2/06/14]\n\nGary Lambert (NH-02): Would Not Close Door on Supporting Impeaching President Obama. \u201dYou heard me how I feel about winning, so first I gotta see whether or not that would work, whether or not we could win. Then I\u2018ll evaluate it at that time\u2026I\u2019m with you on this but we gotta keep our eye on the ball.\u201d [New Boston Republican Committee Debate, 2/06/14]\n\nRyan Zinke (MT-AL) Pledged to Support Impeaching President Obama. \u201dDuring the debate, held May 27, tea party activist and fellow House candidate Drew Turiano asked Zinke whether he would support efforts to impeach Obama [\u2026]\u2019And then I do believe we can put the president on the run. He\u2019s had six years of doing his will to this country, and I believe that\u2019s intentional dismantling of American power both domestically and abroad,\u2019 said Zinke. \u2018So is impeachment in the cards? Let\u2019s hope we have the votes.\u2019 Turiano, not completely satisfied with Zinke\u2019s response, replied, \u2018Is that a yes or a no?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Zinke.\u201d [Huffington Post, 6/02/14]\n\nRepublican Incumbents Push Impeachment\n\nRep. Steve Scalise \u201cRefused to Rule Out a Drive to Impeach President Barack Obama.\u201d \u201cThe third ranking Republican official in the House refused to rule out a drive to impeach President Barack Obama during an interview with Fox News Sunday.\u201d [MSNBC, 7/27/14]\n\nRep. Jeff Denham: Would Not Discount Impeachment. In August 2013, Denham said: \u201cIf our Commander in Chief that was reelected in this country decides to break the Constitution it is a challenge to hold him accountable. And he\u2019s done it several times now.\u201d When asked if he would support impeachment, Denham said: \u201cImpeachment is a, is a very serious issue. I think that you have to prove that the leader of the free world has done something that is so far against American beliefs that, and this trust that he\u2019s been sworn into that you remove him. You know I think that him trying to move beyond these phony scandals is something that opens the door for us to investigate further. IRS targeting people, targeting individuals, targeting political organizations is a huge issue that we\u2019re going to hold him account on. But the biggest issue for me thus far in this presidency has been Benghazi [\u2026]So depending on how far these investigations go we could get into a scenario where the president has broken the law.\u201d [North Valley Tea Party Club, 8/14/13]\n\nRep. Kerry Bentivolio: It Would be \u201cDream Come True\u201d to Impeach President Obama. \u201dRep. Kerry Bentivolio, R-Mich., Monday said it would be a \u2019dream come true\u2019 to write a bill to impeach President Obama after constituents asked what he is doing to stop the president from \u2018doing everything that he\u2019s doing against [the] Constitution.\u2019 \u2018If I could write that bill and submit it, it would be a dream come true,\u2019 Bentivolio said at the Birmingham Bloomfield Republican Club Meeting. \u2018I feel your pain. I stood twelve feet away from [the president] and listened to him. I couldn\u2019t stand being there, but because he is president I have to respect the office. That\u2019s my job, as a congressman. I respect the office.\u2019 Bentivolio, a former Santa Claus impersonator and reindeer farmer, went on to say that he has already asked various lawyers and scholars to advise him on \u2018how [he] could impeach the president of the United States.'\u201d [ABC News, 8/21/13]\n\nRep. Steve King: House will Impeach President Obama if He Acts on Immigration Reform. \u201dRep. Steve King (R-IA) believes the House of Representatives will immediately begin impeachment proceedings if President Barack Obama unilaterally grants work permits and amnesty to millions more illegal immigrants by the \u2018end of summer\u2019 [\u2026]\u2019From my standpoint, if the president [enacts more executive actions], we need to bring impeachment hearings immediately before the House of Representatives,\u2019 King said. \u2018That\u2019s my position and that\u2019s my prediction.'\u201d [Breitbart, 7/26/14]\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz: Impeaching President Obama a Possibility. \u201dRep. Jason Chaffetz says President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the government\u2019s response to the Benghazi terrorist attack could be an impeachable offense and vows to continue digging at the \u201clies of highest magnitude\u201d from the White House. \u2018It\u2019s certainly a possibility,\u201d the Utah Republican said Monday when asked about impeachment. \u2018That\u2019s not the goal but given the continued lies perpetrated by this administration, I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to go. \u2026 I\u2019m not taking it off the table. I\u2019m not out there touting that but I think this gets to the highest levels of our government and integrity and honesty are paramount.'\u201d [Salt Lake Tribune, 5/13/13]\n\nRep. Michele Bachmann: Option of Impeaching President Obama Should Not be Dismissed. \u201dBachmann stopped short of saying that Obama should be impeached, but when asked, said that option shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. \u2018As I have been home in my district, the 6th District of Minnesota, there isn\u2019t a weekend that hasn\u2019t gone by that someone says to me, \u2018Michele, what in the world are you all waiting for in Congress? Why aren\u2019t you impeaching the president? He\u2019s been making unconstitutional actions since he came into office,\u2019 Bachmann said.\u201d [Politico, 5/16/13]\n\nRep. Blake Farenthold: House has Votes to Impeach President Obama. \u201cRep. Blake Farenthold thinks the House of Representatives has the votes to impeach President Barack Obama in response to an inquiry about the authenticity of the president\u2019s birth certificate, but said at a town hall meeting he doesn\u2019t think it would be the best approach. \u2018A question I get a lot, \u2018If everybody is so unhappy with the president, why don\u2019t you impeach him?\u2019 Farenthold, a Texas Republican, said at a town hall meeting Saturday according to a video posted on YouTube. \u2018I\u2019ll give you a real frank answer about that, if we were to impeach the president tomorrow, we would probably get the votes in the House of Representatives to do it.'\u201d [Politico, 8/12/13]\n\nRep.

Jack Kingston: Congress Will Start Looking at Impeaching President Obama \u201cVery Seriously.\u201d \u201dRep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) declined to comment this week when asked whether he supports impeaching President Barack Obama, but in a radio interview two weeks ago, he said it was a very serious possibility [\u2026] \u2018Not a day goes by when people don\u2019t talk to us about impeachment. I don\u2019t know what rises to that level yet, but I know that there\u2019s a mounting frustration that a lot of people are getting to and I think Congress is going to start looking at it very seriously.'\u201d [Huffington Post, 7/16/14]\n\nRep.

Joe Barton (R-Texas), who voted to impeach President Bill Clinton in 1998, said that doing the same for Obama was \u2018debatable.\u2019 \u2018I think it\u2019s debatable.

For those that say impeach him for breaking the laws or bypassing the laws \u2014 could that pass in the House? It probably could. Is the majority of the American people in favor of impeaching the president? I\u2019m not sure.'\u201d [Politico, 6/17/14]\n\nYeah. It\u2019s not off the table.
