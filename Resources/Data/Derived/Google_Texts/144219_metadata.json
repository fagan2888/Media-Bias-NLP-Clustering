It was not running HealthCare.gov, but was instead used by programmers to test new code before it goes live.\n\nThe test server was not supposed to be connected to the Internet, but somehow was. In addition, access to it was protected by a default password installed by the manufacturer, said Albright, who declined to say if that default was 1-2-3-4-5 or something equally breachable.\n\nCybersecurity expert David Kennedy, chief executive of the information security firm TrustedSec LLC, said he was unconvinced this was the first successful hack on HealthCare.gov.\n\n\"There are fundamental flaws in how they're coding the website and it's going to take a long, long time to fix it,\" he told Reuters. \"It continues to be a really big glaring security hole.\"\n\nIt is rare for hackers to upload malware without following through to use it, he added.\n\n(Reporting by Sharon Begley, Doina Chiacu and Alina Selyukh; Editing by Dan Grebler and
