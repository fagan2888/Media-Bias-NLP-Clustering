It does not happen with selfish agendas.\u201d\n\nNevada will send 30 delegates to the national convention in Cleveland in July based on the state\u2019s Feb. 23 caucuses. Trump had already locked up 14 delegate votes, but his opponents subsequently ended their campaigns and released their delegates to vote for whomever they please \u2014 seven who had been dedicated to Marco Rubio, six for Ted Cruz, two for Ben Carson and one for John Kasich.\n\nNevada GOP National Committeewoman Diana Orrock of Clark County, who endorsed Trump last fall, was re-elected with 792 votes. Elko County GOP chairman Lee Hoffman won the race for national committeeman with 531 votes. He admitted he didn\u2019t initially support the former reality TV star but says he now is firmly on the Trump train.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I liked Scott Walker, then Ben Carson, then Ted Cruz,\u201d said Hoffman, who was appointed by the state GOP executive committee to fill the open national committeeman slot on an interim basis in 2014.\n\n\u201cMy current favorite is anybody but Hillary,\u201d Hoffman said to cheers. \u201cWhile Mr. Trump was not my first choice, he is going to be our nominee, and I support him 101 percent.\u201d\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Sandoval announced his support for Kasich after the Nevada caucuses and initially withheld his support for Trump before recently concluding he would support him so as to keep Clinton out of the White House. But U.S. Sen. Dean Heller is among other prominent Republicans who have suggested they may cast their vote for \u201cnone of the above.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign issued a slate of preferred delegates to elect to the national convention and, during a series of votes on convention rules, held up a green \u201cYes\u201d sign or a red \u201cNo\u201d sign to signal which way Trump backers should vote.\n\nTheir side won all of those votes, including refusing to seat two Washoe County Republicans \u2014 State Assemblyman Ira Hansen and County Commissioner Jeanne Herman \u2014 who state party officials said were handing out their own slate of candidates that suggested Trump was supporting them.\n\nThe majority also voted the way the Trump crew preferred in agreeing to place limits on the size of their party platform so as to appeal to a broader base of voters in November.\n\nWashoe County delegate Tom Dickman proposed striking the rules that were intended to streamline the platform by keeping some of the more controversial issues at bay.\n\n\u201cOur country is in bad shape. We all have a lot of concerns. Limiting the platform is a bad idea,\u201d Dickman said.\n\nBut fellow Washoe County delegate Mark Deeter disagreed.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to reach out to a lot of independents,\u201d Deeter said. \u201cEvery time you add something to the list, it\u2019s really a limitation. We should be really general and precise and to the point. That\u2019s the bottom line to winning the White House.\u201d\n\nThe platform presented to the delegates for a vote as the convention ran into the evening was similar to those approved in the past, including support for repealing the Affordable Care Act, defending the Second Amendment\u2019s right to bear arms as a \u201cGod given right,\u201d and affirming the \u201csanctity of life\u201d beginning at conception while opposing government funding of organizations that advocate for, or provide, abortions.\n\nIt also opposes amnesty for those who enter the U.S. illegally, opposes same-day voter registration and supports requiring proof of citizenship and a valid photo ID when voting, and urges the federal government to transfer all U.S. property in Nevada to the state unless federal use of the land is constitutionally authorized.", "article_metadata": {"description": "RENO, Nev. \u2014 Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald urged delegates at the state GOP convention Saturday to put their fractured past behind them and unite behind Donald Trump\u2019s", "og": {"url": "http://www.NevadaAppeal.com/news/22015945-113/nevada-gop-leaders-urge-unity-at-state-convention", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.NevadaAppeal.com/csp/mediapool/sites/NevadaAppeal/assets/img/facebook-thumbnail-1200.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Nevada Appeal", "description": "RENO, Nev. \u2014 Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald urged delegates at the state GOP convention Saturday to put their fractured past behind them and unite behind Donald Trump\u2019s", "title": "Nevada GOP leaders urge unity at state convention | NevadaAppeal.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NevadaAppeal", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 555484641151578}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 22015945}}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Free", "keywords": "TRUMP, CONVENTION, STATE, NEVADA, DELEGATES, GOP, COUNTY, NATIONAL, SUPPORT, VOTES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But with the majority of the 1,086 state delegates chanting \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump,\u201d they carried a series of key early votes at the state convention in Reno on Saturday where the single most popular theme was \u201canyone but\u201d Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\nNevada GOP National Committeewoman Diana Orrock of Clark County, who endorsed Trump last fall, was re-elected with 792 votes.\nRENO, Nev. \u2014 Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald urged delegates at the state GOP convention Saturday to put their fractured past behind them and unite behind Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\nIt does not happen with selfish agendas.\u201dNevada will send 30 delegates to the national convention in Cleveland in July based on the state\u2019s Feb. 23 caucuses.\nTrump backers feared some who opposed the billionaire when he won Nevada\u2019s caucuses in February would try to deny him all his delegates to the national convention."}
