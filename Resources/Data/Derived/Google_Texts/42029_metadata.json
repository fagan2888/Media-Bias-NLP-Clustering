Circuit.\n\nThe Chamber is the latest group to challenge the FCC\u2019s move. ACA International, which represents creditors and collection agencies, filed its own legal challenge a few months back.\n\nThe FCC proposal, approved in a 3-2 vote, would broaden the definition of autodialers, which can churn through numerous telephone numbers at the same time but are banned from calling mobile phones.\n\nThe ruling also makes it easier for people to revoke consent to be robocalled and prevents companies from making more than one robocall to a phone number that has recently switched hands.\n\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler framed the move as a win for consumers that keeps the commission's rules up to date with changing technology.\n\nThe Chamber is challenging all of those new interpretations. It said the expanded definition of an autodialer could cover even a \u201cmass-market smartphone,\u201d a criticism that GOP members of the commission have made before.\n\nThere are a number of apps that can turn a smartphone into an autodialer, but Wheeler has said flat out that a standard smartphone is not considered an autodialer under the new regime. He said the commission is not focused on the hardware as much as the impact, noting autodialer technology has changed since the TCPA was passed.\n\nThe Chamber also alleged that the new rule allowing consumers to more easily opt out of being called are largely unworkable. And the limits on calling a number that has been reassigned opens business up to litigation for \u201csimply attempting in good faith to communicate with customers who previously provided valid consent to be contacted,\u201d according to the Chamber.\n\n\u201cThe Declaratory Ruling and Order is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, in excess of the commission\u2019s statutory authority, and otherwise contrary to the Constitution and other laws,\u201d the Chamber wrote.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The FCC passed new robocall restrictions in June.", "description": "The FCC passed new robocall restrictions in June.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The FCC passed new robocall restrictions in June.", "title": "Chamber of Commerce challenges FCC\u2019s robocall ruling", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/252666-chamber-of-commerce-challenges-fccs-robocall-ruling", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/wheelertom_020615getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/252666-chamber-of-commerce-challenges-fccs-robocall-ruling", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-03T12:29-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Chamber of Commerce, Federal Communications Commision, robocalls, Robocall,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-03T12:29:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/252666-chamber-of-commerce-challenges-fccs-robocall-ruling", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The FCC passed new robocall restrictions in June.", "card": "summary", "title": "Chamber of Commerce challenges FCC\u2019s robocall ruling"}, "dcterms.title": "Chamber of Commerce challenges FCC\u2019s robocall ruling"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf25a\"", "article_summary": "The massive trade group said the FCC\u2019s ruling was filled with \u201coverbroad and atextual interpretations\u201d of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), which governs the FCC\u2019s authority to police robocalls.\nThe Chamber of Commerce is suing to strike down the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s new robocall restrictions approved in June.\nThe Chamber is the latest group to challenge the FCC\u2019s move.\n\u201cThe Declaratory Ruling and Order is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, in excess of the commission\u2019s statutory authority, and otherwise contrary to the Constitution and other laws,\u201d the Chamber wrote.\nThe Chamber also alleged that the new rule allowing consumers to more easily opt out of being called are largely unworkable."}
