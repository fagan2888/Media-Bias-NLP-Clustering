Follow along here.\n\nEarlier this morning, Natoma Canfield \u2014 a cancer survivor from Ohio \u2014 sent the following message to the White House email list, sharing what happened when she wrote the President a letter encouraging him to \"stay focused\" in his efforts to reform America's health care system.\n\nDidn't get the email? Sign up for email updates here.\n\nIn December of 2009, I was a 50-year-old divorced woman, self-employed, and struggling to support myself and pay for my health insurance.\n\nBut in 1995, I'd had a very small bout with breast cancer \u2014 carcinoma in situ \u2014 which meant the insurance companies would forever see me as a woman with cancer. And that meant I had to pay more for my insurance.\n\nMy rates kept going up until I couldn't pay for my insurance any longer. I sure tried \u2014 I cut back everything, but nothing made a difference. I had to cancel.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, desperate to let someone know my plight, I wrote President Obama a letter straight from my heart. I shared my story with him and told him how much people like me needed his help. And he actually read it!\n\nThe original letter from Natoma Canfield, hanging on the wall in the hall between the Oval Office and the President's Private Office in the West Wing.

In March of 2010, I passed out at work, and found out soon after that I had a rare type of leukemia \u2014 acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome, to be specific.\n\nI went to the Cleveland Clinic and was placed in a great program on their leukemia floor, where I would fight for my life. While I was there, my sister Connie Anderson was asked to introduce the President at an event in Strongsville, Ohio.\n\nThen one day, the President sent me a note, then another \u2014 and even called me on the phone. I couldn't believe it. Connie and my brother Ken were able to go to the signing of the Affordable Care Act, and later I finally got to meet the President myself in Parma, Ohio.\n\nI really believe all of the excitement helped keep me alive. And today, I'm happy to say that I'm cancer-free.\n\nOf course, I can't begin to thank the President enough for the Affordable Care Act. During the fight to pass the law, he said that he carried my story with him every day, as a reminder of what the Act would mean for people all across our country. He later decided to frame the letter, which is now hanging up outside the Oval Office.\n\nAs the President has said, \"because of this law, there are other Americans \u2014 other sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers \u2014 who will not have to hang their fortunes on chance. These are the Americans for whom we passed this law.\"\n\nI'm so grateful to have a President who truly cares about the people that he serves.\n\nNatoma Canfield\n\nMedina, Ohio\n\nTo see some more of the letters that people across America have written to President Obama, follow our \"Letters to President Obama\" Tumblr account here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/browserconfig.xml", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "application-name": "Whitehouse", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"title": "My Letter to the President:", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/08/20/my-letter-president", "image": {"src": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/natoma_letter-1.jpg", "height": 347, "width": 520}, "creator": "@WhiteHouse", "site": "@WhiteHouse", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#003C80", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "whitehouse.gov", "description": "Natoma Canfield, a cancer survivor from Ohio, shares what happened after she wrote the President and encouraged him to \"stay focused\" in his health care reform efforts.", "title": "My Letter to the President:", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/08/20/my-letter-president", "image": {"width": 520, "secure_url": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/natoma_letter-1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/natoma_letter-1.jpg", "height": 347}, "updated_time": "2015-08-26T14:46:21-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-20T11:30:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-26T14:46:21-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/profiles/forall/themes/custom/fortyfour/images/fortyfour/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Natoma CanfieldMedina, OhioTo see some more of the letters that people across America have written to President Obama, follow our \"Letters to President Obama\" Tumblr account here.\nIn a last-ditch effort, desperate to let someone know my plight, I wrote President Obama a letter straight from my heart.\nToday, the White House is launching a new Tumblr account called \"Letters to President Obama,\" where we'll highlight letters that Americans have written to the President.\nEarlier this morning, Natoma Canfield \u2014 a cancer survivor from Ohio \u2014 sent the following message to the White House email list, sharing what happened when she wrote the President a letter encouraging him to \"stay focused\" in his efforts to reform America's health care system.\nWhile I was there, my sister Connie Anderson was asked to introduce the President at an event in Strongsville, Ohio."}
