Bush, and is currently exemplified in the current entitled scion, Jeb. It's a terrible, undemocratic idea:\n\nWalker is best-known for fighting Democrats, labor unions and liberal activists in Wisconsin, where he is the purple state's polarizing governor. Many Democrats feel like Walker has bulldozed over them and ignored their concerns in pushing his conservative agenda. Many Democratic lawmakers in Madison are so angered by the governor that they have difficulty making it through a budget hearing, press conference or even a casual coffee without launching into a frustrated tirade about everything he has done wrong in their state. Walker's announcement immediately prompted criticism from prominent Democrats, something he has bragged about on the campaign trail.\n\nSo here's how Walker answered that town hall question: \"As I talk to people across this country \u2014 not just the Republican caucus voters and primary voters but to people in general \u2014 what people are frustrated with more so than that, I think it's elevated higher, is they're frustrated particularly with Washington not being able to get anything done.\"\n\nWalker said his secret to winning three elections in four years, including a controversial recall election, is that he not only carried nearly all Republicans, but he also won over independent voters. Elsewhere, Walker has also said that he won over some \"discerning Democrats.\"\n\n\"What I think people are hungry for from their leaders in Washington \u2014 or the lack of leadership in Washington \u2014 is they want people who just tell them what they're going to do and then they go off and do it,\" Walker said.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Scott Walker: End the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Just do it.", "title": "Scott Walker: End the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/scott-walker-end-the-permanent-bipartisan-fusion-party/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/07/walker.jpg", "updated_time": 1464260343, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just do it.", "title": "Scott Walker: End the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/scott-walker-end-the-permanent-bipartisan-fusion-party/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/07/walker.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Scott Walker: End the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "Scott Walker: End the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd798\"", "article_summary": "Many Democrats feel like Walker has bulldozed over them and ignored their concerns in pushing his conservative agenda.\nElsewhere, Walker has also said that he won over some \"discerning Democrats.\"\nIt's a terrible, undemocratic idea:Walker is best-known for fighting Democrats, labor unions and liberal activists in Wisconsin, where he is the purple state's polarizing governor.\nWalker's announcement immediately prompted criticism from prominent Democrats, something he has bragged about on the campaign trail.\nWalker said his secret to winning three elections in four years, including a controversial recall election, is that he not only carried nearly all Republicans, but he also won over independent voters."}
