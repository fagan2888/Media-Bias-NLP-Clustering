The health-care law requires medical providers to switch over to a more digitized system and provides incentives to do so.\n\nAccording to a Monday report from Politico, however, top physicians including the pro-Obamacare American Medical Association are asking the Obama administration to back off due to inefficiency in the new system and little proof of savings or improvements.\n\nWhile health-care technology may improve, Obamacare may be unlikely to help other key triggers of the U.S.\u2019s low ranking.\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. spent the most per capita on health care at $8,508 (the best is the U.K.\u2019s government-run health-care system at $3,405 per person). It\u2019s not surprising, then, that the survey ranked the U.S. lowest in \u201cequity\u201d \u2014 equal health care for the rich and the poor. Putting aside price controls in many of the ranked countries that have led to drug shortages, it\u2019s likely Obamacare will worsen both of these problems.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act drastically expands Medicaid and provides premium subsidies for some low-income Americans, increasing health coverage, as the Commonwealth Fund notes, but boosted health costs are likely to prevent low-income Americans from getting health-care services, even if they have coverage.\n\nObamacare is increasing both monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, for those in and out of Obamacare exchanges.\n\nWith higher deductibles and co-pays, low-income Americans may be less likely to seek medical care at additional cost than those with higher income, worsening any problems with health-care equity.

In the post-Obamacare health-care system, U.S. insurers are now trying to rid Americans of their pesky \u201cchoice habit.\u201d The health-care law moved Americans toward narrower medical networks, limiting provider preferences for many Obamacare exchange customers, and experts are warning that the shift will soon permeate the private insurance market as well.

However, the U.S. also has some of the best access to specialized medical care.\n\nAccording to the survey, Americans have the third-lowest wait time to see a specialist and are second only to Sweden for the time it takes to receive treatment after a diagnosis.\n\nIn the past, vast expansions of Medicaid patients have lead to higher rates of ER usage for common ailments that should be treated by a primary care physician or similar doctor. Emergency rooms have already seen a boost in volume since Obamacare coverage went into action, and physicians fear that it will lead to a lower quality of care.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "A new study from a pro-Obamacare nonprofit finds that before the health care law, the U.S. health care system ranked last amongst 11 developed nations, but the", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A new study from a pro-Obamacare nonprofit finds that before the health-care law, the U.S. health-care system ranked last among 11 developed nations, but the health-care law may not help fix the probl", "title": "US Health-Care System Ranked Last In Survey, But Will Obamacare Help?", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/16/us-health-care-system-ranked-last-in-survey-but-will-obamacare-help/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/doctor.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health-care law could worsen weak spots", "title": "US Health-Care System Ranked Last In Survey, But Will Obamacare Help?
