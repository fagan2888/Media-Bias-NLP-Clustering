Orlando-based software company PlanSource has launched a new online health insurance exchange for small or medium-sized California employers.

Called True Choice Private Marketplace, the exchange was formed through a partnership with insurance brokers The Centennial, Bolton & Company and Sequoia.

PlanSource has about 100 employees here and has been hiring after raising $12 million in venture capital for expansion this year. The company specializes in software platforms for health insurance administration.

The company has been designing private health insurance exchanges following the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.

According to PlanSource, the exchange is designed to help employers give employees more choices of benefits plans, simplify the enrollment process and control healthcare spending.
