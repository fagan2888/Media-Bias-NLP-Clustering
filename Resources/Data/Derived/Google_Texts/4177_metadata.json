John Cortes, D-Kissimmee, spoke before a House Health Innovation Subcommittee in support of bill HB19. It would allow dental services to be taken off the list of services that managed care plans are required to offer Medicaid recipients. The bill passed 12-1, which allows vendors like MCNA Dental, a Fort Lauderdale dental benefits company, to provide the care instead.\n\nRelated Content HealthZette The End of \u2018Drill and Fill\u2019 Dentistry? Best reasons yet to get yourself that checkup you know you need\n\nMCNA lost all its Medicaid contracts in Florida in 2011 after mandatory managed care was put in place.\n\nHowever, according to a 2015 Stanford University study in conjunction with the University of California,San Francisco, Truven Health Analytics and the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Equality, more than 2 percent of all emergency department visits are now related to nontraumatic dental conditions. The researchers are calling for expanded dental benefits under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"It is likely that EDs (emergency departments) will continue to provide care to individuals without adequate access to community-based dental care unless new dental service delivery models are developed to expand access in underserved areas, and unless more dental providers begin to accept Medicaid under the ACA,\" the researchers wrote in their study, published in Health Affairs.\n\nTop Reasons for Dodging the Dentist Cost\n\nDental anxiety\n\nFear of needing dental work\n\nFear of dental instruments\n\nBad memories\n\nToo busy or lazy\n\nFear of a lecture Source: http://www.Everydayhealth.com\n\n\"Anyone can die of a toothache,\" Cortes said dramatically during the committee meeting, according to the Tampa Bay Times. \"Believe it or not, you can.\"\n\nCan you really die of a toothache?\n\n\"Yes, it is possible to die from complications of an infected tooth,\" Thomas Porter, who is on the faculty of the University of Florida College of Dentistry, told the Times.\n\n\"Every year there are cases where the patient did not receive appropriate and timely treatment of an infected tooth. In most cases, the infected tooth starts as a localized site with pain and infection.\"\n\nCases in point: John Schneider of Mount Orab, Ohio, died in 2014 after what he thought was just a sinus infection turned out to be an infected tooth. The infection soon entered his bloodstream, causing sepsis, and he died.\n\n\"We asked him to go to the doctor and he wouldn\u2019t go. He was like, \u2018I\u2019m OK, I\u2019m OK, I don\u2019t have any money,\" his mother, Aloha Schneider, told wlwt.com. Schneider was just 31.\n\n\"A lot of dental problems don\u2019t hurt until they get to the point where the only solution is treatment,\" Casamassimo says. \"That keeps many patients away; they don\u2019t know they have a problem.\"\n\nPercentage of Population with a Dental Visit in the Past Year Ages 2-17: 83.0%\n\nAges 18-64: 61.7%\n\nAges 65 and over: 60.6% Source: CDC 2013\n\nThe CDC\u2019s latest data from 2013 shows that as we age, dental visits drop.\n\n\"General health is also at risk, too, as studies continue to associate poor oral health with diabetes, heart disease, strokes, pneumonia, premature babies and other major conditions,\" nationalsmilemonth.org shares on its website. \"With a good oral health routine, most of these conditions are preventable.\"\n\nAnd care must start early.\n\n\"Fifty years ago, the thinking was to get kids to the dentist by school age,\" said Casamassimo. \"A lot has changed since then. From data, we realized that a lot of kids had tooth decay, and by 4 or 5 years of age, half of the kids in the country had tooth decay. Now, we want to see them at age 1.\"\n\nTo avoid all dental problems, including those that may be deadly, see your dentist every six months, and be alert to any pain or changes in your mouth or your teeth.\n\nAnd never let finances stop you from obtaining care if you think you might have a problem.\n\n\"Most practitioners have a heart. If they see if you're in trouble, they will give you antibiotics, get you to the hospital so that you can avert these things,\" Cincinnati oral surgeon Dr. Richard Kruer told wlwt.com after Schneider\u2019s passing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Dentist appointment.\" Those two innocent little words tend to send tremors of dread through a hefty portion of Americans. \"I take great care of my health", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LifeZette", "description": "\u201cDentist appointment.\u201d Those two innocent little words tend to send tremors of dread through a hefty portion of Americans. \u201cI take great care of my health but religiously put off my dentist appointment \u2013 I cancel every one until I get my nerve up,\u201d one 30-something Boston resident told LifeZette. \u201cSo I actually see the dentist probably about every eight\u00a0months, instead of every six.\u201d This is not uncommon.
