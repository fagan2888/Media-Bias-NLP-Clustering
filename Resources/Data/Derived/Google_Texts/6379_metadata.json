In the eighth grade, she was so sick that she had to attend her graduation with a feeding tube taped under her nose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that takes over not just your body but your mind,\u201d Rosie said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t focus on school work because I was too busy counting calories.\u201d\n\nThe reason the insurance company denied Rosie: her condition was not severe enough to warrant 24-hour treatment.\n\n\u201cWe spend our whole lives working and paying into that stuff, paying the premiums,\u201d Naunheim said. \u201cI deserve to be able to use that money to save my daughter.\u201d\n\nAfter pleas from the family and Rosie\u2019s doctor, the insurance company relented, and Rosie spent six months in a local treatment facility. She\u2019s now 16, lives at home and attends regular classes at school, but says that she\u2019s still recovering mentally.\n\nOne bill awaiting the governor\u2019s signature at the Missouri Statehouse would add an extra layer of protection for families like the Naunheims: SB 145.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act already requires insurance companies to cover treatment for eating disorders under a mental health parity law, but some patients reported they are still denied coverage because their Body Mass Index measurements were above a predetermined level.\n\n\u201cIt happens, unfortunately, quite often,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Gerfen, a psychologist at the St. Louis Behavioral Medicine Institute. \"Patients who are still engaging in disordered eating behaviors such as binging or purging may no longer meet the weight qualification, and have to leave treatment before they are ready,\" she said. Relapses can be common.\n\n\u201cIt can certainly impede their recovery,\u201d Gerfen said.\n\nThe Missouri law, SB 145, specifies that insurance companies cannot deny care based on a patient\u2019s weight. Among major insurance companies doing business in Missouri, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield includes \u201cthe adult\u2019s weight is less than 85% of estimated healthy weight\u201d as one criteria for covering residential treatment of anorexia, but other criteria can also be met.\n\nPaid out-of-pocket, treatment for an eating disorder can cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nA fiscal note estimates that SB 145 will cost the state less than $12,500 a year to comply with the rule. Each year, Missouri\u2019s Medicaid program covers about 800 people who have eating disorders.\n\nThe measure was first introduced seven years ago by former state Rep. Rick Stream, R-Kirkwood, whose daughter Katie died in 1995 after a long struggle with an eating disorder.\n\nThe new legislation would require insurance companies to make any necessary changes to health plans before coverage begins for the year 2017.\n\nGov. Jay Nixon has until July to sign the bill into law.\n\nInform our coverage\n\nThis report contains information gathered with the help of our Public Insight Network.
