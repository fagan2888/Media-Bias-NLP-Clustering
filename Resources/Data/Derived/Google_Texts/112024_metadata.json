The troops' faces are all covered, possibly due to military regulations prohibiting certain political activities by uniformed service members.\n\nOne photo, for example, shows an Army sergeant in fatigues with a sign telling Obama he will not deploy \"to fight for your Al-Qaeda rebels in Syria.\" That picture has been liked and shared over 2,200 times.\n\nAnother photo shows a Marine sergeant in dress blues holding a sign saying he did not join the Corps to \"fight for Al Qaeda in a Syrian civil war.\"\n\nAccording to The Blaze, the Uniform Code of Military Justice says officers and NCOs could face court martial for such actions.\n\nArticle 88, for example, says:\n\nAny commissioned officer who uses contemptuous words against the President, the Vice President, Congress, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department, the Secretary of Transportation, or the Governor or legislature of any State, Territory, Commonwealth, or possession in which he is on duty or present shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\n\nArticle 92 says those who fail to obey a lawful order can be punished as \"a court-martial may direct.\"\n\nAccording to The Blaze, the photos have appeared all over the Internet, and have received thousands of \"likes\" on Facebook.\n\nOn Friday, ABC News said that 50 percent say the U.S. should not strike Syria, but 50 percent said they would support a strike if it was \"limited to airstrikes using cruise missiles launched from U.S. naval ships that were meant to destroy military units and infrastructure that have been used to carry out chemical attacks.\"\n\nRelated:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you like this article, you can follow Joe on Twitter @jnewby1956, visit and like his Facebook page, or subscribe to receive email updates when a new article is published.\n\nFor hard-hitting conservative commentary, please visit Joe's blog, the Conservative Firing Line.
