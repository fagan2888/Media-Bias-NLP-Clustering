A four-day gig last December included a New Year\u2019s Eve show at a Pennsylvania casino-resort in which he showcased young comedians.\n\nBrenner, who was raised in working-class south Philadelphia and graduated with honors from Temple University, was \u201calways there helping a bright young comedian, whether it be Richard Lewis, Freddie Prinze or Jimmie Walker, and he was still doing it until the very end,\u201d said his friend and publicist, Jeff Abraham.\n\nIn a statement, Walker called Brenner \u201ca true comic genius\u201d who was \u201cmy mentor and taught me about life and comedy.\u201d\n\nThe lanky, toothy-grinned Brenner\u2019s brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups, including Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Reiser.\n\n\u201cDavid Brenner was a huge star when I met him and he took me under his wing. To me, historically, he was the godfather of hip, observational comedy,\u201d comedian Richard Lewis said in a statement. \u201cHe mentored me from day one. \u2026 His passing leaves a hole in my life that can never be replaced.\u201d\n\nBrenner took a brief stab at upping his TV fame with the 1976 sitcom \u201cSnip\u201d and the talk show \u201cNightlife\u201d he hosted in 1987. But he didn\u2019t achieve the success of Seinfeld\u2019s self-titled NBC sitcom or Reiser\u2019s \u201cMad About You,\u201d and he saw Jay Leno follow Carson as \u201cTonight\u201d host.\n\nBrenner\u2019s take on his career, as he described it in a 2000 interview with The Associated Press, was that he put family before stardom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Brenner, frequent \u2018Tonight\u2019 guest, dies", "title": "David Brenner, frequent \u2018Tonight\u2019 guest, dies", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "David Brenner, frequent \u2018Tonight\u2019 guest, dies", "title": "David Brenner, frequent \u2018Tonight\u2019 guest, dies", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/16/david_brenner_frequent_tonight_guest_dies/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/obit-david-brenner.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "David Brenner, frequent \u2018Tonight\u2019 guest, dies", "title": "David Brenner, frequent \u2018Tonight\u2019 guest, dies", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/obit-david-brenner.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynn Elber", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd534\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDavid Brenner was a huge star when I met him and he took me under his wing.\nBut he didn\u2019t achieve the success of Seinfeld\u2019s self-titled NBC sitcom or Reiser\u2019s \u201cMad About You,\u201d and he saw Jay Leno follow Carson as \u201cTonight\u201d host.\n\u201cI like to sit back, smoke a cigarette and laugh for six minutes,\u201d Brenner, in a 2013 interview with CBS, recalled him saying.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Other veteran comics could head straight to \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d couch to banter with Johnny Carson, but David Brenner had to do a stand-up routine when he was a guest.\nThe lanky, always sharply dressed Brenner also briefly hosted his own syndicated talk show in 1987 and starred in four HBO specials."}
