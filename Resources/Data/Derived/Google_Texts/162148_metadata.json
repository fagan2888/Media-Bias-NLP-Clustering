Sadly, the injury is more common than you may want to believe and a simple Google search of the phrase will leave you with an uncomfortable large amount of examples. In history, there has only ever been one case of a penis transplant, but one man, known only as \u201cPenisindoor\u201d is hoping to soon change that number to two.\n\nLike A Scene Out Of Game Of Thrones\n\nPenisindoor\u2019s odd moniker comes from the tragic accident that initially cost the man his most beloved organ. According to Jezebel, in his youth, Penisindoor stuck his fully erect member through a partially opened door. A friend accidentally slammed the door shut, severing the man\u2019s reproductive organ and creating, as Penisindoor put it, \u201ca scene out of the Game of Thrones.\u201d Now in his early 30s, Penisindoor is currently waiting to become the second-ever recipient of a penis transplant.\n\nThe \u201cafter\u201d images of Penisindoor\u2019s gruesome ordeal are quite eye-opening. I must warn you the photos are extremely graphic, but if you absolutely need to know know what a man without a penis looks like, you can find them by visiting the link below:\n\nAccording to Penisindoor\u2019s reddit responses, he is able to urinate, explaining that \u201cI have a hole on the underside of my balls. I sit to pee.\u201d Penisindoor is also able to achieve sexual satisfaction, writing that he can masturbate, \u201cjust differently.\u201d The horrific injury not only didn\u2019t hinder Penisindoor\u2019s ability to snag a girlfriend, but the two are even able to share some level of intimacy. \u201cAny loving couple can be intimate. \u2026 She knew me since we were little, so she knew all along,\u201d Penisindoor explained. Also, because the base of the penis remained intact, Penisindoor can still achieve an orgasm ejaculating out of his re-routed urethra opening underneath his testicles.\n\nFirst Penis Transplant Didn't End So Well\n\nThe first penis surgery was carried out by a team of Chinese surgeons on a 44-year-old man, who, like Penisindoor, lost his own penis in an unfortunate accident. According to NBC News, the 15-hour surgery is similar to that of hand and face transplants. The actual procedure, though dangerous, is not very complex. Regaining functional recovery was described as being the \u201cmain hurdle\u201d of the operation.\n\nThe transplant also requires a lifetime of immune-suppressing drugs to prevent rejection of the new organ. In the case of the first penis transplant, the problem didn\u2019t so much lie in the body\u2019s rejection of the penis as it did the recipient\u2019s wife\u2019s rejection. After only two weeks of having the new organ, the man requested that it be removed because of \u201cthe wife\u2019s psychological rejection as well as the swollen shape of the transplanted penis,\u201d NBC News reported.\n\nPenisindoor\u2019s positive outlook on his circumstances is admirable, as is his hope for the surgery\u2019s success. The donated penis will come from a deceased organ donor whose genetic makeup closely matches the recipient's, but there\u2019s no telling how long it will take before a suitable match is found. Still, the details of his potential new organ don\u2019t seem to bother the optimistic Penisindoor, who left the following analogy to help others better understand his perspective of the whole situation: \u201cIf you were about to sign a check over to yourself for several million dollars, would it matter what pen you used? Or that you just had a pen to seal the deal?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "after, losing, his, penis, accident, one, man, hopes, be, second, ever, recipient, penile", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After losing his penis in a horrific childhood accident, one man describes what it's like to grow up without the important organ, and his hopes of becoming the second-ever patient to undergo a penis transplant.", "title": "Man With No Penis Hopes To Undergo 2nd-Ever Penile Transplant [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/after-losing-his-penis-accident-one-man-hopes-be-second-ever-recipient-penile-transplant-298772", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/19/penis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After losing his penis in a horrific childhood accident, one man describes what it's like to grow up without the important organ, and his hopes of becoming the second-ever patient to undergo a penis transplant.", "title": "Man With No Penis Hopes To Undergo 2nd-Ever Penile Transplant [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/after-losing-his-penis-accident-one-man-hopes-be-second-ever-recipient-penile-transplant-298772", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/19/penis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/19/penis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-19T17:25:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-19T17:25:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After losing his penis in a horrific childhood accident, one man describes what it's like to grow up without the important organ, and his hopes of becoming the second-ever patient to undergo a penis transplant."}, "article_summary": "First Penis Transplant Didn't End So WellThe first penis surgery was carried out by a team of Chinese surgeons on a 44-year-old man, who, like Penisindoor, lost his own penis in an unfortunate accident.\nIn the case of the first penis transplant, the problem didn\u2019t so much lie in the body\u2019s rejection of the penis as it did the recipient\u2019s wife\u2019s rejection.\nIn history, there has only ever been one case of a penis transplant, but one man, known only as \u201cPenisindoor\u201d is hoping to soon change that number to two.\nThe thought of losing one\u2019s penis is an idea capable of bringing any man to his knees.\nLike A Scene Out Of Game Of ThronesPenisindoor\u2019s odd moniker comes from the tragic accident that initially cost the man his most beloved organ."}
