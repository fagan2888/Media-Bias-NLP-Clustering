He fidgeted with the buttons on his oversized suit like a nervous bar mitzvah boy and, in refreshing contrast to comedy frat-boy predecessor Craig Kilborn, charmed viewers with a particular Woody Allen-ish brand of self-deprecating humor.\n\nNow, after nearly two decades on the satirical-news program, Jon Stewart prepares to sign off one last time.\n\nFor the next three weeks, leading up to \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host\u2019s August 6 departure, Salon will be taking a look back at some of Stewart\u2019s most memorable moments spanning his 16 years and five months.\n\nToday, we look back at \u201cLook Who\u2019s Talking\u201d from May 2005:\n\nIt\u2019s a wonder that Stewart had a writing staff back in 2005; with George W. Bush at the helm of the country, all the \u201cDaily Show\u201d host had to do was roll a clip of any of the Gaffe King\u2019s public appearances and let the jokes write themselves. In the segment \u201cLook Who\u2019s Talking,\u201d Stewart examined the president\u2019s profoundly uncomfortable prime-time press conference, the fourth he\u2019d done since the start the of his term as president. In it, Bush chose to address two major topics: energy and social security. He closed out the speech with history\u2019s most morbid mic drop.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bush delivered stand-up comedy and a prime-time press conference in one week.
