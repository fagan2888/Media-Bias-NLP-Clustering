Shelter yourself in a closet that's quiet, dark, to get out of the path of a shooter,\" Light said.\n\nCathleen Bennett, acting health commissioner in New Jersey, said medical centers have special challenges as administrators prepare. Emergency departments, in particular, face higher risks.\n\n\"That seems to be a location where emotions run high and behavior can be unpredictable,\" she said. \"Hospitals have infectious diseases in them, they have equipment like MRI, with large magnets, which can impact what's going on if you have an active shooter situation.\"\n\nNew Jersey has a law \u2014 the Violence in Health Care Facilities Act of 2008 \u2014 requiring hospitals to create a violence prevention program.\n\nMedical centers \u2014 whether large or small, urban or suburban \u2014 prepare the same way, because you can't predict where the next incident will happen, said Mark Ross, the southeastern Pennsylvania emergency preparedness manager with the Hospital and HealthSystem Association of Pennsylvania.\n\nDifferent from a shopping mall or school, Bennett said, hospital planning is especially important because medical centers must protect vulnerable patient populations including those in intensive care.\n\nRoss said in a \"no-notice\" mass casualty event \u2014 such as the Amtrak train derailment in Philadelphia \u2014 a hospital is sometimes locked down to make sure health workers have the space to care for patients without being overwhelmed by media or the curious.\n\nA lockdown is also a way to protect the staffers from becoming secondary targets. In attacks overseas, Ross said, terrorists have tried to do more damage after an initial attack\n\nIn Southeast Pennsylvania, a coalition of organizations plans together. Emergency planners had more time to get ready for Hurricane Irene and the papal visit, and those kinds of events serve as \"practice\" for higher stakes incidents.\n\nAlan Butler directs health care security operations for HSS, a company that provides security services and planning help to health care facilities in several states.\n\nHe urges his clients to train for the unexpected. But every not department of a medical center has the same needs. The level of preparation \u2014 and the frequency of drills \u2014 may be different for emergency room staffers compared with workers in other parts of a medical facility.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As we learn more about the mass shooting at a state run facility in San Bernardino California medical centers in our region say they are prepared for the unexpected When there s a gunman nearby", "title": "Preparing for the unimaginable \u2014 and its aftermath", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "As we learn more about the mass shooting at a state-run facility in San Bernardino California, medical centers in our region say they are prepared for the unexpected."}, "twitter": {"description": "As we learn more about the mass shooting at a state-run facility in San Bernardino California, medical centers in our region say they are prepared for the unexpected.", "title": "Preparing for the unimaginable \u2014 and its aftermath", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_apactiveshootertrainingx1200.jpg", "creator": "@taunyaenglish", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-04", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/healthscience/88793-preparing-for-the-unimaginable-and-its-aftermath", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "author": "Taunya English", "keywords": "medical, emergency, health, shooter, hospital, centers, pennsylvania, jersey, preparedness, bennett, large, protect, planning, those, train, security, staffers, workers, different, because", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_apactiveshootertrainingx1200.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b9f\"", "article_summary": "Alan Butler directs health care security operations for HSS, a company that provides security services and planning help to health care facilities in several states.\nNew Jersey has a law \u2014 the Violence in Health Care Facilities Act of 2008 \u2014 requiring hospitals to create a violence prevention program.\nAs we learn more about the mass shooting at a state-run facility in San Bernardino California, medical centers in our region say they are prepared for the unexpected.\nCathleen Bennett, acting health commissioner in New Jersey, said medical centers have special challenges as administrators prepare.\nIf possible, fleeing the scene is the first, best choice, said Wesley Light, who manages emergency preparedness at Temple University Hospital."}
