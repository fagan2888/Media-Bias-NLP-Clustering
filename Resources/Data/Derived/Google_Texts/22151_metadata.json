With a backup succession plan in place, the board called upon LVHN's chief strategy officer, Dr. Brian Nester, who has been with the network since 1998.\n\nNester, a Reading native, will assume the role of acting president and CEO on July 1, and he is one of the candidates for the permanent job to lead a network that has more than 12,000 employees and four hospitals and 11 health care centers throughout the Greater Lehigh Valley.\n\nBesides adapting to changes caused by the Affordable Care Act and the ever-changing health care landscape, LVHN is developing a working relationship with six other health networks as part of AllSpire Health Partners. The consortium was formed last year to provide cost-effective and efficient health care.\n\nLVHN has launched a national search for a permanent president and CEO, which may also include other internal candidates besides Nester. But in being named acting president and CEO, Nester was empowered by LVHN's board to make decisions, and not just be a caretaker.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Lehigh Valley Business, the 52-year-old Nester talked about the transition at LVHN, health care challenges and his background and aspirations \u2013 including the move to fee-for-value vs. fee-for-service.\n\nWhat were some of your roles and achievements throughout your tenure with LVHN?\n\nNester: I was director of the emergency department at Muhlenberg [LVH-Muhlenberg Hospital in Bethlehem]; associate vice chair of the overall emergency department for LVHN; research program director; and director of medical education for the Muhlenberg campus. There were some others [roles] along the way, but those are the big ones.\n\nEarly on, the biggest accomplishments, there were three, and they were all about patient care and improving care delivery.\n\nIn about 2000, we consolidated psychiatric beds across the Valley, literally, from other institutions as well, and we built the behavioral health and science 60-bed facility at Muhlenberg. \u2026We worked with our chair of psychiatry, Dr. [Michael] Kaufmann, and created an emergency behavioral health unit \u2026 for acute psychiatric illness, right adjacent to the emergency department, and it's become a national model.\n\nAnd what's really wonderful is to see that many folks that have challenges that sometimes require chemical restraints, physical restraints \u2026 we dropped our physical restraints to the lowest levels we had ever had. So that was big. It was huge.\n\nThe other one [accomplishment] is Muhlenberg's volume had dropped down to about 24,000 patient visits per year. At a high they were at 31,000 or 32,000, and we reversed that and now within about four years we are back up to 30,000 again.\n\nThe last one [accomplishment] was starting the residency program.\n\nTell me more about your background before LVHN, and how your experience might fit into this role?\n\nNester: I was assistant director of an emergency department down in Delaware County, called Delaware County Memorial Hospital. It was working for a very busy, for-profit emergency medicine firm. I did a lot of clinical work so I was a real kind of ER doc for several years and then came back to [Albert] Einstein [Medical Center in Philadelphia] to be academic faculty and get back to some research \u2026 and worked at a major trauma center in Philadelphia and loved it.\n\nI became very academic, did a lot of teaching, and got a master's degree \u2026 and I really wanted to bring good things to life, so as Ron [Swinfard] would say, \u201cmany of us who are here, we escaped academics.\u201d \u2026 This is a wonderful environment and we enjoy the academic stuff, the teaching stuff \u2026 but when we get to the bedside, we really do things. \u2026\n\nHow did that help me? I was a grounded clinician first and I had a passion for that, so when I brought that to Muhlenberg and I was passionate about the delivery of care, access, improving patient service, customer satisfaction, I became the go-to person at Muhlenberg for all patient complaints in the community, many of which revolve around the emergency department\u2026\n\nHalfway through [MBA school], Elliot Sussman [then the president and CEO of LVHN] came to me and said \u201cHey, you're involved in a lot of this business stuff and physician interaction and working with consumers and patients. Look, I think we need someone to do this work and there's a role that you could apply for.\u201d\n\nAnd it was the senior vice president role for physician practice and network development, to grow the business, work with the doctors, improve service and just make sure we grow volume. So, I got that job.\n\nUpon taking the acting role as president and CEO, what has the LVHN board of directors instructed you to do?\n\nNester: First is, there is specificity to the title. It's acting, not interim, because it's unexpected [Swinfard's retirement]. There is a rationale behind that.\n\n[The board of directors at LVHN said] \u201cYou've been here a long time. You know the people. You've worked well with Ron [Swinfard] and Elliot Sussman. We don't want this to be a holding position. We don't want you to be a caretaker until we find the ultimate, permanent leader. We want this to be an acting role, because we want you to act,\u201d which I am thrilled about because I think we should and we can.\n\nWhat are your plans for the network, if you land the permanent role of president and CEO?\n\nNester: I think they are the same as what they are today, aspirationally. We are in a tough, tough business right now, and we have a huge commitment to the community.\n\nNo. 1, we are the largest employer in the marketplace, and we have fabulous, fabulous inpatient assets. I have been across the country to many different places. This is about as nice of an environment to practice acute care inpatient medicine.\n\nThe reality is that fee for service has really driven a lot of that and has rewarded us for that.\n\nWith value-based purchasing, that is turned on its end. It is all about appropriate utilization of those inpatient services, but more about engaging patients in their health, their wellness, their pursuit of better care and keeping them out of \u201cexpensive assets\u201d of the inpatient environment. And I am absolutely certain that we can do that.\n\nSo that's moving from that fee-for-service to fee-for-value world.\n\nSo, I think aspirationally, we are trying to re-engineer our hospital and health system into a new kind of health care company that is capable of truly managing populations, taking on clinical and financial risk, because that's going to be the way of the world.\n\nAnd here's the good news: It's good for patients.\n\nIt will be hard for us to change, because we are not going to get paid to do it, and we are struggling through that right now. Our acute inpatient business is down 4 percent. That has historically been one that has paid our bills.\n\nThe reality is that's not going to work anymore.\n\nOur revenue probably will proportionately shrink, and a good portion of it will be at risk for our performance, which, by the way, is how it should be. There is a lot of money in this [health] system. I think there is plenty of money in it to go around, to take care of patients \u2026\n\nAre there any initiatives that you would like to see implemented?\n\nNester: We have a lot of them that go under the radar. \u2026 There are no new ones but some that people don't know about. \u2026\n\nGetting economies of scale through mergers \u2026 all that does is largely get you group purchasing to buy stuff cheaper in bulk. That doesn't fix our problems. So, that's why we started AllSpire. We are finding ways through our intellectual strengths and our buying strengths to accelerate this movement from a fee-for-service world to fee-for-value world, and we are finding many ways to do that\u2026\n\nHave you met with the other CEOs of AllSpire?\n\nNester: I was involved at the front end of pulling AllSpire together, with Ron [Swinfard].\n\nI met with all the original stakeholders and I know all of the CEOs quite well, and was with all of them last Monday \u2026 and I am on the development committee for AllSpire \u2026\n\nIn the clinical world, it's not just about taking care of business, it's about taking care of the patient. Taking better care of patients can actually lower costs...\n\nWill this transition process be an opportunity for LVHN to look at its mission and goals, and potentially tweak or revamp them?\n\nNester: Our mission is to heal, comfort and care for the people of our community by providing advanced and compassionate care, superior quality and value. \u2026 It's always been value at the end, so I am having a hard time seeing how we necessarily have to change the mission.\n\nI think we can redirect our focus on that to really go after value. Value has not been prioritized. \u2026 Hamster-wheel transactionalism is what was rewarded, and that results in, frankly for the whole industry, some perverse incentives financially.\n\nSo, I think fee-for-service drives us to do things that aren't the best use of funds, across the industry.\n\nI think we have been wonderful stewards for our community, no doubt, but I think we are excited about\u2026value-based purchasing, because that is going to separate us from the other providers.\n\nIf you believe in value \u2013 by the way, nobody can't believe in value production \u2013 it's higher quality care at a lower cost. How do you argue that? And we are not for profit, and with that mission. If you believe in that, then get on the horse. Get into it, know what it's going to take to do it, invest in the infrastructure. \u2026 Let's get going. \u2026\n\nBy the way, the world is happening fast around us. Consumers of health care are getting it in their pocket right now. The economy is not hot. The burden of health care is going more to the individual.\n\nI believe exchanges will flourish, price sensitivity will reign, and when that happens, you have a very informed consumer and they are going to know who can provide the best quality at the lowest cost.\n\nAnd that's the journey we are on, because we think we can succeed there.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Lehigh Valley Business", "description": "", "title": "LVHN acting CEO: It's about value, the patient | LVB", "url": "http://www.lvb.com/article/20140616/LVB01/306129999/lvhn-acting-ceo-its-about-value-the-patient", "image": "http://www.lvb.com/storyimage/LV/20140616/LVB01/306129999/AR/0/AR-306129999.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "lvb.com", "description": "", "title": "LVHN acting CEO: It's about value, the patient | LVB", "image": {"src": "http://www.lvb.com/storyimage/LV/20140616/LVB01/306129999/AR/0/AR-306129999.jpg"}, "creator": "@jenniferg_LVB", "site": "@lvb_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Upon taking the acting role as president and CEO, what has the LVHN board of directors instructed you to do?\nIn an exclusive interview with Lehigh Valley Business, the 52-year-old Nester talked about the transition at LVHN, health care challenges and his background and aspirations \u2013 including the move to fee-for-value vs. fee-for-service.\nThe consortium was formed last year to provide cost-effective and efficient health care.\nLVHN has launched a national search for a permanent president and CEO, which may also include other internal candidates besides Nester.\nEarly on, the biggest accomplishments, there were three, and they were all about patient care and improving care delivery."}
