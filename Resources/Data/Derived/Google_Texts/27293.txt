A new census report found that the marriage rate in the U.S. has reached a 93-year low. But Fox News hosts and amateur sociologists Harris Faulkner and Andrea Tantaros know from Faulkner’s twitter feed that it’s at least partly President Obama’s fault.

We have long documented Faulkner’s record of slyly acting as a Republican mouthpiece. Here she did it by just happening to single out an anonymous tweeter, “Love USA 4” (I could not find the account) from her Twitter feed and validating it. After noting that a trend toward delaying marriage might be part of the reason, Faulkner announced:

I'm looking at my Twitter feed. Love USA 4 says, "Couples no longer are getting married for one reason only.” She (the tweeter) says. “The White House administration punishes married through the purse. Singles do better financially.”

Yes, who needs research when you have Twitter?

Co-host Andrea Tantaros, who once urged people to “do me a favor” and punch an Obama supporter “in the face,” quickly agreed. “Of course! Look at ObamaCare! It is much cheaper to be single or to get divorced. And there’s actually something called the ObamaCare divorce…”

Kirsten Powers called this out, laughing: “OK! This is not Obama’s fault!”

But “Punch” Tantaros was not to be dissuaded.

Kirsten, you – come on. I mean, you can laugh about it. But they are disincentivizing marriage through the policies that Washington put out because if you get people to separate, then women – The Life of Julia, remember that? - become more dependent on the government. It is cheaper under ObamaCare to not be married.

Powers said this is a “trend” that “has been going on for a long time, now. Even the show’s #OneLuckyGuy, Jonah Goldberg (no Obama fan) agreed that while there are marriage penalties, “it’s a much larger trend.”
