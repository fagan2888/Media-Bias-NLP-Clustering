Several Tulsa churches sent a special blessing on Sunday.

Christian Orthodox Churches of Holy Trinity, St. Anthony and Holy Apostles met at the Arkansas River to bless the water.

Church leaders say it’s part of an epiphany celebration where Christ descended into the Jordan River.

"The water becomes holy. The material world becomes a way to bless everything,” Father George Eber of St. Anthony Orthodox Christian Church said. “And so the water goes throughout the land. It’s also a time to pray for our cities, pray for our leaders which we do in all our services."

They made a large ice cross that they pushed into the water as part of the blessing.
