She estimated an average of up to 2 hours a day on the phone trying to get her family health care insurance.\n\n\u201cIf policy is the law, then we need to make sure it is working,\u201d Reardon said.\n\nRetired police officer Jack Bayles and his wife, Gina, are in the same situation.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk with Cigna, they have no record of anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worry some. Do we have insurance? Do we not have insurance? Are they going to cover it? Are they not going to cover it?\" said his wife.\n\nHe now owns his own business taking wildlife photography, but his small business has been put on hold as he tries to fix the problem of his family\u2019s health insurance coverage.\n\nPhone records provided by Bayles to FOX31 Denver show on a single call he spent 112 minutes trying get answers from Connect for Health. That was back in December and as of March, he is still waiting for on whether or not he is medically covered.\n\n\u201cThere is a breakdown somewhere,\u201d he said. Bayles became so frustrated with the system he hired an insurance broker hoping that would help. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get it done on our own.\u201d\n\nState exchange has had problems\n\nColorado is one of 17 states that set up its own health exchange. The state\u2019s program went on-line on Oct. 1, 2013 with some technical glitches in the beginning.\n\nConnect for Health admitted there were problems at first, but that the number of complaints has decreased since January.\n\nFOX31 Denver\u2019s Investigative Unit asked Connect for Health Colorado how it tracks complaints, like the one\u2019s Bayles and Reardon brought to our attention.\n\nWe specifically asked in an e-mail, \u201cHow many complaints were filed, the reason for the complaints and action taken on those complaints.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Connect for Health Colorado responded they don\u2019t keep track of complaints and couldn\u2019t answer our request.\n\nRepublican State Senator Kevin Lundburg, who serves on the state\u2019s Health and Human Services committee, is equally frustrated by the lack of answers coming from Connect for Health Colorado.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten good clean answer from them. They\u2019re a little bit fuzzy with their information,\u201d Lundburg said.\n\nLundburg said that 750,000 people in Colorado are uninsured and were expected to sign-up for health insurance though the exchange, but with 112,000 signed up less than a week before the March 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a success story. If it was supposed to provide more insurance, it\u2019s not doing it,\u201d said Lundurg.\n\nThe frustration with long calls times and people who just aren\u2019t as persistent as Bayles and Reardon could factor into why so many are opting to give up on getting their mandate health insurance.\n\nLindy Hinman, Chief Operating Officer with Connect for Health, disagrees with the 750,000 number provide by Senator Lundburg, stating those number were provided by an outside non-profit agency, not Connect for Health Colorado.\n\nBut we found those same numbers being posted on the state of Colorado\u2019s own webpage concerning questions and answers about Health Care Reform in the state.\n\nThree weeks after FOX31 Denver asked Connect for Health Colorado about complaint numbers, Hinman opened up about the complaints the exchanged has received, stating about 2,240 have come through either the call center or on-line. The number of complaints is less than 2 percent of those who\u2019ve signed up for health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt is a very small number of our customers that are giving us complaints and when we do receive them we work on an individual basis to resolve them as quickly as we can,\u201d Hinman said.\n\nBecause of privacy laws she couldn\u2019t walk about individual cases, but reassured users that they are working to resolve all problems.\n\n\u201cWe are working every day with our carriers to make sure whoever has come to us and gotten enrolled that information is then getting to the carrier. There is sometimes a delay getting that information all the way to the service center on the carrier side,\u201d she said.\n\nReardon and Bayles don\u2019t want excuses they just want insurance they were required to sign up for by federal law.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t gotten it right yet, I can\u2019t trust them to get it right in the future,\u201d said Reardon.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: After first talking with FOX31 Denver, Reardon was able to resolve her problem at the end of March, but she is unsure if her family will get the tax credits to lower her insurance rates. Bayles is still waiting for a resolution on his issue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- Consumers who\u2019ve tried to sign-up for the Affordable Health Care Act in Colorado are frustrated and uncertain if they are covered, despite signing up for coverage last year.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "DENVER \u2014 Consumers who\u2019ve tried to sign-up for the Affordable Health Care Act in Colorado are frustrated and uncertain if they are covered, despite signing up for coverage last year.
