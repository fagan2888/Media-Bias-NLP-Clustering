It\u2019s invading their sleep. It\u2019s keeping people up at night. It\u2019s causing a tremendous amount of stress for a lot of folks.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not an opponent of the controversial insurance reform program \u2013 it\u2019s Lawrence Miller, the government official who runs it. And in an appearance before the House Committee on Health Care, angry lawmakers castigated the administration\u2019s newly installed chief of health care reform for problems that continue to plague Vermont Health Connect.\n\n\"We are getting more and more calls from really irate people ... people who initially were really excited about getting coverage and now are feeling really, really frustrated.\" -Trinka Kerr, office of Health Care Exchange\n\nSnowballing technological problems at Vermont\u2019s online insurance exchange are drawing new scrutiny. And advocates warn that the situation for many customers who bought plans through Vermont Health Connect is becoming increasingly dire.\n\nTrinka Kerr, director of the Office of the Health Care Advocate, said the issues have resulted in record-breaking call volumes to her shop, where Vermont Health Connect customers call to register complaints.\n\nFrustrated Customers\n\n\u201cWe are getting more and more calls from really irate people \u2026 people who initially were really excited about getting coverage and now are feeling really, really frustrated,\u201d Kerr told lawmakers Wednesday.\n\nThe problems are legion, but an issue of primary concern is the state\u2019s inability to process changes in policy holders\u2019 domestic or financial circumstances. One of the benefits of the new system was that it was supposed to be able to process those changes automatically. But the technology isn\u2019t working. And that\u2019s created a backlog of more than 14,000 people unable to alter policy errors \u2013 errors that, according to Kerr, have in many cases impeded their access to care.\n\nThen there are the hundreds of Vermonters who have newly joined the ranks of the uninsured, not because they didn\u2019t enroll in a plan and pay their premiums, but because the state, for reasons still unknown, according to Miller, hasn\u2019t transmitted that information to the insurers.\n\n\u201cEven though the withdrawals from their bank have gone through, the checks have been cashed \u2026 their coverage hasn\u2019t been activated,\u201d Kerr said.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield is the private insurer that covers the vast majority of the approximately 66,000 Vermonters with exchange plans. And it\u2019s provided those people with temporary \u201cshell plans\u201d that, according to Blue Cross\u2019 Dawn Schneiderman, \u201cgives them sort of the illusion of coverage.\u201d\n\nBut while the arrangement has helped people maintain access to case as their coverage issues are resolved, it\u2019s also required doctors to provide in some instances thousands of dollars of care without being immediately compensated.\n\n\"I need to express in the strongest terms ... This is a crisis. This is a crisis in our communities.\" - Rep. Mike Fisher, Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Health Care\n\nThrow in long wait times to talk to customer service representatives staffing Vermont Health Connect call centers, and the fact that these issues have persisted since the site\u2019s launch nearly a year ago now, and even legislators who pushed heavily for mandatory enrollment in the exchange are beginning to lose faith.\n\n\u201cSo I need to express in the strongest terms \u2026 that this is a crisis. This is a crisis in our communities,\u201d said Lincoln Rep. Mike Fisher, the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Health Care.\n\nWaiting On Hold\n\nMiller, a former private sector entrepreneur who headed up the Agency of Commerce before being reassigned by Gov. Peter Shumlin to right the Vermont Health Connect ship, said lawmakers are justified to be angry. Asked by one lawmaker if call center employees could simply take down consumers\u2019 names and call them back, rather than force them to endure long hold times, Miller offered this:\n\n\u201cOur history of calling people back is so god awful I hesitate to do it. I wonder why the hell \u2013 excuse my language Mr. Chairman \u2013 I wonder why we tell people we\u2019re going to call them back at all,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMiller\u2019s ready acknowledgement of the exchange\u2019s problems marks a stylistic contrast from Commissioner of Vermont Health Access Mark Larson, the government official at whom lawmakers have directed their outrage in previous hearings. Larson, who has had a somewhat tense relationship with legislators, in part for failing to preemptively disclose problems that they didn't yet know about, wasn\u2019t present at Wednesday\u2019s hearings. Miller said he was working with officials from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who were in town for a routine review.\n\nMiller said the consumer dissatisfaction with Vermont Health Connect stems in large part from operational deficiencies in the program, deficiencies he says will be addressed by the new director of operations brought on last week.\n\nDave Martini, who most recently served as Vermont\u2019s director of health insurance policy at the Department of Financial Regulation, will oversee a staff that Miller says needs to be segregated from the day-to-day \u201cchaos\u201d of customer service trouble shooting.\n\nMiller says the reforms administered by him and Martini may be substantial.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of decisions, you know, tens of thousands of individual decisions that were made along the way in designing Vermont Health Connect, many of which need to be revisited now that we\u2019re in operation,\u201d Miller says.\n\nFor instance, Miller says the plan to automate any changes in customer circumstance may not be a viable one. He says the state proceeded with technological automation, as per federal mandates. But he says it\u2019s a plan that defies industry standards \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield, for instance, inputs change in customers\u2019 circumstances manually \u2013 and that Vermont may seek federal approval to abandon aspects of that requirement.\n\nThat would create a need for more state employees to perform those manual functions \u2013 precisely how many, Miller says he isn\u2019t yet sure.\n\nBut the change-of-circumstance situation is symptomatic of the broader issues that Miller says has thwarted the smooth rollout of Vermont Health Connect.\n\n\u201cThe scope of work that was bitten off exceeds the capacity to do that effectively,\u201d Miller says.\n\nOther major issues under Miller\u2019s watch include a problem with the re-enrollment of 50,000 Medicaid recipients who, for reasons the state is still trying to determine, haven\u2019t been submitting the online forms or paperwork needed to make sure they continue to get benefits.\n\nMiller said the immediate problem was solved when federal officials agreed to allow Vermont to automatically re-enroll everyone who is in Medicaid now.\n\nThe blanket fix means that people whose financial situation has improved in recent months \u2013 not uncommon for people in the program \u2013 will be getting benefits for which they\u2019re not eligible. But Miller says the imperfect solution heads off what would have been a much larger crisis.\n\nIRS Comes Calling?\n\nThe state is also preparing for what one lawmaker called the \u201clooming train wreck\u201d of a financial true-up come tax time. The issue centers on the subsidies and premium assistance available under the Affordable Care Act for people living below 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe problem will arise for people whose calendar year 2014 income exceeded the amount they predicted when they filled out their insurance enrollment forms earlier this year. The Internal Revenue Service has said it will be looking for discrepancies when people file their income tax returns next year, and collecting from those filers whatever federal assistance it determines they shouldn\u2019t have been eligible for.\n\nMiller says the IRS has capped the value of the overpayments for which it will hold people responsible at $1,250 for individuals, and $2,500 for a family. But those caps are only for people living below 400 percent of federal poverty. And Miller said he\u2019s especially worried about how the IRS will handle people whose unanticipated income took them over 400 percent of poverty, and therefore ineligible for any assistance whatsoever.\n\nThe state\u2019s inability to process change-of-circumstance forms means that even people who tried to alter their income information were unable to do so, and that thousands of dollars in unanticipated health care costs could suddenly come due next April.\n\nFisher said that the Legislature\u2019s ability to intervene in the situation is diminished by the fact that it\u2019s not in session. If the problems at Vermont Health Connect aren\u2019t resolved by the time the House reconvenes in January, then Fisher said the Shumlin Administration should expect significant legislative intervention.\n\n\u201cPeople ask, \u2018what are we going to do about it?\u2019\u201d Fisher said. \u201cFrom my perspective, everything is on the table\u2026 It\u2019s just untenable to continue to be in this situation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Here\u2019s how one critic of Vermont Health Connect describes the experience of many of the customers who bought their insurance through it: \u201cIt\u2019s occupying", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "VPR News", "og": {"url": "http://digital.vpr.net/post/lawmakers-angered-continuing-problems-health-exchange", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/vpr/files/styles/medium/public/201404/Miller_Moulton_041014_Zind.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Here\u2019s how one critic of Vermont Health Connect describes the experience of many of the customers who bought their insurance through it: \u201cIt\u2019s occupying", "title": "Lawmakers Angered By Continuing Problems At Health Exchange"}, "story_id": 334619944, "twitter": {"site": "@vprnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@vprnet"}, "author": "Peter Hirschfeld", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Lawmakers Angered By Continuing Problems At Health Exchange"}, "nid": 30654, "datePublished": "2014-07-23", "keywords": "Health Care Exchange, Government & Politics, VPR News", "wordCount": 1502, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "And in an appearance before the House Committee on Health Care, angry lawmakers castigated the administration\u2019s newly installed chief of health care reform for problems that continue to plague Vermont Health Connect.\n\"We are getting more and more calls from really irate people ... people who initially were really excited about getting coverage and now are feeling really, really frustrated.\"\nFrustrated Customers\u201cWe are getting more and more calls from really irate people \u2026 people who initially were really excited about getting coverage and now are feeling really, really frustrated,\u201d Kerr told lawmakers Wednesday.\n-Trinka Kerr, office of Health Care ExchangeSnowballing technological problems at Vermont\u2019s online insurance exchange are drawing new scrutiny.\nPeter Shumlin to right the Vermont Health Connect ship, said lawmakers are justified to be angry."}
