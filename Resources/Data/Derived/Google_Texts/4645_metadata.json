Szczerba.\n\n\"Studies confirm that empowered nurses provide the best patient care,\" American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN) President Teri Lynn Kiss told Forbes. In 2012, AACN rolled out its Clinical Scene Investigator Academy, a 16-month hospital-based nurse leadership training program. Initial program results in Texas, Indiana, North Carolina and Massachusetts indicate more than $20 million saved, with results from New York and Pennsylvania still forthcoming.\n\nOn average, the four teams' initiatives \"decreased patient length of stay in ICUs [intensive care units] and progressive care units by up to a full day,\" said Kiss. \"They decreased by one day the time patients needed support from a mechanical ventilator. And they cut in half ICU complications and infections.\"\n\nRaising nurse staffing levels could improve outcomes for underweight black infants as well, according to a new study published in the journal Health Services Research.\n\n\"Hospitals should consider increasing nurse staffing and improving work environments,\" co-author Jeannette A. Rogowski said in a statement. \"Many payment systems to hospitals now include incentives to improve the quality of patient care. Under Medicaid, hospitals will lose money if infants acquire hospital infections that increase their hospital stay.\"\n\nListening to nurses' requests to address issues such as staffing levels is important, as nurses often feel hospitals deny them proper respect and a say in organization decisions and stakeholder collaboration, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the Forbes article\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNurses need more respect, stronger voice\n\nAltruistic nurses more likely to burn out on the job\n\nStudy: Nurses who show more compassion suffer fatigue, stress\n\nLong nurse shifts lead to burnout, patient dissatisfaction\n\nStudy: Nurses overworked, understaffed and stressed\n\nNursing career path evolves, now includes care in community settings", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare providers can achieve the necessary post-Affordable Care Act transformation by empowering nurses, according to Forbes.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare providers can achieve the necessary post-Affordable Care Act transformation by empowering nurses, according to Forbes.", "title": "To improve healthcare outcomes, empower nurses", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/improve-healthcare-outcomes-empower-nurses/2014-09-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "empowerment,HR & Workforce Management,intensive care units,Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,nurse leadership roles,Nurses,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "\"Studies confirm that empowered nurses provide the best patient care,\" American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN) President Teri Lynn Kiss told Forbes.\nRaising nurse staffing levels could improve outcomes for underweight black infants as well, according to a new study published in the journal Health Services Research.\nOn average, the four teams' initiatives \"decreased patient length of stay in ICUs [intensive care units] and progressive care units by up to a full day,\" said Kiss.\nHealthcare providers can achieve the necessary post-Affordable Care Act transformation by empowering nurses, according to Forbes.\n\"Many payment systems to hospitals now include incentives to improve the quality of patient care."}
