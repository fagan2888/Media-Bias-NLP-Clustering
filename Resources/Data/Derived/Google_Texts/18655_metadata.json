Mr. Rose-Garcia, who performs as Shakey Graves, emerged from the office as the new president and chief executive of his own touring company, Immortal Fun.\n\n\u201cThere was a time not that long ago where if you\u2019d told me I\u2019d have a business manager, let alone be the president of an entity, I\u2019d have said that\u2019s crazy person talk,\u201d said Mr. Rose-Garcia, 27, a native of Austin.\n\nIndeed, until recently, Shakey Graves has largely been a do-it-yourself affair, and a successful one. Earlier this year he sold out over a dozen headline shows, including one at the Bowery Ballroom in New York, and he has become a regular on the festival circuit, playing high-profile events like the Hangout Music Festival, Newport Folk Festival and Pickathon. His 2011 debut album, \u201cRoll the Bones,\u201d was distributed primarily on Bandcamp, a digital retailer that specializes in independent artists.\n\nOn Tuesday his music will get its first real national push when his sophomore album, \u201cAnd the War Came\u201d is released by Dualtone Records, the Nashville label of Guy Clark and Robert Earl Keen that also sold more than a couple million copies of the Lumineers\u2019 2012 debut album.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe set\u2019s lead single, \u201cDearly Departed (featuring Esm\u00e9 Patterson),\u201d has already been streamed on Spotify more than 2 million times. For Mr. Rose-Garcia, the early Spotify returns seem worlds away from the lonely happy hour gigs he played just four years ago in Austin at the Hole In The Wall. At the time, Mr. Rose-Garcia was best known for playing a recurring character known as the Swede on the NBC series \u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d and for bit parts in a handful of Robert Rodriguez films. As the one-man band Shakey Graves, Mr. Rose-Garcia initially fused harrowing blues and plaintive folk in a style similar to that of Chris Whitley or Jeff Buckley. For better or worse, Mr. Rose-Garcia\u2019s homemade percussive instrument, a vintage Samonsite suitcase struck with a kick drum pedal, became his calling card, especially as he began touring.\n\n\u201cAt its worst, it\u2019s gimmicky,\u201d he said. \u201cAt best, it\u2019s useful and utilitarian. It gets sort of that sparse, big sound across, and when the sound guy has it dialed in just right, you don\u2019t need much else. It\u2019s also super awesome to be able to fly on airlines with it.\u201d\n\nExpanded coverage of Texas is produced by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news organization.

I feel more much comfortable being a bandleader now.\u201d\n\nFor the last year or so, he has played that role on and off, working onstage with Austin drummer Chris Boosahda and a rotating cast of musicians who might add a bass, fiddle or cello. Mr. Rose-Garcia was inspired by \u201cStop Making Sense,\u201d the Talking Heads film in which the bandleader, David Byrne, starts out alone and then gradually introduces musicians as the set progresses.\n\nThe effect is more peaks and valleys, which Mr. Rose-Garcia said was also the concept driving \u201cAnd the War Came,\u201d which jumps between mournful, largely solo ballads and heavier and more aggressive multi-instrument fare.\n\n\u201cOn a great radio playlist or a mixtape, there might be a song maybe people didn\u2019t see coming, and then you enjoy a song more because of the song that came before it,\u201d he said, who co-produced the album in his Austin home with Mr. Boosahda. \u201cMy favorite thing is yanking people around in intuitive ways that maybe they didn\u2019t even realize they liked or wanted. So for the album, I wanted the peaks to be bigger than they\u2019d been previously, and I wanted the low parts to sound warm and familiar.\u201d\n\nBecause he has built his fan base largely on the road, playing for festivalgoers, Mr. Rose-Garcia said he considers \u201cAnd the War Came\u201d more of an introduction than a sophomore album. He hopes that with Dualtone\u2019s push for radio and retail, he will be playing for a lot of new faces. Even so, Mr. Rose-Garcia suspects that certain fans of his live shows will be taken aback by the range and volume of the new album.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a point of contention,\u201d he said. \u201cBring it on. I want to spark conversation and questions like, how dare you make an album that people enjoy? Or, how dare you go back on how I perceive you as a musician?\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve felt like that about plenty of artists.\u201d\n\nNo matter how the album is received, he says he is ready for at least two years of nonstop touring, both in the United States and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI have no real plan except to do the work, which is both exciting and pretty harrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am the president of Immortal Fun. And that\u2019s the thing: No matter what, I\u2019m definitely having fun, and that\u2019s going to be nearly impossible for anyone to take away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141004214906, "twitter": {"description": "The artist Shakey Graves, who is a Texas native, has spent a lot of his time performing at festivals.
