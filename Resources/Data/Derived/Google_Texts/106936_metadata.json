He thought that Members of Congress or other elected officials should receive hookers, blow and cash money upon being sworn into office. They\u2019d be too busy to draft bad laws.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that the federal agency that guides sentencing for former Virginia governor Robert McDonnell recommended at least 10 years in the hoosegow. He was convicted of, as the Post puts it, \u201clending the prestige of his office to Richmond businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr. in exchange for $177,000 in loans, vacations and luxury items.\u201d\n\nNow, even if I didn\u2019t think that prison is where something approaching 100% of politicians belong, I\u2019d be all for sending this guy to the slammer for trading favors for Rolexes and such. And I might note that if the Washington Post hadn\u2019t been so busy trying to paint McDonnell as the second coming of Jonathan Edwards, the paper might have noticed he was a crony\u2019s dream politician. But that\u2019s a different story.\n\nIn any case, fine, McDonnell\u2019s going away for a long time and his wife will also spend some time in the clinker. I will not cry over this.\n\nBut 10 years is a long time for luxury items! So how much is U.S. Senator Mark Warner going to get for dangling a judgeship in front of a Democratic state senator\u2019s daughter in an effort to dissuade him from quitting office and helping Republicans?\n\nThis story is even more sordid. Virginia had an evenly divided senate. Democratic state senator Phillip Puckett resigned his seat \u2014 perhaps being lured out of it by job offers from Republicans \u2014 and threw it into Republican hands. That was very bad for Gov. Terry McAuliffe and his top legislative priority \u2014 expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. The allegations that Republicans had dangled job offers launched a federal probe akin to what happened with McConnell. But that\u2019s when things got complicated.\n\nIt turned out that Democrats had been offering jobs to the state senator\u2019s family. And not just any Democrats.\n\nSen. Mark Warner suggested a federal judgeship for Puckett\u2019s daughter, even though she\u2019d barely practiced any federal law. According to family members, he also \u201csuggested a post for her at CGI, a high-tech firm Warner helped lure to Southwest Virginia when he was governor a decade ago.\u201d You don\u2019t say! That sounds very Bob McDonnell-like!\n\nAnd McAuliffe\u2019s chief of staff had basically promised Puckett the moon if he\u2019d only stay in office.\n\nSo what happened? How many years for Warner and everyone else engaged in shenanigans? Did you guess no years? You would be correct, because apparently judgeships are less important than Rolexes. Or federal probes that entangle Democrats aren\u2019t as cool as federal probes that entangle Republicans. I\u2019m sure it all makes a ton of sense somewhere. Here\u2019s the Washington Post:\n\nRICHMOND \u2014 Federal prosecutors will not pursue criminal charges in the resignation of a state senator who quit amid job talks, quietly closing an episode that further tarnished Virginia\u2019s proud reputation for clean government.\n\nListen, trading one\u2019s office for shady personal and political favors is always bad. It\u2019s not just bad when the other party does it. I don\u2019t share the Washington Post\u2019s opinion that Virginia has a proud reputation for clean government but whatever its history, it definitely has a tarnished reputation now.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about whether McDonnell should be punished for his corruption. He should. But as I wrote in \u201cPrison For D\u2019Souza, Beach Time For Corzine,\u201d selective enforcement of the law is a dangerous thing.\n\nAnd Virginia isn\u2019t alone. Remember this story from October?\n\nJust a week after Sen. Kay Hagan (D., N.C.) recommended a North Carolina judge to President Barack Obama for a seat in the U.S. District Court, the judge ruled in favor of a company partially owned by Hagan\u2019s husband.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 07:46:38 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Virginia is for corrupt governors.
