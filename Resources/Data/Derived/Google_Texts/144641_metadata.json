Burnt Orange Report has exposed the litany of hideous, racist posts on Cooper's website. He routinely hurls epithets at and degrades non-white people, degrades women and promotes violence.\n\nUnfortunately, top Texas Republicans Greg Abbott, Rick Perry and David Dewhurst have gotten close to Cooper to the point of giving him an exclusive interview (Abbott), an intimate shooting range visit (Perry), and a cozy dinner (Dewhurst). The Republican Attorney General candidate State Sen. Ken Paxton is the latest Republican to seek Cooper's approval.\n\nRead more below the jump.Paxton took Cooper, Ramparts360 bloggers, Empower Texas staffers, and members of the (shameful) Texas Young Conservatives to breakfast.\n\nWhy does Ken Paxton think it's acceptable to dine with the owner of a racist blog? No Texas Republican should embrace Cooper just because he's a conservative blogger. His blog is a hate-filled, racist disgrace.\n\nRamparts360 blogger Sibyl West described their policy discussion this way:\n\n\n\nWe \u201cgot down to bidness\u201d when one of the bloggers asked him: As Attorney General, what are your priorities? He noted that in his 11 years in the legislature in Texas the biggest changes came under Obama and they involved increased investigations of individuals and businesses by the IRS and OSA. There has been what he called a \u201chigh level of assault on Texas oil and natural gas production.\u201d Keeping these open and running is number one on his list. Then comes Second Amendment issues such as CHL, campus and open carry. He, along with Governor Perry and AG Abbott, is with Birdwell's bill. As far as the position of Attorney General goes he says \u201cStrategy is the biggest job.\u201d Among issues of concern the greatest is Medicaid expansion. One of the Young Conservatives of Texas quoted Dr. Ben Carson as saying Obamacare is not about health care, it's about control. Paxton agreed and added, \u201cYes, because if it's about health care they're stupid.\u201d\n\nHow exciting, another potential Attorney General who thinks the job is legislative tirades against the Obama administration. It's no wonder this Abbott acolyte agrees that embracing Robbie Cooper is OK.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recently, Urban Grounds blogger Robbie Cooper got to rub elbows with another top Texas Republican seeking his support.
