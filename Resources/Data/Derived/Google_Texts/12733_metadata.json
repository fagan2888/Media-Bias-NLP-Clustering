Critics of the ruling claim that the majority opinions by Justices Samuel A.

They are also resting some of their hopes on a unique database. John Hollenhorst shares their story.\n\nSegment 3\n\nOne in 3 kids says they're bullied at school. One in 5 teens will experience depression. More than 3 million children a year are suspended. Schools have a lot to contend with. And just teaching the three R's maybe isn't enough. That's why an old idea is getting new traction around the country. Peter Rosen reports.\n\nThe biggest tennis tournament of the year wraps up today. Wimbledon is ready to crown new champions in London \u2014 and while it's almost 5,000 miles away from Salt Lake City, it's never too far from the mind of Provo's Brad Pearce.
