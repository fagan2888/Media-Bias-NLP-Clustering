The doctor wasn't reprimanded or disciplined.\n\nAnd while the incident underscores the importance of using discretion when posting comments and pictures on social media, it also raised concerns from one reader who questioned why, in an age of transparency, an empty trauma room following a major incident is terrible to publicize.\n\nIndeed the circumstances are murky at best. The nurse was part of an ABC reality show \"New York Med,\" described as a series that \"toggles between the renowned surgeons of Manhattan's New York Presbyterian Hospital and the gritty world of trauma surgeons at Newark's University Hospital where the ER is a doorway to the mean streets of one of America's most violent cities.\" So the scene of the trauma team trying to save the life of this man was likely filmed and perhaps would later be broadcast on national television.\n\nThe nurse, Katie Duke, told ABC News that hospital officials admitted the photograph didn't violate HIPAA privacy rules or the organization's social media policies, but instead fired her because the posting was insensitive. She posted the image with the caption, \"#Man vs 6 train.\"\n\nThe firing came as a shock to Duke, who worked at the hospital for six years prior to the incident. She told the New York Daily News that she decided to post the photo because it was a \"moving and impactful picture.\" It was, she said, \"just a very genuine intention of \u2026 want(ing) people to see what goes on in an emergency room, from the perspective of being an ER nurse.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital told the Daily News that the hospital \"does not discuss individual employee matters. NYMed provides snapshots of experiences at NYP. It would be impossible to convey every aspect of every situation in one-hour of television.\"\n\nThe story generated a lot of interest on FierceHealthcare's Facebook page with some readers siding with the hospital decision. But one reader wondered, \"Why is it that it always falls on the nurse and not the doctor? Both should be counseled about insensitivity and should nots. A class on legal implications and the problems with social media is a must.\"\n\nWhat do you think?
