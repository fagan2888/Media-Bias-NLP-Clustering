When it became law, the Congressional Budget Office projected Obamacare would reduce deficits, but critics, pointing to multiple accounting gimmicks Democrats used to game the CBO score, questioned whether the projection would prove accurate. Now, Americans may never get an answer - at least from the CBO. More than four years after Obamacare passed, the CBO is now saying it is \u201cnot possible\u201d to do another complete analysis on the effect of the law on the nation's deficits.\n\nIt's worth clarifying the distinction between costs and deficits. On the one hand, Obamacare costs a lot of money - mostly due to the expansion of Medicaid and the provision of subsidies for individuals to purchase coverage through government-run insurance exchanges. At the time of passage, the CBO projected that the gross cost of expanding insurance through Obamacare would be $938 billion over a decade - but this vastly underestimated the actual cost of the program.\n\nThe reason is that the original CBO score was for the 2010 through 2019 budget window. Because the major spending provisions \u2013 Medicaid and exchange subsidies \u2013 didn\u2019t kick in until 2014, the first 10-year score only included six years of real spending. In the most recent estimate in April, the CBO revealed that the cost over the new 2015 to 2024 budget window would be more than $1.8 trillion, or roughly double the first projection.\n\nThough the law increases health care costs by trillions, it also includes tax increases and cuts to projected Medicare spending aimed at offsetting those costs. At the time of passage, the CBO concluded that once everything was factored in, the law would reduce deficits by $143 billion over the first decade. In July 2012, an updated forecast shrunk that estimate to $109 billion. The CBO has not done a complete deficit forecast since that July 2012 report, though it has continued to provide updates to the spending forecast.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.
