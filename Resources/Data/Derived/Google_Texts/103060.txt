FOND DU LAC, Wis. (AP) -- A Fond du Lac hospice nurse said he thought he was going to die on Mount Everest when a powerful earthquake in Nepal set off an avalanche.

Andy Land told The Associated Press Saturday his team was on a glacier surrounded by crevasses when they heard roaring April 25, but they only experienced very strong winds.

The 52-year-old said the team abandoned the effort to get to the top and he's now in Phortse (port-SAY'), Nepal. He's trying to return home but because of the destruction it could take another week.

He says he doesn't think he will return because it's such a large undertaking.

He's been calling his effort "Climbing for Hospice" and hopes to still use it to educate people about the need for better end-of-life care.
