BLOOMING GROVE, Pa. (AP) — With the deadly ambush on a state police barracks in the Pocono Mountains, law enforcement in eastern Pennsylvania went on high alert and officers from throughout the region, including New York and New Jersey, joined in a massive search for the shooter or shooters.

But after scouring dense woods on foot and by helicopter Saturday, authorities suspected the assailant had left the area. They had no one in custody as midnight neared, a state police spokesman said.

Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said the attack Friday night that left one trooper dead and another critically wounded was directed at state police and a “very dangerous, armed criminal” eluded quick capture.

“This attack was an ambush. Our troopers were … shot without warning and really had no chance to defend themselves,” Noonan told reporters Saturday afternoon. “It’s a cowardly attack. It’s an attack upon all of us in society.”

Law enforcement officers searched state game lands surrounding the barracks in Blooming Grove, in Pike County, and beyond Saturday. Several roads around the barracks, including parts of Interstate 84, were closed.

“There has been an exhaustive search conducted by hundreds of members of law enforcement,” said Lt. Colonel George Bivens. “We have canvassed the wooded areas, neighborhoods. We are convinced this individual is no longer in that immediate area.”

Police interviewed a man they called a “person of interest,” but Noonan said authorities are talking to hundreds of people as part of the investigation. He stressed the man is not a suspect.

The troopers were ambushed around 10:50 p.m. Friday as one of them was leaving the barracks and another was arriving. Cpl. Bryon Dickson of Dunmore was killed and Trooper Alex Douglass was injured.
