The homes, located near the intersection of Shelbyville and Flat Rock roads, would be within walking distance to a commercial center, which would feature \"English cottage\" style storefronts.\n\nPlans for the shopping center, were first approved by the Planning Commission in 2006, said zoning attorney Bill Bardenwerper, who represents Blacketer. Ohio-based gourmet grocery store Dorothy Lane Market signed a 24-month contract in 2007 to anchor the development, but the economy tanked shortly after, he said. In 2009, Dorothy Lane Market did not renew its contract, and Blacketer was forced to have a new set of plans approved by Planning and Design Services.\n\nA 2007 rendering of the Shoppes at Gardiner Park depicted plans for a grocery store, a coffee shop and an office building.

The fueling station has been moved away from the main entrance on Shelbyville Road to the far west side of the development, he said, and the proposed layout of the center has changed completely.\n\nThe developers have also redesigned storefronts to adhere to the \"English cottage\" style initially promised, and more sidewalks were added to the plans to encourage more pedestrian traffic.\n\nNow that plans have been approved, plans for Eastwood Market and Cafe's storefront, which have been on hold while the proposed shopping center was reviewed by the Planning Commission, can move forward.\n\nMORE |Read The Courier-Journal's story about Eastwood Market and Cafe\n\nReporter Kirsten Clark can be reached at (502) 582-4144 or on Twitter by following @kirstenlmclark.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1k6w8bo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "After years of delays, plans for a shopping center adjacent to an Eastwood subdivision will finally move forward.
