Posted Monday through Friday right here at www.abcnews.com\n\nCompiled by ABC News' Jayce Henderson, Amanda VanAllen, Will Cantine and Carrie Halperin\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA ABC News' Matthew Larotonda and Abby Phillip: \" Obama Stumps to Make Va. Gov's Race a Tea Party Referendum\" With two days remaining before Virginians head to the polls to pick their next governor, President Obama stumped for his fellow Democrat in the race, Terry McAuliffe, today as Republican Ken Cuccinelli crisscrossed the state in last-minute rallies. But the gubernatorial election has been transformed by both sides into a referendum on national politics. Speaking to a crowd of 1,600 in the Washington suburbs, the president attempted to associate Cuccinelli with the congressional GOP and the memory of the recent government shutdown. LINK\n\nHEALTHCARE The Boston Globe's Joan Vennochi: \" Obama's rosy speech at Faneuil Hall isn't enough\" President Obama came to Massachusetts looking for love and preaching bipartisanship as he tries to fix the debacle known as the rollout of his signature health care law. Love, he got. An adoring crowd assembled at Faneuil Hall cheered his plea for compromise and patience. LINK\n\nThe Washington Times' Tom Howell Jr.: \" Medicaid preference could strap states under health care law\" House Republicans suspect the White House has more Obamacare data than it is letting on, sparking a tug of war that is playing out amid fears that Medicaid enrollment could far outpace requests for private insurance under President Obama's program. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, Michigan Republican, sent a stern letter Friday to Marilyn Tavenner, the federal official closest to the health care law's implementation, threatening to subpoena the records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. LINK\n\nThe Los Angeles Times' Kathleen Hennessey: \" President Was Told Healthcare Website Would Work, Official Says\" President Obama was assured that the healthcare insurance website was ready to launch on Oct. 1, even as private contractors and some administration officials knew the site had failed in early testing, a senior White House advisor said Sunday. Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer said the president repeatedly asked about the healthcare.gov website, a key piece of his 2010 healthcare overhaul legislation, and was told it would meet his expectations.\n\nCONGRESS The New York Times' Jeremy W. Peters: \" Senate Vote on Workplace Bias Against Gays Poses a Test for the G.O.P.\" A major test of how carefully Republicans can navigate the intraparty politics of sexuality will come on Monday, when the Senate holds a crucial vote on a bill to outlaw workplace discrimination against gay men, lesbians and transgender people. The anticipated vote comes four months after the Supreme Court invalidated a federal ban on recognizing same-sex marriages, and nearly a year after some conservative leaders warned that losses in the 2012 elections exposed the party as being out of touch with much of the country on social issues. LINK\n\nPolitico's James Hogmann: \" Cuccinelli fights off stench of doom \" In politics, it is generally not a good omen when a candidate's supporters argue that he still has a chance of victory - if the opponent's supporters neglect to vote. But this was Virginia Republican Chairman Pat Mullins's version of the power of positive thinking in an interview this weekend. LINK\n\nEDWARD SNOWDEN USA Today's William Cummings: \" Snowden justifies leaks in 'manifesto'\" The German magazine Der Spiegel published an open letter it says was written by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden titled, A Manifesto for the Truth, in which Snowden said calls for surveillance program reforms justify his alleged decision to leak classified information. \"Citizens have to fight against the suppression of information about affairs of essential importance for the public,\" Snowden wrote according to a translation by Reuters. \"Those who speak the truth are not committing a crime.\" LINK\n\nPENTAGON The Wall Street Journal's Julian Barnes: \" Pentagon Toils to Build a Bomber on a Budget\" When a military contractor showed Col. Chad Stevenson a design for the Air Force's top secret plane of the future, he began to worry. \"They were showing this really nice fold out bed, this nice refrigerator and microwave, a kind of lounge-provision area,\" Col. Stevenson recalled of the recent design. The contractor, Lockheed Martin, LMT +0.91% didn't offer an estimate for such flying comforts. But Col. Stevenson imagined a publicity nightmare in the making: a $300,000 kitchenette as the latter-day symbol of Pentagon excess-the $600 toilet seat for the 21st century.
