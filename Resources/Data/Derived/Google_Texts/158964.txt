ST. LOUIS — Chicago Cubs closer Hector Rondon got stuck in the bullpen bathroom for several minutes after Game 1 of the NL Division Series.

Joe Walsh, St. Louis’ director of stadium operations, said the lock malfunctioned after Friday night’s game, a 4-0 Cardinals win.

Walsh said city fire department officials had been on standby before personnel got the lock to function.
