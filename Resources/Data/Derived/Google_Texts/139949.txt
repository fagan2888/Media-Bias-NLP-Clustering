Given the fact that state Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens has portrayed himself as the Affordable Care Act’s No. 1 obstructionist in Georgia, it’s no surprise that Democrats have fielded a candidate against him.

Elizabeth “Liz” Johnson of Statesboro, a former member of the Democratic National Committee who describes herself as a 40-year veteran of the insurance industry, announced her candidacy this morning.

From the press release:

“The incumbent, Ralph Hudgens, has a long history of pursuing a misguided personal agenda rather than working to serve Georgia citizens. His narrow policies have hurt Georgia's reputation nationally, and have hurt economic development at a time when Georgians are struggling to pay their bills. Some hospitals have been forced to close their doors, and others are on the verge of closing. Our citizens deserve better insurance protection than this. We must have a leader in this office,” said Johnson.

U.S. Rep. Tom Price is front-and-center in a Wall Street Journal piece today, looking at the GOP’s wary moves toward their own overhaul of the American health care system:

Republicans have promised to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act, but the GOP House has staged votes only on repeal, in part to avoid the sort of scrutiny that inevitably comes with specific proposals. Some Republicans say that needs to change. "You can't beat something with nothing," said Rep. Tom Price (R., Ga.), who has proposed legislation to modify—but not fully rewrite—the tax treatment of health insurance. "More and more members [of Congress] are discussing the imperative for us to have a positive alternative." ….For decades, employers have been allowed to buy their workers health insurance without either the company or the employees owing taxes on the value of the coverage. Republicans have long proposed replacing that break with a new tax credit for all Americans with insurance—part of a broader plan to sever the link between employment and health care that the party believes would induce consumers to demand lower and more transparent prices, thus trimming health costs.

On a somewhat similar note, GOP congressman and Senate candidate Jack Kingston was in Valdosta on Monday, again walking back a November statement that the GOP ought to respect the working parts of Obamacare. From WALB-TV:

"I think we really need to de-fund Obamacare and start all over again," said Kingston. "In the absence of being able to de fund it, we need to be able to dismantle it."

One of the Atlanta Braves soon-to-be neighbors is demanding some equivalent treatment. From the Marietta Daily Journal:

One of Cobb’s high-profile corporate citizens is threatening to leave if it doesn’t receive “significant” tax breaks in return for an expansion that includes 200 to 300 employees at an average salary of about $75,000. The Weather Channel, headquartered in Cumberland and owned by NBC, has never asked for subsidies before, but it now needs a reason not to leave Cobb, said Kathy Angell, senior vice president of The Weather Channel’s taxation division, in a Nov. 1 email to Brooks Mathis, executive vice president of the Cobb Chamber of Commerce. The company opened its current offices on Interstate North Parkway at I-75 and I-285 in 1996.

Come qualifying in March, the state Senate seat now occupied by Jason Carter will open up when the Democratic grandson of the former president signs on as a formal opponent to GOP incumbent Gov. Nathan Deal.

We already have two candidates in the race for the Decatur-based, District 42 seat: Attorneys Kyle Williams, chair of the Decatur Education Foundation, and Russell Waldon have signed the first bit of paperwork needed to establish their campaigns.

But we’re told that a third lawyer will wait until next month to enter the contest – one who may have a leg up on the spot. Former state House member Elena Parent, who ousted Republican Jill Chambers in 2010 – then was redistricted out, has told friends that she’s readying her website and gathering supporters.

Parent worked as chief of staff to Carter’s predecessor, David Adelman, so she already knows the terrain. And when she declined to challenge state Rep. Scott Holcomb, D-Atlanta, with whom she was lumped by Republicans in 2011, she earned more than a few IOUs.

Remember our post from yesterday, the one where Gov. Nathan Deal urged lawmakers to be cautious with tax proposals in an election year?

Dalton Mayor David Pennington, who is running an Republican anti-tax campaign to unseat the governor, didn't like that too much. He sent out a dispatch claiming Deal "is selling the people of Georgia a pig in a poke" and that he hasn't done enough to reduce taxes. From Pennington:

"From the car tax to the nursing home bed tax to his desire for a $1 billion dollar transportation tax, Nathan Deal wants more of your hard-earned money to fuel his spending increases."

Deal's camp, of course, is quick to point out the overhaul of the car tag tax, the phase-out of a manufacturing tax and new agricultural exemptions are paying dividends. They just need time to settle in, he says.

We got hold of an invitation for a fundraiser for state Sen. Jason Carter, running for governor on the Democratic side of the ledger. The Dec. 19 event at his law firm, Bondurant, Mixson & Ellmore, shows how the party establishment is already lining up behind him.

Among the sponsors are former Gov. Roy Barnes, former party chair Dave Worley, former ambassador Gordon Giffin – a major supporter of U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn, ex-U.S. Rep. Buddy Darden and party insider Jeremy Berry.

This curious tweet was sent out by Shira Center, Roll Call's political editor, and it had more than a few speculating it was Mike Collins, the son of former Rep. Mac Collins who is seeking the open seat in Georgia's 10th Congressional District. The younger Collins, you'll recall, made a distinct impression last week with a rather painful ad that caught national attention.
