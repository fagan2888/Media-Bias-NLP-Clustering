Now that the website is up and running, paper applications will no longer be accepted. Enrollment for SHOP is open year-round.\n\nJohn Rood, president of the Chicago-based Next Step Test Preparation, already provides his eight full-time employees with health insurance he purchased through an insurance broker. But he logged on to the government-sponsored website last weekend to check out the SHOP options.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t made the final decision to switch yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing if there are better prices for similar levels of care.\u201d\n\nSHOP lets businesses with 50 or fewer full-time employees compare and purchase insurance plans. Employers with fewer than 25 employees are also eligible for a tax credit worth up to 50% of their premium contribution.\n\nThe federally facilitated SHOP marketplace is available to employers in 33 states. The other 17 states and the District of Columbia have chosen to set up their own statewide exchanges, which can be accessed through links on Healthcare.gov. While offering health benefits isn\u2019t mandatory for employers with fewer than 50 workers, it helps attract talent.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely a cornerstone of being competitive as an employer,\u201d Rood says.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees the SHOP marketplaces, doesn\u2019t have data regarding federal SHOP enrollment yet, Shelby Venson, a CMS communications officer said in an email. Enrollment for the 18 individually run SHOP exchanges was \u201csignificantly lower than expected\u201d prior to the launch of the online marketplace, according to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office earlier this month.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that very few businesses know about the SHOP marketplace,\u201d says Erik Rettig, northeast outreach manager of the Small Business Majority, a national small business advocacy organization. \u201cI think once businesses know about SHOP, they\u2019re going to be excited to jump on board and at least peruse their options.\u201d\n\nThe SHOP website opened early in five states\u2014Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey and Ohio\u2014to let business owners test the site before its launch. Rood tried logging on during this early access period but says he got an error message. But when he logged on again the day open enrollment for 2015 coverage began, he says it was \u201ca fantastic experience with no hiccups or speed bumps.\u201d\n\nRood says he will take more time to consider his options and talk to his employees before deciding to switch to a plan through the government marketplace. Like many small business owners, the final decision will come down to affordability.\n\n\u201cUltimately, business owners are practical,\u201d says Michaela Hahn Burriss, the Small Business Majority\u2019s Ohio outreach manager. \u201cThey do what makes the most sense for their businesses.\u201d\n\nHealthy business illustration via Shutterstock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Small business owners can peruse options for health insurance for their employees on the SHOP marketplace.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "NerdWallet", "description": "Small business owners can peruse options for health insurance for their employees on the SHOP marketplace.", "title": "SHOP Health Insurance Marketplace Opens for Small Businesses", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shutterstock_125307056.jpg", "height": 647}, "updated_time": "2015-11-12T15:51:22-07:00", "url": "https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/small-business/shop-health-insurance-small-businesses/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Small business owners can peruse options for health insurance for their employees on the SHOP marketplace.", "creator": "@NerdWallet", "image": "https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shutterstock_125307056.jpg", "title": "SHOP Health Insurance Marketplace Opens for Small Businesses", "site": "@NerdWallet", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 108521893501}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NerdWallet", "section": "Small Business", "published_time": "2014-11-17T16:40:03-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-12T15:51:22-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For the first time, small business owners around the country can now conveniently compare and purchase health insurance packages for their employees through the new Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) online marketplace.\n\u201cMy sense is that very few businesses know about the SHOP marketplace,\u201d says Erik Rettig, northeast outreach manager of the Small Business Majority, a national small business advocacy organization.\n\u201cUltimately, business owners are practical,\u201d says Michaela Hahn Burriss, the Small Business Majority\u2019s Ohio outreach manager.\nJohn Rood, president of the Chicago-based Next Step Test Preparation, already provides his eight full-time employees with health insurance he purchased through an insurance broker.\nLike many small business owners, the final decision will come down to affordability."}
