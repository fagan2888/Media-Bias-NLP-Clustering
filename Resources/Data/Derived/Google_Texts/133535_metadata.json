Fatima\u2019s psychic studio, which has been offering a Romani form of fortune-telling to tourists for two decades, was caught violating a city ordinance which states that psychics may only forecast the future and read the past. Warding off evil spirits and protecting patrons from bad auras is strictly forbidden.\n\nSo when a New York resident issued a formal complaint against Fatima\u2019s, alleging that he paid a psychic $16,800 over several weeks for placing a curse shield on him, police closed in. In an investigation led by Detective Sergeant James A. Page, police learned that the studio\u2019s fortune-teller license was long expired. They forced the studio to shut its doors and make a court appearance.\n\nThe Boston Globe reports:\n\nBut on Monday night, when Fatima\u2019s owner Harry Mitchell went before the city\u2019s licensing board to ask for reinstatement, the lapse worked in Fatima\u2019s favor. Page\u2026said that without a valid license, the shop was not technically operating under the fortuneteller\u2019s ordinance at the time of the cash-for-curse incidents and therefore could not be charged with violating it. Instead, he issued two $100 fines for operating without a license. The board granted a probationary license for Fatima\u2019s to resume operation until the end of the year, provided they promise not to meddle in curses again and work with the New York man to come up with some kind of reimbursement.\n\nMitchell had explained to the Salem Licensing Board earlier this week that he had already settled the dispute with the customer and that he would return the money.\n\nDetective Page told the Boston Globe that while he thought Fatima\u2019s was making money off deception and fraudulence, it would be difficult for police to pursue criminal charges since \u201cpeople are embarrassed and they\u2019re not going to come forward.\u201d\n\nIn response to the allegations, Christian Day, a local warlock who owns two fortune-telling shops and has appeared on Penn & Teller\u2019s Bullshit, said:\n\nIf they\u2019re a fraud, then we\u2019re all frauds, and all religion is a fraud. They\u2019re not regulating the priest who absolves you of your sins and tells you to put some money in the collection basket, or the old lady who sends all her money to Pat Robertson.\n\nIf customers are looking for a reputable place to get their palms read, they might just want to avoid Fatima's completely: the business has received a 1.5 star rating on both Tripadvisor and Yelp with reviews such as, \"I had a palm reading and she didn't even look at my palm,\" \"Fraudulent Gypsies!!!,\" \"She told me I was having a baby!!!! I had a hysterectamy 12 years ago!!!!!,\" and perhaps most tellingly, \"Don't waste your money. Do some research.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Police in Salem, MA\u2014or as it\u2019s often referred to, Witch City, USA\u2014have charged a psychic studio with unlawfully providing curse removal services.", "title": "Police Charge a Salem Psychic with Offering Fraudulent Curse Removal Services", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/11/01/police-charge-a-salem-psychic-with-offer", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13833334917182.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13833334917182.jpg", "description": "Police in Salem, MA\u2014or as it\u2019s often referred to, Witch City,\nUSA\u2014have charged a psychic studio with unlawfully providing curse\nremoval services.
