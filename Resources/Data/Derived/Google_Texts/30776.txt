To cleanse the palate. After two days of plot twists and turns, we need closure.

I feel bad for this poor kid in having to go to bat for his aunt on TV, but it was shrewd to have him there. He’s the only one who can convince the public that all really is well between them. Wouldn’t surprise me if someone ends up starting a collection for her to pay off those medical bills, now that she’s lost her negligence suit. Today’s lynch mob is tomorrow’s GoFundMe, my friends.

Look out for the Hot Air cameo at the beginning.
