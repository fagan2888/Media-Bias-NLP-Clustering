Have you noticed that? I mean they are, they are gloomy. They're like grumpy cat.\"\n\nThe president didn't merely make the reference to the Internet's most miserable and perhaps wealthiest feline.\n\nHe made the Grumpy Cat face too.\n\nIt's rare for an opposition party to ever laud the president for, say, anything. Some might agree, though, that the paralysis that's afflicted our political system for the last few years is the apogee of grumpiness for grumpiness's sake.\n\nHow many, though, other Internet memes might we see being used as the turgid marathon to become our next president takes place?\n\nAfter all, Internet memes have been co-opted by many to communicate with the masses. Delta Airlines created a whole safety video entirely based on them.\n\nSo might we see Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton being compared to the Overly Attached Girlfriend? Could Ted Cruz attempt to soften his sometimes aggressive demeanor by referring to his opponents solely via the medium of LOLcats?\n\nAnd given Mike Huckabee's musical pretensions, he'll surely be tempted to appear in a Gangnam Style video.\n\nDonald Trump hasn't yet referred to somewhat somnolent rival Ben Carson as David After the Dentist, but it's surely close at hand.\n\nMarco Rubio must have already been tempted to show his youthful credentials by Rickrolling his old mentor Jeb Bush.\n\nIf the Democratic race continues to be close, who would be surprised if Bernie Sanders was suddenly likened to either the Dramatic Chipmunk or even the Screaming Goat?\n\nFor her part, Grumpy cat has already achieved a high level of stateswomanship. She's been honored by Madame Tussauds. (She wasn't impressed.)\n\nI wonder how many of our current politicians, when we look back on them in a decade or two, will warrant any sort of respect at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Technically Incorrect: The president suggests his opponents are nothing more than an Internet meme.
