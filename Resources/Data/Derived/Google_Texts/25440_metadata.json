Screen shot/ Lindsay Snow Osborn for Visual.ly\n\nWhen bananas go bad, it\u2019s not that big of a deal; you can always make banana bread. But, how do we manage the rest of our fruit and vegetable haul before it gets to be too late? First, check out our primer on expiration dates. Then, check out this handy infographic from Visual.ly.\n\nFoods unopened, uncut, or uncooked (unless otherwise stated) can last up to months if stored properly, well-beyond their expiration date. Apples, for example, last up to four weeks when stored on the counter or in the pantry; they last up to two months in the refrigerator; and they last up to a whole year when stored in the freezer. Potatoes last up to a month on the counter, up to four months in the refrigerator, but the freezer isn\u2019t recommended as a storage option at all.\n\nFresh vegetables generally tend to remain fresh longer in a moist environment \u2014 so if your refrigerator has a crisper, it may help to extend your haul\u2019s shelf life. One thing to remember is not to store vegetables and fruits in the same crisper drawers, since fruits don\u2019t require as much moisture to stay fresh.\n\nWhat about leftovers? Visual.ly narrows down the most popular foods, like macaroni and cheese, pizza, sandwiches, and spaghetti, and they recommend only keeping them for a few days. Something like mac and cheese can last up to five days, while sandwiches last up to two days.\n\nThe Shelf Life of Food Lindsay Snow Osborn", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "shelf, life, food, pantry, refrigerator, and, freezer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "You like to eat apples and bananas, and with these storage tips, you can safely consume them after they've expired.", "title": "The Shelf Life Of Food, No Matter Where You Store It [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/shelf-life-food-pantry-refrigerator-and-freezer-322446", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/02/17/shelf-life-fruits-and-vegetables_0.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "You like to eat apples and bananas, and with these storage tips, you can safely consume them after they've expired.", "title": "The Shelf Life Of Food, No Matter Where You Store It [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/shelf-life-food-pantry-refrigerator-and-freezer-322446", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/02/17/shelf-life-fruits-and-vegetables_0.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/17/shelf-life-fruits-and-vegetables_0.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-02-17T11:49:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-17T11:50:11-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "You like to eat apples and bananas, and with these storage tips, you can safely consume them after they've expired."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb12e\"", "article_summary": "You like to eat apples and bananas, and with these storage tips, you can safely consume them after they've expired.\nFresh vegetables generally tend to remain fresh longer in a moist environment \u2014 so if your refrigerator has a crisper, it may help to extend your haul\u2019s shelf life.\nThe Shelf Life of Food Lindsay Snow Osborn\nPotatoes last up to a month on the counter, up to four months in the refrigerator, but the freezer isn\u2019t recommended as a storage option at all.\nFoods unopened, uncut, or uncooked (unless otherwise stated) can last up to months if stored properly, well-beyond their expiration date."}
