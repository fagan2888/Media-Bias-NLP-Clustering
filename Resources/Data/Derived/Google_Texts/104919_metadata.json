As a result, doctors are reluctant to participate in Medicaid managed care plans.\n\n\u201cMany physicians limit the number of new Medicaid patients they treat to a ratio of privately insured patients they treat,\u201d Herrick said. \u201cThat is one reason expanding Medicaid will not necessarily boost access to care: many new Medicaid enrollees cannot find doctors who will treat them for the paltry fees Medicaid pays them.\u201d\n\nLimited Access\n\nThe Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigators called 1,800 providers listed in Medicaid managed care plans to assess availability and the time it took to get an appointment for enrollees. Physicians called included cardiologists, family practice doctors, obstetricians, orthopedists, pediatricians, and urologists, and covered both urban and rural areas.\n\nAbout 35 percent of providers were not at the location listed by the Medicaid plan. According to the OIG report, \u201cCallers were sometimes told that the practice had never heard of the provider or that the provider had practiced at the location in the past but had retired or left the practice.\u201d\n\nAnother 8 percent of providers listed by Medicaid managed care plans either are not participating in that plan or did participate but aren\u2019t accepting new Medicaid patients.\n\nThe study also found primary care providers are harder to get an appointment with than specialists, but the wait times for specialists are typically longer.\n\nEnrollment, But Not Access\n\nExpansion of Medicaid was one of the key components of the Affordable Care Act, leading to the enrollment of an additional 10 million Americans in the program in 2014, many of whom will be in managed care plans.\n\nBut increased enrollment may not translate into increased access to care for many Medicaid participants, according to OIG.\n\n\u201cWithout adequate access, enrollees cannot receive the preventive care and treatment necessary to achieve positive health outcomes and improved quality of life,\u201d the report concluded. It also noted, \u201cLong wait times can have a significant impact on patient care.\u2026 That so many providers could not offer appointments within a month raises concerns about enrollees\u2019 ability to obtain timely access to care.\u201d\n\nFurther Reimbursement Cuts\n\n\n\nMany state Medicaid programs are making deep cuts in payments to primary care doctors as additional funding that boosted fees paid to them, made available under the Affordable Care Act, ran out on December 31, 2014.\n\nA study by the Urban Institute estimates doctors who have been receiving the enhanced payments will have their fees for primary care cut by 43 percent, on average.\n\n\u201cPhysicians cannot pay their office overhead and expenses with this poor reimbursement,\u201d said Dr. Roger Stark, a health care policy analyst at the Washington Policy Center and a retired physician. \u201cConsequently, our existing Medicaid patients have an increasingly difficult time accessing care.\n\nStark said Medicaid reimburses doctors on average 40 percent of what private insurance pays. \u201cThe expansion of Medicaid through the ACA will only make this access problem worse,\u201d Stark said.\n\nDr. John Dale Dunn, an emergency physician and policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, says reducing payments necessarily reduces access.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is the most notoriously low-paying program,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cIn fact, there are very few physicians who like taking care of Medicaid patients, since it's an indigent care plan and offers the lowest form of payment.\u201d\n\nKenneth Artz (iamkenartz@hotmail.com) is a freelance writer for The Heartland Institute.\n\n\n\nInternet info: Access to Care: Provider Availability in Medicaid Managed Care, Office of the Inspector General, 2014. http://heartland.org/policy-documents/access-care-provider-availability-medicaid-managed-care", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "\u201cMany physicians limit the number of new Medicaid patients they treat to a ratio of privately insured patients they treat,\u201d Herrick said.\nInternet info: Access to Care: Provider Availability in Medicaid Managed Care, Office of the Inspector General, 2014. http://heartland.org/policy-documents/access-care-provider-availability-medicaid-managed-care\nFor doctors who are accepting new Medicaid patients, the average wait to get an appointment is two weeks, with a quarter of patients having waits of one month or longer.\nAs a result, doctors are reluctant to participate in Medicaid managed care plans.\n\u201cConsequently, our existing Medicaid patients have an increasingly difficult time accessing care."}
