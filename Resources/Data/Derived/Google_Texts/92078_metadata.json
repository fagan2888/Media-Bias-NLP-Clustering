Congress held hearings on the subject in December, with some of the most damning testimony coming from leading liberal intellectuals. For the past five years, no one has worked more diligently to hold this Administration accountable than Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), who represents northern San Diego County, and chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nAfter serving in the Army and reaching the rank of captain, Issa built an impressive private-sector business resume, founding Directed Electronics, manufacturer of the famed Viper vehicle anti-theft system. He also held the chairmanship of the Consumer Electronics Association, host of the landmark Consumer Electronics Show held each year in Las Vegas. He won his seat in the House of Representatives in 2001. During his years in Congress, he has earned a 91 percent lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, along with high marks from both economic conservative organizations such as Americans for Prosperity, and social conservative groups like the Family Research Council and the National Right to Life Committee.\n\nA noted critic of the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was used to bail out banks after the 2008 financial crisis, and a longtime skeptic of housing policies carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Issa made a speciality of transparency and accountability in government, culminating in his chairmanship of House Oversight throughout the Obama Administration. They\u2019ve given him plenty to work on, particularly with respect to the big scandals the mainstream media didn\u2019t want to discuss: Operation Fast and Furious, the Benghazi attacks, and the IRS targeting of conservative groups.\n\nIt was the House Oversight Committee\u2019s investigation of Operation Fast and Furious after the murder of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010 that brought the details of this bizarre Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms program to light, and revealed the involvement of numerous other government agencies.\n\nThe idea behind letting guns \u201cwalk\u201d across the border into Mexico, with the ultimate goal of taking down the drug kingpins who use them to rub out enemies of the cartels, was not new. But gun walking had never before been attempted on the scale of Fast and Furious, and never with such lax security precautions. The House Oversight Committee\u2019s requests for documentation were stonewalled and slow-walked by the Administration, eventually resulting in the invocation of executive privilege by President Obama, and the full House of Representatives voting to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt\u2026 which are incongruous developments for something originally presented to the American people as the work of a few overzealous ATF agents in a single field office.\n\nThe same pattern of obfuscation and delay met House Oversight\u2019s investigation into the Benghazi attacks, where Issa\u2019s committee issued a report accusing the State Department of obstructing congressional investigators, and chided the nominally independent Accountability Review Board for a distinct lack of enthusiasm for holding anyone accountable. Benghazi remains the debacle absolutely no one was responsible for, with the very fleeting exception of four mid-level bureaucrats who were briefly placed on administrative leave by incoming Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nThe full dimensions of the IRS scandal were revealed in Rep. Issa\u2019s committee chambers, as the story mutated from claims of a few low-level rogue agents in Cincinnati running wild, to a scandal that involved officials at the highest levels of the Internal Revenue Service\u2026 one of whom, Tax Exempt Organizations manager Lois Lerner, took the extraordinary step of invoking the Fifth Amendment to escape from testimony before House Oversight. The Treasury Inspector General\u2019s report requested by Issa and Subcommittee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) prompted Lerner to formally acknowledge that the IRS improperly targeted conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status.\n\nIt has been the Administration\u2019s lack of candor \u2013 its extreme reluctance to make documents and witnesses available \u2013 that make these hearings so chaotic, frequently obliging Issa to remind House Democrats and the White House that his function is a duty of Congress, not a sideshow in Washington\u2019s never-ending spin wars. In an Administration that often seems to be composed entirely of rogue low-level employees, Issa never stops asking where the orders really came from\u2026 and they always turn out to be emanating from a higher level than agency heads or the White House initially claimed.\n\nThe public would not know much about these scandals, or the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, without Issa\u2019s efforts. The reason we know that only six people signed up on ObamaCare\u2019s first day is that House Oversight came into possession of internal Administration notes. Most of the details about the botched design of the Healthcare.gov website, and the so-called \u201ctech surge\u201d intended to fix it, have emerged from Oversight committee hearings and document requests. Issa and his colleagues are the only people in government who seem interested in scrutinizing the hugely expensive \u201cnavigator\u201d program of ObamaCare consumer assistants. And while the Administration touts the radical expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act as a huge success, the House Oversight Committee conducted an investigation into the New York program \u2013 the largest in the country \u2013 that led to a $1.2 billion crackdown on overpayments by the Department of Heath and Human Services.\n\nIn addition to his oversight duties, Rep. Issa has also been trying to reform the U.S. Postal Service, another effort that has often ended with Democrats huffing that they don\u2019t want to talk about it. Postal reform might not seem like the most cutting-edge topic with a hurricane of emails blowing through our lives, but that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s important \u2013 the USPS still provides an important service, but its policies are a strange relic of a bygone era when communication occurred largely on printed paper, delivered by hand to the front doors of every house. Its business model has never been adjusted to reflect Information Age realities. It operates under rules unlike any other government agency or private business. A huge amount of taxpayer money, and a large number of jobs, are at stake.\n\nIssa has done excellent work explaining the relevance of the Postal Service to a generation that thinks \u201cmail\u201d either appears instantly on their smartphones, or is delivered by snails. He\u2019s also taken on some powerful special interests in a long-running reform battle that is often eclipsed by more spectacular Washington developments. Issa\u2019s reform proposals have been adjusted in response to criticism from his opponents, in the spirit of constructive compromise that everyone supposedly desires from Congress. He\u2019s working to bring a venerable institution into a future that was unimaginable at the time of its inception. What could be more conservative than that?\n\nRep. Issa is one of the GOP\u2019s heaviest hitters on social media, from Facebook and Reddit to Twitter. Some observers find his toughest competition for the top Republican online presence to be the staff of the House Oversight Committee he chairs, as they bring video of major committee hearings online with stunning speed. Issa is noted for his willingness to engage with fans and detractors alike online.\n\nIntellectual property rights and Internet security have always been among his top legislative priorities. He was a key part of the resistance to SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, a bill that was considered virtually unstoppable until Issa and a few of his colleagues started asking tough questions about it. His dedication to a free and open Internet appears prominently in his profile on every online service (and he seems to have a presence on nearly all of them.) He has spoken of the open Internet as an important frontier for conservatism.\n\nHe also knows how to have fun online. Despite his formidable reputation as lead congressional investigator, he\u2019s a reliable source for cat photos. He has a good grip on how to use humor to attract viral attention online. During the ObamaCare launch disaster, he authored a photo-illustrated blog post entitled \u201cEight Cats Who Called 1-800-ObamaCare But Still Couldn\u2019t Get Healthcare.\u201d Cat Number 5 was especially amusing.\n\nIt is strange, and disturbing, to watch some on the Left applaud the Obama Administration\u2019s ability to escape oversight, casting Darrell Issa as Javert to Barack Obama\u2019s Jean Valjean. Obviously the functions of Issa\u2019s office will lead to partisan grumbling when the White House is held by the opposite party\u2026 and accusations that House Oversight has become a slumbering lapdog when it\u2019s controlled by the President\u2019s party. But the tactics used by this Administration to thwart oversight merit no applause. It is to Issa\u2019s credit that he keeps demanding document and testimony until he gets them. His critics never seem able to make the case that he\u2019s asking the wrong questions, or has no right to ask them.\n\nWhen the Left\u2019s crows that Oversight hearings can\u2019t seem to get anyone fired, they reveal a dismaying lack of interest in the honest and efficient management of the massive government they believe morally entitled, and intellectually qualified, to run so much of American life. They\u2019re also forgetting how many astonishing things have been said by nervous officials in Issa\u2019s hearing rooms.\n\nTransparency is a quintessentially conservative government attribute, an acknowledgement of the primacy of the people as masters of a State that should be allowed to conceal only a very few, highly sensitive aspects of its operation from them. The Left believes government should know plenty about its citizens, without returning the favor. The federal government is immense and powerful now, boasting an executive branch that holds diminishing respect for the legislature. We are told that a great many things must be kept hidden from us for our own good. For his tireless insistence on the free flow of information from government to its citizens, his confidence that free people can make wise decisions when provided with good data, and his determination to restrain the size of government, HUMAN EVENTS names Rep. Darrell Issa Conservative of the Year for 2013.\n\nChairman Issa issued a statement in response to the award:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Transparency, accountability, efficiency, and the rule of law are vital attributes of conservative government.", "title": "Conservative of the Year: Rep.
