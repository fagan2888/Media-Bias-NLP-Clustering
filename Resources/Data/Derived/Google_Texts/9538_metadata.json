Along with virtual visits that let parents consult a pediatric clinician late at night, for instance, Klasko believes walk-in clinics are needed to offer healthcare options to patients closer to come.\n\nJefferson, for one, is among a few dozen health systems nationally that have taken up the retail clinic strategy, though in many regions, including Philadelphia, walk-in clinics remain the provenance of private companies.\n\nAbout 30 percent of the country\u2019s 10,000-plus urgent care and walk-in clinics are owned by corporate firms like CVS or Walgreens or private investors, 20 percent are owned by physicians groups, 14 percent by solo practices, and 25 percent by hospital systems, according to an analysis by Elliott Jeter of VMG. One sign of the corporate interest in walk-in clinics: UnitedHealth Group, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, recently spent $1.5 billion to acquire MedExpress Urgent Care, a West Virginia-based operator of 141 clinics in 11 states.\n\n[Also: Whole Foods CEO floats plan to enter healthcare, eyes clinics]\n\nAs the owner of one of the original walk-in retail clinics, CVS Health has taken a strategy of operating most MinuteClinics as stand alone operations, but also of collaboration in some areas. CVS has 50 MinuteClinic collaborations with 50 regional hospitals and health systems, which include electronic health record integration.\n\nAmong those health systems are Dignity Health, Sharp HealthCare, UCLA Health, the Cleveland Clinic, Henry Ford Health System, Barnabas Health and Dartmouth Hitchcock. \u201cThe affiliations encourage collaboration among healthcare providers, CVS pharmacists and MinuteClinic practitioners to improve coordination of care for patients seen at clinic locations,\u201d CVS Health said.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cvs-says-minuteclinics-hit-25-million-visits-walk-service-takes-hold", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/minute-clinic-feature_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "CVS is planning to open more than 100 new clinics this year -- recent ones opened in Nebraska, New Mexico and Wisconsin -- and could surpass 1,500 locations by 2017.", "title": "CVS says MinuteClinics hit 25 million visits as walk-in service takes hol"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/minute-clinic-feature_0.gif"}, "description": "CVS is planning to open more than 100 new clinics this year -- recent ones opened in Nebraska, New Mexico and Wisconsin -- and could surpass 1,500 locations by 2017.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CVS says MinuteClinics hit 25 million visits as walk-in service takes hol"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "CVS Health this week said its MinuteClinics walk-in retail clinics have seen 25 million visits, suggesting these types of pharmacy-run clinics are not only here to stay, but are becoming a fixture in healthcare.&#13; MinuteClinics have been around for 15 years and were taken over by CVS nine years ago.&#13; CVS Health claims its clinics are the largest and fastest-growing purveyor of retail healthcare, with almost 1,000 locations across 31 states and Washington D.C.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "CVS Health this week said its MinuteClinics walk-in retail clinics have seen 25 million visits, suggesting these types of pharmacy-run clinics are not only here to stay, but are becoming a fixture in healthcare.\nAmong those health systems are Dignity Health, Sharp HealthCare, UCLA Health, the Cleveland Clinic, Henry Ford Health System, Barnabas Health and Dartmouth Hitchcock.\nImage from CVS Health.\nCVS has 50 MinuteClinic collaborations with 50 regional hospitals and health systems, which include electronic health record integration.\n\u201cThe affiliations encourage collaboration among healthcare providers, CVS pharmacists and MinuteClinic practitioners to improve coordination of care for patients seen at clinic locations,\u201d CVS Health said."}
