The GOP candidates were asked to weigh in on the recent feud between Apple and the U.S. federal government as one of the final debate topics on Thursday evening. When questioned on their position about whether or not Apple should comply with the FBI's court order following the December 2015 San Bernardino shooting, candidates Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich all agreed and expressed their support for the U.S. government.

"Their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States," Rubio said. "Yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order," Cruz echoed.

"Absolutely, I would expect Apple to comply with the court order," Carson agreed.

Kasich then pointed a finger at President Barack Obama and his silence on the dispute. "The problem is not right now between the administration and Apple," he stated, then posing the question, "Where has the president been?" The Ohio governor closed the topic with a criticism of Obama's failure to speak publicly on the governmental issue: "The president of the United States should be convening a meeting ... this is a failure of his leadership."
