Charlie Baker comments on Donald Trump's lack of presidential timber. (State House News Service image)\n\nSTATE HOUSE \u2014 Gov. Charlie Baker reiterated that he is \u201cunlikely\u201d to endorse a candidate in the Republican presidential primary and encouraged reporters to put the same question to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and an influential voice in liberal politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to focus on my day job, because this is going to be a long, grinding, torturous process between now and the end of it, and I don\u2019t want to be distracted by it,\u201d Baker said Thursday on his way from an event back into the governor\u2019s office suite when a reporter asked him about Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\nEarlier in the cycle, Baker had some pointed criticisms of Trump and earlier this month the Republican governor endorsed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie before a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary preceded Christie\u2019s exit from the race.\n\nBaker said he was influenced to publicly back Christie because of the results of the Iowa caucuses, where U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, an outspoken conservative from Texas, and Trump, a controversial real estate developer from New York, took first and second place. Trump appears poised to win the Massachusetts Republican primary by a healthy margin.\n\nA column published by Politico floated Baker as a potential Trump running mate, along with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others.\n\n\u201cSeveral hundred thousand people sent that to me, mostly with smiley faces next to it,\u201d Baker said Thursday. \u201cPeople know that my interest and my focus is Massachusetts. I\u2019m not interested in Washington. I\u2019ve never expressed an interest in Washington. I\u2019m interested in Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nOn Boston Herald Radio on Thursday, Sen. Dan Wolf, a Harwich Democrat, said Trump is \u201cscary\u201d and bases his campaign on \u201cfear and anger and xenophobia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think when people from the business world get into politics, you really have to sit down and say, \u2018OK what\u2019s my role, what\u2019s the difference between running a corporation and serving the public,'\u201d said Wolf, who opted against running for re-election to the Senate this year. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that Donald has had that conversation with himself because he seems to think he\u2019s going to run the United States of America like he runs a corporation. It\u2019s very different.\u201d\n\nWolf said he thinks of democracy as \u201cthe civic expression of our collective will,\u201d and believes that \u201cin Donald\u2019s mind it\u2019s the civic expression of the Trump will.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a scary person,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI\u2019m a guy all about inclusion. Donald Trump is somebody who is all about exclusion and his campaign is based on fear and anger and xenophobia.\u201d\n\nAnd though he supports Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Wolf said he will certainly support Hillary Clinton if she becomes the Democratic nominee and would \u201cdo anything to stop the Trump juggernaut.\u201d\n\nBaker, who has maintained he does not know who he will vote for in Tuesday\u2019s Massachusetts primary, also said \u201cit\u2019s unlikely\u201d he would endorse again. Elected Republicans in Massachusetts have generally been split between U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Trump picked up his first endorsement from an elected official in Massachusetts this week when Whitman Rep. Geoff Diehl threw his support behind the poll leader.\n\nThe Swampscott Republican also steered inquiring reporters toward Warren, a Cambridge Democrat, who has yet to throw her weight behind either candidate in the Democratic contest.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m going to do and I certainly hope you\u2019re going to ask every other elected official in Massachusetts the same question,\u201d Baker said. When told that people value his opinion on the matter, Baker said, \u201cThey value U.S. senators\u2019 opinions, too, but nobody seems to be asking them.\u201d\n\nU.S. Sen. Ed Markey has endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for president.\n\n\u2014 Written by Andy Metzger and Colin A.
