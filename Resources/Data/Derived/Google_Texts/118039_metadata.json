Tinga was on birth control in Los Angeles to prevent breeding with close relatives.\n\nLowland gorillas, although they number 20,000 to 125,000, are listed as critically endangered because of accelerating population loss due to deforestation from mining and tree-cutting, hunting and the Ebola virus.\n\nAt the Denver Zoo, Stern said, \u201cthe hope is babies.\u201d\n\nHe and a veterinarian drove the van hauling Tinga, in a stainless steel cage, directly from the Los Angeles Zoo, stopping only for gas.\n\nBack in 2004, Tinga\u2019s family of five was housed in Denver during renovations at the Los Angeles Zoo. She was born here, then grew up in Los Angeles under one of the \u201cspecies survival plans\u201d in which zoos nationwide constantly trade captive animals to try to ensure genetically robust captive populations.\n\nTinga recently began beating on family members, approaching the age where gorillas in nature leave their families. Joining Jim and two females, Bassa and Angel, in Denver is considered optimal, Stern said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re psychologically built to leave their families at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s doing very, very well. There\u2019s been a lot less aggression than there might have been. She\u2019s still a little nervous around the other females \u2014 wisely so.\u201d\n\nThe Denver Gorilla Run raises money for the Mountain Gorilla Conservation Fund, which has helped raise the numbers of mountain gorillas in Rwanda from 248 in 1985 to 880.\n\nColorado runners pay $99.95 to enter the race. They must wear full gorilla costumes. Previous races were downtown. Winners complete the course in 18 to 22 minutes. A record 1,061 raced last year.\n\nA Denver Zoo partnership with race organizers and conservationists has led to a beer venture, too. Aframomum \u201cgrains of paradise,\u201d favored by gorillas in Africa, now is being grown by the Denver Zoo. Colorado brewers discovered the grain can be used to produce a pleasing Silverback Pale Ale. Each pint purchased results in a $1.25 contribution to the conservation fund.\n\nHarvard-educated zoo primatologist Stern, who also directs a zoo-backed New Nature Foundation conservation project in Uganda, points to the fact that gorillas share 99 percent of genes with humans with obvious similarities in ears, eyelashes and fingerprints.\n\n\u201cPeople look at gorillas and they bond with them quickly \u2014 because of our close genetic relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cThey look like family.\u201d\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700 or bfinley@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver goes gorilla for Tinga and gorilla conservation in Africa", "title": "Denver goes gorilla for Tinga and gorilla conservation in Africa", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/01/denver-goes-gorilla-for-tinga-and-gorilla-conservation-in-africa/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141101_060456_tinga-denver-zoo.jpg", "height": 686}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141101_060456_tinga-denver-zoo.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-01T18:54:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:06:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdddff\"", "article_summary": "Back in 2004, Tinga\u2019s family of five was housed in Denver during renovations at the Los Angeles Zoo.\nAframomum \u201cgrains of paradise,\u201d favored by gorillas in Africa, now is being grown by the Denver Zoo.\nTinga was on birth control in Los Angeles to prevent breeding with close relatives.\nAt the Denver Zoo, Stern said, \u201cthe hope is babies.\u201dHe and a veterinarian drove the van hauling Tinga, in a stainless steel cage, directly from the Los Angeles Zoo, stopping only for gas.\nA Denver Zoo partnership with race organizers and conservationists has led to a beer venture, too."}
