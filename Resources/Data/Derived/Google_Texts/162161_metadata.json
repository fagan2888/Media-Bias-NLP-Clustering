We are saying the American system \u2014 of government bound by law \u2014 is exceptional, and allowed liberty and the spirit of enterprise to flourish, thus allowing America to quickly become the richest nation in world history.\n\nOf course, Obama has also often mocked the idea of \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism\u201d \u2014 for example, famously saying this shocker at a NATO Summit in Strasbourg, France, in 2009:\n\n\u201cI believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.\u201d\n\nNo doubt, America is rapidly losing the distinction of being exceptional in today\u2019s world \u2013 thanks to Obama and the Left in Congress not understanding what made America so exceptional.\n\nSo other countries are passing us by. The United States has fallen from #1 to #10 on the Heritage Foundation\u2019s world index of Economic Freedom \u2014 now behind even Socialistic Canada and Denmark.\n\nBut America is exceptional in world history because America was the first nation to be \u201cconceived in liberty.\u201d\n\nAmerica is exceptional because of its Constitution.\n\nAmerica is exceptional because it\u2019s the first country in world history to establish a government, the sole purpose of which is to \u201csecure the blessings of liberty.\u201d\n\nAmerica is exceptional because it was the first nation in human history to put such strict limits on the power of the central government.\n\nAmerica is exceptional because it is the first (and is still the only) nation in human history to be founded on this proposition:\n\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\n\nOur rights to \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u201d are \u201cunalienable\u201d because they are granted by God Himself. And it\u2019s the responsibility of government to protect and secure these rights.\n\nWhen government trespasses beyond this purpose, its activities become illegitimate.\n\nThat proposition, this purpose of government \u2014 to secure the blessings of liberty \u2014 is what makes America exceptional in world history.\n\nAs a result of all the limitations on government power imposed by the Constitution, Americans were free to build businesses and profit from their efforts. This allowed America to become the richest nation in world history in a very short period of time.\n\nTo the extent other countries are now enjoying liberty and prosperity, it\u2019s because they followed the American example.\n\nIf America is no longer exceptional, it\u2019s because our government has mostly ignored the Constitution for the past 90 years or so \u2014 since the Presidency of Calvin Coolidge (the last President who actually cut federal spending in real dollars). He really was a great President.\n\nCalvin Coolidge loved to read through the entire federal budget \u2014 line by line . . . so he could cross items out of the budget. He often said nothing gave him more pleasure than saving taxpayers money.\n\nMostly what our elected leaders do (Democrats and Republicans) is look for ways to get around the Constitution \u2014 if they pay any attention at all to the Constitution.\n\nOur political leaders in Washington, DC (not just Obama) respect few limits on government power.\n\nOur political class today treats the Constitution as a set of guidelines, at best \u2014 not as law.\n\nI believe America is still exceptional because we at least still have the Constitution \u2014 which is still supposed to be the supreme law of the land. We just need to get back to following the Constitution.\n\nAmerica also has an exceptional history that gave us advantages that other counties have not had.\n\nAmerica was settled by courageous people who had a pioneering spirit.\n\nIt takes a certain type of person to leave their family, friends, and familiar lives behind and travel to a new land, a wilderness, in search of freedom and opportunity.\n\nArriving on the shores of a desolate and freezing Cape Code in November of 1620, half the passengers on the Mayflower died during the first winter.\n\nThe tens of millions of settlers and immigrants who followed them here did not expect anything from the government \u2014 certainly were not looking for handouts and free health care. All they wanted was freedom to build a new life.\n\nThat takes courage. America was built by risk-takers.\n\nBy the time of the American Revolution in 1776, Americans had already become the world\u2019s richest people \u2014 because of their entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nAmerica\u2019s thriving shipbuilding, tea, tobacco, and rum businesses were out-competing those of the British Empire \u2014 which was what led to Britain\u2019s crackdown on American industry (i.e. the heavy tax on tea that triggered the Boston Tea Party, the Stamp Tax, and other taxes).\n\nAmerica is exceptional because we actually fought a war against the British Empire (the largest empire in world history) over excessive taxation.\n\nHow many people have done that? What would have America\u2019s founders thought of ObamaCare?\n\nNo doubt, they would have seen ObamaCare as a abomination \u2014 an all-out assault on liberty, exponentially worse than the tax on tea that lit the fuse of the American Revolution.\n\nAmerica is exceptional because we used to zealously guard our liberties. For the Americans of that day, no attack on liberty was too slight to overlook. \u201dGive me liberty, or give me death!\u201d declared Patrick Henry.\n\nThat was the American mindset in 1776.\n\nIf America is losing its distinction as exceptional in the world, it\u2019s because most Americans today don\u2019t seem all that concerned about liberty anymore. Most Americans pay little attention to politics. Internet page-view data reveals Americans to be 12 times more interested in Miley Cyrus\u2018 \u201cTwerking\u201d display than war with Syria or what our government is doing to us.\n\nThe problem is not so much Putin not thinking America is exceptional. We would not expect the former Soviet KGB thug to value liberty.\n\nThe problem is we now have an American President who agrees with Putin \u2014 that America is not exceptional.\n\nPresident Obama has made it clear throughout his political career that he has little respect for our Constitution \u2014 or even the rule of law.\n\nWhen Bret Baier of FOX News asked President Obama about the subversion of the legislative process President Obama and the Democrats engaged in to pass ObamaCare into law by one vote in the U.S. Senate, President Obama said: \u201cI don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about what the procedural rules are.\u201d\n\nObama doesn\u2019t seem to understand that what makes America so exceptional is that we are a nation governed by laws, not men. We are a nation of rules, not rulers \u2014 and that these laws (rules) are supposed to apply equally to everyone.\n\nNo one \u2014 not even Obama \u2014 is supposed to be above the law. All Americans \u2014 including Obama \u2014 are supposed to follow the rules.\n\nObama is not so keen on this.\n\nWhen in the state legislature in Illinois, Obama openly expressed his hostility to our Constitution in a radio interview when he called our Constitution \u201cflawed.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say:\n\n\u201cI think we can say that the Constitution reflected an enormous blind spot in this culture that carries on until this day, and that the Framers had that same blind spot . . . It also reflected the fundamental flaw of this country that continues to this day.\u201d\n\nIn another radio interview, Obama said this:\n\n\u201cAs radical as I think people try to characterize the Warren Court, it wasn\u2019t that radical. It didn\u2019t break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nSo President Obama has made it clear that he considers the Constitution to be a flawed charter for government. He says he wants to \u201cbreak free\u201d from the restraints the Constitution places on government power.\n\nTo Obama and most on the Left, the Constitution is an inconvenient obstacle they try to get around.\n\nObama does not believe in liberty or limited Constitutional government. And he has shown himself to be no fan of the American Dream.\n\nHe\u2019s certainly no fan of capitalism \u2014 which is the most powerful force in world history to create wealth and lift people out of poverty.\n\nPresident Obama is the first President in America\u2019s history who does not believe in \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism.\u201d\n\nHe promised in 2008 that he would \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d America.\n\nIn his mind, America\u2019s heritage of liberty and limited government is not worth conserving.\n\nInstead, Obama wants to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d America into his vision of a European-Bloomberg-style socialistic Nanny State (or worse) \u2014 far removed from the pioneering \u201cspirit of enterprise\u201d that made America so rich, so free, and so successful.\n\nBy the way, can you really love something that you want to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201c?\n\nIf I told my wife I\u2019m out to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d her, I doubt she would take that as a compliment. We\u2019d probably be headed for divorce court.\n\nSo if our own President Obama doesn\u2019t think America\u2019s heritage of liberty is exceptional and worth protecting, why would we expect better from the shirtless KGB thug Putin?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "PUTIN & OBAMA ARE WRONG: Here\u2019s What We Mean by \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism\u201d"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7b00\"", "article_summary": "That proposition, this purpose of government \u2014 to secure the blessings of liberty \u2014 is what makes America exceptional in world history.\nThe problem is we now have an American President who agrees with Putin \u2014 that America is not exceptional.\nHe\u2019s certainly no fan of capitalism \u2014 which is the most powerful force in world history to create wealth and lift people out of poverty.\nPresident Obama is the first President in America\u2019s history who does not believe in \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism.\u201dHe promised in 2008 that he would \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d America.\nThis allowed America to become the richest nation in world history in a very short period of time."}
