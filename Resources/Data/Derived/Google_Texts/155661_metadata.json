More than 44,000 homeless people were tallied around the county in January and 70 percent of those were \u201cunsheltered\u201d and living on the streets, according to county CEO Sachi Hamai.\n\nCity Councilman Mike Bonin said it would take two to three years \u201cat minimum\u201d to find permanent housing for many of those currently living on the streets and called on Castro to provide a broader range of tools to help in the interim.\n\n\u201cThe policy is effectively sidewalks first,\u201d Bonin said, asking Castro \u201cto be our cavalry.\u201d\n\nCastro said the federal government would take comments in the spring on a new formula for allocating aid to states.\n\nBut, Garcetti said, \u201cgovernment can\u2019t end homelessness alone,\u201d pointing to what he said were 533 veterans living on the streets with vouchers in hand because they can\u2019t find a place to live.\n\nHarris-Dawson cited the city\u2019s land use authority as a \u201cbig chip\u201d in addressing homelessness. Land use, including the ability to adjust zoning and permitting processes to encourage more affordable housing, is just one of nine policy issues being debated by the Homeless Initiative set up by Los Angeles County.\n\nEmployment, street outreach and Affordable Care Act opportunities are among the policy points being debated by county and city officials as they work toward a comprehensive plan.\n\nHamai said today she hoped a draft report from the Homeless Initiative would be available in December. A full set of recommendations is expected in February.\n\nSupervisor Hilda Solis also raised concerns about an anticipated record- setting El Nino, even as city and county officials move to increase access to winter shelter beds.\n\n\u201cWe need help from FEMA,\u201d the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Solis told Castro, citing a rash of homeless individuals living in watershed areas that will be potential flood danger zones in major storms.\n\n\u2014City News Service\n\n>> Want to read more stories like this?
