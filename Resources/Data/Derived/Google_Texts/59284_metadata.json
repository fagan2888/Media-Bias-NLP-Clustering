For the most part, visitors are unable to get very far in the enrollment process, often not getting past the first few registration pages \u2014 a problem that persists.\n\nAs Millard\u2019s chart at left shows, there were 9.5 million unique visitors to HealthCare.gov, with 5.7 million visiting the individual marketplace from Oct. 1 to Oct. 5. Millard Brown estimates 3.7 million tried to register and 1 million of those completed registration.\n\nFrom there the numbers plummet into the thousands. Successful log-in was achieved by 271,000 users, 196,000 of which began enrollment. And of those, 36,000 actually completed the enrollment process. That works out to 0.97% of the 3.7 million who tried to register.\n\nThe researcher determined traffic fell 88% from HealthCare.gov\u2019s first week to its second, based on what it calls the website\u2019s daily reach. Officials said the daily reach dropped that much between Oct. 1 and Oct. 13.\n\nMillard Brown\u2019s findings were disclosed earlier this week and publicized by the web site Kantar U.S. Insights.\n\nThe contractor hired to build the web site, CGI Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/11421 /quotes/nls/gib GIB , did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn an email, Health and Human Services officials said the figures quoted by Millard Brown were not accurate, adding they would have more accurate data when they release October enrollment figures in the middle of November. It was unclear whether those figures would break out weekly statistics.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-10-17T14:16:44-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Less than 1% of those trying to register for health insurance under President Obama's health-care overhaul actually were able to complete the enrollment process during the first week of business at HealthCare.gov, a survey shows.", "title": "Less than 1% of HealthCare.gov registrants finish enrollment: report", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/17/less-than-1-of-healthcare-gov-registrants-finish-enrollment-report/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN332_enroll_MG_20131017130545.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "HealthCare.gov,insurers,Obamacare,web site troubles", "article.headline": "Less than 1% of HealthCare.gov registrants finish enrollment: report", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "HealthCare.gov,insurers,Obamacare,web site troubles", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Less than 1% of those trying to register for health insurance under President Obama's health-care overhaul actually were able to complete the enrollment process during the first week of business at HealthCare.gov, a survey shows.", "article.published": "2013-10-17T14:16:44-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/17/less-than-1-of-healthcare-gov-registrants-finish-enrollment-report/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Less than 1% of those trying to register for health insurance under President Obama's health-care overhaul actually were able to complete the enrollment process during the first week of business at HealthCare.gov, a survey shows.", "title": "Less than 1% of HealthCare.gov registrants finish enrollment: report", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/10/17/less-than-1-of-healthcare-gov-registrants-finish-enrollment-report/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN332_enroll_MG_20131017130545.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1355", "article.updated": "2013-10-17T17:56:52-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde93e\"", "article_summary": "And of those, 36,000 actually completed the enrollment process.\nFewer than 1% of those trying to register for health insurance under President Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul actually were able to complete the enrollment process during the first week of business at HealthCare.gov.\nMillard Brown estimates 3.7 million tried to register and 1 million of those completed registration.\nFor the most part, visitors are unable to get very far in the enrollment process, often not getting past the first few registration pages \u2014 a problem that persists.\nAs Millard\u2019s chart at left shows, there were 9.5 million unique visitors to HealthCare.gov, with 5.7 million visiting the individual marketplace from Oct. 1 to Oct. 5."}
