In Colorado, that means single adults who earned less than $15,400 last year will have access to Medicaid. Childless adults in the state currently qualify for Medicaid only if they make less than $95 a month. Colorado estimates about 160,000 people will be added to state Medicaid rolls under the new guidelines.\n\nMedicaid expansion is a major plank of the administration\u2019s plan to get every American covered by health insurance. But the U.S. Supreme Court last year limited the federal government\u2019s ability to penalize states that decide against the expansion, leading to a patchwork of Medicaid eligibility standards. The Congressional Budget Office has projected 11 million Americans will get coverage through the Medicaid expansion by 2022.\n\nKinney said he feels incredibly fortunate to live in a state where he will receive basic coverage through the government program. He has seen firsthand just how expense medical expenses can be.\n\nHe broke his leg last April in a car accident heading home from a cross-country skiing trip. But the other driver was at fault, sparing Kinney from having to pay the hefty medical bills for his treatment.\n\nKinney said he is thankful every time he sees the tab for his care: $500 for the ambulance ride; $150 just to consult with a doctor by telephone; $100 for a pill.\n\n\u201cEven though I know I\u2019m going to get my bills paid, it\u2019s incredibly scary watching the number of zeros on the letters that roll in saying these are the bills we owe,\u201d said Kinney, who is working part-time while his girlfriend finishes medical school.\n\nHe is just beginning his career with a startup counseling company and expects to increase his earnings significantly in the years ahead.\n\nFor now, though, Kinney said he is happy to be caught in the Medicaid safety net because Colorado opted for the expansion. The cost will be covered entirely by the federal government for the first few years, with that share eventually falling to 90 percent.\n\nHe wants a checkup and maybe a trip to the dentist.\n\n\u201cUntil now, I\u2019ve used delusion and denial to pretend something wouldn\u2019t actually happen to my health,\u201d Kinney said. \u201cSo now it\u2019s nice to think about actually having coverage. It didn\u2019t click when I saw all the \u2018Obamacare\u2019 stuff on the news; it was just people yelling at each other. \u2026 It was just politics. Now it feels real.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Medicaid expansion happy surprise for Colorado man", "title": "Medicaid expansion happy surprise for Colorado man", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/11/medicaid-expansion-happy-surprise-for-colorado-man/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130911__Morgan_Kinneyp1.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130911__Morgan_Kinneyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T15:47:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:10:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Medicaid expansion is a major plank of the administration\u2019s plan to get every American covered by health insurance.\nThe Congressional Budget Office has projected 11 million Americans will get coverage through the Medicaid expansion by 2022.\nColorado estimates about 160,000 people will be added to state Medicaid rolls under the new guidelines.\nFor now, though, Kinney said he is happy to be caught in the Medicaid safety net because Colorado opted for the expansion.\n\u201cUntil now, I\u2019ve used delusion and denial to pretend something wouldn\u2019t actually happen to my health,\u201d Kinney said."}
