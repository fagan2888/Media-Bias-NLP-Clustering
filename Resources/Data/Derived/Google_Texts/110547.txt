In just under two weeks, state Assemblyman Charles Mainor's "Food Pantry Challenge" has resulted in the donation of thousands of food items.

From canned vegetables, tuna and ravioli to cereal, tomato sauces, pasta, beverages and more, Mainor is looking to help feed members of the Jersey City and Bayonne communities.

"I'm hoping this will bring more awareness of the financial burden people have in purchasing food and an awareness of hunger," said Mainor, who will add milk, eggs and a chicken to each package of food.

The assemblyman said recipients don't need to be on any assistance program and that "anyone that's in need can just call and then come here and pick up a bag of goods."

The effort began with Mainor being videotaped shopping for items to donate and he then challenged 20 others to donate and asked each of them to challenge five other people. The assemblyman, who represents Bayonne and a large portion of Jersey City, said he hopes others will donate and challenge their friends to do the same.

So far more than 100 people have contributed and Mainor's office has stacks of food all over it.

Mainor was one of 11 New Jersey lawmakers and three dozen community leaders who took the Food Stamp Challenge in September and lived on $4.20 of food per day for a week.

"The greatest part of this is it is proof the community can come together for a common cause at a grassroots level," Mainor said, adding that the challenge will continue through the end of the year. "I'm really looking forward to seeing the faces of people picking up food. It give you a good feeling that what you are doing is helping somebody immediately."

The Jersey City Community Charter School is also holding a food drive and items collected there will be turned over to Mainor. Food donations can be dropped off at Mainor's office at 2324 Kennedy Blvd. in Jersey City.
