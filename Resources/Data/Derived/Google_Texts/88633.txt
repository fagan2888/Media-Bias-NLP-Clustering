A missing 13-year-old boy has been found safe near Rye.

Clayton Jones, of Avondale, went missing Saturday morning, but Custer County Sheriff's Office dispatch has confirmed that he was found by a family member at about 10:45 a.m. Sunday.

He was missing near Colo. 165 and Ophir Creek Road near Rye. Fremont County Search & Rescue helped in the search, CCSO confirmed.

Clayton's grandmother, Roxy Jones, told the Daily Record that the boy went missing at 7 a.m. Saturday. His father, Barry Jones, had dropped the boy off for a short period of time by the road.

"He was left along side of the road right by a metal and he was to wait there. His dad left and came back, and he was gone," Roxy Jones said.

His grandmother said it isn't like Clayton to wander away.

He was on his first big elk hunting trip with his father, grandfather and a family friend.

"He's trained. He's done hunter safety," Roxy Jones said while the search was still ongoing. "He knows how to do many things in the woods. He's had classes for training and these kinds of things. ... He's a bright young boy, very, very smart. He's been camping up in that area years ago many times so he did know the area, maybe slightly."
