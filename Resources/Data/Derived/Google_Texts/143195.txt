Marsh & McLennan launches 2015 employee benefit survey

The Troy-based office of Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC, formerly McGraw Wentworth, has launched its 12th annual Southeast Michigan Mid-Market Group Benefits Survey for midsize companies with 100 to 10,000 employees.



More than 500 companies are expected to participate this year in Marsh’s survey, including auto suppliers, manufacturers, school districts and nonprofits.



The survey results, which will include changes in employer-sponsored health benefits, will be released in early June, said Marsh officials.



“Employers need timely data to guide their health care strategy decisions in an era of rapidly changing compliance issues and market forces,” said Rebecca McLaughlan, Marsh’s vice president, in a statement. “Year-over-year this survey provides valid, actionable data to help Michigan employers with their talent management and business management goals.”



Highlights of the survey will include:

How Michigan organizations have complied with the policies and practices required by the Affordable Care Act.

How employers have adapted workforce strategies and benefits eligibility due to the “play or pay” employer mandate.

Use or interest in defined contribution plans, private exchanges and benefit administration solutions.

Did employers drop health benefit plans? Did they move employees to less than 30 hours due to the full-time equivalent “30-hour rule”?

What cost increases did they incur and how much did they pass along to employees?

Are private exchanges gaining steam in the employer market?

How are plan designs changing to address high-cost specialty drugs such as Sovaldi for Hepatitis C?
