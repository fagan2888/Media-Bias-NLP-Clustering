That, however, is only part of the threat.\n\nThe uncontrolled and chaotic violation this nation brought to us by President Obama\u2019s immigration and refugee schemes pose a number of threats to the homeland as insidious and deadly as the Islamic jihadi.\n\nViruses we had finally eliminated from our lives are returning, and others we should never have to face are now crawling through our nation, targeting our children and families.\n\nIn addition to the word \u201cjihad\u201d we now must re-introduce into our lexicon the words measles, polio, diphtheria, tuberculosis, malaria, scabies, dengue, and now \u201cZika.\u201d\n\nThe Zika virus is emerging as a new threat, is spread by mosquito bites, but the CDC is now warning of a transmission through a blood transfusion and sexual contact. Symptoms include fever, rash, joint and muscle pain, and headache. The horror show part of this scourge is it can also apparently cause brain damage in the fetuses of pregnant women.\n\nIn 2000, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) declared measles eradicated in the United States. But then there was suddenly a 20-year high of 600 cases in 2014, more than all reported cases between 2009 and 2013, reports Breitbart News.\n\nThe government and media blamed a lack of vaccinations for the spread, while admitting that it was an unidentified \u201cforeign visitor\u201d who likely brought the virus into the country.\n\nAt about the same time, in the summer of 2014, a mysterious polio-like illness began to strike children in 34 states. Over 100 children were impacted, many left permanently paralyzed. The CDC has guessed at a possible cause, but there has been no official finding as to what caused so many young people to be condemned with a virus similar to what was eradicated in the United States in 1979.\n\nWhat was happening just prior to the spread of previously thought annihilated viruses? The massive surge of illegal immigrants, including \u201cunaccompanied minors,\u201d at the southern border and their transportation to the interior of the country by the federal government.\n\nAccording to reports by PBS, at least 90,000 illegal immigrant children entered the country in 2014, with another 140,000 entering by the end of 2015. Almost a quarter of a million children, and that does not include additional \u201cfamily units\u201d still pouring into the country from Central and South America.\n\nWe now have cases of the Zika virus in Texas, Illinois and Florida. We\u2019re told \u201ctravelers\u201d went \u201coverseas\u201d and contracted the virus there, bringing it back to the United States. The New York Times reports the virus made its first appearance in South America in May 2015, just as we were in the middle of the continuing \u201csurge\u201d of illegal immigrants into this nation.\n\nWe aren\u2019t told what \u201coverseas\u201d countries are involved in the introduction of Zika here, but we do know that the virus is spreading like wildfire throughout Latin America, specifically, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and Venezuela, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe three countries most of the 230,000 \u201csurge\u201d immigrant minors are coming from? Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.\n\nEurope is serving up a warning of their own when it comes to Syrian \u201cmigrants.\u201d Germany and other European countries who have welcomed now over one million Muslim migrants are facing unprecedented acts of violence, including gang rapes. But they, too, are only now comprehending they didn\u2019t invite just a rape culture to settle down in their midst. Breitbart News reports:\n\n\u201cHospitals in Europe have been warned that newly-arrived migrants may bring with them diseases that have been eradicated in the country for several decades. The Danish State Serum Institute (SSI) has warned hospitals to be on the lookout for signs of diphtheria, an illness that has not been seen in Denmark for 20 years, after two Libyan migrants tested position for the disease.\u201d\n\nBreitbart London reports how \u201cLondon is now the tuberculosis capital of Europe thanks to mass migration. In 2014, for example, the city saw 2,500 new cases, a higher rate than most nations\u2019 totals, including Iraq, Rwanda and Algeria.\u201d\n\nThe establishment is working feverishly to have you not notice the link between the massive influx of sick foreigners into the country and sick, paralyzed and potentially brain damaged children. They want you to think the return of measles, a bizarre new polio, and a virus that could transfer to your fetus, is just all a horrible coincidence.\n\nNone dare note that Americans have always traveled, and tourists have always visited, and yet these scourges only re-emerged with a vengeance after Mr. Obama\u2019s open border chaos began in 2014 and continues to this day.\n\nSuggesting that these horrific viruses \u2014 which are especially gruesome for our children \u2014 are just a fluke, is about as bad as saying the Ft. Hood jihadist terror attack was workplace violence and that ISIS is a JV team.\n\nIs it malevolence or ignorance of the current regime and are you willing to stake your child\u2019s life on it?\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce is a radio talk show host and a Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When facing the massive problems associated with an open border, deluges of illegal immigration, and now even government sponsored surges of so-called \"refugees,\" we naturally must discuss our concern about terrorism and violent crime.
