It was for sure Justin Bieber\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nA second eyewitness, who has asked to remain anonymous, added,\n\n\u201cBieber verbally said to go get that guy and get his memory card. He just sent his security to do his dirty work.\u201d\n\nKauai County spokeswoman Sarah Blane said [Bieber\u2019s security] Dwayne Patterson, was arrested at the scene on Wednesday for third-degree assault and fourth-degree criminal property damage.\n\nBlane released an email statement, which read: \u201cAccording to a preliminary investigation, a 29-year-old Hanalei man had been taking unsolicited photos of the group that Patterson was with at the time. Mr. Patterson reportedly approached the 29-year-old and requested that he delete the photos. Upon refusing to do so, Patterson reportedly assaulted the Hanalei man and damaged his camera.\u201d\n\nThe Florida residing bodyguard, 32, was released after posting $3,000 bail.\n\nLancaster claims he saw Patterson and another bodyguard chase the man, who is reported to be a paparazzo, to his car. The witness claims Patterson \u201cput him in a headlock and lifted him off the ground until he dropped his camera and keys.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was really calling for help,\u201d Lancaster said of the alleged victim.\n\nThe same witness claims Bieber screamed at the bodyguard to get the man\u2019s camera and remove the memory card. \u201cThere was no remorse. How can you go out to Shipwreck\u2019s and not expect people to take pictures?,\u201d he said.\n\nLancaster continued, \u201cIt was so sad. There was a better way to handle that. It was just a trip, man. It was unreal.\u201d\n\nThe second witness says Patterson let go of the unidentified victim when onlookers started pulling out their phones to record the fracas. The Hanalei alleged victim reported no injuries and refused medical attention and the incident is still under police investigation.\n\nThe pop phenom has now arrived in Brisbane, Australia ahead of his first show on Tuesday.\n\nJustin took photos with Australian fans on Sunday night after arriving via private jet from a Saturday tour stop in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nYesterday, the pop prince posted a Viddy of his New Zealand \u201cMeet and Greet\u201d with fans.\n\nThere has been speculation about ticket sales for the singer\u2019s final concerts after resale websites reported high numbers of Bieber tickets being put up for sale in the wake of his controversial year.\n\nThe 19-year-old is due to play eight concerts in Australia, with his 15-month trek wrapping in Perth on Dec. 8.\n\nAs yet, Bieber\u2019s publicist Melissa Victor has not commented on the alleged Hawaii assault, The Associated Press reports.\n\n[Image via Just Jared]", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of Justin Bieber's bodyguards, who was subsequently arrested, allegedly put a man who took photos of the singer at Shipwreck's Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, into", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "One of Justin Bieber\u2019s bodyguards, who was subsequently arrested, allegedly put a man who took photos of the singer at Shipwreck\u2019s Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, into", "title": "Justin Bieber Hits Australia Amid Witness\u2019 Claims Bodyguard\u2019s Hawaii \u2018Headlock\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1041172/justin-bieber-hits-australia-amid-witness-claims-bodyguards-hawaii-headlock/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Justin-Bieber-Arrives-In-Australia-As-Witness-Claims-Bodyguards-Hawaii-Headlock.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-24T14:38:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-18T06:13:13+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Justin-Bieber-Arrives-In-Australia-As-Witness-Claims-Bodyguards-Hawaii-Headlock.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-11-24T14:38:47+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "dwayne patterson,justin bieber,justin bieber believe world tour,justin bieber bodyguard,justin bieber bodyguard arrested,justin bieber jumps off a cliff,entertainment", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Justin-Bieber-Arrives-In-Australia-As-Witness-Claims-Bodyguards-Hawaii-Headlock.jpg", "height": 377, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "One of Justin Bieber\u2019s bodyguards, who was subsequently arrested, allegedly put a man who took photos of the singer at Shipwreck\u2019s Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, into"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07a8\"", "article_summary": "The same witness claims Bieber screamed at the bodyguard to get the man\u2019s camera and remove the memory card.\nJustin took photos with Australian fans on Sunday night after arriving via private jet from a Saturday tour stop in Auckland, New Zealand.\nOne of Justin Bieber\u2019s bodyguards, who was subsequently arrested, allegedly put a man who took photos of the singer at Shipwreck\u2019s Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, into a \u201cheadlock,\u201d claims a witness.\nThe witness claims Patterson \u201cput him in a headlock and lifted him off the ground until he dropped his camera and keys.\u201d\u201cHe was really calling for help,\u201d Lancaster said of the alleged victim.\nLancaster claims he saw Patterson and another bodyguard chase the man, who is reported to be a paparazzo, to his car."}
