Jason Hallet and his wife Rachel and their new home. (Photo: Don Reichert)\n\nWindsor Mayor John Vazquez has served as mayor for eight years.\n\nIn April, Vazquez\u2019s term will end and he plans to continue serving the town as an involved resident, but he said he does not see the need to plan more than that.\n\nVazquez was born in Covington, Kentucky, grew up in Michigan and moved to Colorado in 1990. He graduated with a degree in civil engineering from Colorado State University. He was elected as mayor in April 2008 and to a second term in April 2012.\n\nAfter eight years of serving as mayor, Vazquez said he has not made plans for the next chapter of his life, because plans always change. He said he wants to trust in his faith and that the next step will come organically.\n\n\u201cI honestly haven\u2019t given what is next a whole lot of thought,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cFor now, I\u2019m focusing on finishing the term strong and being in the present.\u201d\n\nVazquez said he has been proud to see Windsor boom from a \u201cbedroom community,\u201d where residents commute to jobs outside of the community, to a major employer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very blessed to be part of a transition from a town on the brink to leaving office to a town that has really set its path and garnered its identity,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cWe have transitioned from having no dot on the map to a premier community in Northern Colorado.\u201d\n\nVazquez said he is proud of many projects he has been involved in and is especially proud of the leadership\u2019s work on the Regional Tourism Act, which if passed, will lead to the construction of the Peligrande Resort and further growth in Windsor.\n\nThe success of Windsor over the past eight years can be credited to a strong leadership and involved community, not his work alone, Vazquez said.\n\n\u201cIt takes an entire board to move the community forward,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cOver the years I have been fortunate to work with some very special individuals, and as a group we have accomplished some great things.\u201d\n\nBoard Member Robert Bishop-Cotner, who has served on the board for the eight years Vazquez has been mayor, said Vazquez was an important part of the reconstruction of Windsor after a tornado that damaged the town in 2008.\n\n\u201cIt took us nine days to do what it takes some communities to do in months,\u2019\u2019 Bishop-Cotner said. \u201cHe is the guy who has the charisma and energy to get people to believe in the impossible.\u201d\n\nBoard Member Kristie Melendez said Vazquez will end his position as mayor with leaving Windsor a better place.\n\n\u201cJohn is a great example of what anyone would want in a leader,\u201d Melendez said. \u201cHe truly cares about the community and the people in it.\u201d\n\nVazquez said he plans to continue serving the Windsor community, only this time it will be only as a citizen without the mayor title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never considered myself anything other than a community member,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cI hope future leaders carry the baton and continue to govern Windsor how it has been governed for 125 years.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1F7voz4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Windsor Mayor John Vazquez talks plans after term ends", "og": {"site_name": "Coloradoan", "description": "Windsor Mayor John Vazquez talks plans after term ends", "title": "Windsor Mayor John Vazquez talks plans after term ends", "url": "http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/windsor/2015/08/29/windsor-mayor-john-vazquez-talks-plans-term-ends/71393372/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/coloradoan.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Windsor Mayor John Vazquez talks plans after term ends", "title": "Windsor Mayor John Vazquez talks plans after term ends", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b9d5df38cbe94f417d730591d2412b5b5c1a470f/c=299-0-1501-1202&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/29/FortCollins/B9318489573Z.1_20150829172839_000_G7UBOGK4J.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@coloradoan", "site": "@coloradoan", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743847167", "fb": {"app_id": 140942715960163}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1474\"", "article_summary": "After eight years of serving as mayor, Vazquez said he has not made plans for the next chapter of his life, because plans always change.\n(Photo: Don Reichert)Windsor Mayor John Vazquez has served as mayor for eight years.\n\u201cHe truly cares about the community and the people in it.\u201dVazquez said he plans to continue serving the Windsor community, only this time it will be only as a citizen without the mayor title.\nThe success of Windsor over the past eight years can be credited to a strong leadership and involved community, not his work alone, Vazquez said.\nHe was elected as mayor in April 2008 and to a second term in April 2012."}
