But there is currently a chill in the relationship between the White House and the Congressional Budget Office that has spilled into the media over the agency\u2019s estimates of the labor market effects of two of President Obama\u2019s most important policy efforts.\n\nThe non-partisan CBO, widely respected on both sides of the aisle and among economists, is correctly viewed as one of the few truly honest brokers in Washington, and certainly one of the most powerful. Washington is fixated on the politics, but no matter which political party gains from any given CBO report, the most useful course of action is to focus on the economics and lessons therein.\n\nAnd with Obamacare and the minimum wage, the lesson is simple: Any given policy always has costs and benefits.\n\nWith Obamacare, the White House and the left have almost exclusively emphasized the benefits of the program. And benefits there are. Obamacare gives subsidies to low- and middle-income households to aid them in the purchase of health insurance. All else equal, these subsidies make those households better off.\n\nThe health care subsidies create a scenario where higher-income families are subsidizing the newfound leisure time of the less fortunate.\n\nDespite what many on the right implicitly suggest, alleviating \u201cjob lock\u201d\u2014offering insurance outside the employer-employee relationship\u2014is also a benefit. The economy would be more efficient if workers didn\u2019t need to stay in a job because of the fear of going uninsured. In fact, Obamacare does not do enough to mitigate job lock. It certainly doesn\u2019t do too much.\n\nAccording to the CBO, some workers will likely leave the workforce because they no longer need to work in order to have health coverage. In my opinion, contrary to many on the right, this is not primarily a case of the government negatively distorting decisions. The most important government distortion in this space occurred decades ago when wage controls incentivized firms to compensate workers by providing them with health insurance, along with the tax exemption for those employer-provided health benefits. Obamacare partially undoes this pre-existing, government-caused, and economically harmful distortion. It seems odd to suggest that this is a negative feature of Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two of the White House&#39;s biggest initiatives\u2014health care reform and raising the minimum wage\u2014will both result in fewer workers, according to Washington&#39;s budget oracles.
