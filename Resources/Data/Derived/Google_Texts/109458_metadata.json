Leslie Sonn\u00e9 said Monday.\n\nThe girls' names were not released because they are minors.\n\nThe officers were trying to detain the girls to question them about a fight, Sonn\u00e9 said, although the girls were not fighting at the time police approached them.\n\nWhile trying to detain the 14-year-old girl, a 16-year-old began pushing the officer away and took a fighting stance, Sonn\u00e9 said. The officer pulled out his electronic gun, more commonly known as Taser, and ordered the 16-year-old to the ground.\n\nHis partner was able to bring her to the ground, but then the younger girl jumped on his back, apparently to try to free her friend, Sonn\u00e9 said. It was then when an officer discharged his Taser \ufeffto stop the attack on the officer, Sonn\u00e9 said.\n\n\"We're still trying to get the final report from the officer,\" she said. \"One of the girls may have been trying to bite the officer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSonn\u00e9 said she did not know if the girls were friends. They are from the local area, but Sonn\u00e9 is not disclosing their cities of residence. It's unclear if the girls were attending the fair with their families or just other friends.\n\nIt is rare that Monterey police officers discharge their Tasers. Sonn\u00e9 said she can't remember the last time an officer used one.\n\nSonn\u00e9 said there will be an investigation on the use of force that will be followed up the chain of command, as is the case in all the instances when there is use of force.\n\nThe two girls were taken into custody at Monterey County Juvenile Hall, charged with battery on a police officer and resisting arrest. They were released to their families.\n\nClaudia Mel\u00e9ndez Salinas can be reached at 726-4370.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_26449194/monterey-police-officer-use-taser-14-year-old", "sailthru.author": "By Claudia Mel&#233;ndez Salinas   Monterey Herald", "ag": {"canon": "TheMercuryNews:article:26449194:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-01T19:53:57-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "mercurynews.com", "description": "Police used a stun gun on a 14-year-old girl when she allegedly attacked another officer who was trying to subdue her friend late Saturday at the Monterey County Fair, police said.", "title": "Monterey police: Officer used Taser on 14-year-old girl as she attacked other cop", "url": "http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_26449194/monterey-police-officer-use-taser-14-year-old", "image": "http://local.mercurynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/mercurynews.png", "site": "@mercnews", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "San Jose Mercury News for iPad", "iphone": "San Jose Mercury News for iPhone", "googleplay": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "id": {"ipad": "id551437906", "iphone": "id479955259", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.sanjosemercurynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-09-01T20:14:27-0600", "endDate": "2024-09-01T20:14:20-0600", "description": "Police used a stun gun on a 14-year-old girl when she allegedly attacked another officer who was trying to subdue her friend late Saturday at the Monterey County Fair, police said.", "byline": "By Claudia Mel\u00e9ndez", "pubDate": "2014-09-01T19:55:36-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-01T18:53:57-0700", "sailthru.title": "Monterey police: Officer used Taser on 14-year-old girl as she attacked other cop", "verify-v1": "cgRcFjhKBsmYEfbwi2qePjkOzvy8XWnvfTpK75N3BmQ=", "sailthru.section": "Crime and Courts", "news_keywords": "crime,homicides,murders,Bay Area,San Jose,crime map,court news,judicial,SJPD,police", "sailthru.site": "mercurynews.com", "fb": {"admins": "702185068,661331474,100001900804139", "page_id": 63095136336, "app_id": 328320203930030}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "og": {"url": "http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_26449194/monterey-police-officer-use-taser-14-year-old", "image": "http://local.mercurynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/mercurynews.png", "type": "article", "description": "Police used a stun gun on a 14-year-old girl when she allegedly attacked another officer who was trying to subdue her friend late Saturday at the Monterey County Fair, police said.", "title": "Monterey police: Officer used Taser on 14-year-old girl as she attacked other cop"}, "google-site-verification": "jvnaFa4kq5tUDhFMQZ84bDI74A2qnu0gfhxZjZXlkko", "y_key": "8cb7e37d57339cb3"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd275e\"", "article_summary": "MONTEREY -- A police officer used a stun gun on a 14-year-old girl when she attacked another officer who was trying to subdue her friend late Saturday at the Monterey County Fair, according to police.\nAbout 9:30 p.m. after receiving reports of the girls fighting, officers used a Taser on one of the girls, Monterey police Lt.
