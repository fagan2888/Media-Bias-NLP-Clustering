The meeting, which lasted over two hours, came one day after a federal judge ruled the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 telephone metadata is likely unconstitutional.\n\nObama is due next month to provide recommendations from an outside panel\u2019s review of the NSA\u2019s vast global spying programs revealed to the public by leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nThe White House said ahead of the meeting with tech executives that the gathering would focus on the struggling healthcare.gov, the website designed to allow Americans to sign up for insurance plans provided pursuant to the Affordable Care Act. Yet the executives signaled before, during and after the meeting that they want focus on government surveillance, much of which has involved their companies\u2019 services, both with and without their cooperation.\n\n\u201cThat is not going to happen,\u201d an executive of one of the companies told The Guardian ahead of the event, regarding the planned discussion of the healthcare site. \u201cWe are there to talk about the NSA.\u201d\n\nAnother executive at the meeting told The Guardian that any issues outside of NSA spying are \u201cperipheral.\u201d\n\nIn early December - though after the White House had invited the industry officials - eight tech companies sent an open letter to Obama and Congress urging reform of surveillance that had \u201cshaken the trust of our users.\u201d\n\nUSA Today reported that Google chairman Eric Schmidt began the meeting by laying out the companies\u2019 concerns. An anonymous source briefed on the meeting said Obama seemed open to allowing more disclosure of NSA surveillance requests by tech companies, which are currently hamstrung by the government in what can and cannot be revealed.\n\nReacting to the NSA leaks, Google, Microsoft and other companies sued the US for the right to reveal more information about government requests for user data.\n\nYahoo executive Marissa Mayer brought up concerns that a certain kind of legislation being posed in various countries, such as Brazil, \u201cwould require service providers to ensure that data belonging to a citizen of a certain country remain in the country it originates,\u201d USA Today reported. Such a requirement would be highly costly for companies, which would have to build data centers in nations all over the world to keep up.\n\n\"We appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the president our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform,\" the technology companies said in a statement after the session.\n\nA senior Obama administration official called the meeting constructive and \u201cnot at all contentious,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nThe White House acknowledged the economic impacts of the intelligence disclosures in a statement released after the meeting.\n\n\"The president made clear his belief in an open, free and innovative Internet and listened to the group's concerns and recommendations, and made clear that we will consider their input as well as the input of other outside stakeholders as we finalize our review of signals-intelligence programs,\" the White House said.\n\nInternal NSA documents provided by Snowden to various news outlets began a steady pace of revelations that have unmasked the NSA\u2019s massive surveillance machine. Snowden is currently under temporary asylum in Russia. He faces the punitive Espionage Act in the United States.\n\nThe first story that came from the leaked trove of NSA documents exposed, in early June, the bulk gathering of domestic telephone data.\n\nA US District Court judge found Monday that the NSA\u2019s metadata collection of phone records may violate unreasonable searches and seizures protections vested in the Fourth Amendment. Judge Richard Leon also said the US Department of Justice has failed to show how the bulk sweep of metadata has helped interrupt any terror attacks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u200bExecutives of major technology companies pressed Tuesday for reform of the NSA\u2019s surveillance operations during a meeting with President Barack Obama that was initially to focus on the government\u2019s maligned health care website.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "\u200bExecutives of major technology companies pressed Tuesday for reform of the NSA\u2019s surveillance operations during a meeting with President Barack Obama that was initially to focus on the government\u2019s maligned health care website.", "title": "Tech execs steer away from HealthCare.gov, to NSA in Obama meeting", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/8b/c0/00/000_was8155218.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/nsa-obama-executives-meeting-404/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "\u200bExecutives of major technology companies pressed Tuesday for reform of the NSA\u2019s surveillance operations during a meeting with President Barack Obama that was initially to focus on the government\u2019s maligned health care website.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/21/8b/c0/00/000_was8155218.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The White House acknowledged the economic impacts of the intelligence disclosures in a statement released after the meeting.\nA senior Obama administration official called the meeting constructive and \u201cnot at all contentious,\u201d Reuters reported.\nAn anonymous source briefed on the meeting said Obama seemed open to allowing more disclosure of NSA surveillance requests by tech companies, which are currently hamstrung by the government in what can and cannot be revealed.\n\u200bExecutives of major technology companies pressed Tuesday for reform of the NSA\u2019s surveillance operations during a meeting with President Barack Obama that was initially to focus on the government\u2019s maligned health care website.\nInternal NSA documents provided by Snowden to various news outlets began a steady pace of revelations that have unmasked the NSA\u2019s massive surveillance machine."}
