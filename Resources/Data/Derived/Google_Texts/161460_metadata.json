He added: \u201cAlcohol, as we all know, increases the risk of bad things happening and is kind of used to heighten the sense of risk that the images would portray.\u201d\n\nFox dismissed those who are using the ads to mock Obamacare, saying there are \u201calways going to be those people who try to twist what you\u2019re doing towards their own purposes.\u201d Instead he said he felt confident that the campaign is reaching \u201cthe population that we\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d As an example, Fox cited \u201ca friend of one of the guys in the keg stand picture,\u201d who \u201cgot a message from someone in Hong Kong\u201d about the ad.", "article_metadata": {"pageNum": 1, "description": "Is signing up for Obamacare easier than a casual hookup?
