(Photo: Larry McCormack / The Tennessean )Buy Photo\n\nWhile I wasn\u2019t certain who would win the Country Music Association\u2019s Entertainer of the Year on Wednesday, I knew it would be a man. That\u2019s because the country music industry doesn\u2019t give its female artists the respect their music deserves based on its commercial success and critical acclaim.\n\nIndeed, in the past 25 years \u2014 beginning with 1989, the year Taylor Swift was born \u2014 there have only been three female artists who have won CMA Entertainer of the Year \u2014 Swift, Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain.\n\nWomen in country music are making the best country music today, and that\u2019s not just my opinion. According to the music industry voters of the CMA, Miranda Lambert made the best country album and country single and participated in the best vocal event of the year, while Kacey Musgraves co-wrote the best song.\n\nGrammy voters decided that Musgraves also co-wrote the best country song and released the best country album of the last year. At the 2014 Academy of Country Music Awards, Lambert also released the best single record of the year and Musgraves made the best album of the year.\n\nIn the past, when I\u2019ve lamented the perception and treatment of women in country, I\u2019ve had male industry veterans tell me that if women will just sell albums, they can turn things around. I\u2019ve got two words for them: Taylor Swift.\n\nSo where is the disconnect? Largely at country radio.\n\nIn the current Billboard Country Airplay chart, there are no solo women, and only two acts with females \u2014 Little Big Town and Maddie & Tae \u2014 in The Top 10. If you expand the list to the Top 20, you can add two more women \u2014 Carrie Underwood and RaeLynn. If you expand the list to the Top 30, you won\u2019t find an additional female name.\n\nMany radio programmers examine the music of female artists through a harsher lens than songs released by men. Some believe that women\u2019s songs don\u2019t work on country radio, while other programmers want to break women through radio, but they just haven\u2019t had much success.\n\nRecord executives say they\u2019ve been told there\u2019s only one slot for a new female. If a female artist\u2019s first single doesn\u2019t perform well on radio, they have a much more difficult time than a male artist getting a second chance by programmers. Then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: Programmers don\u2019t believe that women will break through because it hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nWith few women played on country radio, fewer new careers are launched, as evidenced by the dearth of successful new females. Quick. Try to name five females who have released their first albums in the last five years. Not easy, is it? Yet numerous male names could easily roll off of the tongues of country fans. In the past three years, only three of the 15 artists nominated for the CMA\u2019s best new artist award have been females.\n\nBecause of these programming choices, radio has become a testosterone-fueled sonic playground that is virtually unlistenable. It reinforces the pop culture trend that strips women of their dignity by defining them solely by their bodies and appeal to men. Is this the atmosphere in which we want to raise our children? Is this the legacy we want to leave for Nashville and country music?\n\nI was a loyal WSIX fan until Gerry House left, but then I switched formats because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I only returned when Blair Garner brought his great morning show to NASH-FM. But more often than not, I switch formats once his show is over, after I\u2019ve heard all I can stand of the songs about drinking and objectifying women.\n\nWhat can be done to hear more females and fewer songs that define women solely as physical specimens? First, quit listening to country radio and contact the stations to let them know why.\n\nSecond, use the power of the purse. Since the long-held marketing industry belief is that 80 percent of women control household spending, let the advertisers of these stations know that you have stopped listening to country radio and you won\u2019t financially support any companies that back this philosophy. As radio executives say, they aren\u2019t here to sell records; they are here to sell ads. As listeners, we can say, it\u2019s hard to sell ads if no one is listening.\n\nNashville native Beverly Keel is a longtime journalist and professor; reach her at beverlyjkeel@gmail.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1u9IyZX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Country music industry isn\u2019t giving its female artists the respect their music deserves.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Country music industry isn\u2019t giving its female artists the respect their music deserves.", "title": "Country radio needs to show female artists some respect", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/11/08/country-radio-needs-show-female-artists-respect/18670057/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Country music industry isn\u2019t giving its female artists the respect their music deserves.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/85ab160034279d5fc5c86bd7b393369e742bd033/c=202-0-1360-1158&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/11/07/nas-cma-show-136.jpg", "title": "Country radio needs to show female artists some respect", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Miranda Lambert", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Miranda Lambert", "title": "Country radio needs to show female artists some respect", "author": "Beverly Keel", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9aa0cddd11e56dcb55b3feb012490854ee6f34ee/c=346-0-1214-1158/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/11/07/nas-cma-show-136.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0ed79306415bb9dea065f52692e2840ab5983f9/c=202-0-1360-1158/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/11/07/nas-cma-show-136.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6e90f71147d5babd29a162797d2a6d7aa3cac7f4/c=8-0-1552-1158/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/11/07/nas-cma-show-136.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/deca34d1990dd4d33b96d92858910a2b702f91c7/c=0-140-1561-1018&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/11/07/nas-cma-show-136.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-08T11:03:32.373000-06:00", "shorthed": "Female country artists deserve respect", "articleid": 18670057, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70c9b1d47b393df1c5e442dbe8e2ab3d942e5580/c=0-140-1561-1018/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/11/07/nas-cma-show-136.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b1f637d40e268aabae620bd121e48adf79b0cad3/c=455-0-1106-1158/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/11/07/nas-cma-show-136.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves, Miranda Lambert, CMAs, Country Music Awards, females in country, Carrie Underwood, country radio, Gerry House, Blair Garner"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12bc\"", "article_summary": "Grammy voters decided that Musgraves also co-wrote the best country song and released the best country album of the last year.\nWomen in country music are making the best country music today, and that\u2019s not just my opinion.\nThat\u2019s because the country music industry doesn\u2019t give its female artists the respect their music deserves based on its commercial success and critical acclaim.\nMany radio programmers examine the music of female artists through a harsher lens than songs released by men.\nFirst, quit listening to country radio and contact the stations to let them know why."}
