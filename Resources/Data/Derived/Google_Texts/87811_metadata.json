Nate Bell (R) acknowledged he's working to \"create a barrier\" to health care enrollment by not educating uninsured residents on how to get covered.\n\nOn Feb. 12., Bell said \"without active marketing, you probably get declining enrollment,\" according to the Arkansas Times.\n\n\"We're trying to create a barrier to enrollment,\" Bell said, according to the Times.\n\n\"In general, as a conservative, if I have the opportunity to reduce government spending in a program from what\u2019s projected\u2026 I\u2019m probably going to take that deal,\" Bell added.\n\nA Tuesday vote to reauthorize funding for the \"private option\" on Medicaid expansion failed in the Arkansas state House, five votes shy of the 75 needed for passage.\n\nBell sponsored an amendment banning state spending on advertising, direct mail or any other form of promotion for the Health Insurance Marketplace. In an interview with the blog The Arkansas Project published Feb. 14, Bell explained the reasoning behind his amendment:\n\nThat\u2019s entirely my goal here, to stop this thing from expanding, to lock it where it\u2019s at. Let me explain\u2026the bulk of the enrollment has come from what\u2019s been known as the auto-enrollment, where they take the people in existing programs, send them a letter that says: you\u2019re eligible\u2026please check here and we\u2019ll enroll you. My language takes that ability to do that away.\n\n(h/t ThinkProgress)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Out-Of-Touch Politicians Out-Of-Touch Politicians\n\n1 of 11 Rudy Giuliani And The Price Of Milk While running for president in 2007, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told a reporter at a Montgomery, Ala., supermarket that he estimates \"a gallon of milk is probably about a $1.50, a loaf of bread about a $1.25, $1.30, last time I bought one.\" It must have been a few election cycles since his last trip: The grocery store's website listed milk for $3.38 and bread up to $3.49.
