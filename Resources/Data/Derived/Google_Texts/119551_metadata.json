And does the recent activity signal other heads might roll at the Legislature?\n\nBackground\n\nThe ongoing state and federal probe into alleged Statehouse corruption stems from questions raised more than three years ago by the private watchdog S.C. Policy Council in Columbia and The Post and Courier concerning the campaign spending habits of Harrell, R-Charleston.\n\nMuch of the case was tied to Harrell reimbursing himself thousands of dollars for flights using his private airplane that he claimed were campaign-related.\n\nOne of the several plane trips under scrutiny was a 2009 flight where he took friends and family to Florida for a high school baseball tournament. He later claimed on disclosure forms that he took the trip for \u201clegislative travel.\u201d Authorities determined the trip was personal.\n\nHarrell eventually resigned his office and pleaded guilty to six ethics-related misdemeanors last September. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation. As a part of his plea deal, Harrell agreed to cooperate in further public corruption investigations.\n\nWhy did the investigation resurface now?\n\nMark Powell, communications director for Attorney General Wilson, said Friday that the office does not comment on ongoing criminal investigations.\n\nBut the possibility that more wrongdoing is suspected can be gleaned by reading emails from last October indicating there was something beyond the Harrell prosecution that officials wanted to explore.\n\nIn one of the messages, special prosecutor David Pascoe refers to a lengthy redacted portion of the SLED report covering Harrell\u2019s misconduct.\n\n\u201cI definitely think this is something that should be looked into in regards to any corruption in the Legislature,\u201d Pascoe wrote.\n\nWhat he\u2019s referring to is unknown because the accompanying passage is blacked out.\n\nIn a separate email, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh tells him in connection to Pascoe\u2019s note, \u201cI will request SLED to look into these allegations.\u201d\n\nLast month, a letter from McIntosh to SLED Chief Mark Keel also makes reference to unidentified lawmakers being named in the Harrell report.\n\n\u201cPortions of this report were redacted that involved members of the General Assembly,\u201d it reads. \u201cThis is to request that, upon completion of the investigation of those persons, the report be forwarded to Solicitor David Pascoe for a prosecutive decision.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s the new special prosecutor?\n\nDemocratic 1st Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe. Pascoe was the same special prosecutor who Wilson originally named to take over the Harrell case last year after Harrell\u2019s legal team began questioning the attorney general\u2019s impartiality and ethical conduct.\n\nPascoe said he\u2019s already begun meeting with SLED officials about the scope of his duties in the new probe. But he also has admitted that he was surprised by the appointment, saying the case was given to him by the AG\u2019s office without warning.\n\nPascoe\u2019s new duties cover only those lawmakers in the redacted report. By inference, it means Wilson\u2019s office is hanging onto other aspects of the probe, possibly to include lobbyists or other figures surrounding the Legislature and state government.\n\nWhat does the Policy Council say?\n\nAshley Landess, president of the council, raised the initial ethics issues that led to the investigation of Harrell\u2019s misconduct. She has long held that corruption in the Legislature runs rampant, pointing to what she said are weak campaign disclosure requirements for lawmakers.\n\nIn an interview Friday, she was at a loss as to why the case suddenly surfaced now after months of silence, adding that she feared investigators don\u2019t have the motivation to launch a full-on Statehouse crackdown into some of the issues her watchdog group follows.\n\n\u201cI think we thought this was the beginning of what would be a major investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing the Harrell investigation taught me is how incredibly weak state laws are when it comes to corruption, deliberately. So that may be part of the probe, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nLandess declined to say when she may have last spoken with an investigator about what the council has uncovered on its own.\n\nWill the probe affect next year\u2019s elections?\n\nSpeed has not marked the investigation so far and there is no announced timetable as to what comes next. If Pascoe identifies multiple instances of Statehouse behavior as legally suspect, that will likely draw out the investigation.\n\nIf any new targets are announced, there are two time factors to consider: The Statehouse reconvenes for its 2016 session in January, and lawmakers will begin filing for re-election in March.\n\nWhat\u2019s Harrell been up to?\n\nAs part of his guilty plea last September to the six ethics-related misdemeanor charges, Harrell agreed to cooperate with any state or federal questioning covering matters tied to the probe.\n\nHarrell\u2019s last public comments about the case came in December when he said that he hadn\u2019t spoken with either state or federal investigators since early fall of 2014.\n\nAt the time he said he was under the impression they were done with him, though he did confirm he was asked \u201cabout a few other members\u201d of the Legislature.\n\nToday, no one is confirming if Harrell has added anything since. In a statement Friday, Harrell said he has moved on from his Statehouse life while building his new insurance business in West Ashley.\n\n\u201cMy family and I are working hard and enjoying life these days. That\u2019s really all I have to say,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nReach Schuyler Kropf at 937-5551.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "S.C.
