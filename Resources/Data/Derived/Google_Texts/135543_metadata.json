A plenary session, Cardiovascular Disease in HIV Patients: An Emerging Paradigm and Call to Action , led by Dr. Steven Grinspoon of Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital discussed the fact that cardiovascular disease is an important noninfectious co-morbidity of HIV for which PLWH may be at heightened risk compared to their peers without HIV. Dr. Grinspoon underscored the need for treatment options to prevent cardiovascular disease and discussed investigations underway into possible approaches, including the use of statins (drugs used to lower cholesterol levels), which may offer a number of other benefits to lowering CVD risk among PLWH. Dr. Dieffenbach observed that NIAID, in partnership with NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, will soon be launching the REPRIEVE Study to evaluate the use of a particular drug to reduce the risk of CVD in adults infected with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy.\n\nKey Conference Take-Aways\n\nReflecting on the some of the key themes of the conference overall, Dr. Dieffenbach highlighted two take-ways for all of us:\n\nBetter use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)\u2014Several conference presentations offering ideas on PrEP rollout, use, uptake, and adherence offer useful insights and strategies for consideration. Continued efforts to improve the HIV care continuum\u2014The need for all of us to continue efforts to find undiagnosed individuals and improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum was underscored, he observed, by the data shared by CDC this week. A new CDC analysis found that more than 90 percent of new HIV infections in the U.S. could be averted by diagnosing people living with HIV and ensuring they receive prompt, ongoing care and treatment, reinforcing the importance of HIV testing and treatment for protecting the health of people living with HIV and preventing transmission to others.\n\nOur charge \u2013 those of us who attended and even those who weren\u2019t able to attend the conference \u2013 Dr. Dieffenbach concluded, is to figure out how best to make use of the tools and information shared at CROI 2015 to help end the HIV epidemic.\n\nWatch next week for our interview with Dr. Dieffenbach\u2019s colleague Dr. Peter Kim who spoke with us about TB research highlights coming out of the conference as well as other interviews we conducted at the conference with federal colleagues.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
