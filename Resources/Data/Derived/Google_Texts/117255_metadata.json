But she must have determined that the bad press she would get for being secretive and unaccountable would be worth the advantages of secrecy and control. This is different than her ongoing fundraising controversies. Clinton\u2019s defenders can argue that the presumptive Democratic nominee\u2019s decision to allow her family foundation to take contributions from undesirable foreign governments was the result of Clinton caring too deeply about the sick and impoverished and lacking a foresight about the public backlash. This is very different. The WaPo reports that Clinton apparently made the decision to skirt federal requirements even before her Senate confirmation hearings for the post began. Knowing the turmoil this would cause, Clinton necessarily assumed that the scandal would be worth being able to hide her electronic tracks.\n\n\n\n[Politico seeks to explain the series of stumbles by Team Hillary in recent weeks by citing a lack of adequate staffing. Along the way, the piece sheds some light on the warring factions inside the $2 billion enterprise that continues to pit President Obama\u2019s team against Clinton\u2019s core.]\n\nBad timing - What Clinton could not have foreseen is that the revelation would come at the most damaging moment imaginable. The news comes not only as outrage simmers over her foundation\u2019s sketchy practices but also as Clinton returns to Washington and the political sphere tonight to rally her supporters at EMILY\u2019S List, the pro-choice group that is tasked with waging war on Clinton\u2019s potential opponents on gender issues. The bombshell about secret emails at the State Department also hits on the day the foreign policy she helped craft faces intense scrutiny with the arrival of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a last-ditch bid to head off a nuclear deal with Iran. Her public presence on the same day as Netanyahu\u2019s speech was tough enough. A public appearance on the day of the most significant scandal yet surrounding her second presidential run is just a disaster.\n\n\n\n[Daily Caller reports that the Department of Justice shut down attempts to search off-site storage facilities for Lois Lerner\u2019s missing emails claiming that opponents shouldn\u2019t have even known these facilities and tapes even existed.]\n\n\n\nCui bono? - Clinton\u2019s team is adamant that their candidate complied with the intent of the law that required the former secretary to conduct business on her government account. Their argument is that by providing copies of the emails to other officials that the government already has Clinton is in the clear. Then why the private account? And what was left out of the document dump the Clinton campaign unloaded on the government? Are there emails about the debacle in Libya? Are there emails to unsavory individuals or groups? And the questions will go on and on. An audacious, premeditated decision to skirt sunlight laws and accountability measures is hardly the thing that Clinton needs at a moment when doubts about her ethics were already mounting.\n\n\n\nJEB LOOKS TO EASE CONSERVATIVE WORRIES\n\nLas Vegas Review-Journal: \u201cFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday told a crowd of about 400 people in Las Vegas that he applies conservative values, not just talks about them, as he seriously considers a run for president in 2016. Bush said he\u2019s done something \u2018that is kind of unusual in Washington world,\u2019 He\u2019s had the chance to sign the front side of a paycheck and experience how businesses are formed, how jobs are created and how risk-takers, looking to create businesses, are important for the economy. He also talked about his accomplishments in Florida during eight years as governor\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nJeb mum on donor meetings - AP: \u201cBush was scheduled to be in Las Vegas through Tuesday afternoon. His team acknowledged he had other private meetings while in Las Vegas - including some focused on raising money - but declined to provide further details. The city is home to several prominent Republican donors, including Las Vegas Sands Corp. CEO Sheldon Adelson, who was in Washington on Monday to attend a speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Bush said he monitored Netanyahu\u2019s speech, which Bush described as \u2018classy.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n[WaPo: \u201cFormer Vice President Dan Quayle is set to co-host a fundraiser in Arizona [today] for a super PAC backing Jeb Bush, one of a series of high-dollar events that the former Florida governor is headlining as he mulls a possible presidential bid.]\n\n\n\nPrepares to press the flesh in Iowa - Des Moines Register: \u201cBush, a former Florida governor, will mingle with Iowans at a barbecue restaurant in Waukee and a pizza restaurant in Cedar Rapids, as well as at a fundraiser in Urbandale and a big multi-contender political event in Des Moines, as previously reported\u2026Bush has now scheduled two more events: He will meet privately with Iowa activists, volunteers and GOP campaign veterans on Saturday afternoon at Jethro\u2019s BBQ 'n Jambalaya in Waukee. On Saturday night, he\u2019ll do a public meet-and-greet at the Pizza Ranch at 2450 Westdale Drive SW in Cedar Rapids.\u201d\n\n\n\nIS WALKER PEAKING TOO SOON?\n\nNoting Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s surge in popularity as well as his trip-ups, goateed eminence Jonah Goldberg questions whether the potential 2016 GOP contender\u2019s timing is off: \u201cIn countless discussions I had at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference \u2013 as well as among people I\u2019ve talked to who attended the Club for Growth meeting in Florida this weekend \u2014 the concern for friends, and the hope for foes, is that Walker is peaking too soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nRand looks to blunt critics on Israel - Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is out with a new video today that includes some tough talk on national defense and his opposition to foreign aid for hostile governments. It is part of an effort to rebut critical coverage of his foreign policy like this piece from Buzzfeed: \u201c\u2018If you have to give money to Israel, I\u2019m all for people donating and giving money to Israel but we don\u2019t have money for any of those subsidies, it\u2019s gone,\u2019 Paul told blogger Mica Sims in 2010. \u2018We have to borrow money from China to give it to other countries. It makes no sense whatsoever from a fiscal standpoint.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nCruz auditions for Adelson with tough talk on Iran - National Journal: \u201cThe meeting room on Capitol Hill was packed, but for Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential ambitions, one person stood out. At a panel discussion sponsored by pro-Israel group This World: The Values Network on Monday afternoon, the Texas senator aggressively voiced his view that Iran should not gain nuclear capabilities. It was an opportunity for Cruz, an almost-certain presidential contender, to make his case to casino magnate, GOP mega-donor and audience member Sheldon Adelson, whose fundraising decisions are heavily influenced by candidates\u2019 support for the security of Israel, for 2016 support.\u201d\n\n\n\nKasich on hand for Bibi talk - Columbus Dispatch : \u201cGov. John Kasich, who this month was in the key presidential primary state of South Carolina, will attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s controversial speech [today] before a joint session of Congress.\u201d\n\n\n\nLindsey raises cash on Bibi speech - WaPo: \u201cIf you\u2019re not a member of Congress who plans to be there in person, the place to be is the Capitol Hill Club, a GOP social club where Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is holding a speech-watching luncheon that doubles as a fundraiser for his new political committee. \u201d\n\n\n\nPerry finds a PAC man - NYT: \u201cRick Perry \u2026 is moving to establish a \u201csuper PAC\u201d to back his effort, and has turned to Austin Barbour, a Mississippi-based lobbyist and political operative to head it, according to three people with knowledge of the moves..\u201d\n\n\n\nCarson makes it official - WSJ: \u201cRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has formally created an exploratory committee to run for president, his campaign chief executive, Terry Giles, said Monday. \u2026With the exploratory committee, Mr. Carson can raise money that he can transfer to his campaign once it begins.\u201d\n\n\n\nSOUND OFF: READERS RESPOND TO 2016 POWER INDEX\n\n\u201cIf the party cannot get together quickly behind one candidate it will be another long eight years with Hillary and Bill to stomach. Scott Walker is the closest to fitting the bill with either [Marco Rubio] or [Carly Fiorina] as the VP running mate.\u201d --Bill Norwood, Ozark, Mo.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a [Chris Christie] fan, but have lost interest. Not one of the other candidates, including Jeb, is acerbic enough to duke it out with Hillary\u2019s smarmy cadre of millennial \u2018talking pointers.\u2019 Rand Paul has the venom, but he cannot win. Count me as thumbs up to [Gov. Scott Walker] and [Carly Fiorina]!!\u201d --Brooke Samuelson, Windsor, Conn.\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nThis day in 1845 marks the first time Congress used the Constitutional provision allowing Congressional veto overrides. It was an attempt to rein in President John Tyler\u2019s eager use of presidential veto power. Two weeks prior, Tyler had vetoed a bill that would have denied him the ability to provide funds for cutter ships without Congressional approval. Congress insisted on legislative approval before the commissioning of any new military craft. Tyler\u2019s use of the veto, at 10 times, was only second only to President Andrew Jackson who used it 12 times during his administration.\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Democrats were the staunchest supporters of the creation and defense of the Jewish state. Republicans were once lukewarm. Now, Democrats increasingly side against Israel, while Republicans are nearly unanimous in support. So how did we get here? Part of it is pique. Some of the speech snubbers are Obama loyalists angry at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019sattempt to scuttle President Obama\u2019s pending nuclear deal with Iran. And as John Judis observed, part of it is rooted in political shifts in Israel and the U.S. and resultant changes in lobbying efforts and gamesmanship on both sides. But that still doesn\u2019t fully explain why so many Democrats would risk a backlash from Jewish voters and supporters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic. The answer lies not with the politics of Jewish Americans, but those of Christians.\n\n\n\n[WaPo: \u201cIn November 1945, [President Harry Truman] offered this riposte to American diplomats cautioning him against embracing the cause of Zionism: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, gentlemen, but I have to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious for the success of Zionism: I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my constituents.\u2019\u201d]\n\n\n\nSort it out - As Christians have migrated in increasing numbers to the Republican Party and non-believers have aligned themselves mostly with Democrats, the political pressure points have changed. Social issues, particularly Democratic support for access to elective abortions, have been a major part of this sorting. And like other trends in partisanship, it has been self-perpetuating and self-intensifying. As Christians became more Republican, the Republican Party increasingly reflected their values. Those values, especially among the growing number of evangelical Protestants, include a belief that their faith is an outgrowth of Judaism and in the promise of a land set apart for the people to whom their God first chose to reveal himself. As Democrats become less Christian and Republicans become more Christian, expect the partisan prism on Israel so astonishingly displayed today to become commonplace.\n\n\n\n[In the latest Gallup poll, 45 percent of Americans view the Israeli leader favorably, up 10 points since 2012 and tying the highest rating recorded by Gallup over Netanyahu\u2019s tenures.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s bond with Israel is stronger than the politics of the moment\u2026This is an important message at an important time and the Prime Minister is the perfect person to deliver it.\u201d \u2013Speaker John Boehner says in a new video previewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress.\n\n\n\nBulldog - WashEx: \u201c\u2026Boehner \u2026. said he will give Israel's leader a bust of [Winston Churchill] to note that only those two foreign leaders have ever addressed Congress three times.\u201d\n\n\n\n[The Boston Globe reports that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., will be among those giving Netanyahu the cold shoulder.]\n\n\n\nHOUSE MAY VOTE ON DEMS\u2019 HOMELAND BILL TODAY\n\nNational Journal: \u201cHouse GOP leaders plan to allow a vote as early as [today] on a clean bill to fund the Homeland Security Department through the rest of the fiscal year, according to Republican sources, dashing the hopes of conservatives who want to tie the money to language clocking President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. Leaders detailed their plan at a closed-door GOP conference meeting [this morning]\u2026According to a source in the room, Speaker John Boehner told members the House would vote on the Senate\u2019s DHS funding bill once it receives papers confirming that the other chamber would not go to conference on the bill\u2026. \u2018[T]he House has done its job by passing legislation to fund DHS and block the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration,\u2019 Boehner said, according to the source. \u2018Unfortunately, the fight was never won in the other chamber.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president. \u2026 I believe this decision \u2013 considering where we are \u2013 is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country. The good news is that the president\u2019s executive action has been stopped, for now. This matter will continue to be litigated in the courts, where we have our best chance of winning this fight.\u201d \u2013Speaker John Boehner at a House GOP conference this morning.\n\n\n\nRYAN & CO. LOOK TO REASSURE JUSTICES ON OBAMACARE\n\nPaul Ryan, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, along with Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich. and Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., add another layer to the GOP plan to cover ObamaCare beneficiaries if Supreme Court justices opt to blow up the law. The budget hawks proposal comes in a WSJ op-ed and meshes with other proposals floated by Senate Republicans in recent days.\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream previews the ObamaCare Supreme Court arguments set for Wednesday and the media campaign around Chief Justice John Roberts.]\n\n\n\nCROSSROADS KEEPS HITTING HASSAN\n\nNHjournal: \u201cFollowing up its radio ad buy announced last week, the conservative issues group Crossroads GPS [today] will launch a $50,000 digital ad buy again criticizing Gov. Maggie Hassan [D-N.H.,] for a proposed budget it says includes \u2018more spending, higher taxes, and no real innovation.\u2019 Crossroads last week became the second out-of-state group to attack Hassan, who is viewed as a possible contender for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Kelly Ayotte, [R-N.H.]\u2026. The new digital ad will be seen on Facebook, Twitter and search engine web sites, Crossroads said. Its script is similar to the radio ad, charging Hassan proposed a tax that \u2018would hit lower income people hardest\u2019 and \u2018sizeable increases in business taxes.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n#JOBHUNT\n\nFrom Politico\u2019s interview with departing White House communications boss Dan Pfeiffer: \u201c[O]ne of the coolest things out there right now ... is what Snapchat is doing with ESPN, CNN, Vice and some others through their Discover function.\u201d\n\n\n\nHEAVY DUTY ROBBERY\n\nFrom the bizarre crime files, WFTX reports that the Collier County Sheriff\u2019s department is trying to solve a hefty theft in Monterey, a gated community in North Naples, Fla. The thief somehow made off with 183 boxes filled with rolled nickels worth over $18,000 from a house party on February 15. At almost a half-pound per $2 roll, that would be nearly two tons of 5-cent pieces.\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cNobody is asking for America to go to war.
