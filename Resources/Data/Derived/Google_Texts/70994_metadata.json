But the rest of the nation was not in tune with the Empire State and our region played an important role in the development of the national abolition movement.\n\nIn the fall of 1835, a state convention of anti-slavery groups was to be held in Utica. On Oct. 21 they were to gather on the second floor of the old Utica Academy. A combination of opposition to the abolitionists and fear inciting civil unrest resulted in the city's common council rescinding the permit to meet in the public building.\n\nSo the meeting was moved two blocks west on Bleecker Street to the Second Presbyterian Church in Utica. That used to stand right here in this parking lot\n\nAmong those in attendance, Gerrit Smith, a wealthy anti-slavery sympathizer. A group outside the church, opposed to the anti-slavery movement, forced their way into the meeting and forcefully broke it up.\n\nSmith invited those gathered to come to his residence in Madison County. The next day, 103 of those who met at Utica traveled west on the Erie Canal to Canastota and then walked ten miles to Peterboro.\n\nThe meeting at the Peterboro Presbyterian church was the beginning of the New York State Anti-Slavery Society.\n\nGerrit Smith's participation in the abolition movement, participation that would see him become a member of congress, a candidate for the presidency and institutionalized at the Utica lunatic asylum when his role in the John Brown attack at Harper's Ferry was about to be revealed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Slavery in New York State officially ended on July 4, 1827.
