In a haze of pain, she called a friend for a ride to the only hospital in her central Michigan county. She had no idea that the hospital, Mercy Health Partners, was part of a Catholic health system. She just knew she needed help.\n\nWhat happened next, contend the plaintiffs in a new lawsuit filed by the ACLU on Means\u2019s behalf, was not just the fault of a doctor, emergency room staff, or even the hospital. The blame goes right to the top\u2014to the U.S. Catholic bishops. According to the lawsuit, over the course of the next 36 hours, Means was never told that her fetus had little chance of surviving. Nor was she told\u2014as she would have been in a secular hospital\u2014that doctors could induce labor or terminate her pregnancy. Instead, Means was twice sent home with painkillers and told to return only if she was having contractions three to four minutes apart. Unaware of the risks of continuing the pregnancy, she followed their instructions, still believing that she could have a healthy baby. On the night of December 2, as hospital staff prepared to discharge her for a third time, Means began to deliver her baby, which lived for fewer than three hours. She left the hospital with only an infection, but her condition\u2014pre-term rupture of membranes\u2014could have resulted in infertility.\n\nNow, the ACLU is alleging that a series of directives from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), which opposes abortion, were responsible for Means\u2019s suffering. In its Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services\u2014a document last updated in 2009 that is at the heart of the ACLU\u2019s case\u2014the bishops instruct Catholic hospitals not to provide artificial birth control of any kind, including sterilization, or facilitate surrogate pregnancies. Abortion is also forbidden, with a vague loophole for circumstances when the pregnant woman is suffering from a \u201cproportionately serious pathological condition.\u201d\n\nWith the suit, the ACLU is assailing a favorite liberal b\u00eate noire. The USCCB has, of late, come to surpass even the papacy as a bastion of support for regressive policies. Cases like Means\u2019s underscore the USCCB\u2019s anti-woman reputation. \u201cTamesha Means\u2019s story is not unique,\u201d says Louise Melling, deputy legal director for the ACLU. \u201cIt\u2019s not about one hospital. We\u2019re shining a spotlight on a lack of basic care for women that happens all over the country.\u201d\n\nMany doctors who work in Catholic hospitals chafe under these restrictions. In a study published in 2012, 52 percent of OB/GYNs who work in Catholic hospitals reported at least one ethical conflict over their employer\u2019s religious policies. Lori Freedman, a medical sociologist at the University of California-San Francisco and one of the study\u2019s authors, explains that in many cases, the directives hang over doctors\u2019 heads. \u201cThere are areas where the bishops are less interested in micro-managing the hospital,\u201d she says. \u201cBut in other places, the bishops are really involved, and doctors are scared to death.\u201d\n\nConcerns about Catholic hospitals\u2019 constraints on reproductive health care are mounting thanks to the growing number of mergers between Catholic and secular health systems, a change spurred by incentives in the Affordable Care Act. In rural areas, this can mean\u2014as in the case of Mercy Health Partners\u2014that a Catholic hospital is the only gig in town. Currently, one in six Americans are treated in a Catholic facility; one-third of Catholic hospitals are in a rural area. If all of the mergers under consideration go through, this number could rise considerably. Coupled with anti-abortion policies adopted by a growing number of states that require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, the expansion of Catholic health systems could severely limit the number of doctors who can offer the procedure.\n\nThe Means case disturbingly echoes an incident in 2010, when a Catholic hospital administrator in Phoenix\u2014a nun\u2014was excommunicated after approving an abortion to save the life of a woman with heart failure. The nun was eventually returned to good standing in the church, but after the hospital refused to promise never to perform another abortion, the local bishop, Thomas Olsted, revoked its Catholic affiliation.\n\nAs chilling as these cases are, it\u2019s unclear whether the USCCB\u2019s directives\u2014rather than the decisions of individual Catholic hospitals, doctors, or bishops\u2014are to blame. The ACLU\u2019s complaint alleges that the Ethical and Religious Directives \u201crequire hospitals to abide by their terms, even when doing so places a woman\u2019s health or life at risk.\u201d John Berkman, a professor of moral theology at the University of Toronto, says that although the directives provide important direction for Catholic health-care providers, they\u2019re guidelines, not religious laws. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the USCCB is the general of the army and the hospitals are their subordinates,\u201d he says. \u201cAnyone who thinks that the bishops say a word and everyone follows in lock step is na\u00efve.\u201d\n\nFrom a legal perspective, suing the USCCB rather than the doctor or the hospital is akin to blaming a professional organization for medical malpractice, says Robin Fretwell Wilson, a professor of law at the University of Illinois. Much of the ACLU\u2019s case hinges on the lack of information imparted to Means, which is generally considered to be the doctor\u2019s responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that if [Means] sued the hospital or the doctor, this would be plain-vanilla medical malpractice,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they\u2019re not suing the doctor, the hospital, the local bishops, the board of trustees\u2014you\u2019re many layers removed from the person who really should owe this woman a remedy if everything in the complaint is taken as accurate.\u201d\n\nThe very notion that hospitals can decide what kind of care they will provide based on their religious affiliation is ensconced in federal law; shortly after Roe v. Wade was handed down, Congress passed a broadly worded \u201cconscience clause\u201d prohibiting public officials from requiring doctors or institutions who receive government funds to perform abortion or sterilization procedures if they object on moral grounds. Since then, virtually all of the states have enacted some kind of conscience clause legislation\u2014Michigan allows both individual providers and institutions to refuse to provide abortion\u2014and the federal government\u2019s protections on the religious right of refusal have only expanded.\n\nAlthough federal and state law imparts wide discretion to religiously affiliated health care providers, Catholics are not of one mind about when an abortion is justified; there\u2019s considerable debate among ethicists about how far the right of refusal should go. Julie Hanlon Rubio, a professor of Christian ethics at St. Louis University, a Jesuit institution, says that many moral theologians were disturbed by Olmsted\u2019s condemnation of the Arizona hospital\u2019s decision, which the Catholic Health Association\u2014an umbrella organization comprising more than 600 hospitals\u2014concluded was an appropriate application of the USCCB\u2019s directives. But she adds that she and her colleagues were startled, in part because his action was so extreme. \u201cIn cases where both lives are threatened, there\u2019s no way to save both, and the operation that will save the mother will result in the baby\u2019s death, that seems morally justified,\u201d she says. \u201cIn some cases, a bishop might overstep boundaries. But it\u2019s not typical to have that kind of intervention.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the suit\u2019s efficacy as a legal strategy, Means\u2019s story doesn\u2019t reflect well on the Catholic bishops and the growing Catholic health system. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to grasp how abortion is related to miscarriage or emergency obstetric care, but having real cases brings it home,\u201d Freedman says.\n\nBut the heart of the ACLU\u2019s complaint seems to be less about the directives themselves than the government\u2019s broad protections for conscientious refusal, which provides the legal justification for the guidelines in the first place. It\u2019s hard to argue that the USCCB shouldn\u2019t tell Catholic hospitals to follow Catholic teachings when U.S. law allows so much leeway for individual health care providers\u2019 religious beliefs, and explicitly counts institutions among those individuals. If Means\u2019s treatment at Mercy Health Partners was substandard, it\u2019s trickier to pin the blame on the directives than on bad interpretations from the hospital or the provider\u2014or simple medical malpractice.\n\nEfforts to paint broad-strokes portraits of Catholics as uniformly hostile to women\u2019s rights don\u2019t sit well with Rubio. But she understands why organizations like the ACLU would be anxious about the potential for the doctors or staff of a Catholic hospital to misunderstand the directives\u2014or for bishops to use them too aggressively. \u201cObviously there have to be limits to religious liberty. We can\u2019t allow faith to be a trump card for law,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if people think Catholics are insensitive to this issue, that\u2019s not the case.
