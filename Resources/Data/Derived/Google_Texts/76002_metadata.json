Obama formed the special task force Nov. 21, 2014, when he announced his controversial executive actions to unilaterally grant amnesty to some 5 million illegal aliens. His administration is also bringing in 70,000 foreign refugees per year from Iraq, Somalia, Bhutan, Burma, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and, most recently, Syria.\n\nThe task force, chaired by Obama\u2019s domestic policy guru and former National Council for La Raza executive Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, came out with a list of recommendations on how to integrate the nation\u2019s historically high number of immigrants \u2013 a total of 1.1 million legal immigrants and about 450,000 illegals enter the country every year.\n\nMu\u00f1oz said at the April roll-out event that her attention was focused on \u201cinstitutionalizing\u201d Obama\u2019s policies on immigration so the federal bureaucracy would be hard-wired with a more welcoming attitude toward immigrants of all types long after she and Obama are gone from the White House.\n\nMu\u00f1oz said it was her job \u201cto make sure we build this really into the DNA across the federal bureaucracy, at a leadership level, but much more importantly to make sure that when political appointees like me are no longer here this (immigration strategy) is built into what those agencies do and think about every day.\u201d\n\nShe said it was important for the federal government to standardize, set benchmarks and \u201cmeasure successes,\u201d making sure cities and states create the desired \u201cwelcoming communities\u201d for immigrants and refugees.\n\nCreating new voters and activists\n\nThe task force\u2019s recommendations focus on helping integrate the new Americans on three levels \u2013 economic, linguistic and civic.\n\nThe \u201ccivic\u201d integration measures could prove most controversial. Among the goals are to make the citizenship application more affordable for elderly and poor immigrants, make the citizenship test easier to navigate for those with language or cultural barriers, and mentoring new immigrants and refugees on how to become active participants in America\u2019s \u201cdemocratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cCivic integration\u201d appears to be the code words for turning immigrants into voting citizens who can also become activists for immigrant rights, immigrant benefits and continued open-border immigration policies.\n\nDe Blasio grants ID card to illegals\n\nEager to do his part, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has launched a new \u201cID cards for illegals\u201d program that will make it easier for aliens to use city services such as public libraries, parks and museums and, critics say, to vote in elections.\n\nPart of the \u201cnew Americans\u201d agenda includes setting up \u201ccitizenship corners\u201d in public libraries where immigrants will be coached on how to navigate the process of becoming a U.S. citizen.\n\nAs Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch pointed out, the identification card basically grants the ability for undocumented immigrants over the age of 14 to gain access to city services and financial opportunities otherwise off limits. Armed with the card, illegals can rent an apartment, provide an ID to police and open a banking account, so long as they can prove residency in one of the city\u2019s five boroughs.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about criminal aliens \u2026 and here we have the city of New York aiding and abetting criminal activity.\u201d\n\nFitton said pro-amnesty advocates love the card because it \u201cmakes it easier for [illegals] to vote and to register to vote.\u201d At the same time, he also warned: Someone affiliated with ISIS could simply cross into America via the porous border with Mexico and obtain the New York City card.\n\nMayor de Blasio said of the card, when it launched in January: \u201cThis ID addresses substantially the notion that we all matter and everyone has an identity,\u201d the Observer reported.\n\nCity Council members, meanwhile, touted the card as a terrific way for upholding New York\u2019s diversity and multicultural atmosphere.\n\nFlush with cash from Gates, Rockefeller, Soros foundations\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what the White House is looking for.\n\nAmong the key partners in the White House\u2019s \u201cdiversity\u201d movement are Welcoming America, the Migration Policy Institute, La Raza, and the National Partnership for New Americans.\n\nThe White House Task Force on New Americans announced its report in April at the Migration Policy Institute or MPI in Washington, D.C. This think tank has received funding from a host of globalist and open-borders interests including billionaire George Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Carnegie Corp. of New York, the JM Kaplan Fund of New York and the Public Welfare Foundation, among others, according to Discover the Networks.\n\nOne of MPI\u2019s major agendas is to influence the U.S. government toward a more permissive policy on refugee resettlement.\n\nIn fact, MPI will be hosting a June 26 conference on refugee \u201cintegration.\u201d\n\nThe policy wonks at MPI and the various federal agencies no longer use the word \u201cassimilation\u201d when speaking about immigrants. They prefer the term \u201cintegration,\u201d a concept in which the government \u201cmanages\u201d extremely diverse immigrant populations which coexist side by side with native-born Americans but not necessarily assimilating into a common culture.\n\nEnglish just one of many languages\n\nThe online event page for the upcoming MPI conference acknowledges there have been \u201csuccesses\u201d and \u201cchallenges\u201d when it comes to integrating refugees from \u201cincreasingly diverse origins and linguistic backgrounds.\u201d\n\nCity and county school systems are expected to manage increasing numbers of students who don\u2019t speak English or even Spanish. Twin Falls, Idaho, schools now have 100 refugee students who speak more than 20 languages. Wichita, Kansas, schools have more than 350 foreign students who speak 81 different languages. And Manchester, New Hampshire, schools also play host to students speaking more than 80 languages.\n\nThe United States has the world\u2019s largest refugee resettlement program, accepting two-thirds of the 98,000 refugees who were permanently resettled in 2013.\n\nThe number of primary languages spoken rose from 114 in 2004 to 162 just eight years later, according to MPI. \u201cAlthough this growing diversity reflects an effort on the part of the U.S. government to be more responsive to refugee crises worldwide, it has the potential to complicate service delivery for resettlement providers with limited resources,\u201d the institute says on its website.\n\nSomali refugees: A record of fraud and terror\n\nThe country with the worst record of assimilation is Somalia. About 110,000 Somalis have come to the U.S. as refugees since 1991 with large Somali communities now residing in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of Minnesota, Seattle, Columbus, Ohio, Lewiston, Maine, San Diego, Atlanta, several cities in Texas, North Dakota and Idaho.\n\nSince 2007 dozens of Somalis have been charged and convicted of providing material support to overseas terrorist organizations such as al-Shabab, al-Qaida and ISIS. The FBI has confirmed that more than 40 Somali-Americans have left the country to go fight for al-Shabab and ISIS.\n\nEarlier this year, WND reported, the FBI named Liban Haji Mohamed, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Somalia, as its newest \u201cmost wanted terrorist.\u201d Mohamed worked as a cab driver in Northern Virginia before leaving the country to fight for al-Shabab in his native Somalia. While here, he recruited other Americans to join the terrorist group, the FBI said.\n\nLess than three months later on April 20, the U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Andrew Luger, announced the arrests of six Somali-American men who allegedly tried repeatedly to board flights for the Middle East where they planned to join the ranks of ISIS. Luger admitted at a press conference that \u201cwe have a terror recruitment problem in Minnesota,\u201d where almost all of the suspects have been Somali refugees, or sons and daughters of refugees.\n\nBut the obvious security risks have not stemmed the flow of Somalis. The United Nations continues to send Somalis to U.S. cities at a rate of 800 a month.\n\nSomalis were also involved in a scam for years in which they lied on their applications about family ties to refugees already in the U.S., which led the State Department to temporarily suspend the family reunification program in 2008 after more than 36,000 from Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea entered illegally.\n\nYet, the U.S. State Department, its resettlement contractors and the foundations that support them continue to push for more refugees, saying they are \u201cthe most intensely screened\u201d of all immigrants.\n\nSeeking utopia with \u2018gradually disappearing border controls\u2019\n\nNot surprisingly, the refugee program\u2019s impact on national security is not on the agenda at MPI\u2019s upcoming refugee conference on June 24.\n\nInstead, discussion will focus on MPI\u2019s findings with respect to refugee employment and incomes, English proficiency and education levels, use of public welfare benefits, \u201cas well as differing integration outcomes between refugee groups with similar characteristics at arrival,\u201d the website for the event states.\n\nAccording to Discover the Networks, MPI\u2019s work focuses on six main areas:\n\n\u201c(a) \u2018self-governance\u2019 for communities that straddle the U.S./Mexico border, rather than strict obedience to immigration policies set in Washington; (b) a more permissive U.S. refugee admissions and resettlement policy; (c) increased social-welfare benefits for illegal immigrants residing in the U.S.; (d) a movement beyond \u201cabsolute notions of [national] sovereignty\u201d; (e) \u2018the re-conceptualization of the common border and the border region as a line of convergence rather than separation\u2019; and (f) the creation of \u2018a North America with gradually disappearing border controls.'\u201d\n\nAnother key player in Obama\u2019s push to make new Americans out of refugees and immigrants is an organization called Welcoming America. It was started by David Lubell in 2010 with $150,000 in seed money from George Soro\u2019s foundation.\n\nLubell\u2019s organization and its affiliates go around the country spinning one-sided tales about the economic and cultural benefits that new immigrants bring into American cities while ignoring the costs. They pay for slick TV and radio ads and billboards and help feed positive talking points to mayors and other local officials.\n\nThe JM Kaplan Fund\u2019s international migration division, run by Suzette Brooks Masters, also works to fund programs aimed at countering \u201cbacklash\u201d to refugee programs in American cities.\n\nTurn resistors in to Southern Poverty Law Center\n\nJM Kaplan funded a report written by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in 2013 that offered a playbook on how to quell grassroots uprisings against the infusion of foreign refugees into American cities.\n\nAmong the recommendations given by HIAS was to monitor and research the backgrounds of \u201cresisters\u201d and turn them in to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left \u201cwatchdog\u201d that has in recent years taken to branding mainline Christian organizations such as the Family Research Council as \u201chate groups.\u201d\n\nEva Millona, co-chair of the National Partnership for New Americans, a coalition of 34 organizations involved in advocating for immigrant rights and expanded welfare benefits, said in April it was crucial that the federal government take a leading role in integrating the diverse new immigrant populations springing up around America.\n\n\u201cWe have been pushing to really have a centralized leadership in terms of implementation of this report,\u201d Millona said. \u201cWe are happy that the report has called for a centralized entity to really move it forward.\u201d\n\nMillona said the 34 groups affiliated with her coalition already have \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in 29 states, including all manner of service providers, immigrant rights attorneys, interpreters, and advocates \u201cto make sure immigrants have what they need\u201d to become new Americans.\n\nThey have plenty of mayors signed on to help. And it\u2019s not just big-city mayors. Mayors in Boise, Idaho, Columbia, South Carolina, Nashville, Tennessee, Louisville, Kentucky, and Dodge City, Kansas, among other places have all been working with Lubell\u2019s Welcoming America and similar community-organizing groups.\n\nNashville Mayor Karl Dean has created a special high-level office, the New Americans Advisory Council, to advise him on how to integrate the city\u2019s growing population of foreign-born residents.\n\nPlanting \u2018seed communities\u2019 to transform smaller cities\n\nNashville\u2019s foray into the immigrant welcoming business began in earnest when it agreed to join a pilot program funded by a federal grant to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 2001. Nashville joined Portland, Oregon, and Lowell, Massachusetts, as the three experimental testing grounds.\n\nThat experiment, called Building the New American Community Initiative, contained a mission that became the model for transforming the demographics of cities of all sizes across the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of this grant if you look in retrospect what they were trying to do, is expand the resettlements outside of the traditional gateway cities of L.A., New York, Houston, Boston, Miami and Chicago and plant new seeds throughout the country,\u201d said a Nashville activist who asked not to be identified.\n\n\u201cThey roped in the Chamber of Commerce, which took this federal grant,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd one of the outgrowths of this twisted thinking is to very quickly get the refugees invested in local government and forming coalitions within their communities.\u201d\n\nThe BNAC initiative\u2019s executive summary talks about creating economic and social change through increasing levels of immigration and refugee resettlement which would spread more broadly throughout the nation\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 1990s was an extraordinary decade in terms of the number, origins and cultural diversity of migrants who arrived in the United States. \u201cImmigration\u2019s influence on the social, economic and political institutions of the nation has matched these demographic changes, and there is every indication that refugees and immigrants will continue to be a major force for change in the years to come. The influence of newcomers and their children on local communities, as well as the ways in which communities affect newcomers\u2019 integration trajectories, lies at the heart of many social and economic changes in American society.\u201d\n\nThe summary also refers to the \u201cimportance of voting\u201d and getting refugees and immigrants to \u201cparticipate as partners with public agencies\u201d while helping \u201ccraft policies\u201d that change the community.\n\n\u201cOne of the major goals of the BNAC Initiative was to educate policymakers about newcomer communities and their integration experiences in localities, as well as to bring refugee and immigrant voices to the table on a range of policy issues. This has been one of the most successful aspects of the Initiative, with newcomers not only learning about the American electoral system and the importance of voting, but also participating as partners with public agencies in the coalitions. In practical terms, refugee and immigrant organizations played a direct role in crafting policies and programs that directly influence their communities as well as the receiving community.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, they took this grant in 2001 and everyone was really sort of asleep at the wheel as far as what was happening in Tennessee,\u201d according to the activist.\n\nBrian Mosely, a reporter for the Times-Gazette in Shelbyville, Tennessee, woke up the sleeping masses with a bombshell series of articles from 2008 to 2012 about the problems Bedford County was experiencing with the influx of Somali refugees, most of whom went to work in a Tyson meatpacking plant. Many of the problems had to do with culture clashes, crime and costs. When Tyson dropped the Labor Day holiday in favor of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr, the town exploded in controversy as the local union rep described the backlash to the holiday as \u201cbigotry.\u201d\n\nThen there was an article in the Wall Street Journal about how the refugees were being bused in to the meat plant and replacing native workers.\n\n\u201cThere were contradictory reports of refugee contractors with Catholic Charities driving refugees in to get the jobs,\u201d said the local activist. \u201cThey lied to cover this up.\u201d\n\nThe list of mayors signing on to Obama\u2019s strategy to create voter-eligible \u201cnew Americans\u201d is likely to keep growing.\n\nFor an indication of how many mayors across the U.S. hold views similar to Atlanta\u2019s Kasim Reed and Nashville\u2019s Karl Dean, one only need peruse the membership rolls of the Partnership for a New American Economy. This group consists of Chambers of Commerce in cooperation with major investment bankers like Rockefeller Group International, Goldman Sachs and Brown Brothers Harriman along with dozens of U.S. mayors, from big and small cities and belonging to both major parties. The group claims that immigrants and refugees are highly entrepreneurial and strengthen a city\u2019s economy.\n\nA recent study by the Congressional Research Office discovered quite the opposite. It found 74.2 percent of refugees brought to the U.S. through the United Nations refugee program end up on federal food stamps, while 23 percent live in public housing.\n\nThe \u2018Dirty Dozen\u2019 mayors?\n\nIn October 2014, after thousands of unaccompanied alien children crossed the U.S. southern border from Central America, Lubell\u2019s Welcoming America honored 12 mayors it said had the compassion to welcome the children into their cities. Refugee Resettlement Watch blogger Ann Corcoran dubbed them the \u201cdirty dozen.\u201d Most are also members of the Partnership for a New American Economy.\n\nMayor Kasim Reed, Atlanta\n\nMayor Martin J. Walsh, Boston\n\nMayor Rahm Emanuel, Chicago\n\nMayor Stephen Benjamin, Columbia, S.C.\n\nMayor Michael Hancock, Denver\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti, Los Angeles\n\nCounty Executive Isiah Leggett, Montgomery County, Md.\n\nMayor Michael Nutter, Philadelphia\n\nMayor William Peduto, Pittsburgh\n\nMayor Daniel Bianchi, Pittsfield, Mass.\n\nMayor Edward Murray, Seattle\n\nMayor Francis Slay, St. Louis\n\nMayor Jonathan Rothschild, Tucson, Ariz.\n\nOther cities and counties that have pledged their support to Lubell\u2019s welcoming movement include: Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (including Pittsburgh); Austin, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; Boise, Idaho; Chicago, Illinois; Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Dodge City, Kansas; High Point, North Carolina; Lincoln, Nebraska; Louisville, Kentucky; MaComb County, Michigan; Montgomery County, Maryland; Nashville, Tennessee; New York, New York; Oakley, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Francisco, California; St. Louis, Missouri (city); St. Louis, Missouri (county); and Sterling Heights, Michigan.\n\nRead the White House task force\u2019s full report: \u201cStrengthening Communities by Welcoming All Residents: A Federal Strategic Action Plan on Immigrant and Refugee Integration.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "President Obama\u2019s making a big push in the final months of his presidency to convert huge numbers of recent immigrants and refugees into \u201cnew Americans,\u201d and the mayors of the nation\u2019s cities are lining up to help him accomplish his goal.
