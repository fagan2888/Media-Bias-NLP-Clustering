First lady Michelle Obama is now part of "the club" - the 50-plus club.

There's a big party planned for the first lady this weekend but, in the mean time, she's celebrating at least one birthday gift: her first AARP card.

FLOTUS may be excited to finally be a member of the advocacy group, but she likely won't need to use many of the benefits - discounts, health insurance and travel savings - while she's in the White House.

"Excited to join Barack in the 50+ club todayâ€¦ check out my AARP card!" Obama tweeted this morning.
