Donald Trump called Friday for a boycott of Apple until the tech giant agrees to help the FBI access information stored on the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.

Trump then went on a Twitter rant about Ted Cruz and Obamacare while tweeting from... an iPhone.

A judge has ordered Apple to help the FBI bypass the security measures of Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone, which could give the government information about whether the man in the husband-wife terror crew had help with the December attack that killed 14 people and injured 17.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement on the company’s website that doing so would be government “overreach” and would set a dangerous precedent for tech companies nationwide.

Google and Twitter, among others, have applauded Cook’s decision.

Federal prosecutors filed court papers Friday seeking to make Apple to comply with the FBI’s order.

“Boycott Apple!” Trump reportedly said in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, a day before the South Carolina Republican primary. “Boycott Apple until such time as they give up that information.”

The call is sure to resonate with his fervent following, who Trump constantly peppers with messages of fear about terrorists and the need for more government oversight on matters of national security.

There’s just one problem.

Some time after Trump made his proclamation, a five-tweet rant was posted on his verified, personal Twitter account. The tweets boasted about how he would completely repeal Obamacare and referenced Ted Cruz’s outspoken support of Chief Justice John Roberts, who eventually voted to uphold Obamacare.

All five of Trump’s tweets were sent via “Twitter for iPhone” — Twitter’s app for Apple’s most popular device, the iPhone.

It is unclear who exactly Trump thinks should “boycott Apple,” but he apparently is not included.
