An estimated 18.5 mothers died for every 100,000 births in 2013, compared with 7.2 in 1987.\n\nThe Post reports that this translates to, quote, \u201ca woman giving birth here is twice as likely to die than in Saudi Arabia and three times as likely than in the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWashington Post\u201d reporter Danielle Paquette, who wrote the story, joins us.\n\nDanielle, in your piece, there is a startling line, and I am just going read it. It says, \u201cthe United States is the only advanced economy in the world with a rising maternal mortality rate.\u201d\n\nWhat is going on in this country as opposed to other advanced economies that is causing this problem?\n\nDANIELLE PAQUETTE, REPORTER, \u201cTHE WASHINGTON POST\u201d: Well, Alison, this problem confounds a lot in the medical community. There is not one thing driving the problem.\n\nExperts I have spoken to tell me that certain parts of the country there is \u2014 there are gaps in health insurance coverage, especially in the South. For example, Mississippi has one of the highest maternal mortality rates, that the state did not expand Medicaid.\n\nThere\u2019s something like 100,000 people who don\u2019t have access to any healthcare. And many of them are women. We have in Mississippi 160 doctors for every 100,000 residents. That drives part of this problem.\n\nALISON STEWART: One of the interesting things in your piece is that the problems are described as preventable. So what\u2019s stopping people from preventing them?\n\nDANIELLE PAQUETTE: Well, some doctors say it is something as simple as getting a routine checkup. So many women lack access to healthcare, especially in the South. And so maybe just something as simple going to that doctor and saying, hey, something doesn\u2019t feel right. Help me out.\n\nAnother thing is a social reason. Oftentimes doctors will see women, women might say something feels off, something is not right. And a physician might write that off as stress or perhaps just paranoia.\n\nAnd that \u2013 that same women (ph), some nurses say may go home and then she may enter premature labor and she may start bleeding. If she would have been at the hospital at the time of this, you know, that could possibly have saved her life.\n\nALISON STEWART: This makes me think that this is just a very stark example of the bigger issue of that certain populations in this country, based on whether it is race or based on economic standing, have better access to better healthcare.\n\nDANIELLE PAQUETTE: It is incredible to see the numbers. Risk varies drastically by race. In some parts of the country, African-American women are nearly twice as likely to die of pregnancy-related complications.\n\nALISON STEWART: Danielle Paquette from \u201cThe Washington Post,\u201d thank you for sharing your reporting.\n\nDANIELLE PAQUETTE: Thank you, Alison.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The United States is the only advanced economy in the world with an increasing number of women who die in childbirth.
