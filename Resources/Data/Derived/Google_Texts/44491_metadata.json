In recent years, though, legislators whittled back coverage for more than 100,000 adults, to the point that most were limited to emergency procedures such as pulling teeth that were painful, infected or impacted, often after a patient showed up at an emergency room.\n\nIn agreeing to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 or Obamacare, as many people call it \u2013 the Legislature this year set aside $23.3 million for this biennium to restore dental coverage to adults, Lindeblad said. But it will receive $49.2 million from the federal government to cover newly eligible families.\n\n\u201cWith the pent up-demand, it may be problematic, out of the gate, to get an appointment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch to see if we have capacity issues.\u201d\n\nBracken Killpack, vice president of government affairs for the Washington State Dental Association, said the state has among the highest ratios of dentists to population in the country and should have the capacity to handle the increase. It helps that, unlike medical practices, where specialists outnumber general practitioners, about 80 percent of dentists are in general or family practice, he said.\n\nBut some dentists initially may be reluctant to take new Medicaid patients after their experience with the state starting, stopping and restarting coverage over the last decade, he added.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be a little cautious,\u201d Ulmer agreed. Some patients were in the middle of treatment programs when they lost their coverage, and dentists scrambled to work out reduced fees or payment plans that could fit with patients\u2019 limited resources. Adult dental care is often more complex and expensive than children\u2019s care, and reimbursement rates from Medicaid are lower.\n\nNot everyone who is covered by a Medicaid dental program will use it, Ulmer said, just as not everyone who has private dental insurance uses it until there\u2019s an emergency. But the goal is to get as many people in preventive care as possible.\n\nThe IDEA Clinic will treat adults on the new Medicaid programs as well as those who don\u2019t have insurance, essentially \u201ceverybody who comes through the door,\u201d she said. Spokane dentists volunteer their services, but the clinic still has overhead and staff costs, and the reimbursement rates will help with that.\n\n\u201cWe might be able to break even with Medicaid,\u201d Ulmer said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OLYMPIA \u2013 A quarter-million adults in Washington will gain dental coverage over the next two years as the state expands its Medicaid rolls under the Affordable Care Act and re-establishes programs dropped in budget cutbacks.
