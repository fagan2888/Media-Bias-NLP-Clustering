Elise M. Stefanik introduced the Be Open Act in an announcement Thursday. The legislation repeals mandated automatic health care enrollment for new employees under the ACA.\n\nThe act requires that employers with more than 200 employees automatically enroll any new full-time employees in a health care plan within 90 days if the employee does not choose a plan or declines coverage.\n\n\u201cThis legislation simply repeals an unnecessary and duplicative part of this law that reduces choice in health coverage and creates confusion that can lead to significant tax penalties on both the employee and employer,\u201d Ms. Stefanik, R-Willsboro, said in a release.\n\nShe outlined several complications that could be caused by auto-enrollment. If an employee is auto-enrolled, he or she may not be aware of the fixed premiums associated with a new plan that could be unaffordable in some cases. Employees also could be double-enrolled if they are already covered by a separate plan before they were hired, and they could be subject to ACA tax penalties if they receive tax credits for health care coverage or use a health savings account.\n\nLisa A. Weber, owner of Timeless Frames in Watertown, said she has never had any problems with new employees having conflicting health insurance when auto-enrolling. However, she said, employees should be able to choose their plan, especially when health insurance becomes costly for employers.\n\n\u201cAt Timeless Frames, we have always offered a rich health insurance plan, and we remain committed to it,\u201d Ms. Weber said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s smart for people to have health insurance, but there comes a point where you have to start compromising the plan, and that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watertown Daily Times", "description": "Employers no longer may have to enroll new employees automatically in a health care plan under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Stefanik legislation repeals employee health care auto-enrollment under Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20150718/NEWS03/150718714", "image": "http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/images/ogimage_wdt.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1089953044367179, "pages": 88854700101}, "viewport": "width=1290, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "PREV NEXT Order PrintsEmployers no longer may have to enroll new employees automatically in a health care plan under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe legislation repeals mandated automatic health care enrollment for new employees under the ACA.\n\u201cAt Timeless Frames, we have always offered a rich health insurance plan, and we remain committed to it,\u201d Ms. Weber said.\nHowever, she said, employees should be able to choose their plan, especially when health insurance becomes costly for employers.\nThe act requires that employers with more than 200 employees automatically enroll any new full-time employees in a health care plan within 90 days if the employee does not choose a plan or declines coverage."}
