She spent three months in rehab at the renowned Craig Hospital.\n\nNow, the Eagle Valley community is rallying behind her, helping her at school and in the neighborhood as she rolls through a new normal. Volunteers have spent hundreds of hours outfitting her home to accommodate a wheelchair. Teachers and classmates have helped her navigate Eagle Valley High School. (Just don\u2019t ask her how it\u2019s going, because, like most every 15-year-old would say, \u201cschool is gross.\u201d)\n\nThe Forsberg family is hosting its first fundraiser on Friday, Aug. 28, hoping to offset their escalating medical and rehabilitation costs. The Caring for Kailyn event \u2013 at Eagle\u2019s Brush Creek Pavilion (909 Capitol St.) \u2013 is scheduled from 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Tickets are available at the door or at the Vail Valley Charitable Fund website.\n\nThe $25 per-person fundraiser will include a silent auction with more than 70 items, live music and dinner with a cash bar.\n\nClick over to facebook.com/caringforkailyn for more info.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "A fundraiser for Kailyn Forsberg, the Eagle freeskier who was paralyzed in a slopestyle competition at Copper Mountain in April, is set for Friday, Aug. 28", "title": "Kailyn Forsberg fundraiser set for Friday, Aug 28 in Eagle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/08/27/fundraiser-for-injured-freeskier-kailyn-forsberg-set-for-friday-aug-28-in-eagle/28119/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2015/08/kailyn-at-craig-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "A fundraiser for Kailyn Forsberg, the Eagle freeskier who was paralyzed in a slopestyle competition at Copper Mountain in April, is set for Friday, Aug. 28", "title": "Fundraiser for injured freeskier Kailyn Forsberg set for Friday, Aug. 28 in Eagle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/08/27/fundraiser-for-injured-freeskier-kailyn-forsberg-set-for-friday-aug-28-in-eagle/28119/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2015/08/kailyn-at-craig-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@jasonblevins", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A fundraiser for Kailyn Forsberg, the Eagle freeskier who was paralyzed in a slopestyle competition at Copper Mountain in April, is set for Friday, Aug. 28"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73dd\"", "article_summary": "Kailyn Forsberg is back at school, rolling in and out of her house on a custom-made wheelchair ramp and getting back to her life as a teenager.\nNow, the Eagle Valley community is rallying behind her, helping her at school and in the neighborhood as she rolls through a new normal.\nTeachers and classmates have helped her navigate Eagle Valley High School.\n(Just don\u2019t ask her how it\u2019s going, because, like most every 15-year-old would say, \u201cschool is gross.\u201d)The Forsberg family is hosting its first fundraiser on Friday, Aug. 28, hoping to offset their escalating medical and rehabilitation costs.\nIt\u2019s been almost five months since a catastrophic crash during a national slopestyle competition at Copper Mountain left the 15-year-old athlete paralyzed."}
