Oh, and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) could snatch the GOP nomination away from Trump. This whole election cycle is full of surprises, so the obvious next step is that some of the most hard-core liberals who write for The New York Times actually pen something sensible. I\u2019m talking about Paul Krugman\u2019s piece last week, where the unabashed liberal economist (and Nobel laureate) said essentially that Bernie Sanders has jumped the shark:\n\nFrom the beginning, many and probably most liberal policy wonks were skeptical about Bernie Sanders. On many major issues \u2014 including the signature issues of his campaign, especially financial reform \u2014 he seemed to go for easy slogans over hard thinking. And his political theory of change, his waving away of limits, seemed utterly unrealistic. [\u2026] ou could argue that policy details are unimportant as long as a politician has the right values and character. As it happens, I don\u2019t agree. For one thing, a politician\u2019s policy specifics are often a very important clue to his or her true character \u2014 I warned about George W. Bush\u2019s mendacity back when most journalists were still portraying him as a bluff, honest fellow, because I actually looked at his tax proposals. For another, I consider a commitment to facing hard choices as opposed to taking the easy way out an important value in itself. But in any case, the way Mr. Sanders is now campaigning raises serious character and values issues. It\u2019s one thing for the Sanders campaign to point to Hillary Clinton\u2019s Wall Street connections, which are real, although the question should be whether they have distorted her positions, a case the campaign has never even tried to make. But recent attacks on Mrs. Clinton as a tool of the fossil fuel industry are just plain dishonest, and speak of a campaign that has lost its ethical moorings.\n\nThe Washington Post editorial board also took Sanders to task after his train wreck of a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board, where he touted a favorite talking point of the far left: he wants to break up the big banks. How? Well, he\u2019ll come up with an answer to that question at a later juncture, which no one saw as an acceptable answer.\n\nA New York Daily News editorial board interview with the candidate proved otherwise. The senator seemed to have no idea of what reformed banks should look like, or whether he would need new legislation, even though the government under his presidency would play a central role in tearing apart these complex financial institutions. Mr. Sanders followed the interview with what was meant to be a clarifying statement. The treasury secretary would draw up a list of too-big-to-fail banks, Mr. Sanders explained, and break them up under the authority of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. In an interview with us, Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels said that current regulators are not applying existing authorities aggressively enough and that Mr. Sanders would pick a strong treasury secretary with no Wall Street ties to fill in many of the details. It\u2019s astonishing that, on this of all issues, the campaign would need to issue a what-the-candidate-meant-to-say statement. Even then, the campaign has left a lot of essential questions unanswered.\n\nOh c\u2019mon, Washington Post; you saw that this guy was a mile-wide and an inch deep back in January:\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s story continues with fantastical claims about how he would make the European social model work in the United States. He admits that he would have to raise taxes on the middle class in order to pay for his universal, Medicare-for-all health-care plan, and he promises massive savings on health-care costs that would translate into generous benefits for ordinary people, putting them well ahead, on net. But he does not adequately explain where those massive savings would come from. Getting rid of corporate advertising and overhead would only yield so much. Savings would also have to come from slashing payments to doctors and hospitals and denying benefits that people want.\n\nThe scary part is that he has cobbled together a large following, especially with young, college-educated liberals. This is terribly depressing, since many of these students are suckered into thinking that free college is a serious, and sustainable, economic policy. Moreover, it could possibly gut black colleges. It seems like Sanders\u2019 college plan could be one huge economic failure and a microaggession to boot. As for Bernie\u2019s health care plan, well, it\u2019s a total disaster for the working poor.\n\nLast Note: Watch Cato Senior Fellow Johan Norberg explain how Sweden didn\u2019t start off as a socialist haven, but such a theory was embraced towards the latter part of the 20th century and pretty much ruined the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you lose Paul Krugman....05/27/2016 6:57:26AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "When you lose Paul Krugman...", "title": "Even Paul Krugman Thinks Sanders Is 'Over The Edge'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/11/even-paul-krugman-thinks-sanders-is-over-the-edge-n2146108", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/101/2016-04-10T051109Z_1_LYNXNPEC39050_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-SANDERS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "When you lose Paul Krugman...", "title": "Even Paul Krugman Thinks Sanders Is 'Over The Edge'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/11/even-paul-krugman-thinks-sanders-is-over-the-edge-n2146108", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/101/2016-04-10T051109Z_1_LYNXNPEC39050_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-SANDERS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Even Paul Krugman Thinks Sanders Is 'Over The Edge', Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "But in any case, the way Mr. Sanders is now campaigning raises serious character and values issues.\nThe treasury secretary would draw up a list of too-big-to-fail banks, Mr. Sanders explained, and break them up under the authority of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.\nMr. Sanders followed the interview with what was meant to be a clarifying statement.\nIt seems like Sanders\u2019 college plan could be one huge economic failure and a microaggession to boot.\nIt\u2019s one thing for the Sanders campaign to point to Hillary Clinton\u2019s Wall Street connections, which are real, although the question should be whether they have distorted her positions, a case the campaign has never even tried to make."}
