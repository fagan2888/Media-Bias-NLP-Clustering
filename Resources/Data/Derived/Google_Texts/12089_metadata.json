The potential sale price has not been disclosed, said Cottage spokeswoman Maria Zate.\n\nUSPI needs to complete an appraisal of the center before an agreement is reached and sent to the Federal Trade Commission. Cottage expects the process to take at least five more months, the company said in a news release.\n\nCottage, the Santa Barbara-based nonprofit healthcare provider, said in April that it\u2019s looking to sell its surgery center at 2403 Castillo St. to assuage the FTC\u2019s monopoly concerns regarding the proposed merger.\n\nThe merger has been in the works for more than two years but the FTC would not comment on the status of its investigation. The merger would combine Sansum, the largest physician practice on the South Coast, with the only inpatient hospital.\n\nSansum and Cottage have said that the merger would align with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s call for partnerships and efficiencies. Others worry that the merger would increase the cost of care and delay service delivery.\n\nThe deal would unite Cottage\u2019s three hospitals \u2014 in Santa Barbara, Goleta and Santa Ynez \u2014 and Sansum\u2019s 23 ambulatory sites.\n\n\u2022 Contact Alex Kacik at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "santa barbara,cottage hospital,surgery,sansum,health care,latest news,south coast", "og": {"site_name": "Pacific Coast Business Times", "description": "Cottage Health Systems and Sansum Clinic moved a step closer to their proposed merger as Cottage found a potential buyer for its Santa Barbara Outpatient Surgery Center, Cottage announced Sept. 28.\u2026", "title": "Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital finds buyer for outpatient surgery center", "url": "http://www.pacbiztimes.com/2015/09/28/santa-barbara-cottage-hospital-finds-buyer-for-outpatient-surgery-center/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "description": "Cottage Health Systems and Sansum Clinic moved a step closer to their proposed merger as Cottage found a potential buyer for its Santa Barbara Outpatient", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-29T00:53:45-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-29T01:02:03-06:00"}}, "article_summary": "Cottage Health Systems and Sansum Clinic moved a step closer to their proposed merger as Cottage found a potential buyer for its Santa Barbara Outpatient Surgery Center, Cottage announced Sept. 28.\nThe deal would unite Cottage\u2019s three hospitals \u2014 in Santa Barbara, Goleta and Santa Ynez \u2014 and Sansum\u2019s 23 ambulatory sites.\nCottage, the Santa Barbara-based nonprofit healthcare provider, said in April that it\u2019s looking to sell its surgery center at 2403 Castillo St. to assuage the FTC\u2019s monopoly concerns regarding the proposed merger.\nSansum and Cottage have said that the merger would align with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s call for partnerships and efficiencies.\nCottage tasked New York-based investment banking firm Cain Brothers & Co. to find a possible suitor and they came up with United Surgical Partners International, a healthcare provider based in Pasadena."}
