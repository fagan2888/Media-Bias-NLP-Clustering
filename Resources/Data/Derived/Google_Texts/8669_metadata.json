But after monitoring the 115th U.S. Open during its four-day run, I\u2019m convinced Weiskopf, knowledgeable and TV- friendly on pregame and postgame panel shows, would be a much better fit as a tournament analyst.\n\nNorman knows the sport. But he missed key occasions when his knowledge should have turned into listenable opinion.\n\nBuck noted Thursday that Tiger Woods had a disastrous opening round. Norman agreed, but he declined to provide any thought-provoking comments about Woods\u2019 problems.\n\nWATCH: Is it right for U.S. Open to copy British Open?\n\nAnd early Saturday night the TV cameras were focused on Dustin Johnson, who looked trapped in a Chambers Bay sand trap worthy of a scene from \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d\n\nJohnson solved the problem, lofting his ball and landing it just a couple of feet from the pin.\n\nNorman noted: \u201cThat was a terrific shot!\u201d\n\nWe knew that. But where was the analysis to describe just how difficult the shot was?\n\nPerhaps Buck and Norman will blend better in the future. Fox\u2019s U.S. Open contract runs 11 more years.\n\nTo casual viewers, Chambers Bay probably looked as if the U.S. Open was being played on a links course in Scotland.\n\nChambers Bay\u2019s dry, often bumpy greens produced two memorable comments from golfers.\n\nHenrik Stenson, after Friday\u2019s round, said the greens \u201cwere pretty much like putting on broccoli.\u201d\n\nRory McIlroy added Saturday: \u201cI don\u2019t think they are as green as broccoli. I think they\u2019re more like cauliflower.\u201d\n\nSpecial tribute.\n\nKMGH-Channel 7 will provide live coverage (6:30-7 p.m. Friday) of a Special Olympics event at Red Rocks. The program will salute four local athletes ready to compete at the Special Olympics World Games in Los Angeles next month.\n\nThe athletes are Julian Hall, 25, of Denver, tennis; Chris McElroy, 29, of Aurora, swimming; Nikia Davenport, 40, of Denver, powerlifting; and Nathan Knepper, 37, of Golden, tennis.\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post. Contact him at tvtime@com- cast.net.\n\nSports talk radio on Mile High Sports will return, probably next Monday, on KDEN (1340 AM). It\u2019s one of Denver\u2019s oldest frequencies. The 1340 signal has been in the local lineup since 1940 when Frederick Meyer, a local grocer, put it on the air as KMYR-AM.\n\nMile High Sports\u2019 1340 AM lineup will feature the same talent heard on 1550 AM and 94.1 FM, which left the air May 20 when Mile High sold the two properties to music-oriented Marco Broadcasting.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dusty Saunders: Tom Weiskopf worthy of U.S. Open analyst role", "title": "Dusty Saunders: Tom Weiskopf worthy of U.S. Open analyst role", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/21/dusty-saunders-tom-weiskopf-worthy-of-u-s-open-analyst-role/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150621__GettyImages-51058428p1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150621__GettyImages-51058428p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-21T22:14:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:58:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9aaf\"", "article_summary": "Here is mine: Replace Greg Norman with Tom Weiskopf as the analyst teaming with Joe Buck.\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post.\nWATCH: Is it right for U.S. Open to copy British Open?\nBut after monitoring the 115th U.S. Open during its four-day run, I\u2019m convinced Weiskopf, knowledgeable and TV- friendly on pregame and postgame panel shows, would be a much better fit as a tournament analyst.\nTo casual viewers, Chambers Bay probably looked as if the U.S. Open was being played on a links course in Scotland."}
