In other words, people are buying into the rhetoric of the Democrats, while at the same time, they agree with critical public policies advocated by the Republicans.\n\nThe major finding of the survey is intriguing and puzzling. \u201cMajorities say the Democratic Party is open and tolerant, cares about the middle class and is not \u2018too extreme.\u2019 By contrast, most Americans see the GOP lacking in tolerance and empathy for the middle class, and half view it as too extreme.\u201d\n\nThe perception that the GOP cares less about the middle class than the Democrats is especially troubling for the Republican Party because demographic and economic data is clear that Democrat policies have been disastrous for the middle class. There is a huge gap between public perceptions and the reality of life in the middle class during the Obama presidency. Thomas B. Edsall\u2019s December 2014 column in the New York Times asks, \u201cHave Democrats Failed the White Working Class?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question because, he writes:\n\n\u201cAt work and at home, their lives are worse than they were a generation ago. Their real incomes have fallen, their employment opportunities have diminished, their families have crumbled and their ties to society are fraying.\n\n\u201cThis is how daily life feels, to many in the white working class. Unlike blacks and Hispanics, whites are not the beneficiaries of affirmative action programs designed to open doors to higher education and better jobs for underrepresented minorities; if anything, these programs serve only to limit their horizons.\n\n\u201cLiberal victories in the sexual and women\u2019s rights revolutions \u2013 victories that have made the lives of many upscale Democrats more productive and satisfying \u2014 appear, from the vantage point of the white working class, to have left many women to struggle as single parents, forced to cope with both male defection from paternal responsibility and the fragmentation of a family structure that was crucial to upward mobility in the postwar period.\u201d\n\nThe changes in societal mores over the past six years, especially in regard to sexual matters, have disproportionately hurt the lower and middle classes. The \u201cmarriage gap\u201d is the highest it has ever been; the difference in marriage rates between the working class and middle-and-upper middle class has produced unprecedented numbers of single mothers and children in poverty.\n\nIn his new book, \u201cLabor\u2019s Love Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Working-Class Family in America,\u201d Andrew J. Cherlin explores all the ways that the decline in marriage has harmed non-college-educated adults who are increasingly turning to cohabitation rather than marriage and raising their children as single parents rather than follow the patterns of the college-educated who are more likely to get married before having children.\n\nIn her review of Mr. Cherlin\u2019s book, Kay Hymowitz noted that by 2010 while college-educated women delayed motherhood, non-college-educated-women\u2019s \u201crates of nonmarital childbearing had doubled and their families looked more like those of the inner-city poor than the \u201crespectable\u201d quasi-bourgeois of the working-class golden age.\u201d She further added, \u201cThe stolid, churchgoing working-class family is imploding, with divorce and nonmarital births now as routine as a high-school football game.\u201d\n\nWhile some Americans are happy to see looser societal strictures, Ross Douthat, in an excellent New York Times column summarizes the problems related to the vast \u201ccultural and economic divide between the college educated and the struggling working class.\u201d He wrote, \u201cWe may have a culture in which the working class is encouraged to imitate what are sold as key upper-class values \u2014 sexual permissiveness and self-fashioning, spirituality and emotivism \u2014 when really the upper class is also held together by a kind of secret traditionalism, without whose binding power family life ends up coming apart even faster.\u201d\n\nThe Pew study also indicates what other polls also show: President Obama\u2019s job approval rate has ticked up (to 48 percent compared to 26 percent for congressional leaders) since his monumental loss in the 2014 elections. His rhetorical initiatives have improved his personal standing, but when asked who can best solve the nation\u2019s problems, Pew reports a statistical tie, \u201c40 percent say Obama, while 38 percent say GOP leaders. That is virtually unchanged from a few days after the midterm elections in November.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has also successfully continued to paint Republicans as \u201cextremists.\u201d Pew reports that 50 percent of the public views the GOP as extreme while only 36 percent view the Democrats as extreme. In fact, nearly 60 percent of the public perceives the Democrats as \u201cnot extreme,\u201d in spite of the fact that they recognize the radical nature of many of the policies the Democrats are pushing.\n\nClearly, the Republican Party has the winning hand on the policy issues. The president with the media\u2019s help is managing to trump the Republicans with his rhetoric and style. By losing the image war, the GOP is, by default, allowing the president\u2019s fundamental transformation of our nation to continue apace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People are buying into the rhetoric of the Democrats, while at the same time they agree with critical public policies advocated by the Republicans.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "People are buying into the rhetoric of the Democrats, while at the same time they agree with critical public policies advocated by the Republicans.", "title": "JANICE SHAW CROUSE: Perceptions vs. facts: Who cares about the middle class?", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/27/janice-shaw-crouse-perceptions-vs-facts-who-cares-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/us-state-of-unionjpeg-01aeb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/us-state-of-unionjpeg-01aeb.jpg", "description": "People are buying into the rhetoric of the Democrats, while at the same time they agree with critical public policies advocated by the Republicans.", "card": "summary", "title": "JANICE SHAW CROUSE: Perceptions vs. facts: Who cares about the middle"}, "Author": "Janice Shaw Crouse", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Republican Party, Thomas B Edsall"}, "article_summary": "There is a huge gap between public perceptions and the reality of life in the middle class during the Obama presidency.\n\u201cThis is how daily life feels, to many in the white working class.\nThe \u201cmarriage gap\u201d is the highest it has ever been; the difference in marriage rates between the working class and middle-and-upper middle class has produced unprecedented numbers of single mothers and children in poverty.\n\u201cMajorities say the Democratic Party is open and tolerant, cares about the middle class and is not \u2018too extreme.\u2019 By contrast, most Americans see the GOP lacking in tolerance and empathy for the middle class, and half view it as too extreme.\u201dThe perception that the GOP cares less about the middle class than the Democrats is especially troubling for the Republican Party because demographic and economic data is clear that Democrat policies have been disastrous for the middle class.\nBy losing the image war, the GOP is, by default, allowing the president\u2019s fundamental transformation of our nation to continue apace."}
