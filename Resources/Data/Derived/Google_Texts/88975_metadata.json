Seventy-nine percent of Boomers are proud to call themselves so, for instance. And on the other end of the age spectrum, Millennials are disdainful of their generational name and all that\u2019s associated with it. They were the age group least likely to describe their group as having qualities like being \u201cpatriotic\u201d, \u201cresponsible\u201d, \u201cwilling to sacrifice\u201d, \u201creligious\u201d, \u201cmoral\u201d, \u201cself-reliant\u201d, and \u201cpolitically active\u201d. Only about one third of the Millenials surveyed consider themselves compassionate and hardworking.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, some of these differences may be related more to age and life stage than to the unique characteristics of today\u2019s generations,\u201d the report reads.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why some Millennials might want to distance themselves from an identity that has often been equated with being self-absorbed, whiny and spoiled. \u201cMillennials are significantly more critical of their generation than older age cohorts are of theirs,\u201d the report notes.\n\nMillennials, however, are environmentally and socially conscious: they\u2019re more likely than older people to say that there\u2019s \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of climate change. They also want to push for alternative energy and are generally more accepting of homosexuality, interracial marriage and immigration.\n\nOf course, there are variations within each generation. For instance, some older Millennials (27-34) identify more with Gen Xers: they remember a life before the Internet, find themselves socially different from younger Millennials, and don\u2019t identify with many pop culture icons and events that define the life experiences of the college set.\n\nIt still is worth noticing, however, that regardless of where someone falls on generational self-identification, one thing is apparent: Millennials, of all ages, generally don\u2019t care for the term.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "They're also quite negative in their self-image, a Pew Research Center study reports.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "They're more likely than older people to consider themselves self-absorbed", "title": "Millennials Don't Like to Call Themselves Millennials", "url": "http://time.com/4021479/millennial-generation-pew/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/millennial-identification-pew.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/millennial-identification-pew.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Millennials Don't Like to Call Themselves Millennials", "description": "They're more likely than older people to consider themselves self-absorbed", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "baby boomers, careers & workplace, culture, generation, milennials, people", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "millennials, gen x, generation x, boomer, baby boomers, generation, pew"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMillennials are significantly more critical of their generation than older age cohorts are of theirs,\u201d the report notes.\nAnd on the other end of the age spectrum, Millennials are disdainful of their generational name and all that\u2019s associated with it.\nMillennials, however, are environmentally and socially conscious: they\u2019re more likely than older people to say that there\u2019s \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of climate change.\nIt still is worth noticing, however, that regardless of where someone falls on generational self-identification, one thing is apparent: Millennials, of all ages, generally don\u2019t care for the term.\nFor instance, some older Millennials (27-34) identify more with Gen Xers: they remember a life before the Internet, find themselves socially different from younger Millennials, and don\u2019t identify with many pop culture icons and events that define the life experiences of the college set."}
