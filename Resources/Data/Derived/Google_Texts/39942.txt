There are a lot of ways MSNBC has managed to make the art of chyron fails truly its own.

Maybe it’s referring to an address by President Obama as “The King’s Speech,” or breathlessly letting viewers know that Michelle Obama once wore a dress designed by Oscar de la Renta.

Or maybe it’s superimposing “Kimye Engaged” over someone falling off a train platform or “The LeBron Effect” over a scene of massive destruction.

It could be blaming the GOP for the flubbed rollout of Obamacare or implying French president Nicolas Sarkozy is a prostitute.

Who could forget when Ronan Farrow Daily nearly blew up the Internet with some of the worst viewer question wording in television history?

Here are 21 times it didn’t go well over in the lower-third of MSNBC.
