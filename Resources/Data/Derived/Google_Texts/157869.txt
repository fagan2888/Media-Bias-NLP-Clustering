North Korea recently opened a new water park to boost its global image, the New York Post reported. In typical fashion, it was ushered in with a full military procession in grand style.

The park’s attractions include pools, water slides and — let’s not forget — statues of Kim Jong-il. Such lavish displays of financial waste are normal for a country where poor people live with no electricity.

According to the Post:

“The water park is the edifice built thanks to Korean Peoples’ Army service personnel’s spirit of devotedly carrying out any project and their fighting traits as they are ready to flatten even a high mountain at a go in hearty response to the order of the supreme commander,” said North Korean Premier Pak Pong Ju at the park’s opening ceremony.”

Stories like this used to make Americans chuckle. But with Obamacare and other colossal wastes, who really knows what our own future might look like?
