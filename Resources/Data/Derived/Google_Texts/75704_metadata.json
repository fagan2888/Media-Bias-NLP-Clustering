Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, has for years promoted the Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation that would expand the Equal Pay Act to close certain loopholes and allow employees to share salary information with their coworkers. It would also require employers to prove pay differences between their male and female employees are related to job performance, not gender. GOP opposition has stalled the bill.\n\n\u201cA key part of ending what President Kennedy called the \u2018serious and endemic\u2019 problem of unequal wages is having the knowledge that you are being paid less in the first place,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cThis is not just about women; it is about ensuring families, who are more reliant on women\u2019s wages than ever, are not being shortchanged. Collecting data is a necessary step if we are to identify and end patterns of pay disparity. I am pleased the Labor Department is finally dealing with this scourge head-on. Now Congress needs to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\u201d\n\nThe National Partnership for Women and Families says Connecticut women who work full time earn an average of 78 cents for every dollar a man in the state earns. Nationally, women make an average of about 77 cents for every dollar a man earns in pay, the NPWF said. Minority women earn even less.\n\nThe group also said a female worker in Connecticut earns an average annual salary of $47,900 while a male earns $61,097.\n\nThe executive order that focuses on equal pay is the latest step Obama has taken in a campaign to use his executive order to make an end-run on Congress, where a GOP-controlled House has blocked many initiatives. Those include an immigration bill that would have helped the White House deal with an influx of unaccompanied child migrants. Obama has indicated he\u2019d use his executive authority to change immigration policy \u2013 and other things \u2013 and will probably act while Congress is out of town on its August recess.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president said he will \u201cscour over\u201d U.S. laws and regulations to see what authority he has to continue issuing executive orders.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama signed the \u201cFair Pay and Safe Workplaces\u201d executive order , which imposes additional disclosure and compliance obligations on federal government contractors with procurement contracts valued at more than $500,000. Among other things, the order requires contractors to disclose labor law violations, restricts the use of arbitration agreements, and requires certain information to be provided on employees\u2019 paystubs.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do business with the United States of America, you got to respect our workers, you got to respect our taxpayers,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe goal here is to make sure this action raises standards across the economy.\u201d\n\nWorkers rights advocates and unions heralded the order, which applies to roughly 24,000 businesses with federal contracts, including Connecticut\u2019s large defense contractors. But some contractors a pushing back, saying the new regulations are too cumbersome.\n\nObama is using his executive power more frequently in defiance of a GOP move to sue him for exceeding his authority when he postponed a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires companies to cover their workers.\n\nThe lawsuit was expected to fail in court but energize the GOP base in this election year. Yet polls show it\u2019s not popular.\n\nIn a CBS poll, released Wednesday, 54 percent of Americans said they disapproved of the suit, while 37 percent said they approved of it. A similar poll conducted by CNN last month found that those surveyed disapprove of the GOP effort by a 57 percent to 41 percent margin.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/07/obama-to-require-ct-federal-contractors-to-disclose-gender-pay-gaps/", "news_keywords": "Budget/Economy, Politics, Washington, Affordable Care Act, Equal Pay Act, Equal Pay Report, executive order, government contracts, immigration, Obama", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/07/obama-to-require-ct-federal-contractors-to-disclose-gender-pay-gaps/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Continuing to use his executive authority to bypass a recalcitrant Congress, President Obama on Thursday proposed a new rule that would require federal contractors and subcontractors to disclose more information about pay to male and female employees.", "title": "Obama to require CT federal contractors to disclose gender pay gaps", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/07/obama-to-require-ct-federal-contractors-to-disclose-gender-pay-gaps/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/08/US-WhiteHouse-Logo.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@radelat"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/07/obama-to-require-ct-federal-contractors-to-disclose-gender-pay-gaps/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It would also require employers to prove pay differences between their male and female employees are related to job performance, not gender.\nWashington \u2013 Continuing to use his executive authority to bypass a recalcitrant Congress, President Obama on Thursday proposed a new rule that would require federal contractors and subcontractors to disclose more information about pay to male and female employees.\nEarlier this month, Obama signed the \u201cFair Pay and Safe Workplaces\u201d executive order , which imposes additional disclosure and compliance obligations on federal government contractors with procurement contracts valued at more than $500,000.\nThe executive order that focuses on equal pay is the latest step Obama has taken in a campaign to use his executive order to make an end-run on Congress, where a GOP-controlled House has blocked many initiatives.\nNationally, women make an average of about 77 cents for every dollar a man earns in pay, the NPWF said."}
