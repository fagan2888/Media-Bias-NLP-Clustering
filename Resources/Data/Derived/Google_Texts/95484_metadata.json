Miller and Meredith Schwartz on\n\nSusan H. Hildreth was appointed director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) by President Barack Obama on January 19, 2011. Her nomination had been confirmed by the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent on December 22, 2010. Prior to joining IMLS, Hildreth served as Seattle city librarian, California state librarian, and San Francisco city librarian, as well as president of the Public Library Association in 2006. Under her leadership, IMLS made $857,241,000 in total grants to libraries and museums. As Hildreth\u2019s four-year term draws to a close, she shares with LJ some of what she learned at the head of the institute and what she hopes the library community will build on in the future.\n\nLJ: Since you became IMLS director, what have been your biggest accomplishments\n\nwith regard to libraries?\n\nSH: Early in my tenure here, we needed to develop a strategic plan, and we did, in 2012. That plan has guided our work and investments over the last four years.\n\nWe developed some key messages about the relevance and capacity of libraries and museums, focusing on learning: libraries as real community hubs and also the myriad challenges and opportunities to providing access to content.\n\nI\u2019ve also had other people in the field mention to me that they\u2019ve used some of our work and our language around those themes to help them express the priorities of libraries in their communities.\n\nI\u2019m very proud of our continuing investments in early learning. We\u2019ve developed a great partnership with the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading, which led to the publication of \u201cGrowing Young Minds: [How Museums and Libraries Create Lifelong Learners]\u201d in June 2013. That document \u00adreally highlights the contributions and potential in libraries and museums as early learning partners in communities. We know that a lot of our libraries have used it to help start a discussion with their policymakers. It and our investments in early learning have helped us provide the foundation for our current work with an organization called the BUILD Initiative.\n\nMost states have at least some kind of standard benchmarks that they have to achieve for early learners, and we\u2019re trying to align what we\u2019re doing in libraries and museums with what\u2019s required, because we do so much already. It\u2019s not that far off to help some of our folks in the early learning field make an impact\u2026. And that work, of course, is ongoing.\n\nWhen I came to IMLS, we had just announced our great partnership with [the John D. and Catherine T.] MacArthur Foundation to support the learning labs, digital media centers, modeled on the New Media Center at the Chicago Public Library. I\u2019ve been proud to be able to create 24 of these digital media labs in libraries and museums across the country. We\u2019ve been working with MacArthur to support its priority of connected learning, and we\u2019ve been able to help spread the word about their interest and their priority in badging\u2014creating online systems for validation of informal learning. We\u2019ve been trying to show that libraries and museums have a key role that they can play in [online education], and we provide a lot of informal and out of school education already.\n\nThe other thing I wanted to mention that has been helpful is that working with federal agency partners we\u2019ve modeled collaboration that could be done at the state or local level. [There are] two key collaborations that we\u2019re very proud of. This one predates my tenure here\u2014working with the Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration on workforce development. We were so excited with the workforce bill that passed, where libraries were identified and known to be key partners in workforce development.\n\nAlso, it was very impactful when we were able to develop the partnership with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services\u2014the Health and Human Services Department manages the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. That was not an investment without some interest from many parties. Some libraries had begun to prepare for the impact of the Affordable Care Act rollout, and we were able to help libraries identify their key role in helping their communities navigate that information and get the best information out there\u2026.\n\nWe have a number of other federal partnerships as well. The library world is very complex, and our federal partners really need help navigating what\u2019s ALA, what\u2019s ACRL, what\u2019s PLA, what\u2019s ULC. We\u2019ve been able to facilitate at least at the federal level a better understanding of the library universe.\n\nWhat were major challenges during your tenure?\n\nThe IMLS directorship is a fixed four-year term, and that is not coincident with the president\u2019s incoming term. I was appointed by President Obama in the middle of his second term. It was challenging coming into an administration where I wasn\u2019t really part of the incoming transition team, determining the key partners to work with, making sure that libraries and museums were part of the agenda of the administration and Congress.\n\nIMLS is a great agency but not the most highly visible one, and in many situations, that\u2019s good. But I also think coming in after the administration had kicked off some of its major policy initiatives, I had to determine how we could most effectively integrate what libraries and museums were doing to support those initiatives. We did a very good job doing that.\n\nAnother challenge, there are still some fairly traditional views of libraries and museums, and we know that we are constantly trying to counteract those. Early on in my time here, we began to work with some of the staff at the Office of Science and Technology Policy\u2014advisors to the president on science and technology policy about Maker spaces and STEM [science, technology, engineering, math]. We\u2019re creating a library and museum Maker community. We\u2019ve made a number of STEM investments, and in terms of the president\u2019s Maker initiative, IMLS is counted on as a very critical member of their inner agency working team to spread the word about STEM learning and Maker spaces to libraries and museums around the country.\n\nI\u2019ve been able to succeed at helping policymakers and other federal partners understand that we have this tremendous built asset of networks of libraries throughout the country that are poised to make a difference in their communities, and they\u2019re doing it already. Often what will happen in discussion is that when you bring up libraries as a potential partner, no matter what the issue is, there\u2019s usually not a reaction that, \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t work with libraries.\u201d It\u2019s more like, \u201cOh, libraries. Why didn\u2019t I think of libraries?\u201d [We\u2019re trying] to move us from entities that are under the radar and not thought of as partners to a place where we\u2019re go-to community assets that can make a difference, frankly, no matter the content of the issue.\n\nFrom your vantage point at IMLS, what trends in U.S. library service have you witnessed?\n\nIMLS made an initial grant to [the American Library Association] to begin [its] work with civic engagement with its partner, the Harwood Institute. That now has been followed by a fairly significant investment by the [Bill & Melinda] Gates Foundation. The Harwood Institute approach is just one way for libraries beginning to look outward [to] understand that they must use their deep knowledge of their community to be proactive and also to respond to community needs.\n\nWhile this has been going on for a number of years, libraries are becoming very adept and responsive to the needs of their communities and in many cases proactive\u2014understanding that it\u2019s not about what we in the library world might think is the right way to do things or what we might think our community needs. It\u2019s about listening to our community and determining the priorities that our towns and cities or rural areas have and then determining how we can best meet those needs.\n\nOver the four years that I\u2019ve been here, I think that ALA and other stakeholder groups have made some good progress in terms of the e-content delivery situation. It was so tense for a while, and now we\u2019re beginning to get the word across that we\u2019re not in competition with print; we\u2019re only going to augment the print and the ebook market. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in moving ahead in terms of providing information in all kinds of formats.\n\nIn our physical buildings, libraries have been very flexible in terms of how they use their spaces and responsive to the needs of their communities, as well as the changing nature of their collections. When I look at some of the libraries that are adopting Maker spaces and our libraries and museums that have benefited from our learning lab program, it\u2019s fascinating to see how they\u2019re using the space they have, repurposing in some cases to provide much more engaging active learning environments.\n\nBuilding on those trends, how would you see them continuing or changing in the future?\n\nLibraries provide great facilitation among their community members. And libraries are [basically] platforms for community conversations and community connections. Sometimes libraries have to some extent shied away from getting involved in intense community engagement [in terms of civic engagement] because when you do that, you can get involved in a political situation.\n\nThe library can provide a neutral open place where issues can be discussed face-to-face, where you bring different people together, and the library also has resources to help inform those discussions. If you\u2019re going to do that effectively, the library staff have to be willing to understand what it means to be community dialog facilitators. It\u2019s happening now, and it will continue to happen, because that particular role we play as trusted living rooms of the community will continue far into the 21st century.\n\nHow did your experience before you came to IMLS inform your approach\n\nwhile you were there?\n\nI had a wide variety of experience in a number of different settings. I\u2019ve worked in rural, suburban, and urban libraries. So I think my experience in the field prepared me well and helped me to know the field and understand how we might want to move forward. In serving as the state librarian of California, I had been one of the largest, if not the largest, grantee of [IMLS]. When you\u2019re a grantee of the agency, you certainly have your own relationships, and you have a view of how things work. It\u2019s always interesting then when you come on the other side and see how things work and how you can make a difference.\n\nI\u2019m able to state ideas, state policies, take issues, and communicate about them with the general public or with policymakers, so that they can understand what we\u2019re trying to say. Sometimes we speak in our own language here, and we don\u2019t make as much headway with folks who are not of our world as we might like to. I\u2019ve had a lot of great experiences, but the time I spent in the San Francisco Public Library prepared me for public speaking of any and all kinds. I had some good innate skills, but that experience helped me fine-tune those communications skills.\n\nHow has your time at IMLS changed your perspective on the profession going forward?\n\nIn answering that, I want to refer to a series of convenings that we had earlier this year to take a look at our national leadership grant investments for libraries. We had some [truly] exciting conversations, but there were two things that we heard loud and clear in order to help shape some of our investments.\n\nOne was on the part of many different interested stakeholders, investors, and parties: that we\u2019ve invested a lot in creating the digital world and it\u2019s now time to try to identify more of a national platform and try to invest in that. IMLS has over the years made many great investments in lots of digitization efforts, but it\u2019s now the time to identify the ones that are most effective and can be readily scalable so that we can begin to have much more regional and national connectivity.\n\nThe second thing is that our library staff are such dedicated individuals. They have a clear understanding that their role is shifting from information provider to the role of mentor, coach, learning navigator\u2014particularly when you think about how much learning is online [and as] people become more and more interested in their own lifelong learning or self-motivated learning.\n\nIt was interesting that even though our convenings were focused on the national leadership grants, in terms of our program, we also heard a strong message about priorities for the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program. We certainly want to continue to support the development of master\u2019s degrees and graduate curriculum, but we also want to make sure that we\u2019re supporting a workforce that is providing the kind of learning experiences that our communities expect and value.\n\nOn the museum side, what have you learned that you would want libraries to embrace?\n\nWe\u2019re all learning institutions. I think we\u2019re very, very similar, and the differences are not really very different at all.\n\nI have seen that sometimes museums have more flexibility in terms of making something happen because they\u2019re often nonprofit entities, and they don\u2019t necessarily have a city council or something to go through. So museums are very good at taking prudent risk. They\u2019re willing to try something and see how it works and make changes if it doesn\u2019t work quite well. But in some cases, they\u2019re a little more daring than our library colleagues. There may be many reasons, but I think it could be an environmental reason in terms of [how] they\u2019re governed.\n\nLibraries and museums more and more are joining forces because we\u2019re part of a greater learning ecosystem. For instance, this work that we\u2019re doing with BUILD Initiative, we have libraries and museums talking to their state early learning networks and finding out things about each other that they didn\u2019t even realize.\n\nLibraries and museums are very strong assets to make a difference in people\u2019s lives. We\u2019re very strong together, and our assets really complement each other. Funders are looking for that. So, it\u2019s an opportunity to frame our role that way.\n\nWe do a lot of work with other federal agencies, non\u00adprofits, foundations, and they care about making sure that all the assets of the community are working together. That\u2019s including schools, libraries, museums, nonprofits, and after-school programs. Building those kinds of networks is really important, and many foundations don\u2019t want to invest unless they know that kind of collaboration is going on. The libraries and the museums can do that well together, either of them, depending on their communities, can play that role as the community connector, and that\u2019s something that they\u2019re learning from each other.\n\nThe phrase is collective impact. Collective impact a real focus\u2014I found at least in Washington and nationally and internationally\u2014of investors, funders. They want to know that if they\u2019re investing in whatever particular interest area they may have, that the communities or the ecosystems that they\u2019re working with are all working together to support this.\n\nIn terms of collective impact, in the field of education, libraries and museums have a huge role to play, and they have to be frankly quite aggressive in getting themselves out there and making it known to their community that they can play these roles. I\u2019ve been in a number of sessions here in Washington where we have school folks and we have community college folks and after-school programs, and libraries and museums can be a key part and are already doing a lot of work in those areas. It\u2019s important that libraries and museums understand that they can be the glue, if you will, that keeps a community together, and they can highlight this collective impact. They can come together to make a strong ecosystem in their \u00adcommunity.\n\nWhat, if anything, would you like to have accomplished that you weren\u2019t able\n\nto squeeze in during your time with IMLS?\n\nThis is a great organization representing libraries and museums, and that\u2019s the fabric of our community. I\u2019m very pleased with what we\u2019ve done. We have a number of dedicated staff here. We have great support from stakeholder groups like ALA and [the Urban Libraries Council] and [the Association of Research Libraries] and the litany of the alphabet soup and the library and museum world. I think we have been very successful in working positively with our stakeholders.\n\nWhat else do you hope IMLS will focus on in the future?\n\nWe have been an organization that is well known\u2014and should be well known\u2014for its peer-review process, which is excellent, and we have generally put out a call for good ideas and accepted all the applications we got over the transom, figured out what was best, and funded them. That is a very good job, but I think we have to move forward and try to be a little bit more directional or at least identify some key priorities in terms of our grant-making. Of course our largest program is the grants to states. That\u2019s [a] great investment. We have some general guidelines that all those activities have to follow.\n\nIn terms of our competitive funds, the national leadership grants, Laura Bush 21st Century, we have to be very focused on outcomes and results to be able to show to the administration and Congress that the investments they\u2019re making in these programs are valuable.\n\nAnd although we have funded many great activities in the past, during my tenure, and I hope it will continue, we\u2019ll be a bit more focused on various priorities so that we have investments that can show the outcome. In the long run, that will help insure the productivity, the existence of IMLS, and also make sure that all of our policymakers and funders understand that what we\u2019re doing makes a difference.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Library Journal", "description": "Susan H.
