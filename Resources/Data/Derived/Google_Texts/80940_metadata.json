The final results of the shutdown blame game won't be in until the government is un-shut. Yet at the same time that the party is allowing itself to be branded as an ideologically rigid outfit controlled by political hostage takers, it has been endangering its future by waging a high-profile but Alamo-like stand against Obamacare, just as a main component of the health care program is kicking in\u2014and appears to be popular.\n\nIf anything has defined the GOP in its must-destroy-Obama phase, it's the party's virulent opposition to the Affordable Care Act. And with Obama reelected, the economy slowly improving, and deficits slowly decreasing, Republicans have bet almost all the chips they have left on the decimation of Obamacare. With Sen. Ted Cruz wagging the party, the GOPers pushing for the government shutdown\u2014aided and abetted by Rush Limbaugh, the Heritage Foundation, and other influentials of the far right\u2014have focused exclusively on Obamacare. This confrontation over government spending has nothing to do with, well, government spending. The shutdown was merely a way for Cruz-controlled Republicans to vent about Obamacare. So if the Republican party stands for anything today, it is obstructing Obamacare. But here's the rub: What if Obamacare works?\n\nThe initial response to yesterday's opening of the state and federal exchanges that are providing affordable insurance plans to Americans who previously could not obtain coverage has Obamacare proponents dancing.

And the exchanges have weeks to work out the kinks before the December 15 deadline to finish enrolling people for the coming year.\n\nSo while the Republicans have succeeded in forcing a shutdown of the government\u2014according to the latest polls, not a popular endeavor\u2014their crusade against Obamacare has harmed their long-term prospects in several ways:", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "With a main component of the health care law kicking in and proving popular, the Republicans' fundamental narrative\u2014that government is the problem\u2014could take a major hit.", "title": "The GOP's Obamacare Suicide", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/obamacare-gop-shutdown", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/cruz3_618.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/obamacare-gop-shutdown", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/cruz3_618.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/cruz3_618.jpg"}, "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The GOP's Obamacare Suicide"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Congress,Economy,Health+Care,Obama,Top+Stories", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb05c\"", "article_summary": "Is the Republican Party committing suicide this week?\nSo if the Republican party stands for anything today, it is obstructing Obamacare.\nAnd with Obama reelected, the economy slowly improving, and deficits slowly decreasing, Republicans have bet almost all the chips they have left on the decimation of Obamacare.\nThe shutdown was merely a way for Cruz-controlled Republicans to vent about Obamacare.\nIf anything has defined the GOP in its must-destroy-Obama phase, it's the party's virulent opposition to the Affordable Care Act."}
