One year on since the death of world champion waterskier Sarah Teelow in the Bridge to Bridge race on the Hawkesbury River her parents will compete on Sunday at this year's event.

There has still been no coroner's report into the death of the 20-year-old from Sydney, who crashed five kilometres into the 112-kilometre race in which boats can reach 200 kilometres an hour.

The governing body said that it has carried out its own investigation and found no need to change safety around the sport.

Ski Racing Australia CEO Kristie Middleton said: "As a result of last year's accident we have had a full internal investigation and found no requirement to make any changes to the robust safety procedures that are in place.

"This is a high speed motor sport and it has an above reasonable safety record."

Of the decision of parents Chris and Tanya Teelow to compete, she added: "It will be a tough day for them."

Gavin Robertson, former Australian cricketer, who now competes in the sport, said waterskiing was one of the last great bastions of family sport.

"I saw Chris at the briefing and my perception was that his spirits were in a good way. It's something they have done their whole life and it's a way of life."

Four of Sarah's friends will make a charity ski run on Sunday.
