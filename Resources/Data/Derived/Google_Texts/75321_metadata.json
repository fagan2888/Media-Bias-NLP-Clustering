Some carriers said they paid out more in claims than they collected in premiums last year, so they lost money on policies sold in the new public marketplaces. After finding that new customers were sicker than expected, some health plans have sought increases of 10 percent to 40 percent or more.\n\nAdministration officials have political and financial reasons for wanting to hold down premiums. Big rate increases could undermine public support for the health care law, provide ammunition to Republican critics of the measure and increase costs for some consumers and the federal government.\n\nKevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, is urging states to consider a range of factors before making their decisions.\n\n\u201cRecent claims data show healthier consumers,\u201d Mr. Counihan said in a letter to state insurance commissioners. The federal tax penalty for going without insurance will increase in 2016, he said, and this \u201cshould motivate a new segment of uninsured who may not have a high need for health care to enroll for coverage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, federal officials said, much of the pent-up demand for health care has been met because consumers who enrolled last year have received treatments they could not obtain when they were uninsured.\n\nFederal officials have also told state regulators that medical inflation will be less than what many insurers assumed in calculating their rates for 2016.\n\nBut Scott Keefer, a vice president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, which requested rate increases averaging about 50 percent for 2016, said his company had not seen an improvement in the health status of new customers.\n\n\u201cOur claims experience has not slowed at all,\u201d Mr. Keefer said. \u201cThe trend has gotten a little worse than we expected.\u201d\n\nLike other insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota reported a surge in prescription drug expenses. Two high-cost specialty drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, Enbrel and Humira, account for one-fourth of prescription drug costs in the company\u2019s individual health plans, Mr. Keefer said. Other insurers reported high costs for hepatitis C medications.\n\nState officials said their agencies had been reviewing insurance rates for decades and generally knew local market conditions better than federal officials.\n\nMonica J. Lindeen, a Democrat who is the Montana insurance commissioner and the president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said the letter from Mr. Counihan was interesting, but \u201cdid not point to any new information that would impact how state insurance departments regulate their health insurance markets.\u201d\n\nState officials said they had to worry about the solvency of some insurers as well as the affordability of insurance for consumers. In February, the Iowa insurance commissioner moved to shut down a nonprofit co-op insurer, and a state court found the company insolvent because of \u201cadverse claims experience.\u201d Another carrier, the Louisiana Health Cooperative, said it would voluntarily halt operations at the end of this year because it was \u201cnot growing enough.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut administration officials said their arguments had already prevailed in several states, and President Obama, on a recent trip to Tennessee, said the final rates for 2016 would \u201ccome in significantly lower than what\u2019s being requested.\u201d\n\nMoreover, consumers can avoid large rate increases by switching to lower-cost health plans next year, administration officials said. In any event, they said, the federal government pays most of the premium for most people who buy insurance on the exchanges, so consumers will be largely shielded from higher premiums.\n\nCalifornia, one of the few states that actively negotiate prices, said health insurance rates would rise next year by an average of just 4 percent.\n\nIn New York, on average, insurers requested a 10.4 percent rate increase in the individual market, and state officials said they had reduced the average increase to 7.1 percent. \u201cWe closely analyzed each insurer\u2019s request and cut rates that were excessive or unreasonable,\u201d said Anthony J. Albanese, the acting superintendent of financial services in New York.\n\nBut the New York Health Plan Association, a trade group for insurers, criticized the state\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThe approved rates do not, in many cases, accurately reflect the financial status of plans as indicated in their rate submissions,\u201d said Paul F. Macielak, president of the New York association. \u201cHealth plans have suffered financial losses the last two years when the state significantly reduced premium requests. Plans cannot be expected to continue losing money year after year and remain viable.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act established a rate review process that requires insurers to disclose and justify large proposed increases. State officials have the primary responsibility for reviewing rates, except in five states that the Obama administration says do not have \u201ceffective rate review programs.\u201d\n\nIn those states \u2014 Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming \u2014 federal officials review rates. Several insurers said they had been flooded with questions from officials asking for more data on their claims experience and challenging their forecasts for 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe federal government has urged states to hold public hearings on rate requests, and a consumer group in Missouri is urging the Obama administration to hold a hearing on increases requested by Coventry Health Care, a unit of Aetna. Coventry is seeking increases that average 19 percent in Missouri.\n\nRohan Hutchings, a spokesman for Aetna, said the proposed rates reflected the cost of care. \u201cFor 2016,\u201d he said, \u201cwe expect that medical costs will grow by 8 percent to 10 percent in the individual market.\u201d In addition, he said, the federal government is scaling back a transitional program that helps insurers pay certain very large claims.\n\nJay Angoff, a lawyer for the consumer group, the Consumers Council of Missouri, who is a former director of the state\u2019s Insurance Department, said, \u201cThe federal government does not have authority to disapprove rates, but does have authority to deem them unreasonable,\u201d and should do so. Coventry, he said, ignored the fact that \u201cthe least healthy people signed up first, in 2014, leaving a healthier group of people to sign up in 2016.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150803200337, "twitter": {"description": "After finding that new customers were sicker than expected, some health plans have sought increases of 10 percent to 40 percent or more.", "title": "Obama Administration Urges States to Cut Health Insurers\u2019 Requests for Big Rate Increases", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/us/politics/obama-administration-urges-states-to-cut-health-insurers-requests-for-big-rate-increases.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003835015"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/us/politics/obama-administration-urges-states-to-cut-health-insurers-requests-for-big-rate-increases.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003835015", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/us/politics/obama-administration-urges-states-to-cut-health-insurers-requests-for-big-rate-increases.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Administration Urges States to Cut Health Insurers\u2019 Requests for Big Rate Increases", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 3, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),States (US),Obama  Barack,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "After finding that new customers were sicker than expected, some health plans have sought increases of 10 percent to 40 percent or more.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "After finding that new customers were sicker than expected, some health plans have sought increases of 10 percent to 40 percent or more.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 3, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2015-08-06", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "published": "2015-08-03", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "04health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150806160141, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/us/politics/obama-administration-urges-states-to-cut-health-insurers-requests-for-big-rate-increases.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "After finding that new customers were sicker than expected, some health plans have sought increases of 10 percent to 40 percent or more.", "title": "Obama Administration Urges States to Cut Health Insurers\u2019 Requests for Big Rate Increases"}, "pdate": 20150803, "des": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "articleid": 100000003835015, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Obama Administration Urges States to Cut Health Insurers\u2019 Requests for Big Rate Increases", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hoping to avoid another political uproar over the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration is trying to persuade states to cut back big rate increases requested by many health insurance companies for 2016.\nIn calling for aggressive regulation of rates, federal officials are setting up a potential clash with insurers.\nState officials said their agencies had been reviewing insurance rates for decades and generally knew local market conditions better than federal officials.\nCalifornia, one of the few states that actively negotiate prices, said health insurance rates would rise next year by an average of just 4 percent.\n\u201cRecent claims data show healthier consumers,\u201d Mr. Counihan said in a letter to state insurance commissioners."}
