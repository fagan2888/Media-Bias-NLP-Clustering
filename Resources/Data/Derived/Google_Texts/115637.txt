Billy Idol will be dancing with himself in Las Vegas.

The punk rocker announced Monday a new Sin City residency with 12 dates in March and May. It will be at the House of Blues venue inside the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel.

Tickets for the "Billy Idol: Forever" show go on sale this week and start at about $80, plus fees. The show will feature the rocker's longtime guitarist Steve Stevens.

It also promises songs from throughout the entertainer's catalog, including those with the British punk band fronted by Idol, Generation X, and solo hits such as "White Wedding" and "Dancing With Myself."
