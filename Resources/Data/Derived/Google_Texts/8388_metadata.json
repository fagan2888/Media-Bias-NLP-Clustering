It goes like this:\n\nTed Cruz says something crazy-sounding; His words get accurately reported, complete with video; Ted Cruz gets a justifiable reputation for being a \u201cwild-eyed lunatic\u201d; He says it is the \u201cliberal media\u2019s\u201d fault.\n\nReality is not Ted Cruz\u2019s friend.\n\nNow you would think it would be obvious that the problem is with what Cruz is saying, since the media \u2013 to the extent they bother to actually report it at all \u2013 is only accurately reporting it.\n\nBut the Cuban Anarchist says liberals use \u201cyellow journalism called PolitiFact.\u201d As though PolitiFact were a branch of the DNC and not a creation of the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nCNBC\u2019s John Harwood sat down with Cruz and told him that \u201cYou\u2019ve said a few things that don\u2019t necessarily comport with the facts,\u201d for example, Cruz\u2019s claim that Obamacare would kill jobs, or that there are \u201c125,000 I.R.S. agents, [so] send \u2019em to the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve only got 25,000 agents,\u201d Harwood pointed out.\n\nAnd then it came, the question media figures should be asking EVERY political candidate when they play with the facts:\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t somebody listen to you and say, \u2018The guy\u2019ll just say anything \u2014 doesn\u2019t have to be true?'\u201d\n\nBecause like every Republican candidate in recent years, Ted was only joking:\n\nThere is a game that is played by left-wing editorial writers. It\u2019s this new species of yellow journalism called PolitiFact. Colloquially I was referring to all the employees as agents. That particular stat is in a joke I used. So, they\u2019re literally fact-checking a joke. I say that explicitly tongue in cheek.\n\nIt turns out Harwood was a little off, but Cruz was a lot off. The actual quote was,\n\nThere are 110,000 agents at the IRS. We need to put a padlock on that building and take every one of those 110,000 agents and put them on our southern border.\n\nBut there aren\u2019t 110,000 employees at the IRS. There were 90,000 in 2013, when Cruz made his \u201cjoke.\u201d A discrepancy of 20,000. Which is a lot. An inflation of over 25 percent.\n\nWe have seen Republican presidential hopefuls dodge facts before; even dodge questions. We\u2019ve witnessed the \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d routine. But Cruz has a new twist on an old trick:\n\nHarwood: A third Texas president, L.B.J., created Medicare in the mid-\u201960s. Your hero Ronald Reagan campaigned vigorously against that, saying it would lead to socialized medicine, would end liberty in the United States. Who was right: L.B.J. or Reagan?\n\nCruz: It\u2019s not worth tilting at windmills. I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t alive then.\n\nOh, you weren\u2019t alive then. So if not being alive then precludes you from having an opinion, you can\u2019t have an opinion on what the Founding Fathers may or may not have intended through writing the United States Constitution.\n\nYet you repeatedly claim the United States was founded as a Christian nation for Christians. How can you know? You weren\u2019t alive then.\n\nRick Ungar pointed out at Forbes that by choosing a religious institution to make his presidential announcement, Cruz automatically excluded all non-Christians from his constituency. He is supposed to be president for all Americans, but he has decided that he will be a Christian president for Christians.\n\nWell\u2026people who pretend they are Christians. But you get the idea.\n\nThis is nothing new. As a Houston Chronicle editorial said of Cruz following his announcement, \u201cWe\u2019re not so happy about his disdain for 30 million Texans he was elected to represent just a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\nIn truth, to judge by what he said at Liberty University \u2013 \u201cImagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel\u201d \u2013 he cares more about Israel than about 30 million people in Texas.\n\nHis absence will hardly be noticed. Unlike Kay Bailey Hutchison, his predecessor in the Senate, Cruz isn\u2019t in Washington to get things done for his state. He\u2019s not there to govern. He sees himself as an agitator, a disruptive force who disdains crafting solutions to problems or compromising with his colleagues toward a pragmatic end. He\u2019s made a lot of noise during his time in Washington, but except for partially shutting down the federal government in 2013, it\u2019s hard to point to much of anything Cruz has done.\n\nThis point has been made before, but of course, Cruz\u2019s own delusional view of himself is that he is not a \u201cback-bencher like Obama\u201d but a guy who gets things done. The trouble is, the only person Cruz gets things done for is Cruz.\n\nThirty million Texans learned that lesson. Every person in America who is not a far-right Evangelical will learn it if Cruz becomes president.\n\nUngar points out what we have pointed out many times here:\n\nCall me crazy, but it seems logical to expect that had our nation been intended to be a Christian nation, there would have been some reference to the same in the Constitution\u2014and yet there is none. Indeed, the words, \u201cGod\u201d, \u201cJesus Christ\u201d, \u201cChristianity\u201d, \u201cBible\u201d, and \u201cCreator\u201d are never so much as mentioned in our founding document \u2014not even once. In fact, the only time religion is discussed in the Constitution is in Article 6, Section 3 requiring that \u201cno religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\u201d\n\nUngar says of Cruz\u2019s announcement, \u201cPersonally, I think most of our Founders were turning over in their graves.\u201d\n\nCruz has a fact problem. Every Republican candidate has a fact problem. The facts, simply put, argue against every shred of the ideology they are trying to force down our throats. They can dance around it, as Cruz did with Harwood and as Rand Paul did with Sean Hannity, but the facts are what the facts are.\n\nIt is not the media\u2019s fault, and CNBC is far from being \u201cliberal media\u201d just as PolitiFact is far from being a left-wing website. The problem isn\u2019t CNBC or PolitiFact. The problem is the GOP and their misuse of facts. As Stephen Colbert once quipped, reality has a liberal bias. But that is because liberals are cognizant of that reality, and conservatives are not.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to sound like a lunatic, don\u2019t say crazy things. It\u2019s that easy. But it\u2019s a lesson Republicans can\u2019t learn because their ideology does not permit it. They\u2019ve become lost in the very alternate reality bubble they created to ensorcell Americans.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Ted Cruz is really crazy. We can only judge him by his words and deeds, and according to those, he is that wild-eyed lunatic he claims not to be. And that\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault; it\u2019s his.\n\nWelcome to reality, Ted.\n\nPhoto: Screen capture from CNBC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz, like every other Republican, hates being quoted, and it's never his fault that he said it, but the media's fault for reporting it", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Ted Cruz, like every other Republican, hates being quoted, and it's never his fault that he said it, but the media's fault for reporting it", "title": "Ted Cruz Says Accurately Quoting Him is Yellow Journalism", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/04/11/ted-cruz-accurately-quoting-yellow-journalism.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ted-Cruz-Harwood.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-11T08:32:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Elections,Featured News,2016 election,america,Bible,cnbc,Houston Chronicle,I.R.S.,John Harwood,liberty university,PolitiFact.com,Rand Paul,Republican Party,Rick Ungar,Tampa Bay Times,Ted Cruz,Texas,United States,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2015-04-11T07:47:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-11T08:32:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2016 election, america, Bible, cnbc, Houston Chronicle, I.R.S., John Harwood, liberty university, PolitiFact.com, Rand Paul, Republican Party, Rick Ungar, Tampa Bay Times, Ted Cruz, Texas, United States"}, "article_summary": "It goes like this:Ted Cruz says something crazy-sounding; His words get accurately reported, complete with video; Ted Cruz gets a justifiable reputation for being a \u201cwild-eyed lunatic\u201d; He says it is the \u201cliberal media\u2019s\u201d fault.\nTed Cruz has a fact problem.\nWe don\u2019t know if Ted Cruz is really crazy.\nThe trouble is, the only person Cruz gets things done for is Cruz.\nIf you don\u2019t want to sound like a lunatic, don\u2019t say crazy things."}
