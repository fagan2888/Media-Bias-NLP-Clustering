By interviewing each participant\u2019s parents, the researchers assessed social factors like participation in groups, number of friends, and the amount of time spent with friends. They then used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the thickness of the brain\u2019s outer layer in the frontal lobe.\n\nBy examining the degree of trauma in relation to social capacity, the team found that the injuries could be used to predict the health of a patient\u2019s social life.\n\nRecovering from Head Injury\n\nThe current study follows in a growing line of papers investigating the consequences of pediatric head trauma. Earlier this week, researchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center determined that a single season of high school football may be enough to induce brain alterations. Similarly, a study from the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia recently cautioned that the use of electronic after a concussion may double the recovery time.\n\nWhile the new findings illuminate a difficult symptom, they also hint at a possible therapy target. According to the authors, the physical trauma and social withdrawals are connected through \u201ccognitive proficiency,\u201d which is made up by short term memory and cerebral processing speed.\n\n\"In social interactions we need to process the content of what a person is saying in addition to simultaneously processing nonverbal cues,\"co-author Ashley Levan, a doctoral candidate at Brigham Young, told reporters. \"We then have to hold that information in our working memory to be able to respond appropriately.\u201d\n\n\u201cWant to go into more of the details about why working memory and processing speed are associated with social functioning and how specific brain structures might be related to improve outcome,\" Gale added.\n\nSource: Levan A, Baxter L, Brock KC, et al.
