The guidelines, now being revised, are the basis for federal food and nutrition programs and welfare benefits such as SNAP and educational campaigns, including MyPlate (formerly the food pyramid). The USDA touts them to be \u201cauthoritative advice for people 2 years and older about how good dietary habits can promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases.\u201d\n\nThe fourth meeting of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee started Thursday and will conclude today.\n\nAccording to Politico, recent advisory committee meetings raised eyebrows because \u201chot-button issues, such as diet and climate change,\u201d are being discussed in an unprecedented way. The committee has even dedicated one of five subcommittees to \u201cfood sustainability and safety\u201d to discuss how the food we eat contributes to climate change and how the government should recommend changes to our diets based on those concerns.\n\nSustainable food systems and environmental protection may be important, but these issues don\u2019t belong in discussions of healthy eating.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee from delving deeply into them over the past year. In the January meeting of the committee, member Miriam Nelson gushed about the importance of promoting foods that have the \u201clittlest impact on the environment\u201d and invited testimony from sustainability expert Kate Clancy, who argued it would be \u201cperilous\u201d not to take global climate change into account when dispensing dietary advice.\n\nIn April, a USDA spokesperson seemed to back away from the row by minimizing the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee\u2019s role in policy-making, saying, \u201cThe committee is still in the early stages of its work, so it is premature to guess what their recommendations might be, and even more premature to speculate about what will be included in the final dietary guidelines.\u201d\n\nBut the appointment of Tagtow to the USDA office responsible for not only developing and promoting the dietary guidelines, but advancing prominent programs such as MyPlate, suggests that the USDA is doubling down on raising the profile of our diet\u2019s alleged effect on the climate and other issues that have more to do with political science than nutritional science.\n\nFor instance, Tagtow boasts that the mission of her consulting firm, Environmental Nutrition Solutions, \u201cis to establish healthier food systems that are resilient, sustainable, ecologically sound, socially acceptable and economically viable.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t nutrition. This is code language for politically charged activism. In what amounts to her policy platform statement, Tagtow writes that we should select meat and dairy products from animals that have been fed only grass diets.\n\nShe also repeats the myth that meat is an environmentally reckless form of protein, suggesting a plant-based diet instead. She says we should reduce our consumption of meat, lean or not, not because of any potential health benefits, but in order to \u201cconserve natural resources and energy.\u201d\n\nTagtow has suggested that Iowans could improve the state\u2019s economy by eating only food grown in the state, at least part of the year.\n\nShe touted a Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture study, claiming that \u201d if Iowans ate five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and Iowa farmers supplied that produce for three months of the year, these additional crops would add $300 million and more than 4,000 jobs to the Iowa economy.\u201d\n\nShe fails to mention that in her utopian Iowa, residents wouldn\u2019t likely enjoy the benefits of staples like oranges or pineapples for those months. Nor does she consider the devastation to Iowa\u2019s agricultural community if her agro-protectionist ideals were implemented in other states.\n\nWell, now she\u2019s headed to the federal government to promote her narrow ideology.\n\nThe maxim that in government, \u201cpersonnel is policy,\u201d is especially true here, given Tagtow\u2019s policymaking role. The priorities she\u2019s spent her career advancing are far from the consensus among mainstream nutritionists.\n\nHer appointment is a slap in the face to thousands of men and women in nutrition who daily work tirelessly and impartially to help Americans eat better. And it casts doubt over whether USDA is willing to dispense nutrition advice based on science rather than an activist agenda.\n\nTHE AUTHOR:\n\nJEFF STIER is a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research in Washington, D.C.
