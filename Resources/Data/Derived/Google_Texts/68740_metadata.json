By applying commonsense strategies earlier to certain inevitabilities, we might avoid some of the human and financial costs.\n\nA case in point: the aging of the population. As the latest issue of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2019s Charting Nursing's Future notes, over the next four decades, the number of Americans 65 or older will double to about 84 million \u2014 nearly 20 percent of our entire population \u2014 and 70 percent of them are expected to seek assistance in maintaining their health and well-being.\n\nOne way to prepare for the onslaught, according to the issue brief, is to embrace and expand some of the nurse-led initiatives that already have proven successful in various parts of the country. These include a transitional care model that uses advanced practice registered nurses to coordinate care for high-risk older adults within and across health care settings. There\u2019s also the well-known Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly that helps individuals to remain at home by bringing them to PACE centers two or three days a week, where they can see a primary care provider, receive physical therapy and personal care, refill prescriptions and join in social activities.\n\nIn Arkansas, nine Centers on Aging \u2014 each owned and managed by a local hospital and each employing a geriatrician, an APRN and a social worker \u2014 provide primary care and education about chronic conditions.\n\nThese programs can improve quality of life, delay or avert serious physical or mental conditions, reduce hospitalizations and save money.\n\nTo encourage the adoption of these and other effective approaches across the nation, the RWJF report urges certain policy changes, including allowing nurses to practice to their full practice authority and eliminating obstacles like requiring nurse practitioners to seek physician approval before Medicare will pay for home health services and durable medical equipment.\n\nMost critically, nursing schools must beef up training in geriatric care. Currently, the RWJF brief points out, less than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s RNs are certified gerontological nurses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As 65-plus population explodes, RWJF issue brief describes successful nurse-led programs for an aging population.", "csrf-token": "xJSmtoCHAG7LjQXd+LkU8Kvzdk3iHi/BTVYhf98ebY8=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/s/Santamour_190x127.jpg?1448315746", "description": "As the 65-plus population explodes, an RWJF issue brief describes successful nurse-led programs for an aging population.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nurses Create Models of Care for an Aging America"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/s/Santamour_190x127.jpg?1448315746", "type": "Article", "description": "As the 65-plus population explodes, an RWJF issue brief describes successful nurse-led programs for an aging population.", "title": "Nurses Create Models of Care for an Aging America"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "population health, aging population, geriatrics, geriatrician, advanced practice nurses, APRN, nurses, nursing, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, seniors, elderly", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "These include a transitional care model that uses advanced practice registered nurses to coordinate care for high-risk older adults within and across health care settings.\nIn Arkansas, nine Centers on Aging \u2014 each owned and managed by a local hospital and each employing a geriatrician, an APRN and a social worker \u2014 provide primary care and education about chronic conditions.\nCurrently, the RWJF brief points out, less than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s RNs are certified gerontological nurses.\nSometimes in this country we wait for a problem to become a full-on crisis before we make it a priority.\nBy applying commonsense strategies earlier to certain inevitabilities, we might avoid some of the human and financial costs."}
