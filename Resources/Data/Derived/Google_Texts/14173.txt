A rematch is shaping up between Orlando attorney John Morgan and Tampa Bay developer Mel Sembler over Amendment 2, a ballot initiative to legalize medical marijuana in Florida.

After Sembler on Friday told the Tampa Bay Times that he and his wife, Betty, would raise $10 million or more to defeat the initiative, Morgan, who led a similar drive that narrowly failed in 2014, wasted no time in using the announcement in a fund-raising email.

"I've got a message for Mel Sembler: "BRING. IT. ON," Morgan wrote.

"Make a donation to the campaign now and send Mel Sembler and all those who would seek to stand in the way of compassion a message."

The Semblers, who co-founded the Drug Free America Foundation, played leading roles in defeating the 2014 proposal.

Morgan, meanwhile, largely bankrolled the failed effort to pass the amendment, spending nearly $4 million of his own money and that of his law firm on the plan.
