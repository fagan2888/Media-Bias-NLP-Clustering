(Getty Images)\n\nCosts of health insurance for workers increased in 2015, continuing more than a decade-long trend, according to new data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe 2015 average increase for single and family premiums was 4 percent compared to 2014 numbers, the foundation's data shows. It follows years of steady increases, most notably from 2000 to 2005, when the annual premium that workers and employers pay to keep health insurance increased 69 percent, while worker' earnings only increased 15 percent.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nIn response to the increase, employers have shifted costs to their employees. While the average amount employers paid for their workers' health care premiums increased from 2005 to 2015, the share of the premium paid by workers increased 83 percent. Workers are spending a larger share of their incomes on health care.\n\nCourtesy Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nDeductibles are the out-of-pocket costs consumers pay each year before their health insurance kicks in to pay the rest. At companies of all sizes, plans with deductibles of $1,000 or more increased. Nearly half of covered workers had such a plan by 2015.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Costs Continue to Shift to Employees in Health Insurance Plans", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "New data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows employees are bearing more health costs.", "title": "Costs Continue to Shift to Employees in Health Insurance Plans", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/09/23/costs-continue-to-shift-to-employees-in-health-insurance-plans", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/41/ab/e4402b544d99a980d03beb1890c2/150901-youngpatientdoctor-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "New data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows employees are bearing more health costs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Costs Continue to Shift to Employees in Health Insurance Plans"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 23, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lindsey Cook,DatamineHealthcare,health,health insurance,Pulse,Health Care Index,Data Mine [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "New data from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows employees are bearing more health costs."}, "article_summary": "Courtesy Kaiser Family FoundationDeductibles are the out-of-pocket costs consumers pay each year before their health insurance kicks in to pay the rest.\n(Getty Images)Costs of health insurance for workers increased in 2015, continuing more than a decade-long trend, according to new data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nCourtesy Kaiser Family FoundationIn response to the increase, employers have shifted costs to their employees.\nEmployers are contributing more money, but less of the overall costs to employee health plans.\nWhile the average amount employers paid for their workers' health care premiums increased from 2005 to 2015, the share of the premium paid by workers increased 83 percent."}
