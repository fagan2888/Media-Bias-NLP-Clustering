No, no. We also, quite obviously, felt it was necessary to expand upon Bob's growing love of emoticons, so Claire put together the Great Emoticon Roundup.\n\nFurthermore, we felt it only fair to embrace the comments about what we ourselves were doing, so we took a few comments that have been left either here at NPR or on YouTube and gave those our best effort as well. (Whether your comment was positive or negative, let me say, we are thrilled you watched, and thrilled you talked back, and you should take my funny-face-making solely as the personal tic that it is. I have been an unmitigated ham since infancy.)\n\nAnd now, in order, we present a retrospective several weeks in the making: Bob And Linda Read Internet Reviews Of Oscar-Nominated Movies. We hope that you will join us on Oscar night as we live-tweet at the hashtag #NPROscars. I'm at @nprmonkeysee, and Bob is at @Bob_Mondello, and I encourage you to follow him and imagine that he puts an emoticon at the end of everything.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Well, the Oscars are Sunday night, and that means it&#039;s time to look back", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/nine-best-picture-nominees-many-funny-faces-and-couple-bonus-features", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201403/283972925.png", "type": "article", "description": "Well, the Oscars are Sunday night, and that means it&#039;s time to look back", "title": "Nine Best Picture Nominees, Many Funny Faces, And A Couple Of Bonus Features"}, "story_id": 283970959, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Linda Holmes", "org_id": 1, "dc": {"title": "Nine Best Picture Nominees, Many Funny Faces, And A Couple Of Bonus Features"}, "nid": 17747, "datePublished": "2014-03-01", "wordCount": 418, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ec8\"", "article_summary": "And now, in order, we present a retrospective several weeks in the making: Bob And Linda Read Internet Reviews Of Oscar-Nominated Movies.\nWe also, quite obviously, felt it was necessary to expand upon Bob's growing love of emoticons, so Claire put together the Great Emoticon Roundup.\nWe hope that you will join us on Oscar night as we live-tweet at the hashtag #NPROscars.\nI'm at @nprmonkeysee, and Bob is at @Bob_Mondello, and I encourage you to follow him and imagine that he puts an emoticon at the end of everything.\nBut we wouldn't just leave you with the mega-super-roundup of all nine videos."}
