Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) rarely, if ever, agrees with Schaghticoke Tribal Nation Chief Richard Velky about anything having to do with federal recognition, but that rare moment has arrived.\n\nBlumenthal, Connecticut\u2019s former attorney general, now says that a third party veto provision he helped insert into the Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019 proposed revisions of the federal recognition rules is unconstitutional, the Connecticut Mirror reported. Velky said the same thing a year ago.\n\nThe provision would give third parties that were involved in litigation against tribes veto power over those tribes\u2019 right to re-petition for federal recognition under the revised rules. A tribe would have to go to the same third party that fought its federal recognition at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Interior Board of Indian Appeals and/or in federal court to get consent to re-petition. In Connecticut, which has fought indigenous sovereignty for almost 400 years, the likelihood of that happening is slim to none, Indian leaders say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve argued, and so have other parties, that [the third party veto] raises very severe constitutional questions,\u201d said Blumenthal, who has successfully fought federal recognition of Connecticut\u2019s three state recognized tribes \u2013 the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation (STN), the Eastern Pequot Tribal Nation (EPTN) and the Golden Hill Paugussett Indians (GHP). Beyond Connecticut, Blumenthal has advocated aggressively against tribal sovereignty, federal recognition, and tribal governments\u2019 jurisdiction on tribal land. He intervened in San Manuel v. the National Labor Relations Board in which a split federal appeals court tossed out 75 years of tribal exemption from federal labor laws. He led a coalition of more than a dozen state attorneys general to intervene in the Narragansett Indian Tribe\u2019s efforts to place 31 acres of land into trust for elder housing, which ultimately resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2009 ruling in Carcieri v. Salazar that limits the Interior secretary authority to take land into trust for tribes recognized after 1934. He testified in front of the House Resources Committee against legislation to fix that ruling, recommending instead that \u201cCongress should have sole authority to approve post-1934 tribal trust land requests.\u201d\n\nLast spring when the proposed revised rules were announced, Blumenthal acknowledged that the third party veto was added in response to Connecticut politicians\u2019 requests. \"I am pleased that the administration has been responsive to our concerns about giving groups a second chance of recognition when they failed the criteria the first time,\" he said.\n\nRELATED: Federal Recognition Proposal Praised \u2013 Except for CT\u2019s \u2018Third Party\u2019 Veto\n\nVelky wrote to the Interior Department\u2019s Assistant Secretary \u2013 Indian Affairs Kevin K. Washburn last May soon after the proposed new rules were published. A discussion draft of changes issued in the spring of 2013 was well received in Indian country, but the third party veto that made its way into the proposed regulations is unconstitutional, Velky told Washburn.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the proposed rule's supplemental provision granting third parties the right to object or consent to any tribal effort to re-petition does not, I believe, comport with the due process and equal protection principles of our Constitution,\u201d Velky wrote. \u201cNor does the U.S. Constitution provide that a state and its political subdivisions may exercise an absolute veto over the exercise of constitutional authority vested exclusively in the Federal government.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Washburn's Bold Plan to Fix Interior's Federal Recognition Process\n\nRELATED: Federal Recognition Proposal Praised -- Except for CT's 'Third Party' Veto\n\nRELATED: Velky to Washburn: Third Party Fed Rec Veto Is Unconstitutional\n\nAsked to comment on Blumenthal\u2019s new position regarding the third party veto, Velky said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear he realizes that even though we\u2019re Native people, we are guaranteed our rights and protection under the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nWithout the third party veto, the Connecticut tribes were well placed for review under the proposed revised rules. Although tribes will still be required to meet the seven mandatory criteria for federal recognition in the existing regulations, an important revision would give new weight to tribes that have maintained state-recognized reservations since 1934. Connecticut tribes have some of the oldest reservations in the country. The GHP\u2019s reservation was established in 1639. The tribe was denied recognition in a Final Determination in 2004. Blumenthal was able to overturn positive Final Determinations for the EPTN and the STN in 2005 based in part by arguing that the tribes\u2019 reservations established in 1683 and 1736, respectively \u2013 and recognized by the state ever since \u2013 were irrelevant to their bids for federal acknowledgment.\n\nNow that the senator acknowledges that the third party veto would not likely stand up to a constitutional challenge, he has asked the BIA to ditch its plans to revise the rules altogether. \u201cWe think these rules are illegal and extremely unwise,\u201d Blumenthal said, according to the Connecticut Mirror, without explaining how they are illegal or unwise. He also said he \"repeatedly, emphatically and passionately\" told the BIA there's no need to change the standards for recognition. \"The mystery here is why the BIA has even considered changing them,\" Blumenthal said \u2013 a baffling assertion since Blumenthal himself had called the federal recognition process \u201cbroken\u201d and the BIA \u201clawless, capricious and out of control\u201d for years \u2013 until the agency reversed EPTN and STN\u2019s federal recognitions.\n\nRELATED: Blumenthal blasts BIA's 'new rules'\n\nBlumenthal says he blocked the three state recognized tribes from federal status because they could file land claims and open casinos. New casinos would void the state\u2019s gaming compacts with the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mohegan Tribe. The compacts have netted the state well over $6 billion from Foxwoods Resort Casino and the Mohegan Sun since they opened in the 1990s. But more casinos may be coming anyway.\n\nIn a surprise twist to Connecticut\u2019s gaming story, state legislators recently backed a bill to allow Mohegan and Mashantucket to form a partnership to operate up to three news casinos in the state, strategically located to attract customers who might otherwise go to the increasing number of casinos in the surrounding states.\n\nRELATED: Connecticut Tribes Propose Casino Partnership to Battle Competition, Lawmakers Support\n\nBlumenthal declined to respond to ICTMN\u2019s request for comment on the additional casinos and other direct questions, but sent instead the congressional delegation\u2019s comments on the proposed revised rules that were submitted to the Interior Department last September. The delegation made a number of recommendations, all of which are calculated to usurp the federal government\u2019s authority over the federal recognition process and block Connecticut\u2019s state-recognized tribes from the nation-to-nation relationship with the federal government that acknowledgment brings. For example, the delegation asks the BIA to bar re-petitioning altogether or, if it remains, to allow any third party into the process \u2013 even if they had nothing to do with the original process. Other recommendations would require the state to confirm in writing that a tribe exerted political control over a continuous community on a reservation. If adopted, the recommendations would effectively create a third party veto.\n\nThe final revised rules will likely be released sometime this spring.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
