NORTH FORSYTH — Authorities are searching for a former Forsyth County resident who is believed to be back in the area after escaping a prison work-release detail in middle Georgia.

According to authorities, 20-year-old Eric J. Coe was last seen in Monroe County, near the city of Forsyth, on Wednesday.

The vehicle he is believed to have stolen in neighboring Lamar County was found Thursday night on Settingdown Road in north Forsyth.

Coe is not believed to be dangerous. He was reportedly about halfway through serving a 120-day boot camp program.

His arrest history includes charges of theft by taking and burglary, which he reportedly committed in Forsyth County and for which he was sent to prison in Monroe County.

Thursday night, Forsyth County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a report of a second stolen vehicle on Settingdown Road.

According to the sheriff’s office, the vehicle is described as a black Ford Ranger XLT extended cab with a tag number of PHG3977. The pickup truck has front-end damage to the hood, grill and front bumper and has a dented rear passenger corner panel.

Deputies have increased patrols in the county, and teams are making contact with Coe’s known associates. According to authorities, evidence suggests people around north Georgia may be assisting him.

“Anyone found to be aiding Coe or assisting in harboring this fugitive will be dealt with accordingly and charged to the full extent of the law,” according to the sheriff’s office.

The U.S. Marshals Service is leading the investigation and case.
