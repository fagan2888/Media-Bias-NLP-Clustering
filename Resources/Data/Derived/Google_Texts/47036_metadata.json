They often have had differing ideas of the best way to achieve job creation, but there has been, mostly, a shared understanding that too many Americans were unemployed.\n\nWe\u2019re still in recovery, and the jobless rate \u2013 decidedly improved from a high of 10 percent to the current 6.6 percent \u2013 is still too high. But it\u2019s not too soon to change the goal from creating jobs to creating good jobs.\n\nWhen you\u2019re out of work, almost any income is welcome. Even a fast-food worker\u2019s minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is better than nothing, even if it means the bills continue to pile and the credit card debt mounts. But that\u2019s not a recipe for long-term financial health, either for individual workers or for the economy as a whole. People earning such a low wage don\u2019t contribute much to the economy. They buy food; they pay for utilities and rent. But they can\u2019t buy dishwashers or get their nails done or go to restaurants, or do any of the kind of spending that helps sustain and create other jobs, fueling the economy. Further, such low-paid workers end up being subsidized by taxpayers, since so many minimum-wage workers are eligible for SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid and other such benefits. Actually, the benefits are effectively a subsidy for the multibillion-dollar fast-food industry, which can get away with paying such low wages because their employees are given public help.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the economy.]\n\n\n\nSo what would happen if the minimum wage were raised from $7.25 an hour to $10.10, as has been proposed? Some companies will reduce workers, it\u2019s true. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a half million jobs would be lost by the end of 2016, should the minimum wage be hiked. That\u2019s the downside.\n\nThe upside is that 16.5 million workers would see their wages go up, according to CBO, and 900,000 would be brought out of poverty. That\u2019s not only just a matter of basic human dignity \u2013 why should a full-time worker be living below the poverty level? \u2013 but it\u2019s better for the economy and eases the burden on federal programs for the poor.\n\nThe second prong is helping workers who are skilled, but don\u2019t quite have the skills for the jobs available. One new move in that direction was announced this week by the Department of Labor, which is offering $150 million in grants to train, counsel and place workers in industries now using foreign workers here on the H1-B visa program. The Ready to Work Partnership, financed by a user fee paid by employers that bring international workers here on such visas, is aimed at the long-term unemployed. Most of the jobs will be in information technology, health care and advanced manufacturing, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez told reporters in a conference call.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Congress.]\n\nIt\u2019s potentially a great chance for people who have been out of work six months or longer. Such workers find it particularly hard to find a new job, perhaps because employers are spooked by hiring someone who\u2019s been out of work for so long, and perhaps because the jobs they had been doing don\u2019t exist anymore. They do need jobs, and we all need them back in the workforce, paying taxes and fueling the consumer economy. They key is making the new jobs good jobs. Adding a bunch of $7.25-an-hour employees to the mix isn\u2019t going to work for anyone.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "employment", "title": "Increase Minimum Wage to Create Better Jobs", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Raising the minimum wage is not only good for the economy but also a matter of basic human dignity.", "title": "Create Better Jobs, Not Just More of Them", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2014/02/20/increase-minimum-wage-to-create-better-jobs", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/45/00/e6a792e544d28625035eec7f16f0/140220-fastfoodprotest-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Raising the minimum wage is not only good for the economy but also a matter of basic human dignity.", "card": "summary", "title": "Increase Minimum Wage to Create Better Jobs"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Feb. 20, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,minimum wage,Department of Labor,unemployment,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion],employment", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Raising the minimum wage is not only good for the economy but also a matter of basic human dignity."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd139\"", "article_summary": "Even a fast-food worker\u2019s minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is better than nothing, even if it means the bills continue to pile and the credit card debt mounts.\nSo what would happen if the minimum wage were raised from $7.25 an hour to $10.10, as has been proposed?\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that a half million jobs would be lost by the end of 2016, should the minimum wage be hiked.\nThe upside is that 16.5 million workers would see their wages go up, according to CBO, and 900,000 would be brought out of poverty.\nPeople earning such a low wage don\u2019t contribute much to the economy."}
