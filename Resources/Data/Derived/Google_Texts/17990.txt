The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday night announced a pilot program that will let some stocks trade in five-cent, instead of one-cent, increments.

The pilot program — due to last a year — will focus on small-cap stocks. The concern here — as detailed in a 2012 report to Congress and other studies — is that there is less of an incentive for underwriters to pursue public offerings, produce sell-side research or be a market maker under present rules.

The SEC directed the stock exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to draft up the specifics, which will include four groups of 300 stocks each, one of which will trade at current penny spreads and three others which to varying degrees will implement nickel increments.

Here’s a sampling of reaction to the news.
