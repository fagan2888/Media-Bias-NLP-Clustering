Ben Cardin, he asked to keep the federal plan he had through CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield on a private basis.However, the 12-year Secret Service veteran said that last month he received a letter telling him his current plan did not meet the new federal mandates. He joins the millions of other Americans who stand to lose their insurance because the policies fail to meet minimum requirements set out under Obamacare, but he says he was covered under the same plan that other Secret Service agents continue to use.\"If the plan I had was substandard, then why is the government providing the exact same insurance plan to the Secret Service, the people who put their lives on the line every day to protect them?\" Bongino told the Post.He noted that he took the same plan that was offered to federal workers, but paid the premium out of his own pocket. He charged that the president \"can't be telling the truth about Obamacare,\" and considers his policy cancellation letter \"a betrayal.\"\"Getting that letter was like a punch to the face,\" he said. \"I only put my life on the line every day to protect the president. I will be forced to purchase a new plan for my family, who Obama personally met at the White House, from a Web site that doesn\u2019t work, for a premium approximately $200 a month more expensive, for services we don\u2019t want.\u201dThis is not the first time Bongino has taken issue with the president and his administration. He wrote a book, \"Life Inside the Bubble,\" explaining why he left the Secret Service. In it, he describes the Obama administration as \"toxic\" and intimidating.Bongino, 38, told the Post that just because he worked on the Secret Service presidential protection detail \"doesn't mean I have to stay silent.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "secret,service,agent,loses,insurance,obamacare", "pubdate": "2013-11-18T08:27:29", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A former Secret Service who lost a race for the Senate last year and is now running for a House seat is complaining the government health insurance plan he converted to private coverage on retirement is now being canceled under Obamacare. \r\nDan Bongino, a Republican running...", "title": "Former Secret Service Agent Says Obamacare Killed His Family Health Plan", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/secret-service-agent-loses/2013/11/18/id/537167/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=b769868b-da2c-4b11-ad40-4ab05abfc9f6&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/secret-service-agent-loses/2013/11/18/id/537167/", "title": "Former Secret Service Agent Says Obamacare Killed His Family Health Plan", "description": "A former Secret Service who lost a race for the Senate last year and is now running for a House seat is complaining the government health insurance plan he converted to private coverage on retirement is now being canceled under Obamacare. \r\nDan Bongino, a Republican running...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1384763249, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "secret,service,agent,loses,insurance,obamacare", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2013-11-18T08:27:29"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/secret-service-agent-loses/2013/11/18/id/537167/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A former Secret Service who lost a race for the Senate last year and is now running for a House seat is complaining the government health insurance plan he converted to private coverage on retirement is now being canceled under Obamacare."}, "article_summary": "He wrote a book, \"Life Inside the Bubble,\" explaining why he left the Secret Service.\n\"If the plan I had was substandard, then why is the government providing the exact same insurance plan to the Secret Service, the people who put their lives on the line every day to protect them?\"\nBongino told the Post.He noted that he took the same plan that was offered to federal workers, but paid the premium out of his own pocket.\nHe charged that the president \"can't be telling the truth about Obamacare,\" and considers his policy cancellation letter \"a betrayal.\nIn it, he describes the Obama administration as \"toxic\" and intimidating.Bongino, 38, told the Post that just because he worked on the Secret Service presidential protection detail \"doesn't mean I have to stay silent.\""}
