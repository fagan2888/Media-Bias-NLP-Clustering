It was rhythmic, like the sound of an old dot matrix printer. As I opened the door, I was confronted with the image of my wife holding two plastic funnels over her breasts with a big frown across her face. I immediately thought of Madonna\u2019s cone-shaped bra from the 1980s and let out a gasp.\n\nCourtney: John wasn\u2019t laughing at me, he swore up and down. He was laughing at the ridiculousness of the contraption: a standard mechanical breast pump. New motherhood already felt like a battle to stay standing on ground in perpetual tectonic shifts. Now I realized that I was effectively dependent on a badly designed, embarrassingly loud device for any chance to leave the house. Let\u2019s just say, I didn\u2019t feel like Madonna. I felt like a cow at an industrial farm, awaiting a humanizing visit from Temple Grandin. It turns out, even Wikipedia describes the breast pump as \u201canalogous to a milking machine used in commercial dairy production.\u201d\n\nSince our first encounters with the breast pump, we wondered how women had been duped into settling for such bad design. The pump is a symbol of the modern work-life conundrum. In theory, women have the freedom to honor the wisdom that \u201cbreast is best,\u201d while still pursuing their own careers. And yet, to do so, they\u2019re forced to attach themselves, multiple times a day, to a loud, sometimes painful machine that makes one feel anything but powerful.\n\nNo doubt inspired by the ubiquitous public service announcements about how healthy breastfeeding is for mother and baby, 77 percent of new mothers do it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s 2013 Breastfeeding Report Card. In fact, a crucial provision of the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to cover lactation services, with the pump being the most obvious purchase. The average electric pump costs approximately $250. According to market research firm Global Industry Analysts, the breast pump market will reach 5.63 million units by 2015.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd yet, despite the lucrative market possibilities as well as the health benefits, the modern pump remains largely unchanged since it was first invented. Edward Lasker, an engineer, produced the first mechanical breast pump and secured the patent in the 1920s. In 1956, Einar Egnell created the Egnell SMB breast pump, a more efficient answer to Lasker\u2019s original design. Nearly 60 years later, little has changed about the fundamental design of the mechanical pump. Suffice to say that neither man, despite building their legacies on lactation, had ever breastfed a baby.\n\nOnce we were confronted with the appallingly outdated design of the breast pump, we started asking other parent friends about their experiences. One friend, an executive in Washington, described pumping in an airport bathroom in San Juan, P.R., holding the plastic funnels to her breast as women touched up their makeup and gave her dirty looks. The only electrical outlet was next to the sinks.\n\nAnother friend needed to pump during a conference call; she crossed her fingers that the client on the other line wouldn\u2019t ask about the incessant and curious sound in the background. The noise isn\u2019t the suction, as one might expect, but the motor. Our half-ton hybrid car is quieter.\n\nAnother friend commented on the transparent plastic funnels: What product designer actually thought I would want to see my nipples getting sucked into small tubes over and over again?\n\nWe believe that all mothers deserve a better, more dignifying breast pump. It\u2019s a critical, daily tool for the working mother and a no brainer investment for early childhood health (thus, the federal government subsidizing its use at such a significant level).\n\nAnd beyond the health benefits of a better breast pump, there is a lot of money to be made by the company that attempts to really understand what would make the lives of working mothers easier and more pleasant. One pregnant friend put it in stark relief, \u201cThere were approximately one zillion different kinds of baby carriers to choose from when I was registering, but breast pumps? About three, and none of them looked significantly different from one another.\u201d\n\nWe are reminded of Gloria Steinem\u2019s \u201cIf Men Could Menstruate,\u201d an article published in Ms. Magazine in 1978, in which she used satire to point out how different the world would be if gender roles were reversed: \u201cMen would brag about how long and how much.\u201d If men could breastfeed, surely the breast pump would be as elegant as an iPhone and quiet as a Prius by now.\n\nIt\u2019s high time someone redesigned the breast pump. There\u2019s dignity to be regained and a whole lot of money to be made.\n\nCourtney Martin is the author of multiple books, including \u201cDo It Anyway: The New Generation of Activists.\u201d John Cary is the author of \u201cThe Power of Pro Bono.\u201d They are partners in life and in work.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140316085414, "BN": "parenting", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/parenting", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 16, 2014", "keywords": "Babies and Infants,Breastfeeding,Parenting,Highlights", "GBLC": "Highlights", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/parenting/Shouldn't the Breast Pump Be as Elegant as an iPhone and as Quiet as a Prius by Now?
