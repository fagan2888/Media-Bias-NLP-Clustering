A previous writer, a veteran who has all our thanks, decried Sanders and socialism as some new, evil element of the our daily lives. It has been a part of our nation since its founding in the form of public paid teachers, national defense, expansion, trade.

Later came Social Security and Medicare. Oops, I almost forgot our nationâ€™s highways, cracked and pot-holed they maybe. These programs, along with Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act are all programs that are there for all to help all.

No one is talking about or planning for the government to take over the business and corporations in this country. Although, that place where you work, how many tax abatement's have they received? Who paid for the road and sewer, water improvements for them?

Get a bloody grip, folks! No one is going to tell you to wear purple on Tuesday and orange on Wednesday. Neither are they telling you to be gay. What faith or God you should worship. No one is telling you to have an abortion. It is against the law for your tax dollars to be spent on abortions or supporting any religion or life style over another. This is fact, you will find that under truth. Something that is hard to find in this day and age.
