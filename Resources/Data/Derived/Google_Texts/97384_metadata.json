(New Boston Post photo by Beth Treffeisen)\n\nMILTON \u2013 Some religious liberty advocates are expressing concern about eroded religious freedom in Massachusetts after a state court judge ruled that an all-girls Catholic school in Milton violated state anti-discrimination law when it rescinded a job offer because the applicant had a same-sex spouse.\n\nFontbonne Academy, run by the Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Boston, began the process of hiring Matthew Barrett as food services director in 2013, but quickly withdrew its job offer when Barrett listed his husband as an emergency contact. Barrett sued the school, claiming that it had discriminated against him in violation of Massachusetts law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nFontbonne claimed it was entitled to an exemption, as the law lets religious organizations take \u201cany action with respect to matters of employment. . . calculated by such organization to promote the religious principles for which it is established or maintained.\u201d Because Catholic teaching forbids same-sex marriage, Fontbonne argued that employing a man in such a union would be incompatible with its mission.\n\nBut Norfolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled Dec. 16 that Fontbonne doesn\u2019t qualify as a religious institution because it doesn\u2019t limit enrollment or employment to just Catholics. Fontbonne hires and admits people of all faiths.\n\nWilkins also noted that the exemption wouldn\u2019t apply anyway because the job at issue doesn\u2019t involve presenting church teachings.\n\nCritics faulted the decision. The ruling represents \u201ca radical disregard of traditional understanding of freedom in this country,\u201d C. J. Doyle, the executive director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, said in an interview. Some observers agree.\n\nAt least one Catholic legal scholar, however, said that Wilkins seems to have applied Massachusetts law correctly. Dwight Duncan, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Law School in Dartmouth who has written extensively on religious legal topics, said by email that the decision is \u201cpretty solid, from a strictly legal point of view.\u201d\n\nDuncan cautioned, however, that \u201cthere is no reason why anti-discrimination law should automatically trump the religious freedom of private entities.\u201d A key point is that the state exemption from such rules for religious organizations is relatively narrow, he said.\n\n\u201cExemptions for religious employers from employment-discrimination law are broader under federal civil-rights law,\u201d Duncan explained.\n\nOther legal advocates disagree with Wilkins.\n\nThe judge misapplied the state statute, producing a result \u201cinconsistent with fundamental principles\u201d of law, according to Gregory Baylor, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom in Scottsdale, Arizona, and a religious-liberty consultant for the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities.\n\n\u201cReligious schools should be free to select employees who support their religious missions,\u201d Baylor said by email. \u201cThis ruling is particularly troubling for religious organizations in Massachusetts, as it may serve to undermine their freedom to maintain their religious character through their personnel decisions.\u201d\n\nBen Klein, a lawyer with Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, or GLAD, who represented Barrett, said in an interview that the decision was the first to reject a religious organization\u2019s exemption claim.\n\nHe added that many religious institutions have been trying to expand exemption provisions in a way that \u201cwould alter \u2026 principles of anti-discrimination law.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Associated Press reported that over the past two years, about three dozen Christian colleges and universities nationwide had requested extended exemptions from federal anti-discrimination laws in dealing with both students and employees.\n\nBarrett v Fontbonne Summary Judgment\n\nContact Kara Bettis at [email protected] or on Twitter @karabettis.\n\nCorrection: Corrects comment in next-to-last paragraph as published in an earlier version.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/21/lawyers-fret-over-religious-liberty-implications-of-ruling-against-catholic-school/", "article_author_name": "Kara Bettis", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FontbonneAcademy-2.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "anti-discrimination, boston, Catholic school, employment law, Fontbonne, religious exemption, religious freedom, religious liberty, same-sex marriage"}, "description": "Some religious liberty advocates worry about eroded religious freedom in Massachusetts after a district court judge ruled that an all-girls Catholic school in", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FontbonneAcademy-2.jpg"}, "keywords": "catholic school,boston,religious freedom,anti-discrimination,employment law,fontbonne,religious exemption,religious liberty,same-sex marriage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Lawyers fret over religious liberty erosion after Milton Catholic school rulingPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/21/lawyers-fret-over-religious-liberty-implications-of-ruling-against-catholic-school/Fontbonne Academy in Milton became the focus of a case that pit religious freedom against employment anti-discrimination law.\nFontbonne claimed it was entitled to an exemption, as the law lets religious organizations take \u201cany action with respect to matters of employment.\nBarrett sued the school, claiming that it had discriminated against him in violation of Massachusetts law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\nAt least one Catholic legal scholar, however, said that Wilkins seems to have applied Massachusetts law correctly.\n(New Boston Post photo by Beth Treffeisen)MILTON \u2013 Some religious liberty advocates are expressing concern about eroded religious freedom in Massachusetts after a state court judge ruled that an all-girls Catholic school in Milton violated state anti-discrimination law when it rescinded a job offer because the applicant had a same-sex spouse."}
