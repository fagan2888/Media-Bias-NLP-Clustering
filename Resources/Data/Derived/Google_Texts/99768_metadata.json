But for those people who lose their children and family members, it is all too real. I watched two family members die because they couldn\u2019t get proper HIV/AIDS health care. I remember when ACT UP staged die-ins to call attention to the epidemic.\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nToday, Black Lives Matter activists and young people they have inspired stage die-ins across the nation\u2014in the streets, in government buildings and on college campuses. They are protesting systemic racism, police brutality, and a criminal injustice system that is killing us.\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nActivists from the Moral Mondays Movement in North Carolina have also staged die-ins. They are fighting for the lives of those who will die because Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and the Republican-controlled legislature have refused Medicaid expansion.\n\nMoral Mondays protesters in North Carolina carry cutouts of tombstones for a \"die-in\" outside the North Carolina State Capitol\n\n\n\n\u201cThe denial of Medicaid expansion is a form of political and social violence.

I risked my life defending that right. Some died in the struggle. If we are ever to actualize the true meaning of equality, effective measures such as the Voting Rights Act are still a necessary requirement of democracy.\u201d\n\n-Congressman John Lewis\n\nVoter suppression enables Republicans to enact and maintain their deadly policies.\n\nIn 2016, 10 states will be putting into place restrictive voting laws that they will be enforcing for the first time in a presidential election. These laws range from new hurdles to registration to cutbacks on early voting to strict voter identification requirements. Collectively, these ten states are home to over 80 million people and will wield 129 of the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the presidency.\n\nThe same way that Moral Mondays reclaimed the high ground from the right-wing \u201cMoral Majority,\u201d Democrats need to reclaim the concept of being pro-life.\n\nBecause the reality is, we are pro-life.\n\nAnd death is the specialty of Republicans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "While I read about the experiences of people living in Flint, Michigan , whose children have been poisoned as a result of policies instituted by Michigan\u2019s Republican Gov.\u00a0Rick Snyder and his ...", "title": "Killing us harshly: A Republican specialty", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/1/24/1470938/-Killing-us-harshly-A-Republican-specialty", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/198197/story_image/dreamstime_m_42642487.jpg?1453310967", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailykos", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/198197/story_image/dreamstime_m_42642487.jpg?1453310967"}, "description": "While I read about the experiences of people living in Flint, Michigan, whose children have been poisoned as a result of policies instituted by Michigan\u2019s Republican Gov.\u00a0Rick Snyder and his admini...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Killing us harshly: A Republican specialty"}}, "article_summary": "The same way that Moral Mondays reclaimed the high ground from the right-wing \u201cMoral Majority,\u201d Democrats need to reclaim the concept of being pro-life.\nx YouTube VideoActivists from the Moral Mondays Movement in North Carolina have also staged die-ins.\nThey are fighting for the lives of those who will die because Republican Gov.\nMoral Mondays protesters in North Carolina carry cutouts of tombstones for a \"die-in\" outside the North Carolina State Capitol\u201cThe denial of Medicaid expansion is a form of political and social violence.\nAnd death is the specialty of Republicans."}
