He took the oath of office from his predecessor, outgoing Attorney General and soon to be Governor, Greg Abbott.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter being sworn in by Abbott, Paxton, took to the podium and said, \u201cIt is a very exciting day for me to say I am the Texas Attorney General.\u201d\n\nHe also quipped, \u201cI guess this means the former Attorney General is unemployed.\u201d The comment drew laughs as outgoing Attorney General now incoming Governor Abbott became the former Attorney General during the act of administering the oath to Paxton. Paxton credited Texas\u2019 current Governor, Rick Perry, with the idea for the joke.\n\nThe star-studded swearing in ceremony included the current two potential 2016 presidential candidates, Gov. Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz, Governor-elect Greg Abbott, current Lt. Governor David Dewhurst, Lt. Governor-elect Dan Patrick and Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett.\n\nDuring his welcome message, Lt. Governor Dewhurst told the packed room of over 600 supporters that under the leadership of AG Ken Paxton, Texas would be \u201cthe greatest law and order state in the nation.\u201d\n\nGovernor Perry delivered the opening prayer for the ceremony. During his remarks he said the Texas Attorney General\u2019 Office \u201cplays a particularly important role.\u201d He said this is especially important now because of \u201cfederal government overreach.\u201d\n\nPerry said he is a proud supporter of the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He joked about the need to be able to defend your dog from an attacking coyote while out jogging. He also stated his support for the 10th Amendment and praised the role outgoing AG Abbott performed during his tenure in defending Texas.\n\nLt. Governor-elect Patrick told a story about the campaign trail he and Paxton spent many months together on to get to where they are today. He told a story about all of the AG candidates being in Houston while all of the Lt. Gov. candidates were in North Texas. Their respective wives appeared in the opposite cites to represent their husbands. In Houston, Paxton took a photo himself with Patrick\u2019s wife, Jan, and sent it to Patrick. Not to be outdone, Patrick went and found Paxton\u2019s wife, Angela, and took a picture of them together and sent it to Paxton. He said both of them then posted the photos on their Facebook pages. \u201cWe confused the heck out of people that night,\u201d Patrick said and the audience laughed.\n\nSen. Cruz, who served previously as Texas Solicitor General under Abbott before running for the Senate, delivered the keynote speech. \u201cWe are celebrating a new Attorney General, my good friend, Ken Paxton,\u201d Cruz began. He said the Texas Attorney General is on the \u201cfront line every day\u201d in defending Texas from an overreaching federal government. He cited several cases where the AG has had to file lawsuits to defend Texas including over issues related to the 2nd Amendment, state sovereignty, religious freedom and Obamacare.\n\nCruz, along with most everyone else who spoke, reminded Paxton about the enormity of following Abbott as AG. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some big shoes to fill,\u201d Cruz quipped. He then affirmed what the audience already knew. \u201cKen Paxton is a worthy successor to Attorney General Greg Abbott.\u201d\n\nJustice Willett reminded the audience about the importance of the AG\u2019s Office. \u201cThe Texas Attorney General is flat out essential to the liberty of Texas,\u201d Willett stated. Willett and Paxton attended Baylor University together. He said he was glad to see the size of the Baylor delegation of Texas\u2019 statewide elected government officials double in size with Paxton\u2019s swearing in.\n\nPaxton took the oath of office with his hand on an historic piece of Texas history, the Sam Houston Bible. He was sworn in by Abbott while his wife, Angela stood by his side. She proudly kissed him after the ceremony.\n\nPaxton\u2019s family participated in the ceremony as two of his children led the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance. His other two children led the pledge to the Texas Flag. Paxton\u2019s wife, Angela, amazed the audience with her rendition of The National Anthem.\n\nPaxton thanked the people in the room, his wife Angela and children. He also spoke touchingly about his parents, who were also present for the ceremony. He was grateful for their support and everyone\u2019s encouragement he received to travel down the path to Texas Attorney General.\n\nPaxton also spoke on the outgoing leadership of Texas noting, \u201cWe are blessed. Texas is unique and special,\u201d Paxton stated. He characterized what outgoing Governor Perry and Lt. Governor Dewhurst accomplished during their tenures as \u201camazing.\u201d He added that Texans enjoy great personal freedoms because of state governance \u2014 the House, Legislature, and Senate \u2014 and common sense conservative values that lead to prosperity.\n\nThe new Attorney General likened Texas to that \u2018shining city on the hill\u2019 former President Reagan always said fondly of the United States. He said that it is, in part, because Texas is successful. \u201cOur policies work.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that even with the challenges the nation faces, he is encouraged by incoming Texas leadership.\n\nHe joked with Abbott about the big shoes he was going to have to fill. \u201cI wear a size 12,\u201d Paxton joked while showing Abbott his shoe. \u201cI am ready to go to work.\u201d He also thanked Abbott for setting the Attorney General \u2018standard\u2019 for the state and the nation.\n\nHe then looked to the incoming team on the stage \u2014 Governor-elect Abbott and Lt. Governor-elect Patrick and said, \u201cWe are in great shape with the leadership of people on this stage.\u201d\n\nHe closed by saying, \u201cAs Texas goes, so goes the nation.\u201d\n\nBob Price and Merrill Hope are staff writers and a members of the original Breitbart Texas team.
