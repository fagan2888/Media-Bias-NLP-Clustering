When they first settled at Plymouth, they were told: \u201cShare everything, share the work, and we\u2019ll share the harvest.\u201d\n\nThe colony\u2019s contract said their new settlement was to be a \u201ccommon.\u201d Everyone was to receive necessities out of the common stock. There was to be little individual property.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing about the Plymouth Colony that sounds like it was from Karl Marx: Its labor was to be organized according to the different capabilities of the settlers. People would produce according to their abilities and consume according to their needs. That sure sounds fair.\n\nThey nearly starved and created what economists call the \u201ctragedy of the commons.\u201d\n\nIf people can access the same stuff by working less, they will. Plymouth settlers faked illness instead of working the common property. The harvest was meager, and for two years, there was famine. But then, after the colony\u2019s governor, William Bradford, wrote that they should \u201cset corn every man for his own particular,\u201d they dropped the commons idea. He assigned to every family a parcel of land to treat as its own.\n\nThe results were dramatic. Much more corn was planted. Instead of famine, there was plenty. Thanks to private property, they got food \u2014 and thanks to it, we have food today.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Pilgrims themselves saw the broader economic implications of what they\u2019d been through. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were celebrating Thanksgiving because they\u2019d realized that capitalism works and communal property is a failure,\u201d says economist Russ Roberts. \u201cI think they were just happy to be alive.\u201d\n\nI wish people understood. This idea that happiness and equality lie in banding together and doing things as a commune is appealing. It\u2019s the principle behind the Soviet Union, Medicare, the Vietnam War, Obamacare and so on. Some communal central planning is helpful, but too much is dangerous. The Pilgrims weren\u2019t the first settlers on the East Coast of the New World to make this mistake.\n\nJust a few years before, the colony of Jamestown was almost wiped out by the same idea.\n\nHistorian Edmund S. Morgan, in \u201cAmerican Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia,\u201d describes what happened in 1609-1610: \u201cThere are 500 people in the colony now. And they are starving. They scour the woods listlessly for nuts, roots and berries. And they offer the only authentic examples of cannibalism witnessed in Virginia. One provident man chops up his wife and salts down the pieces. Others dig up graves to eat the corpses. By spring only sixty are left alive.\u201d\n\nAfter that season, the colony was abandoned for years.\n\nThe lesson that a commons is often undesirable is all around us. What image comes to mind if I write \u201cpublic toilet\u201d? Consider traffic congestion and poor upkeep of many publicly owned roads. But most people don\u2019t understand that the solution is private property.\n\nWhen natural resources, such as fish and trees, dwindle, the first impulse is to say, \u201cStop capitalism. Make those things public property.\u201d But they already are public \u2014 that\u2019s the problem.\n\nIf no one owns the fishing rights to a given part of the ocean \u2014 or the exclusive, long-term logging rights to part of the forest \u2014 people have an incentive to get there first and take all they can before the next guy does. Resources are overused instead of conserved. We don\u2019t maintain others\u2019 property the way we maintain our own.\n\nColonists in Plymouth nearly starved because they didn\u2019t understand that. In Jamestown, some were driven to cannibalism.\n\nBut no one starves when ranchers are allowed to own land and cattle. Or turkeys.\n\nPrivate ownership does good things. Be thankful for it.\n\n\u2022 John Stossel, host of \u201cStossel\u201d on the Fox Business Network, is author of \u201cNo They Can\u2019t!
