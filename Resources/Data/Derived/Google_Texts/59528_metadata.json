The WHYY/NewsWorks Health and Science Desk provides \"The Short Answer.\"\n\nToday's Question\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, how does where I live affect how much I pay for health insurance?\n\nThe Short Answer\n\nFirst and foremost, each region has its own quirks. There's a mix of hospitals and insurers, and those levels of competition very much influence how much people pay for coverage. The same plan costs more in Philadelphia than it does in Pittsburgh, for example.\n\nBut now, because of the Affordable Care Act, geography matters a bit more \u2014 specifically for people shopping on the individual market and for small group plans (basically, businesses with fewer than 50 employees). A region's so-called \"community rating\" \u2014 the risk factors for an entire market area \u2014 now has a greater influence on how premiums are calculated.\n\nWhy?\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, insurers could base premiums on a number of factors \u2014 how sick you are, how much care you're likely to use. If you're female, for instance, premiums would typically cost more.\n\nThat stuff is now a no-no.\n\nStarting on Jan. 1, 2014, individuals or small groups in the same region have to be offered the same premiums \u2014 with insurers being able to tweak rates based only on age, family size and tobacco use.\n\nSo who wins and who loses?\n\nGood question. The new rules redistribute risk, working to even things out. As such, it's good news for some folks and bad news for others.\n\nThink about a small company with unhealthy workers. The new community rating system is a big win for a company like that. The risk pool against which that company's premiums are calculated has just been expanded \u2014 by a lot \u2014 and those companies are likely to pay lower rates. However, experts say the flip side may also be true \u2014 healthy companies could have to pay more. Of course, all of this is still playing out and we'll have to see what happens.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe 2010 health law goes into effect Jan. 1, 2014. How will it affect you, your wallet and your health?
