Researchers blame the high costs on the fact that hospitals have to negotiate multiple contracts with insurers and organizations also have several layers of management.\n\n\"Simplifying healthcare administration reduces cost, improves the patient and provider experience and enables all healthcare stakeholders to focus more on quality and effectiveness,\" Denny Brennan, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium, said in the statement.\n\nThe MassCollaborative.org website features standardized industry forms and strategies to address insurance eligibility verification and claim appeals. Its goal is to take the cost and complexity out of the system and improve the overall end-to-end experience for healthcare providers, payers and patients in the state, according to Lynn Nicholas, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Hospital Association.\n\n\"As both state and federal reform move our healthcare system forward, this sort of administrative simplification is plain common sense,\" she said.\n\nThe initiative also attempts to address concerns that impact the entire industry and not just a particular segment, said Lora Pellegrini, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans. \"Reducing unnecessary administrative costs is an important step toward improving the efficiency and quality of the healthcare system,\" she said.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nU.S. hospitals spend more on administration than patient care\n\nHospital cost and charge gap grows immensely\n\nAHIP: Hospital prices drive up healthcare costs\n\nHealthcare consolidation to cause massive inflation\n\nProvider consolidation, out-of-network fees raise costs\n\nHow focusing on a handful of hospitals could reduce overall costs", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Mass Collaborative, an organization of more than 35 health plans, healthcare providers and trade associations, has developed a new\u00a0website\u00a0to standardize and simplify\u00a0healthcare administration processes and costs.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The Mass Collaborative, an organization of more than 35 health plans, healthcare providers and trade associations, has developed a new\u00a0website\u00a0to standardize and simplify\u00a0healthcare administration processes and costs.", "title": "New website streamlines healthcare administrative processes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/new-website-streamlines-healthcare-administrative-processes/2015-01-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Healthcare Administration,Mass Collaborative,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "The Mass Collaborative, an organization of more than 35 health plans, healthcare providers and trade associations, has developed a new website to standardize and simplify healthcare administration processes and costs.\n\"As both state and federal reform move our healthcare system forward, this sort of administrative simplification is plain common sense,\" she said.\n\"Reducing unnecessary administrative costs is an important step toward improving the efficiency and quality of the healthcare system,\" she said.\nIndeed, recent research indicates that hospital administration costs in the United States run about $667 per person each year, whether or not a patient is hospitalized--for about $215 billion in total.\n\"Simplifying healthcare administration reduces cost, improves the patient and provider experience and enables all healthcare stakeholders to focus more on quality and effectiveness,\" Denny Brennan, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium, said in the statement."}
