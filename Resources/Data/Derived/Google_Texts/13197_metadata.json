Dobrev took a picture of herself topless holding a sign that read \u201c#getcovered\u201d across her chest.\n\nDobrev is one of the most interesting celebrities to join the fight, as she isn\u2019t even American.\n\n\u201cIm Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go to http://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered, Because w/o it, youre naked,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe future of Obamacare is uncertain. Though it has been passed by Congress, signed by President Obama, and upheld by the Supreme Court, a group of Republicans are targeting the law. The group of mostly Tea Party Republicans has insisted that they will not vote for a measure to pay the government\u2019s bills unless Obamacare is defunded or delayed. As a result, the government has been locked in a shutdown for more than a week.\n\nConnie Britton is busy outside of her Obamacare advocacy. She has been on board for a movie spinoff of the television series Friday Night Lights, but said not all the actors share her enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about a lot of things. Some people are really excited about it and some people aren\u2019t,\u201d Britton said.\n\nKyle Chandler, who played coach Eric Taylor in the show, seems to be one of the hesitant ones. Connie Britton said Chandler pointed out that the television series was already based on a movie, which itself was based on a book.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Connie Britton is all in for Obamacare.
