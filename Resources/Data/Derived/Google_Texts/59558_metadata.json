Those people will want medical care, which means the demand for all health care services will only continue to rise.\u201d\n\nKimball said it is important to understand the differences between urgent care and emergency centers prior to seeking medical care.\n\nUrgent care centers accommodate patients with minor conditions, such as sprains, the flu, colds, infections, other common illnesses and minor stitches. Freestanding emergency centers or hospital-based emergency rooms should only be visited in the event of a life-threatening situation, Kimball said.\n\nUrgent care centers\n\nIn early September, Community Urgent Care opened its doors to patients along Hwy. 249 in the Tomball area. With four exam rooms, the clinic treats patients with a variety of symptoms, such as eye, ear and sinus infections, common allergies, asthma, bronchitis, coughs, colds, food poisoning, poison ivy and stomach pain, said Osama Shuja, manager and head of marketing at Community Urgent Care.\n\n\u201cBasically an urgent care facility is a bridge between an emergency room and your primary care physician,\u201d Shuja said. \u201cIt offers some services that an emergency rooms does without the wait and high prices that emergency rooms are charging nowadays.\u201d\n\nThe average wait at the clinic ranges from about five to 20 minutes, Shuja said. Community Urgent Care accepts Medicaid and Medicare patients and is working to accommodate all forms of insurance, he said.\n\nAn average visit to an urgent care center is $155 compared to $750 to $1,250 for a typical ER visit, Kimball said. Wait times can also vary significantly from a few minutes to several hours, he said.\n\n\u201cMagnolia is a critical piece of our strategic plan and the strategic direction of our organization. Growth is continuing to go into that marketplace, and we\u2019re trying to be proactive and address the needs.\u201d \u2014Brett Kinman, chief operating officer of the Tomball Regional Medical Center\n\n\u201cSome insurers also feature lower patient copays for urgent care service than treatment in an emergency room, making urgent care the more affordable option for immediate but nonemergency, nonlife-threatening situations,\u201d Kimball said.\n\nEmergency centers\n\nIn early March, Affinity Emergency Center at Magnolia opened to patients in the Magnolia Landmark Building along FM 1488.\n\n\u201cMagnolia is a critical piece of our strategic plan and the strategic direction of our organization,\u201d said Brett Kinman, chief operating officer of the Tomball Regional Medical Center. \u201cGrowth is continuing to go into that marketplace, and we\u2019re trying to be proactive and address the needs.\u201d\n\nThe center offers emergency room care as a department of TRMC to treat broken bones, serious illnesses and provide other care by board-certified physicians, he said.\n\n\u201cWe also have an imaging center there as well, so they\u2019ve got full service,\u201d Kinman said. \u201cIt\u2019s staffed by emergency physicians 24/7, 365 days a year. They can take on just about anything and everything there that we can take care of [at TRMC in Tomball].\u201d\n\nThe Tomball area received a new emergency center last November with the opening of Parkway ER along Kuykendahl Road.\n\nThe center offers treatment for a variety of emergencies, such as blood clots, allergic reactions and chest pain as well as burns, cuts, concussions and seizures, office manager Luisa Rodriguez said. The ER also offers CT scans, X-rays, ultrasounds, labs and electrocardiogram tests.\n\n\u201cWe have physicians and nurses who have emergency room experience,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThey are prepared and ready for any emergency\u2014they have seen anything and everything.\u201d\n\nView a map of local health care providers", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "urgent care, emergency room", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Community Impact Newspaper", "description": "urgent care, emergency room", "title": "Tomball, Magnolia adding more urgent care, emergency centers | Community Impact Newspaper", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://communityimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TOM-2015-11-29-1.jpg", "height": 466}, "updated_time": "2015-11-04T10:56:21-05:00", "url": "https://communityimpact.com/houston/tomball-magnolia/healthcare/2015/11/04/tomball-magnolia-adding-more-urgent-care-emergency-centers/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "urgent care, emergency room", "creator": "@impactnews_tom", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/communityimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/TOM-2015-11-29-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C466&ssl=1", "title": "Tomball, Magnolia adding more urgent care, emergency centers | Community Impact Newspaper", "site": "@impactnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "robots": "noodp", "bitly-verification": "6bcd44a334c1", "p": {"domain_verify": "586ad831859a33caa88da9358144e4cd"}, "fb": {"admins": 10203978947544147}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "local, news, community impact, impact news, Tomball | Magnolia, business, city, county, dining, development, education, transportation, real estate, elections, nonprofit, guides, housing, health care, water, neighborhoods vote, employment, parks, recreation, arts, entertainment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CommunityImpact", "published_time": "2015-11-04T07:20:55-05:00", "author": "www.facebook.com/CommunityImpactTOM", "section": "Tomball | Magnolia", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T10:56:21-05:00", "tag": "Urgent Care Association of Ameria"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "news_keywords": "affinity emergency center at magnolia, community urgent care, emergency centers, emergency rooms, magnolia, tomball, tomball | magnolia health care directory 2015, tomball | magnolia november 2015, urgent care, urgent care association of ameria, local news, community impact, impact news"}, "article_summary": "Urgent care centersIn early September, Community Urgent Care opened its doors to patients along Hwy.\n\u201cThe number of urgent care centers across the country has increased over the past decade and more will continue to open,\u201d said Dr. Robert Kimball, president of the board for the Urgent Care Association of America.\nFreestanding emergency centers or hospital-based emergency rooms should only be visited in the event of a life-threatening situation, Kimball said.\nThe health care landscape is continuing to expand in Tomball and Magnolia with a number of new urgent care and emergency centers popping up over the past year.\n\u201cBasically an urgent care facility is a bridge between an emergency room and your primary care physician,\u201d Shuja said."}
