While we\u2019re all deciding to exercise more and eat better, we think some of the characters from some of our favorite TV shows could stand to make some resolutions of their own.\n\nToday, we turn our attention to the residents of Central City. Here are our New Year's resolutions suggestions for the cast of The Flash.\n\nBarry Allen \u2013 Consider hiring an image consultant\n\nLook, Barry, the way you use your super speed to help people in Central City is great. With all these super-powered criminals running around, people need saving. We\u2019re just saying\u2026the Streak? The Flash? Maybe you should look into hiring someone who could come up with a name for you that\u2019s not also a way of a describing an act that could net you an indecent exposure arrest.\n\nReverse-Flash \u2013 Work on your self-esteem\n\nOkay, Mr\u2026.Thawne? Wells? Zolomon? Whatever you real name is, you can\u2019t go through your entire life defining yourself by your relationship with somebody else. Instead of a being the opposite of The Flash, maybe take some time to discover who you are completely apart from the Flash. Not to mention, if a \u201cFlash\u201d is something that can you charged with indecent exposure, I don\u2019t know even want to know what a \u201cReverse-Flash\u201d is.\n\nFirestorm \u2013 See a doctor\n\nRonnie, you have some medical issues you may want to attend to. I don\u2019t think a simple topical cream is going to fix this one. I know it used to be hard for a young person like yourself to afford healthcare, but it\u2019s a new day. Obamacare is real. You can get coverage, and thanks to the new law, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you for pre-existing conditions like chronic on-fireness. There\u2019s got to be specialists for things like that, right?\n\nHarrison Wells \u2013 Watch Back to the Future Part II\n\nWatch Part I for context, if you like, but you really pay attention to what Biff does in Part II. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re getting newspapers from the future (also, seriously? The future still has newspapers?), but they must still have sports sections, right? You should probably take notes and maybe place a few bets.\n\nMeta-humans of Central City \u2013 Unionize\n\nYou guys should probably come together as a group some home, a collective rogue element, if you will. Strong, cool-headed leadership should be valued, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a qualified criminal among you. You can only get your butt handed to you by the Flash on weekly basis for so long before you should start considering collective bargaining.\n\nThe Flash returns to the CW on January 20.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s a New Year, which means it\u2019s time for everyone to make their New Year\u2019s resolutions.
