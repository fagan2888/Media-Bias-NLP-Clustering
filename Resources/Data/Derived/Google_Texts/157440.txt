No doubt, the bestest thing about America is our freedom of belief

Unfortunately for Barack Obama, a growing number of Americans believe that he's doing a poor job as president.

Some people think he's too iron-fisted, while others feel he's too passive; and a vocal minority just wants to send him back to Kenya.

Meanwhile, charting confirms that the GOP isn't in Kansas anymore; they've pretty much fallen off the map altogether.

And their little tea bag, too.

The only thing the vast majority of Americans seem to agree on is that the Republican party is the absolute worst.

I mean, say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism... at least it's an ethos.
