However, these camera glasses would prove to be incredibly valuable in an entire other sense.\n\nKirkpatrick was becoming frustrated with the lack of security provided by two King County sheriff\u2019s deputies assigned to the protection of busses on the Metro Transit squad.\n\nIn the early-morning hours of November 14, Kirkpatrick confronted the officers in a completely cordial manner to voice his concern over the lack of their efforts to provide adequate security.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nDuring the exchange, Kirkpatrick certainly raised his tone a bit, but he never screamed or became aggressive. However, according to Sgt. Lou Caballero and Deputy Amy Shoblom, Kirkpatrick became angry and yelled profanities at the officers.\n\nAfter the exchange, Kirkpatrick returns to his bus, but Caballero had other intentions; he would file a complaint against Kirkpatrick. Caballero and Shoblom both alleged, in formal statements against the bus driver, the he yelled profanities at them.\n\nAccording to Caballero\u2019s complaint, Kirkpatrick yelled and said, \u201cYou got three (expletive) deputies out here that don\u2019t do nothing.\u201d Shoblom also wrote in a separate report, at Caballero\u2019s request, that she heard Kirkpatrick yell and use profanity.\n\nWhen he learned of the complaint against him, which would have ruined his 20-year career, Kirkpatrick took his video to the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\n\u201cThey came after me,\u201d said Kirkpatrick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sickening,\u201d he said. \u201cMy family and I have gone through a lot.\u201d\n\nWhen he showed the video to the Sheriff\u2019s investigator, it showed him saying, \u201cI\u2019m not yelling at you, sergeant. I\u2019m not yelling at you. I\u2019m expressing how frustrated I am at the fact that I got three deputies that don\u2019t do anything when I need help.\u201d\n\nThere was no swearing at all in the video which exposed Caballero and Shoblom as liars.\n\nIn a ridiculous manner, the officers completely denied the authenticity of the video.\n\n\u201cI am a man of integrity and I did not and DO NOT lie,\u201d Caballero wrote as he questioned the authenticity of the video.\n\n\u201cThis false accusation is both offensive and outrageous,\u201d Shoblom wrote, asserting there was \u201cno evidence\u201d the video \u201cis the original.\u201d\n\nAfter being caught in their lies, the two deputies now face the possibility of termination for dishonesty. Sheriff John Urquhart said Wednesday he will decide next week whether to uphold recommendations to fire the deputies.\n\nThis incident highlights the importance of filming police. Here, we have what seemed like a fleeting exchange with cops, actually evolve into cops lying to ruin the career of an innocent man. Had this not been caught on video, it would have been Kirkpatrick\u2019s word against these two lying cops \u2014 and we know who the other cops would have believed.\n\nThis article was originally published by: The Free Thought Project", "article_metadata": {"description": "Citizen\u2019s Private Body Cam Protects Him From Cops Who Lied To Get Him Fired", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Matt Agorist | The Free Thought Project", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Citizen\u2019s Private Body Cam Protects Him From Cops Who Lied To Get Him Fired", "title": "Citizen\u2019s Private Body Cam Protects Him From Cops Who Lied To Get Him Fired", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/citizens-private-body-cam-protects-him-from-cops-who-lied-to-get-him-fired/207935/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP131092888360.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-24T15:29:34-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Citizen\u2019s Private Body Cam Protects Him From Cops Who Lied To Get Him Fired", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP131092888360.jpg", "title": "Citizen\u2019s Private Body Cam Protects Him From Cops Who Lied To Get Him Fired", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Police", "published_time": "2015-07-25T05:00:41-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-24T15:29:34-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd033\"", "article_summary": "Citizen\u2019s Private Body Cam Protects Him From Cops Who Lied To Get Him FiredAfter being caught in their lies, the two deputies now face the possibility of termination for dishonesty.\nHere, we have what seemed like a fleeting exchange with cops, actually evolve into cops lying to ruin the career of an innocent man.\nKirkpatrick was becoming frustrated with the lack of security provided by two King County sheriff\u2019s deputies assigned to the protection of busses on the Metro Transit squad.\nLou Caballero and Deputy Amy Shoblom, Kirkpatrick became angry and yelled profanities at the officers.\n\u201cI am a man of integrity and I did not and DO NOT lie,\u201d Caballero wrote as he questioned the authenticity of the video."}
