Therefore, a hacker could potentially access these systems.\n\nAccording to the report, the Federal Aviation Administration \u201cfaces cybersecurity challenges\u201d in several different areas, including securing air-traffic control information systems and avionics, and \u201cclarifying cybersecurity roles and responsibilities among multiple FAA offices.\u201d\n\nGerald Dillingham, one of the authors of the report, told The Daily Signal in an interview the report is \u201cforward looking,\u201d and that there is \u201cvery little, if any\u201d impact for civilian day-to-day travel at the current time.\n\nHe said newer, modern aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner or the Airbus A350 are \u201cvery Internet protocol based,\u201d and that an individual with nefarious intent might be able to access vital controls by breaching firewalls with a virus if proper protocols are not in place.\n\nDillingham said the intent of the report is to call attention to the need for a standard set of regulations for Internet-connected aircraft going forward.\n\n\u201cHackers are always trying to find the next way in,\u201d said Dillingham.\n\nHe added that since the report was released on April 14, there have already been steps taken to \u201cmitigate\u201d the risks.\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, told CNN the report \u201cexposed a real and serious threat\u2014cyberattacks on an aircraft in flight.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The Federal Aviation Administration] must focus on aircraft certification standards that would prevent a terrorist with a laptop in the cabin or on the ground from taking control of an airplane through the passenger Wi-Fi system. That\u2019s a serious vulnerability,\u201d said DeFazio.\n\nDavid Inserra, an expert on cybersecurity at The Heritage Foundation, said the report \u201cpoints to the new trend: security in the so-called Internet of Things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, normal objects are becoming connected to the Internet, ranging from your coffee maker to the airplane you fly on, bringing new opportunities and benefits, but also real security concerns,\u201d said Inserra. \u201cMoving forward, the United States needs to be more security conscious, not just accepting the benefits of technology, but also realizing that security is necessary to maximize those benefits and minimize potential harm.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Modern, Internet-enabled aircraft may be susceptible to hacking, according to a new government report.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Modern, Internet-enabled aircraft may be susceptible to hacking, according to a new government report.", "title": "How Your Airplane\u2019s Wi-Fi Network Could Pose a Security Risk", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150419_AirplaneHacking.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-17T23:19:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CU8iu9"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Modern, Internet-enabled aircraft may be susceptible to hacking, according to a new government report.", "title": "How Your Airplane\u2019s Wi-Fi Network Could Pose a Security Risk", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150419_AirplaneHacking.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "cyber", "published_time": "2015-04-19T03:01:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T23:19:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "cybersecurity, aircraft, wi-fi, Internet, Government Accountability Office, Federal Aviation Administration, terrorism, hacking"}, "article_summary": "\u201cModern aircraft are increasingly connected to the Internet,\u201d warns the Government Accountability Office report.\nOn a modern plane, however, vital systems are linked to the same Wi-Fi system that passengers use.\nModern, Internet-enabled aircraft may be susceptible to hacking, according to a new government report.\n\u201cMoving forward, the United States needs to be more security conscious, not just accepting the benefits of technology, but also realizing that security is necessary to maximize those benefits and minimize potential harm.\u201d\nHe added that since the report was released on April 14, there have already been steps taken to \u201cmitigate\u201d the risks."}
