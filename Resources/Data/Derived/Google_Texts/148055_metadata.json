They also created a website to explain the idea, complete with a letter to their burger rivals.\n\nSince Peace Day asks the public \u201cwho will you make peace with,\u201d Burger King wrote to McDonald\u2019s that they \u201ccall a ceasefire\u201d on the burger wars.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s end the beef, with beef,\u201d the website says.\n\nAll of the proceeds from the proposed event would have gone toward Peace One Day, a nonprofit organization.\n\nHowever, McDonald\u2019s was not interested in a burger-related peace treaty.\n\nSoon after Burger King\u2019s proposal went public, the CEO of McDonald\u2019s took to their social media to pen a response back to Burger King.\n\nThough the post did call the proposal a good idea for a good cause, McDonald\u2019s countered that the two companies could instead do something \u201cbigger\u201d to make a positive impact.\n\nThere was some cheekiness to the post from McDonald\u2019s, with the brand politely chastising Burger King for comparing the business-related competition to the reality of war.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s ended the post with the quip, \u201cP.S. A simple phone call will do next time.\u201d\n\nThough the McWhopper isn\u2019t happening, this story exemplifies content marketing, as the proposal has gotten a ton of news coverage.\n\nAn NBC affiliate in Atlanta even decided to make their own McWhopper for National Burger Day yesterday.\n\nWhether people considered the move a publicity stunt, a brilliant content marketing strategy or a total waste of time, it has put a major spotlight on the International Day of Peace.\n\nGet Free Updates!
