The Maine House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a bill to allow citizens to carry concealed weapons without a permit. L.D. 652, which would eliminate the permitting requirement to carry a concealed weapon (and also permit people to carry a weapon in a car), passed with bipartisan support in a 83-62 vote. The bill passed through the Senate on May 28. Gov. Paul LePage has indicated that he will sign the bill into law.

Maine, a "shall-issue" state, has issued over 36,000 concealed weapons permits, including permits to out-of-state residents. Maine has exceptionally low crime rates, and a relatively high rate of gun ownership.

It was already legal to openly carry a firearm in the state of Maine. Seven other states, including fellow New England state Vermont, have "Constitutional Carry" laws on the books.
