(AP) - Six graduates of Mount Marty College are suing the Yankton liberal arts school after learning its new medical program failed to earn accreditation, preventing them from becoming licensed nurse practitioners.\n\nThe liberal arts college learned May 19 the program would be denied accreditation by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, which was five months after the first class in the program graduated.\n\nThe Argus Leader reported (http://argusne.ws/1ijVUPV) that those 18 students and another graduate from May now cannot be licensed as nurse practitioners. They can still complete coursework at a different school to earn an accredited degree.\n\n\u201cIf plaintiffs want to work as nurse practitioners, they will have to pay for and retake all of the classes that will not transfer to other schools that have an accredited nurse-practitioner program,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nSix of the 19 graduates sued Friday in Minnehaha County, a day after the college announced the issues with accreditation.\n\nThe school failed to disclose in its marketing materials that it didn\u2019t obtain pre-approval from the accrediting agency and \u201cimplied\u201d that the program was accredited, the lawsuit argues. The students learned it was not accredited after being accepted, taking out student loans and starting classes.\n\nSusan Kaslow, the school\u2019s vice president of academic affairs, told the Argus that the accreditation decision has been \u201cdevastating\u201d for the graduates.\n\n\u201cThey have kids, they have bills,\u201d she said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t your typical 18- to 22-year-old college students.\u201d\n\nThe college has been trying to find other schools that will allow the graduates to transfer credits and fill in coursework to earn post master\u2019s certificates, which would allow them to be licensed as practitioners.\n\nThe college could appeal the accreditation denial, but an appeal proceeding wouldn\u2019t allow the institution to present evidence of improvements, Kaslow said, so the school intends to apply for re-accreditation, an 18-month process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six graduates of Mount Marty College are suing the Yankton liberal arts school after learning its new medical program failed to earn accreditation, preventing them from becoming licensed nurse practitioners.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/21/mount-marty-grads-sue-over-failed-accreditation/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Six graduates of Mount Marty College are suing the Yankton liberal arts school after learning its new medical program failed to earn accreditation, preventing them from becoming licensed nurse practitioners.", "title": "Mount Marty grads sue over failed accreditation"}, "twitter": {"title": "Mount Marty grads sue over failed accreditation", "description": "Six graduates of Mount Marty College are suing the Yankton liberal arts school after learning its new medical program failed to earn accreditation, preventing them from becoming licensed nurse practit", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5bd\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Six graduates of Mount Marty College are suing the Yankton liberal arts school after learning its new medical program failed to earn accreditation, preventing them from becoming licensed nurse practitioners.\nSix of the 19 graduates sued Friday in Minnehaha County, a day after the college announced the issues with accreditation.\nSusan Kaslow, the school\u2019s vice president of academic affairs, told the Argus that the accreditation decision has been \u201cdevastating\u201d for the graduates.\nThe Argus Leader reported (http://argusne.ws/1ijVUPV) that those 18 students and another graduate from May now cannot be licensed as nurse practitioners.\nThey can still complete coursework at a different school to earn an accredited degree."}
