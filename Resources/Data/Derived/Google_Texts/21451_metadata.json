She wakes up at 4:45 a.m. everyday and commutes about an hour to attend school near Reno.\n\n\u201cYou get used to it,\u201d Sumpter told The Sparks Tribune. After all, it had been her routine since seventh grade.\n\nWhen she moved on to high school, she had four schools to choose from but finally settled on Reed; partly because a familiar face would be there. Her friend Gabby Williams, also a Raiders standout choose to play there and they had been playing together since the fifth grade. Williams committed to play at UConn last fall.\n\nOn December 20, Sumpter set a Nevada High School Athletic Association record in 3-point shooting. She pegged 14-of-20, 3-point shots in a 85-45 victory against Hug High School. Sumpter finished the game with 50 points making 35 of the Raider\u2019s 39 points in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still crazy to me that I did it,\u201d Sumpter said during a follow up interview with The Tribune. Last season, she averaged a team-high of 24.4 points per game.\n\nSumpter said, however, that recognition from her young fans is more rewarding than what she does on the court.\n\n\u201cNative Americans, they\u2019re really proud of me because a lot of kids come here from the reservation and they don\u2019t make it in big schools and they don\u2019t get to play basketball. They usually end up back at Pyramid Lake or at a smaller school,\u201d Sumpter said. \u201cSo I think it was kind of cool that I got to make it.\u201d\n\nThe American family Insurance High School Slam Dunk and 3-point Championship showcases 16 of the nation's top high school basketball players to compete during Final Four weekend.
