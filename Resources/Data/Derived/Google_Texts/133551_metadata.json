He spoke in a 30-minute interview from his offices on the top floor of the congressional building that towers over downtown Brasilia.\n\nQuickTake Brazil's Highs and Lows\n\nBrazilian assets for months have rallied on expectations that the vice president could revive economic growth and renew confidence in a country that has been battered by a widening budget deficit, near double-digit inflation and rising unemployment. In a panel organized by Bloomberg this week, three of the country\u2019s top independent fund managers said they expect Temer\u2019s economic team to quickly address the country\u2019s fiscal deficit to win back investor confidence -- which would make room for the central bank to cut the base interest rate by at least 200 basis points.\n\nNow one of his closest advisers says there\u2019s no room for the kind of dramatic austerity measures investors crave in light of the country\u2019s crushing recession.\n\n\u201cToday you have 40 percent of the population in an extremely delicate situation from a social standpoint,\u201d said Moreira Franco, who co-authored the economic platform of Temer\u2019s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to carry out an economic adjustment sacrificing 40 percent of the population.\u201d\n\nCountry\u2019s Reins\n\nTemer\u2019s supporters have been battling accusations from members of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party that his administration would cut back on welfare programs to appease business interests, should he take over the top job. The vice president denied those charges in an interview televised on SBT Thursday night, saying his top priorities would be to create jobs and put the economy \u201cback on track.\u201d\n\nThe leftist Workers\u2019 Party employed a similar strategy against opposition leader Aecio Neves in the 2014 presidential race, saying he would reduce social spending and raise the benchmark interest rate.\n\nWhile Moreira Franco didn\u2019t discuss monetary policy, he did say Temer would resist calls to give the central bank full independence. Under current law, Brazil\u2019s president can fire a central bank director at any time. A push to take away that power and give all central bank board members a fixed four-year term gained momentum in Congress early this year before impeachment proceedings started to dominate lawmakers\u2019 attention.\n\nRousseff will have to temporarily hand the country\u2019s reins to Temer next month if the opposition garners the simple majority it needs to start a Senate impeachment trial, which surveys conducted by local media show it currently has. If the opposition wins a final impeachment vote with a two-thirds majority of the Senate, Temer would assume the presidency until a new president is elected in late 2018.\n\nExtensive Review\n\nTemer will aim to increase the retirement age but only after extensive review and consultations, said Moreira Franco, citing how it took years to study, prepare and build support for the implementation of Obamacare in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have the challenge to face the biggest crisis in our history in a very short time,\u201d he said. \u201cWill we solve the entire crisis? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThe government would however seek to stimulate private sector investment by cutting red tape, ruling out caps on investment returns, and scaling back the role of Petrobras in the oil industry, he said.\n\n\u201cWe need clear rules and conditions for investors to make their business plans,\u201d Moreira Franco said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Arnaldo Galvao,Raymond Colitt", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/temer-adviser-plays-down-prospects-of-fast-fix-for-brazil-s-woes", "title": "Brazil's Leader-in-Waiting Sees No Quick Fix for Economy", "description": "Vice President Michel Temer is playing down expectations that he can achieve a quick fix for Brazil\u2019s economic troubles should his boss, Dilma Rousseff, be impeached.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Raymond Colitt", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Brazil", "news_keywords": "Brazil", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/temer-adviser-plays-down-prospects-of-fast-fix-for-brazil-s-woes", "parsely-title": "Brazil's Leader-in-Waiting Sees No Quick Fix for Economy", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-04-28T22:13:01.950Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Vice President Michel Temer is playing down expectations that he can achieve a quick fix for Brazil\u2019s economic troubles should his boss, Dilma Rousseff, be impeached.", "parsely-tags": "Brazil,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2016-04-28T22:13:01.950Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/temer-adviser-plays-down-prospects-of-fast-fix-for-brazil-s-woes", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Vice President Michel Temer is playing down expectations that he can achieve a quick fix for Brazil\u2019s economic troubles should his boss, Dilma Rousseff, be impeached.", "title": "Brazil's Leader-in-Waiting Sees No Quick Fix for Economy"}, "fb": {"status": "Vice President Michel Temer is playing down expectations that he can achieve a quick fix for Brazil\u2019s economic troubles should his boss, Dilma Rousseff, be impeached."}, "parsely-post-id": "O6D6A56JTSE901", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "Vice President Michel Temer is playing down expectations that he can achieve a quick fix for Brazil\u2019s economic troubles should his boss, Dilma Rousseff, be impeached.\n\u201cWe need clear rules and conditions for investors to make their business plans,\u201d Moreira Franco said.\nUnder current law, Brazil\u2019s president can fire a central bank director at any time.\nWhile Moreira Franco didn\u2019t discuss monetary policy, he did say Temer would resist calls to give the central bank full independence.\nA push to take away that power and give all central bank board members a fixed four-year term gained momentum in Congress early this year before impeachment proceedings started to dominate lawmakers\u2019 attention."}
