Ray Shelter, Jr.

A 31-year-old man is in custody in the shooting death of a veteran police officer who was responding to a domestic dispute in western Pennsylvania.

State police say Ray Shetler Jr. (pictured) was captured at about 3:15 a.m. Sunday after a six-hour manhunt while walking near a power plant about 60 miles east of Pittsburgh.

Police believe Shetler shot St. Clair Township Officer Lloyd Reed on Saturday night after officers were called to a domestic situation in New Florence. Reed, who had been an officer for more than 20 years, was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Trooper Stephen Limani says Shetler is being treated for a gunshot wound to the right shoulder. Shetler hasn't yet been charged with a crime. Limani says a warrant will be obtained Sunday for Shetler's arrest.
