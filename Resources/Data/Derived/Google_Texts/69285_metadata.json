The total is split about evenly among hourly Machinist union members, engineers and other staff.\n\nBut lately, the byword is stability \u2014 or at least \"relative stability,\" as one executive put it this week in a break during the company's annual gathering of aviation reporters. By most accounts, the figures will remain where they are, more or less, for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt could be worse, for several reasons. And it could have been better.\n\nThe much anticipated ramp-up of production in the F135 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has been slower than expected, as Pentagon spending has been hit by sequestration and political pressure to slow the planned acceleration of the nation's largest military hardware program.\n\nPratt, which assembles in Middletown the F135s destined for the U.S. armed services, delivered 51 of the engines in 2014 and plans to make 64 this year.\n\nBased on 2009 projections, annual totals would now have been more than double the current build rate, executives said.\n\nStill, that 100-plus figure could be just a couple of years away.\n\n\"You'll see the ramp start to really happen,\" Bennett Croswell, president of military engines for Pratt, said in an interview Thursday. \"But I am concerned about sequestration. \u2026 We will lose some production volumes.\"\n\nPratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies, has been a fixture in Connecticut for close to 90 years. Here's a look back at their history.\n\nPratt doesn't break down employment by program, and the company does not, and probably cannot, say where employment would have been if the original schedule were still in force.\n\nOn the commercial side, engineering and development on Pratt's next generation PurePower geared turbofan is largely done. \"We are going to ramp our E&D down, there's no question about that,\" said Paul Adams, the Pratt president.\n\nThat might seem ominous for East Hartford engineering staff levels, but Adams and other executives said it's not safe to assume that the hometown ranks of designers and development people will thin.\n\n\"I really don't want to make any employment predictions for us, short term or long term,\" Adams said. \"We like the skill set that we have here in Connecticut, it's where we do the majority of our engineering \u2026 but we will always be looking at and understanding, do we have the right skills in the right quantity in the right locations?\"\n\nThe geared turbofan has an order backlog of 6,300 engines, and that means that Middletown's new moving assembly line will remain busy for years. And Pratt, which won the latest Pentagon engine war against General Electric with sole sourcing on the F-35, and is touting the geared turbofan as revolutionary, is of a mind to keep innovating.\n\nEven as the F135 ramps up, \"We're looking at the next generation of propulsion systems,\" Croswell said. \"It would be a whole new platform. We are in the design phase of that program right now.\"\n\nAmong the innovations, Pratt is developing something called \"adaptive cycles,\" which are basically ways to vary engine running rates based on conditions.\n\nAdams even danced around the issue of Pratt's developing a geared turbofan model for jumbo jets, despite recent comments by Greg Hayes, CEO of parent company United Technologies Corp., that that won't happen. The largest geared turbofan currently generates 33,000 pounds of thrust, for the single-aisle Airbus A320 line.\n\n\"Not wanting to too much correct my boss in public, I would say that the technology is easily applicable to a wide body,\" Adams said. \"It's going to be contingent on us getting on the right program with the right airframe.\"\n\nPratt, which is preparing to break ground on a new head office and engineering center, financed with state tax credits under a deal with Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, is at what executives describe as a time of several \"inflection points.\" One of those is dangerous, as the number of commercial engines in service recently bottomed out at about 12,500. That means that the normally lucrative business of selling spare parts could suffer until the geared turbofan programs mature.\n\nThe company says it has an answer for that, in the form of a push toward maintenance contracts that give Pratt a larger role in maintaining engines for airlines \u2014 moving away from \"transactions,\" such as the sale of spare parts, toward contracted payments for making sure a fleet of engines stays in good working condition.\n\nThat's what many reformers in U.S. health care want to see \u2014 a move away from \"fee-for-service\" toward overall payments to insurers, doctors' groups and hospitals to keep large populations healthy.\n\nI didn't ask Adams whether he's conferring with Obamacare officials who are behind that evolution.\n\nHe did tell reporters that Pratt's total sales, $14.5 billion in 2014, should reach $24 billion by 2020. That's certainly good for the network of in-state Pratt suppliers.\n\nA lot has to go right for that dramatic sales jump to happen, and Pratt has suffered some well-publicized engineering glitches in both the F135 and geared turbofan programs, as rival General Electric is developing its own new engine to compete on single-aisle commercial aircraft.\n\nConnecticut always needs to worry about Pratt's constant search for lower-cost locations. But it's fair to say that Pratt's aggressive stance toward innovation, combined with the overall health of the airline industry \u2014 five straight years of profits with signs of continued health \u2014 bodes well for stable employment in the state where the company started 90 years ago.\n\nAnd in the long sweep of history, stable isn't bad.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "A Stable Jobs Picture For Pratt & Whitney In Connecticut", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "Pratt & Whitney executives don't talk much about job totals in Connecticut as they describe the company's new engines, market strategies and technologies.", "title": "A Stable Jobs Picture For Pratt & Whitney In Connecticut", "url": "http://www.courant.com/business/dan-haar/hc-haar-pratt-whitney-status-20150403-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-551e8da3/turbine/hc-haar-pratt-whitney-status-20150403", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Pratt & Whitney jobs, Connecticut F-35 Joint Strike Fighter", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/83212754", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-04-03", "Description": "Pratt & Whitney's Connecticut job figures will remain where they are, more or less, for the foreseeable future as the F135 and geared turbofan engines ramp up for production.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Pratt & Whitney jobs, Connecticut F-35 Joint Strike Fighter"}, "article_summary": "Pratt & Whitney executives don't talk much about job totals in Connecticut as they describe the company's new engines, market strategies and technologies.\nThat means that the normally lucrative business of selling spare parts could suffer until the geared turbofan programs mature.\nThe largest geared turbofan currently generates 33,000 pounds of thrust, for the single-aisle Airbus A320 line.\nPratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies, has been a fixture in Connecticut for close to 90 years.\n\"You'll see the ramp start to really happen,\" Bennett Croswell, president of military engines for Pratt, said in an interview Thursday."}
