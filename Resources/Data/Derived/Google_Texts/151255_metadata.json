Walmart workers are fed up and fighting back: #FightFor15 pic.twitter.com/X33ZhmjCcG \u2014 UFCW (@UFCW) October 16, 2014\n\nDemonstrations last week against the Walton family, founders of Walmart, were coordinated in Arizona, New York and Washington, D.C., by \u201cOrganization United for Respect at Walmart\u201d and \u201cMaking Change at Walmart,\u201d two United Food and Commercial Workers campaigns to unionize Walmart workers.\n\nUFCW headquarters in D.C. had 1,274,156 members and received $210 million in revenue from its state and local affiliates in 2013, based on its latest report to the U.S. Department of Labor. With the union\u2019s monthly dues ranging from $15.04 to $20.15 per member, UFCW stands to gain tens of millions of dollars if even a small portion of Walmart\u2019s workforce votes to unionize.\n\nAt UFCW\u2019s Oct. 16 D.C. demonstration, protesters marched and sat in the streets with Making Change at Walmart printouts reading, \u201cStanding Up for OUR Jobs,\u201d \u201cThe Waltons are robbing America\u201d and \u201cDidn\u2019t your mother teach you to share?\u201d\n\nIn D.C. and 26 states, workers can be forced to pay UFCW as a condition of employment. UFCW took mandatory fees from 7,292 nonmembers in 2013 and paid union President Joseph Hansen a salary of $297,971.\n\nIncluding expenses and other disbursements, Hansen was paid $350,960. UFCW Canada President Wayne Hanley was paid a total of $372,548, and several other UFCW officials were paid more than $300,000.\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka called UFCW\u2019s D.C. protest a \u201cpowerful stand against what the Walton Family is doing to America.\u201d UFCW is a member of the AFL-CIO coalition, which paid Trumka $322,131 in its most recent fiscal year.\n\nUFCW thanked Trumka for attending the protest and \u201cfor all you do to help people feed their families,\u201d but did not respond to a Watchdog.org request to clarify how the Waltons are \u201crobbing America.\u201d\n\nAfter being refused entry to the offices of The Walton Family Foundation, UFCW protesters in D.C. blocked the intersection of 18th Street and K Street. \u201cWalmart workers won\u2019t be moved,\u201d UFCW asserted. \u201cThey\u2019re staying put because they need a living wage and full time hours NOW.\u201d\n\nWalmart workers won\u2019t be moved!
