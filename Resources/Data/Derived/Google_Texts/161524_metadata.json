Choy, but minutes later reconsidered and voted to reinstate the license, instead suspending it for six months. A do-over on a revocation case is so rare that several longtime observers said they could not recall ever seeing one before.\n\nIt is not entirely clear why the board had a sudden change of heart, although several mentioned that Choy had not been charged with anything similar in the past. The physician also expressed contrition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very ashamed of myself,\u201d Choy said. \u201cI ask you for clemency; I ask you not to take my license.\u201d\n\nThe physician said he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in changing the records. \u201cThis has been the lesson of a lifetime,\u201d Choy said. \u201cI promise I will never do it again.\u201d\n\nThe board\u2019s change of vote was a blow to the son of the patient in question, Teresita Garrido, who died in 2010 when she was a patient of Choy's. Jacinto Garrido is the one who filed the complaint and kept his eye on it during the Department of Health 's three-year investigation and prosecution.\n\nHad Choy known there was a duplicate copy of the records, he might have succeeded in the cover-up, Jacinto Garrido said. \u201cHow many more patients did he do this to but it was never uncovered?\u201d\n\nA Tallahassee hearing officer who considered evidence in the case in January, John Van Laningham, determined that Choy tampered with the medical records after getting a phone call from an attorney representing the family. Choy gave the doctored records to the attorney, and later to the DOH, Van Laningham wrote.\n\nThe falsification indicates Choy\u2019s guilt \u201cby clear and convincing evidence,\u201d he wrote in his recommended order on April 15. In it, Van Laningham recommended Choy\u2019s license be revoked.\n\nAnd that is what the board did by a 5-to-4 vote late Friday afternoon. But a few minutes later, Dr. Zach Zachariah, who had voted in the majority, asked for a reconsideration. This time, the board opted to suspend Choy\u2019s license, and depending on a review of his riskiness by independent assessors, allow Choy to practice on probation for five years, with another physician monitoring his records. He was also fined $35,000.\n\nDOH records give this background: Teresita Garrido, 77, a longtime patient of Choy\u2019s, complained to him in May 2008 of abdominal pain. He sent her for a CT scan in June; the report, which was faxed to Choy\u2019s office, said the scan showed \u201ca large malignant tumor mass\u201d in her pancreas.\n\nChoy either didn\u2019t notice the part about the tumor or somehow forgot what it said because there is nothing about it in Garrido\u2019s original medical records and he did not tell her about it, according to Van Laningham\u2019s findings of fact in the case.\n\nThe patient continued to complain of abdominal pain from time to time, the hearing officer\u2019s report says, but she didn\u2019t learn of the tumor or get treatment for it until she became so weak that her son took her to Mercy Hospital on July 19, 2010. By then the tumor had metastasized to the liver. She died Aug. 6, 2010.\n\nSoon after, Choy got a letter from an attorney representing the Garrido family requesting the medical records. Choy, who had no malpractice insurance coverage, \u201cpanicked\u201d and altered them, according to the hearing officer.\n\nMeanwhile, the family's lawyer said it wasn't financially feasible to sue Choy. Under Florida law, it is virtually impossible to win any damages in a malpractice case involving the death of an unmarried adult who has no minor children or other dependents.\n\nTheir only recourse, she told them, was to file a complaint with DOH. That is what happened.\n\nLast week, Jacinto Garrido made the trip from Miami to Tampa to \u201cseek health care justice,\u201d as he put it.\n\nIn a brief address to the board, he called Choy \u201cMachiavellian\u201d in his attempts to twist the facts of the case and said it is too dangerous to ever let him return to practice. \u201cWe know past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Choy\u2019s attorneys, Amy Schrader of Tallahassee, countered that the outcome for Teresita Garrido probably would not have been any better if Choy had told her about the malignancy in 2008 and she had begun treatment. Given how deadly pancreatic cancer tends to be, Schrader said, Teresita Garrido\u2019s two-year survival \u201cis a reasonable outcome for that condition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A Miami physician who mishandled a case and then altered the medical records to cover it up has been given a second chance by the Florida Board of Medicine", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/doctor-suspended-deception", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201406/Teresita_Garrido_with_a_grandchild.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Miami physician who mishandled a case and then altered the medical records to cover it up has been given a second chance by the Florida Board of Medicine", "title": "Doctor Suspended for Deception"}, "story_id": 320314284, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Carol Gentry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Doctor Suspended for Deception"}, "nid": 6754, "datePublished": "2014-06-09", "keywords": "Florida Board of Medicine, Peter V.
