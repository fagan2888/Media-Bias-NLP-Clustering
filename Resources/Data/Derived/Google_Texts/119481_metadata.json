Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nAmid the ongoing unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, there's been an early sign of political consensus between major leaders in both parties on the tactics being employed by law enforcement.\n\nThe political community had been markedly quiet in the aftermath of the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer after an altercation over the weekend. President Barack Obama had not even remarked on the matter until Tuesday. The racial, socioeconomical and legal land mines of the developing story were clearly evident to every politician, on the left and the right.\n\nBut as the standoff between militarized police and bands of angry and frightened protesters stretched on and saturated cable television, the stark silence began to break.\n\nEarly Thursday, two senators on polar opposites of the political spectrum were among the first to speak forcefully on the matter.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, sent a tweet that expressed her dismay with how law enforcement was attempting to diffuse the chaos.\n\n\n\nThis is America, not a war zone. The people of #Ferguson just want answers. We all want answers. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 14, 2014\n\n\n\nAlmost around the same time, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Facebook to lament the arrests of reporters on the ground covering the situation.\n\n\"Reporters should never be detained \u2013 a free press is too important \u2013 simply for doing their jobs,\" Cruz said in part. \"Civil liberties must be protected, but violence is not the answer. Once the unrest is brought to an end, we should examine carefully what happened to ensure that justice is served.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither of these musings on social media included specific policy proposals, and Cruz notably began his message with the point that police officers \"risk their lives every day to keep us safe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut taken together, the two distinctly different ideological warriors \u2013 and oft-mentioned potential presidential contenders \u2013 wanted to convey that they thought police in Ferguson were overstepping their boundaries.\n\nFor the media, the most anticipated reaction was that of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has made a concerted effort to make inroads with African-Americans on issues like drug sentencing and education reform.\n\nPaul ended up issuing the most extensive comments on the situation of any potential 2016 White House candidate, through an op-ed published by Time.\n\nLike Cruz, Paul made sure to note that police had a right to keep the peace, but also squarely stated that \"there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.\"\n\nPhoto Gallery x of x Full Screen People protest as tear gas canisters detonate around them on Wednesday in Ferguson, Mo.

He slid into a more ideological frame by diagnosing the militarization of police as a product of \"big government.\" Since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, Washington has sent millions of dollars to local municipalities to bulk up their weaponry, producing what Paul referred to as \"small armies\" in the name of homeland security. This was Paul's fairly direct pitch to conservatives that his argument for a police force with a lighter, less aggressive footprint is something they can sign on to.\n\n\n\nBut the core of Paul's message seemed to align with Warren, who said Ferguson looked like \"a war zone.\"\n\n\"When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury \u2013 national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture \u2013 we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands,\" Paul wrote, broadening his argument.\n\nHis specific policy prescription appeared to be a call to roll back federal funding for advanced weaponry more suited for the streets of Baghdad, not for a suburb of St. Louis.\n\nThis will undoubtedly meet resistance from some Capitol Hill lawmakers, many of whom remain sensitive to local security needs in their states.\n\nBut perhaps Paul's first ally in the endeavor could be Warren, another leader with a large megaphone who sits far across the aisle.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Cruz, Paul, Warren Weigh in on Ferguson", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "When it comes to police tactics used in Missouri, even Elizabeth Warren and Rand Paul appear to agree.", "title": "Potential Presidential Candidates Find Common Ground on Ferguson", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/08/14/cruz-paul-warren-weigh-in-on-ferguson", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1a/c3/2735518243ac8f14229b21b8a565/140814-ferguson-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Cruz, Paul, Warren Weigh in on Ferguson", "description": "When it comes to police tactics used in Missouri, even Elizabeth Warren and Rand Paul appear to agree.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Aug. 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,2016 presidential election,Pulse,picks,Warren, Elizabeth,Paul, Rand,Cruz, Ted,Ferguson, Missouri,The Run 2016 [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "When it comes to police tactics used in Missouri, even Elizabeth Warren and Rand Paul appear to agree."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda287\"", "article_summary": "Jeff Roberson/AP x of x Full Screen Protesters try unsuccessfully to light a Molotov cocktail Wednesday in Ferguson.\nJeff Roberson/AP x of x Protesters try unsuccessfully to light a Molotov cocktail Wednesday in Ferguson.\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch, Chris Lee/AP x of x A protester takes shelter from smoke billowing around him Wednesday in Ferguson.\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch, David Carson/AP x of x St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, left, delivers remarks about Brown's shooting as Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson listens during a news conference Sunday in Ferguson.\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch, Robert Cohen/AP x of x Police officers patrol Sunday in Ferguson."}
