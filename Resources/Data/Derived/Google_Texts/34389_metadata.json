Thornton responded that Wilson needed to \u201cshut his mouth,\u201d and Sharks owner Hasso Plattner wisely told them to keep disagreements in-house. Since, Thornton and Wilson allegedly have buried the hatchet. (Yeah, right.)\n\nFrei\u2019s take: Last year, the Sharks won the first three games of their first-round playoff series against the Kings and then collapsed. The Kings went on to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nThat embarrassment led to conclusions it was time for the Sharks to do some housecleaning and paring, and to try to rebuild on the fly.\n\nOne of the issues will be whether the Wilson-Thornton relationship is irreparable and one or the other needs to go.\n\nCaught in the middle is coach Todd McLellan. He has been with the Sharks since 2008, when he moved over from Mike Babcock\u2019s Red Wings staff.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Joe Thornton,NHL,Sharks,Spotlgi", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "In opening a three-game California trip, their final road excursion of the season, the Avs will meet Joe Thornton and the Sharks.", "title": "Joe Thornton: Spotlight on the San Jose Sharks center", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/03/28/joe-thornton-spotlight-on-the-sharks-center/21118/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/03/Joe-Thornton.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "In opening a three-game California trip, their final road excursion of the season, the Avs will meet Joe Thornton and the Sharks.", "title": "Joe Thornton: Spotlight on the San Jose Sharks center", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/03/28/joe-thornton-spotlight-on-the-sharks-center/21118/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/03/Joe-Thornton.jpg", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "In opening a three-game California trip, their final road excursion of the season, the Avs will meet Joe Thornton and the Sharks."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe65\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Joe Thornton, center, SharksWhen: The Avalanche plays Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. MDT at San Jose\u2019s SAP Center.\nWhat\u2019s up: In opening a three-game California trip, their final road excursion of the season, the Avs will meet Joe Thornton and the Sharks.\nFrei\u2019s take: Last year, the Sharks won the first three games of their first-round playoff series against the Kings and then collapsed.\nThornton responded that Wilson needed to \u201cshut his mouth,\u201d and Sharks owner Hasso Plattner wisely told them to keep disagreements in-house.\nHe has been with the Sharks since 2008, when he moved over from Mike Babcock\u2019s Red Wings staff."}
