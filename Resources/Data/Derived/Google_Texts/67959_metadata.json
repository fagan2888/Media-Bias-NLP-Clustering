Shkreli, the media-savvy, one-time hedge fund manager, became the scourge of the pharmaceutical industry after his company acquired the rights to Daraprim \u2013 a decades-old drug used to treat parasitic infections in cancer and HIV patients \u2013 and then raised the price from $13.50 to $750 a pill.\n\nRelated: Ignoring Warnings, Drug Companies Hike Prices By 10 Percent\n\nThe cocky, 32-year-old executive was ousted from his company last December after being arrested and charged in an unrelated securities fraud case. He has said he is likely to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuse to answer the committee\u2019s questions, assuming he is in attendance.\n\nValeant Pharmaceuticals is another company that will be on the hot seat for the same practice of purchasing the rights to drugs that have been on the market for years and then jacking up their prices.\n\nFor example, the price of Mephyton, a blood-coagulating drug, has been raised eight times since July 2014, from $9.37 a tablet to $58.76, according to The New York Times. In similar fashion, the price of Edecrin, a diuretic, has been raised nine times since May 2014, from $470 a vial to an eye-popping $4,600.\n\nAnd according to thousands of pages of documents obtained by the House committee, Turing and Valeant appear to have built their business models around significantly increasing the prices of drugs they did not invent or develop.\n\nRelated: Extreme Rise in Some Drug Prices Reaches a Tipping Point\n\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, voiced outrage and shock that many drug companies are \u201clining their pockets at the expense of some of the most vulnerable families in our nation.\u201d\n\nBut he shouldn\u2019t have been all that surprised. As Shkreli has freely acknowledged, plenty of drug companies have pursued the same business model -- either jacking up the price of a drug after acquiring the rights or simply boosting prices on drugs that have long been part of a company\u2019s line.\n\n\"It's a great business decision that also benefits all of our stakeholders,\" Shkreli tweeted last year.\n\nGilead Sciences, for example, purchased Pharmasset in 2011 for $11 billion and then made a fortune bringing out the hepatitis-C miracle drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and charging a retail price of $84,000 for a single course of treatment.\n\nThe wholesale price for 30 of the top-selling U.S. drugs increased 76 percent between 2010 and 2014, according to the House oversight committee \u2013 eight times the general rate of inflation.\n\nRelated: Drug Company Profits Soar as Taxpayers Foot the Bill\n\nThe latest confirmation of these trends comes from a new survey released this week of roughly 3,000 brand-name prescription drugs. The survey by DRX found that prices had doubled for 60 of the drugs and at least quadrupled for 20 others since December 2014, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAmong the more notable price hikes found by DRX, which provides price data within the health industry:\n\nThe price of Alcortin A, a steroid and antibiotic gel to treat eczema and skin infections manufactured by Novum Pharma, soared by 1,860 percent during the period surveyed.\n\nPfizer raised prices for 24 drugs by at least 12 percent, with Viagra increasing about 13 percent and the price of two heart drugs going up 44 percent and 86 percent.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline increased prices by 15 percent on 22 products, including Lamictal XR for epilepsy.\n\nHere is a chart that highlights the survey\u2019s findings:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There is certain to be some excitement Thursday morning when officials from two notori", "title": "Get Ready for Fireworks Over Soaring Drug Prices", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/04/Get-Ready-Fireworks-Over-Soaring-Drug-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06302011_drug_costs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/04/Get-Ready-Fireworks-Over-Soaring-Drug-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06302011_drug_costs_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There is certain to be some excitement Thursday morning when officials from two notori", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Ignoring Warnings, Drug Companies Hike Prices By 10 PercentThe cocky, 32-year-old executive was ousted from his company last December after being arrested and charged in an unrelated securities fraud case.\nRelated: Drug Company Profits Soar as Taxpayers Foot the BillThe latest confirmation of these trends comes from a new survey released this week of roughly 3,000 brand-name prescription drugs.\nPfizer raised prices for 24 drugs by at least 12 percent, with Viagra increasing about 13 percent and the price of two heart drugs going up 44 percent and 86 percent.\nAs Shkreli has freely acknowledged, plenty of drug companies have pursued the same business model -- either jacking up the price of a drug after acquiring the rights or simply boosting prices on drugs that have long been part of a company\u2019s line.\nFor example, the price of Mephyton, a blood-coagulating drug, has been raised eight times since July 2014, from $9.37 a tablet to $58.76, according to The New York Times."}
