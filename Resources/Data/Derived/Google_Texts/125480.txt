Last week, the state's health department released demographic information on who used New York's new health insurance exchange to enroll in a health insurance plan.

The data showed how many people across New York signed up for private health insurance plans, enrolled in Medicaid and took advantage of Child Health Plus.

In total, nearly 1 million people got health insurance coverage through New York State of Health, or about 5 percent of the state's population. The exchanges were created by the Affordable Care Act.

Capital broke that down by county: We found Queens County had the highest percentage (6.78) of its population enroll while Madison County (2.86) had the lowest. But in Madison about half the people who enrolled signed up for a Medicaid plan while half signed up for private insurance. In Queens, twice as many people signed up for Medicaid compared to a private insurance plan.

Capital's map illustrates just how widespread enrollment was and how quickly it became part of the fabric of New York.

"QHP" is qualified health plan, and "CHP" is Child Health Plus, which is the state's version of Medicaid for children.
