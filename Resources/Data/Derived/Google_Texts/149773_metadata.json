Even as it passed, some lawmakers expressed concern the measure limits the state\u2019s flexibility to improve the program in the future.\n\nHIP 2.0 went into effect last February. It uses money from the federal Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance to low-income Hoosiers. It\u2019s early in the second year of a three- year demonstration, approved by the federal government.\n\nRep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany, an ardent supporter of the program, says there\u2019s still a lot the state doesn\u2019t know about how HIP 2.0 is working.\n\n\u201cWe know there are a lot of good things about HIP; we know there are a lot of things that are working,\u201d Clere says. \u201cBut we know there are other elements that are either questionable or may leave opportunity for improvement.\u201d\n\nAnd Clere says that\u2019s why the bill is a bad idea \u2013 he says it makes it harder to make positive changes. But Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, says the legislation is about protecting HIP 2.0.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be codified,\u201d Lehman says. \u201cIt needs to be put in place so that those who say it needs to change and we need to make it change can\u2019t, on a whim, make it go away.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which is part of Governor Mike Pence\u2019s legislative agenda this session, now awaits his signature.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HIP 2.0 went into effect last February and provides insurance to some low-income Hoosiers.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "HIP 2.0 went into effect last February and provides insurance to some low-income Hoosiers.", "title": "Bill To Codify HIP 2.0 Closer To Becoming Law | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/bill-codify-hip-20-closer-law-95265/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2014/01/HIP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2014/01/HIP.jpg", "description": "HIP 2.0 went into effect last February and provides insurance to some low-income Hoosiers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill To Codify HIP 2.0 Closer To Becoming Law"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "House and Senate lawmakers Thursday sent a bill to the governor that codifies HIP 2.0, the state\u2019s health care program.\nBut Rep.
