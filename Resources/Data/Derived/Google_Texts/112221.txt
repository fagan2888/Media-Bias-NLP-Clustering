(Newser) – "Proven ability to work with irrational people who pursue narrow priorities at the expense of millions of others." That's one of the main job requirements for speaker of the House, at least according to a fake Craigslist ad posted to social media Thursday by a Democratic congressman's office. The Hill reports this piece of political satire comes from California Rep. Mark Takano and pokes fun at Republicans' inability to find someone to replace outgoing speaker John Boehner.

The fake ad came shortly after Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who was expected to win the position, withdrew his name from consideration, the Hill reports. Apparently the speaker of the House is responsible for "managing multiple investigative committees aimed at attacking Hillary Clinton"—a reference to McCarthy's comments on the Benghazi panel—and "babysitting experience [is] STRONGLY PREFERRED." (In the real world, pressure is building on Paul Ryan to step up.)
