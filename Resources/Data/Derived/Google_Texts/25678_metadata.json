At this very early stage, when every week more candidates declare, the public is mainly not engaged\u2014not even the select contingent of voters that will turn up to cast ballots in the caucuses and primaries. Republicans are hungry to reoccupy the White House, and the realistic among them understand the party won\u2019t win without pitching a bigger tent. There may be no single GOP frontrunner, but there are just a few politicians who have the resources, positioning and potential to expand the base. They are former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, not necessarily in that order.\n\nIn other words, candidates like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Ben Carson aren\u2019t even dark horse contenders for the nomination; they're political losers and they don't even know it yet. That\u2019s an intriguing (if brutally honest) contention \u2014 and if true \u2014 would disappoint many conservative grassroots activists who harbor high hopes for their preferred candidates.\n\nNevertheless, perhaps these experts are right that the field is much smaller than currently meets the eye. Surely, however, some of the hopefuls in the race have no business running for president. They\u2019re either clenching to unrealistic (and delusional) visions of someday sitting in the Oval Office \u2014 or they have ulterior motives, such as earning a cabinet position or a spot on the national ticket.\n\nAnd yet, Sabato and his colleagues caution, if Republicans have any interest in breaking their two-cycle losing streak, they should probably rally around one of these three contenders \u2014 or risk everything:\n\n...A few will manage to win some primaries or caucuses. But if winning in November is the goal, Republicans will settle on Bush, Rubio or Walker. Some of the other candidates are too far right to win swing states, others are controversial and divisive within the party itself, still more are novices who have never held elective office, or retreads and golden oldies whose time has passed. It may look like an enormous, amorphous field of candidates, but already it\u2019s clear that three candidates loom large.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Does another Republican candidate have the capacity, connections, and money to win the primary and the general election? Or do Republicans need to endorse one of these three contenders to finally recapture the White House?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Choices..05/26/2016 4:23:45AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Choices.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Election Experts: There Are Only Three Serious GOP Contenders", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/06/10/election-expert-there-are-only-three-serious-gop-contenders-n2010698", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/103/68fb2a34-7206-409d-9f34-791e206fe1f0.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Choices.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Election Experts: There Are Only Three Serious GOP Contenders", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/06/10/election-expert-there-are-only-three-serious-gop-contenders-n2010698", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/103/68fb2a34-7206-409d-9f34-791e206fe1f0.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Election Experts: There Are Only Three Serious GOP Contenders, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecc0\"", "article_summary": "Or do Republicans need to endorse one of these three contenders to finally recapture the White House?\nDoes another Republican candidate have the capacity, connections, and money to win the primary and the general election?\nIt may look like an enormous, amorphous field of candidates, but already it\u2019s clear that three candidates loom large.\nNevertheless, perhaps these experts are right that the field is much smaller than currently meets the eye.\nRepublicans are hungry to reoccupy the White House, and the realistic among them understand the party won\u2019t win without pitching a bigger tent."}
