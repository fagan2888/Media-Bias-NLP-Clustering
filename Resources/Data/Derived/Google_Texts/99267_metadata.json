He let the contested merger of Penn State Milton S. Hershey (Pa.) Medical Center and Harrisburg, Pa.-based PinnacleHealth System go through, in part because he said it was needed to adapt to changes in the industry brought on by the ACA.\n\nThe judge's ruling differs from the position others have taken. In many cases, the FTC's argument that healthcare providers will use increased scale to negotiate higher payments from insurers has proven convincing.\n\nFTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez reiterated the agency's view in a May 12 speech. She said the FTC recognizes that healthcare is shifting in the direction of risk-based payments and population health management, which hospitals argue requires scale. However, she said the scale can also lead to hospitals exerting market power on insurers.\n\nThe FTC has repeatedly asserted there is no conflict between antitrust laws and the care coordination provisions of the ACA.\n\n\"If you look at the ACA, it specifically says it's not meant to supplant competition and we think it is quite clear that the goals of the ACA and antitrust are in harmony, not in conflict,\" Deborah Feinstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, told reporters at a briefing at the National Press Club last December.\n\nMore articles on antitrust issues:\n\n\n\nJudge rejects FTC's attempt to block PinnacleHealth-Penn State Hershey merger\n\nCigna CFO: We underestimated the 'depth and complexity' of antitrust investigation\n\nIn the Midwest, health systems go big or go home: The new reality of system dominance\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
