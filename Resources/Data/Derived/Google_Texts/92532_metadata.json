Instead, the whole thing was more likely to remind Millennials of the raucous 2000 version of the movie, \u201cMeet the Parents.\u201d Just as in that comic sendoff of what can go wrong when cultures and generations clash, the evening featured non-stop attacks on the Millennial generation\u2019s heroes and its beliefs. Unfortunately, this version had no Hollywood style reconciliation or even glimmer of understanding at its conclusion.\n\nAll the candidates delighted in attacking President Obama, perhaps forgetting not only that he won\u2019t be on the ballot in 2016, but also that he remains a hero to the majority of Millennials. In July 2015, Pew found that 55 percent of that generation approved of the President\u2019s job performance. Not only that, this support was built upon the generation\u2019s preference for some of the very issues that the candidates on Thursday night went out of their way to oppose.\n\nSeventy percent of Millennials favor same sex marriage; Mike Huckabee has based his entire candidacy in opposition to the idea and no other candidate was brave enough Wednesday night to say they agreed that same sex couples should be permitted to marry legally. Sixty-eight percent of Millennials are in favor of legalizing marijuana; no candidate was willing to come close to saying the idea might have merit; Rand Paul\u2019s insistence on a state\u2019s rights approach to (medical) legalization choices was as close as the field came. Instead, Jeb Bush in the best Boomer presidential candidate tradition apologized for using the stuff when he was young, chalking it up to youthful indiscretion, and Governor Chris Christie asserted that maintaining pot\u2019s illegality was so important as President he would go against traditional Republican deference to state\u2019s rights and assert federal law supremacy over state law to prosecute offenders. Like old people out of touch with what is happening in the world around them, the candidates kept on talking about repealing ObamaCare; meanwhile, fifty-two percent of Millennials approve of the program.\n\nIf that weren\u2019t bad enough, the candidates spent an inordinate amount of time bashing the parents of many Millennials, not a smart approach because Millennials, unlike previous generations, actually revere their parents. One out of five Millennials has an immigrant parent. Every candidate on the stage wanted to seal the border so no more immigrants could get into the United States without documentation. Of greater concern, most candidates also signed on to deporting undocumented immigrants who are already here. The ones who didn\u2019t go that far were the only candidates who gained or kept their support among a focus group of Fusion TV\u2019s target audience, Millennials. Four of Donald Trump\u2019s ten supporters in the Florida-based group deserted him, with two going to Carly Fiorina, and one each to Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. To the Millennials watching, those candidates appeared to be the only ones at the dinner table talking a modicum of sense.\n\nThe Millennial generation favors \u201cwin-win\u201d solutions that avoid direct and, especially military, confrontations with America\u2019s global opponents, something which all those in the debate outside of Rand Paul either didn\u2019t care about or didn\u2019t know. Beginning with Lindsay Graham\u2019s appeal to the assertion of unilateral American military power in the undercard debate, all the candidates pushed for a much more bellicose international approach by America. Their differences were over how quickly they would rip up the agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons, not how to celebrate the outcome of a settlement negotiated in concert with our allies and enemies. No one thought to ask the generation most likely to be sent into future combat what it thought. When Pew did so in July they found a plurality of Millennials (43%/39%) supported the agreement.\n\nIt was left to the two blustery participants from the Northeast, Christie and Trump to contribute a moment of concern for the welfare of Millennials to the proceedings. Governor Christie\u2019s best moment of the night was when he pointed out that most of the audience really didn\u2019t care about the careers of the two CEOs on the stage. Instead, he suggested, the candidates should be \u201cmore interested in the construction worker making $55,000 a year who can\u2019t figure out how to pay for his kid\u2019s college education.\u201d Here, Christie had an avenue to connect with Millennials on their unique views on money, happiness, and their disdain for banks and financial companies in general, that we wrote about last year. That, unfortunately for the GOP, was the only mention in the three hours of debate about the number one issue\u2014the high price of college tuition\u2014on the minds of Millennials\u2019 parents and the generation itself.\n\nAnd when Trump came out four square for a progressive taxation scheme, in line with Millennials strong belief in economic equality and fairness, Ben Carson, playing the role of the dinner guest who interjects a random thought to the conversation when they aren\u2019t sleeping through it, called the idea socialism. In fact, Millennials think more positively about the abstract concept of socialism than they do of capitalism.\n\nAll of America laughed at the antics of the crazy prospective in-laws in \u201cMeet the Parents\u201d out of both a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and relief that at least their own family contretemps weren\u2019t as bad as the events portrayed in that movie. Laughter was also the only positive reaction the Republican debate engendered among Millennials. They were as relieved the debate was over as they were when their first meeting with their future in-laws ended, but they had an even clearer sense of just how out of touch this set of aspiring presidential candidates were with their concerns and ideas. Hopefully, some day in the future one or two of the participants will have the chance to lead the Republican Party to an understanding of the American future Millennials are destined to create. But for now, there is little hope that realization will come soon enough to provide a happy ending for the GOP in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the three hours of continuous political debate among the Republican presidential primary candidates last week, the GOP failed once again to engage the Millennial voters it will need to be successful in the 2016 general election.
