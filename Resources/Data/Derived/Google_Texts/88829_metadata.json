The Hispanic vote will be crucial to winning states like Florida, Nevada, Colorado or even Florida considering immigration reform will be a topic likely discussed in the upcoming debates. In 2008, Hispanics hugely supported Clinton over Obama. However, she needs to win over blacks and young, college educated white voters who heavily supported Obama in 2008 and 2012.\n\nClinton will likely discuss her role as a mother and grandmother to try to win over working class women. Expect her to emphasize that her experiences and record as a public official qualify her above other candidates to create a better future for Americans. Anticipate hearing from her on issues of income inequality and the struggling middle class. Also, expect to hear, not just from Clinton but from all the candidates, on issues of higher minimum wage, paid family medical leave, early childhood education and affordable child care. These issues are particularly important to women whose support Clinton will try to earn.

It\u2019s going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again. And I\u2019m ready to stand with you to lead the fight.\u201d He eventually gave full announcement of his candidacy at Liberty University, a private Christian college in Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nHis early Spring announcement will allow him, like Clinton, to take advantage of the full second fundraising quarter to accumulate the funding needed for the long presidential run.\n\nOn the issues:\n\nWants to repeal Affordable Care Act,\n\nAccording to a Facebook post, wants to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and called for a flat tax,\n\nDenies scientific evidence on climate change,\n\nSupports a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget,\n\nWants to repeal the Common Core education standards; a co-sponsor of the Local Control of Education Act, which will allow states to continue receiving federal grant funding regardless of their decision to participate in Common Core Standards,\n\nOpposes President Obama\u2019s deferred immigration program for young arrivals as well as a pathway to citizenship,\n\nOpposes same-sex marriage,\n\nSupports the interpretation that the Second Amendment allows an individual the right to keep and bear firearms,\n\nWants to repeal Dodd-Frank that originally tightens regulations of financial institutions\n\nWould use military action to battle Islamic State militants, if necessary,\n\nOpposes abortion even in cases of rape.\n\nPotential Advantages:\n\nAppeal to evangelical voters,\n\nRhetorical skills,\n\nBiographical appeal; Canadian Born-American whose father was Cuban,\n\nTea Party association,\n\nAble to rouse up the base of the Republican party,\n\nKnown for being a superior debater.\n\nPotential Disadvantages:\n\nCould be outspent by more well established candidates like Jeb Bush, though his recent fundraising from PACs of $31 million in one week following his announcement surprised experienced political reporters,\n\nElectability; his positions may alienate important constituents,\n\nKnown for being a provocateur as well as strident and uncompromising,\n\nMay struggle to appeal to independents and moderate Republicans,\n\nHelped orchestrated the 2013 government shutdown.\n\nRand Paul\n\nFreshmen Senator from Kentucky\n\nEducation: Baylor University and Duke University\n\nBaylor University and Duke University Occupation: Ophthalmologist\n\nThe Campaign Message\n\nWith the theme of \u201cStand with Rand; Defeat the Washington Machine,\u201d Paul became the second Republican senator to declare his candidacy for his party\u2019s nomination, promising supporters that he will do some major housecleaning in Washington if he gets elected president. Known for his libertarian views calling for reduced federal drug sentences, advocating for oversight on the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies, and calling for a more carefully planned approach to the use of military force. Paul is also known for being a maverick, criticizing Republicans as much as he does Democrats. Expect the campaign message to focus on three key areas: civil liberties, non-interventionist military and economic prosperity.\n\nPaul, the son of a former Texas Congressman and two-time presidential candidate, will likely have the advantage with his father\u2019s base of loyal supporters from the past two elections.\n\nPaul has large appeal to a wide variety of voters. College students are drawn to his views on reigning in domestic surveillance, and many are encourage by his advocating to ease drug-sentencing laws. Paul can rely on libertarian followers who supported his father in the prior two elections as well as the Tea Party enthusiasts to help in the primary. However, he needs to win one of the first four states in the nominating contests: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, in order to be considered a serious contender.\n\nOn the issues:\n\nCalls for a balanced budget amendment,\n\nSupports term limits for the house and the senate,\n\nWants to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\n\nSupports construction of Keystone XL pipeline,\n\nWants to reform the criminal justice system such as restoring the voting rights of every non-violent felon,\n\nBelieves Common Core to be a one-size-fits-all model and wants to abolish it,\n\nAgrees with Supreme Court ruling striking down the Defense of Marriage Act,\n\nAgreed with President Obama\u2019s plan to restore relations with Cuba and to lift the embargo,\n\nWants to reduce military aid to Israel.\n\nPotential Advantages:\n\nHas an ideology that is inclusive of a wide variety of people across the political spectrum that includes appeal to black minorities,\n\nHas strong libertarian followers and Tea Party support,\n\nHas support of loyal fans from his father,\n\nHolds adjunct occupation as a physician (most presidents were lawyers).\n\nPotential Disadvantages:\n\nHe\u2019s trying to appeal to too many different groups of people;\n\nHis views on defense spending and the use of military force could complicate his candidacy in a party generally described as hawkish;\n\nThe Republican establishment views him as an isolationist, though he has been trying to be more of an internationalist in recent weeks;\n\nIn his 2010 senate campaign, he said that private businesses should not be forced to obey anti-discrimination laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nFreshmen Senator from Florida\n\nEducation: University of Florida and University of Miami Law School\n\nUniversity of Florida and University of Miami Law School Occupation: Politician\n\nCampaign Message:\n\nSurrounded by his family and hundreds of cheering supporters, Florida Senator Marco Rubio officially made his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination by calling for \u201cA New American Century.\u201d The youngest candidate so far on the Republican side, at 43, Rubio says, \u201cToo many of our leaders and our ideas are struck in the 20th century,\u201d appealing to people eager for a generational change in leadership. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio\u2019s campaign will emphasize American greatness and the American dream. As a senator, Rubio\u2019s major initiative was on immigration reform. He was part of a bipartisan group of senators that drafted a comprehensive immigration bill that included a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already in the country.
