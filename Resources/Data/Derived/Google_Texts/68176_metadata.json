A few students on the football team were holding a registry drive at my alma mater, and I became intrigued. I knew it was nothing like donating blood, but other than that, I really didn\u2019t know what it meant to become a bone marrow donor at all. I heard it was painful, and I heard it wasn\u2019t the quickest recovery, but something about potentially becoming a donor forced me to learn more, no matter how scared I truly was.\n\nAs I read up more on bone marrow donation I found out that it was not nearly as intimidating as I had thought. Undergoing a relatively simple procedure could mean the difference between whether one person lives or dies; and even when it\u2019s not a matter of life or death; it can help someone\u2019s quality of life substantially. What I was giving wouldn\u2019t be a major loss to me; in fact bone marrow levels return to normal in a few weeks after donating. Patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or sickle cell anemia, just to mention a few, benefit immensely from transplants which 12,000 people a year need. It was when I learned this that the decision became a little bit easier.\n\nIf you are wondering what it is like to become a bone marrow donor, click \"View Slideshow\" above to get the step-by-step guide.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bone, marrow, donation, what, it, means, be, donor, and, why, you, should, consider, it", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "12,000 people are in need of a donor, and you could be the potential match.", "title": "A Step-By-Step Guide Of What It Means To Donate Bone Marrow [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bone-marrow-donation-what-it-means-be-donor-and-why-you-should-consider-it-338326", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/15/bones.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "12,000 people are in need of a donor, and you could be the potential match.", "title": "A Step-By-Step Guide Of What It Means To Donate Bone Marrow [SLIDESHOW]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bone-marrow-donation-what-it-means-be-donor-and-why-you-should-consider-it-338326", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/15/bones.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/15/bones.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-16T09:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-16T14:24:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "12,000 people are in need of a donor, and you could be the potential match."}, "article_summary": "Recently, I became a bone marrow donor and it was by no means an easy decision.\nIf you are wondering what it is like to become a bone marrow donor, click \"View Slideshow\" above to get the step-by-step guide.\nI knew it was nothing like donating blood, but other than that, I really didn\u2019t know what it meant to become a bone marrow donor at all.\nAs I read up more on bone marrow donation I found out that it was not nearly as intimidating as I had thought.\nWhat I was giving wouldn\u2019t be a major loss to me; in fact bone marrow levels return to normal in a few weeks after donating."}
