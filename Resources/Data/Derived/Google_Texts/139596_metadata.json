Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that President Barack Obama stops by your garage for a chat.\n\nBut that was comedian and podcast star Marc Maron\u2019s Friday, when Obama took a break from his fundraising tour through Los Angeles to visit Maron\u2019s garage in the city\u2019s Highland Park neighborhood and do an hour-long interview.\n\nMaron, in turn, described in an interview with the Wall Street Journal what it\u2019s like to sit down with the president\u2014in what he called his \u201cslowly dilapidating house,\u201d no less.\n\nThe White House approached Maron, the irreverent host of WTF, one of the top five podcasts on iTunes, months ago about the possibility of setting up an interview, he said. He was taken aback. \u201cI never thought I would talk to the president,\u201d he said. \u201cI never even thought to pursue that interview.\u201d\n\nThough Maron is the former host of a political radio show, his current podcast has a markedly different focus. He most often talks to members of the film industry\u2014he sat down with director Judd Apatow on Thursday\u2014or with fellow comedians, including a highly acclaimed episode with Louis C.K. in 2010. So when interviewing Obama became a reality, Maron had some catching up to do\u2014though not too much.\n\n\u201cIt did need to be the kind of interview that I do, so I tried not to overcompensate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I knew that in order to honor the office and to honor the conversation, I couldn\u2019t completely disregard it.\u201d\n\nThen came the house preparations. Mr. Maron had been surprised enough that Obama wanted to come on the show. But when the White House told him the interview would be held in his garage\u2014where he typically interviews subjects\u2014his response was quick: \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s crazy.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome immediate concerns came to mind. \u201cOh my god, I hope the bathroom\u2019s clean,\u201d he said in Thursday\u2019s podcast, as he announced his upcoming interview. \u201cI should probably clean my house a little. Prep the cats somehow.\u201d\n\nStarting on Sunday, Secret Service began making stops at the Maron house. Officers closed down roads around his neighborhood, positioned snipers on his neighbor\u2019s roof, and erected tents in his driveway. But far from grumbling at the inconvenience, his neighbors poured onto the streets to welcome Obama\u2019s arrival Friday. The result was a veritable carnival, complete with a clown and a juggler.\n\nPreparations complete, the interview began. Maron described the president as \u201cvery at ease \u2026 almost to the point where I\u2019m like, \u2018Is he really this at ease?\u2019\u201d He asked Obama whether he was nervous. The president\u2019s response: \u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama steps from Marine One in Pasadena, Calif., on Friday en route to tape a podcast interview with comedian Marc Maron. Associated Press\n\nTheir conversation covered a host of topics, Maron said, including Wednesday\u2019s shootings in Charleston, S.C., race, family, and Obama\u2019s goals for the rest of his presidency. The interview at times was \u201cvery candid\u201d and \u201ca little wonky,\u201d he said. Audio clips are expected to be released later Friday, and the interview will air on the podcast at 3 a.m. ET on Monday.\n\nIn the interview, Obama offered some hints as to why he was sitting down with Maron, who, despite running a popular podcast, is still a relatively obscure choice. \u201cAt some point during the conversation he said that he wanted to get people to engage in politics,\u201d Maron said. \u201cI think in his mind [he thought] that this would reach an intelligent group of people that may feel detached from the actual personal engagement in political action and interest in politics.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters Friday that sitting down with Maron allowed the president to \u201creally offer listeners the opportunity to have more insight into how he makes decisions\u201d and into \u201cwhat he\u2019s thinking about in terms of his family, his past, his future.\u201d\n\nFor Obama, an interview on WTF is his latest foray into the less conventional world of media outlets, in an effort by the White House to reach a younger, more diverse audience. In 2010, Obama became the first sitting president to appear on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Jon Stewart. Last year, when he sought to pitch the Affordable Care Act ahead of an enrollment deadline, he delivered a purposely awkward interview on \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d an online show hosted by comedian Zach Galifianakis. Earlier this year, he invited three viral YouTube stars to the White House to interview him after the State of the Union. And he used a \u201cselfie stick\u201d to plug another health-care signup deadline earlier this year, where he riffed on the popular \u201cThanks Obama\u201d Internet meme in a video for Buzzfeed.\n\nBut the interview with Maron did offer one first. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain this is the first time a president of the U.S. has been interviewed in a garage,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nMaron came away with a souvenir, too. \u201cThe President forgot his coffee,\u201d Maron posted on Instagram Friday, along with a picture of a to-go cup with the president\u2019s seal.\n\nHe has since learned more. \u201cTurns out it was tea,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack tea.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The president's appearance on the WTF podcast will go live early Monday.", "title": "Inside Comedian Marc Maron\u2019s Interview With President Obama", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/06/19/inside-comedian-marc-marons-interview-with-president-obama/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA122_maron_P_20150619172007.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Inside Comedian Marc Maron\u2019s Interview With President Obama", "description": "The president's appearance on the WTF podcast will go live early Monday.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Rebecca Ballhaus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "The president's appearance on the WTF podcast will go live early Monday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-19T21:36:39-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/06/19/inside-comedian-marc-marons-interview-with-president-obama/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-89519", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The president's appearance on the WTF podcast will go live early Monday.", "title": "Inside Comedian Marc Maron\u2019s Interview With President Obama", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/06/19/inside-comedian-marc-marons-interview-with-president-obama/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JA122_maron_P_20150619172007.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-89519", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-19T21:36:39-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The president\u2019s response: \u201cOf course not.\u201dPresident Barack Obama steps from Marine One in Pasadena, Calif., on Friday en route to tape a podcast interview with comedian Marc Maron.\nIn 2010, Obama became the first sitting president to appear on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Jon Stewart.\nEarlier this year, he invited three viral YouTube stars to the White House to interview him after the State of the Union.\nMarc Maron doing a standup routine in May.\nBut that was comedian and podcast star Marc Maron\u2019s Friday, when Obama took a break from his fundraising tour through Los Angeles to visit Maron\u2019s garage in the city\u2019s Highland Park neighborhood and do an hour-long interview."}
