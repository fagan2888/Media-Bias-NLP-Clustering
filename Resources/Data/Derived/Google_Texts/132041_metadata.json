The smell of gumbo, shrimp, and burgers filling the air.\n\nThe LSU Tigers' home opener against McNeese State has been cancelled after a rain delay that lasted over 3 hours.\n\nMichael Bonnette with LSU said the game will not be rescheduled, No other dates match up between the teams.\n\nThe game went into a weather delay with 10:08 left in the first quarter when lightning was detected several times in the area. The delay started around 6:50 p.m. and lasted until the game was cancelled around 10:30 p.m. It lasted over 3 hours and 30 minutes.\n\nLSU had first waited to start the game before the midnight cut off before finally cancelling it. Neither team had scored when the weather delay started.\n\nThe Tigers will play their SEC opener against Mississippi State in Starkville on Saturday, Sept. 12 at 8:15 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN.\n\nIf viewing this story on a mobile device, click here for additional features: http://shout.lt/bccFN\n\nCopyright 2015 WAFB.
