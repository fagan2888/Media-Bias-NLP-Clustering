Lobster Place, a bustling seafood shop in the center of New York\u2019s Chelsea Market, is a good place to start. The store\u2019s open display cases hold live sea urchins that respond to the touch; fat, juicy chunks of Hawaiian Wahoo; gigantic, whole tilefish that stare, glassy-eyed at the curious consumer; and other offerings that, were they not labeled, you\u2019d need a degree in marine biology to recognize.\n\nSome, like baby squid and octopi, razor clams, and fillets of specialty catch that retail for upward of $25 per pound, might intimidate the standard home chef in search of something to serve for dinner. This is intentional. Chelsea market draws tourists, upper-class gourmands and Food Network fans in search of weird fish that\u2019s hard to find anywhere else.\n\nOther offerings, though, are just \u2026 different. There\u2019s no reason to believe most of the fillets priced by the pound are less tasty or harder to cook than typical supermarket fare. Yet Davis Herron, Lobster Place\u2019s director, says standard fillets of salmon, tuna, cod and halibut are still the specialty market\u2019s biggest sellers.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the most endangered fish are also staples of the American diet. When we talk about overfishing, we\u2019re referring to individual species that consumers \u2014 and the market \u2013 latch on to, often to the exclusion of other options. As much as we extoll the virtue of seafood, our enthusiasm for those select few suggests, we\u2019re really not all that comfortable with it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fear of seafood,\u201d said Rick Moonen, a renowned seafood chef who was one of the first to advocate sustainable fishing. \u201cFor some reason, people get nervous.\u201d Fish are complicated, expensive and easy to overcook. They\u2019re laced with small, sharp bones ready to choke the incautious diner. They smell. The limited number of species we stick to aren\u2019t exceptions, but at least they\u2019re familiar. Yet by refusing to broaden our options, we\u2019re threatening to eat them out of existence.\n\n* * *\n\nCod has been an American favorite since the 17th century, when early American settlers found that the species packed the Atlantic Ocean seemingly as tightly as sardines in a can. Colonial fishermen in New England merely had to lower their baskets into the water and watch them fill up with fresh catch; 250,000 tons were caught annually off the coast of the U.S. and Canada right up until the 1950s, when large factory trawlers arrived.\n\nIn the half-century since, cod has become a poster fish for what happens when a species becomes too popular. We\u2019ve been eating the mild, flaky whitefish at such a rate that in the mid-\u201990s, the entire Atlantic population came close to commercial collapse. It\u2019s survived, so far, but barely: Just this year, the amount of cod that fisheries are legally allowed to harvest from the Gulf of Maine was cut by 80 percent. Fishermen who rely on the catch decried the regulations for their perceived harm to the industry; regulators, in turn, tried to explain that this is the last hope for there being any cod industry at all. As an NOAA administrator explained when the cuts were announced last January, \u201cIt\u2019s midnight and getting darker when it comes to how many cod there are.\u201d\n\nWhile that drama plays out in the Gulf of Maine, haddock swims by unperturbed. A mild, flaky whitefish, it swims the same waters as cod, and it\u2019s more abundant. Lobster Place displays fillets of both next to each other; when I visited, they cost the same per pound. To the extent that there\u2019s a difference, it\u2019s mainly the name, and in the fact that only one is being overfished. How come cod is one of the market\u2019s most popular fish, while the haddock, in Herron\u2019s experience, is more difficult to sell?\n\n\u201cNew York is a cod market,\u201d is his only explanation.\n\nLobster Place doesn\u2019t even bother selling another mild, flaky whitefish that is currently more plentiful than cod or haddock. The Atlantic spiny dogfish is caught off the shores of the eastern U.S., and in recent years, its population has exploded. In 2008, the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils, which regulate fishing in federal waters, had imposed a quota of 8 million pounds on the fish. By 2012, as the species replenished, they bumped that number up to 20 million, and fishery attained the Marine Stewardship Council\u2019s certification of sustainability. This year, the quota more than doubled, to just over 40 million. \u201cIt\u2019s a locally caught, wild fish that can be fished at sustainable levels,\u201d is the pitch that John F. Whiteside, Jr., an attorney who represents the Atlantic dogfish fishery, gave me.\n\nThe Atlantic dogfish is much more popular in Europe, where the British deep-fry it as an alternative to cod in fish and chips. Five months into the fishing year, only 25 percent of its quota has been met, meaning there\u2019s plenty to go around. But if you live in the United States and would like to try it \u2013 if you live, even, in New Bedford, Mass., where two of the three seafood processors that handle spiny dogfish are located \u2014 you can\u2019t buy it. All of the Atlantic catch is shipped abroad, because the U.S. just isn\u2019t a spiny dogfish market.\n\n\u201cCertain fish have a great name,\u201d Moonen said. Others don\u2019t It\u2019s as simple as this: most would hesitate before eating something called a Patagonian toothfish, but the same fish became an American sensation once a shrewd fishmonger rechristened it Chilean sea bass.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think we should give it a different name, but I\u2019m not convinced,\u201d Whiteside said about the spiny dogfish. After all, he points out, catfish does fine. And while attempts to give out free samples have resulted in more than a few confused 20-somethings thinking they were lining up for free beer, he insists that once people try it, the name ceases to matter.\n\nTo get people to take that first bite, it can help a fish to have someone with credible taste to vouch for it. Certain restaurants \u2013 Herron mentioned New York\u2019s Le Bernardin \u2014 have enough cachet that diners will try just about anything the chef puts on the menu. Herron, who supplies a number of restaurants, has been known to try and talk respected chefs into trying something different. With less esteemed establishments, though, he\u2019ll often run into the same problem that comes up with his own sales. Places don\u2019t want to stray from the familiar favorites, because they know they\u2019re what people want to order.\n\nRick Moonen is one those chefs interested in trying new fish, and with the prestige to back up his recommendations. He insists that he isn\u2019t trying to serve \u201ccreatures from the black lagoon\u201d at his Las Vegas restaurant, but nonetheless finds that anything deviating from the mainstream can be a tough sell. The key to getting at least some people to try something new, he said, is cross-marketing: few customers will look at a menu and be immediately grabbed by Petrale sole. But put a crabmeat crust on it, and \u201cyou\u2019ll sell the heck out of it.\u201d\n\nFor chef Peter Hoffman, a locavore celebrity in the New York restaurant scene, it all goes back to the fear of fish \u2013 and to our desire to see our seafood as anything but. People prefer chicken-like fillets, he said, which keeps us from being willing to try out small fish, like his favorite: the porgy. Getting the meat off the bones of small fish isn\u2019t worth the effort for fishermen, and people don\u2019t tend to buy whole. That\u2019s especially a shame, said Hoffman, because cooking whole fish is actually one of the easiest ways to do it. For less-experienced chefs, as he puts it, \u201cThe chances of culinary excellence are higher.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how they go about it, fish need great salesmen, because attempts to market them come with a small margin of error. Meat can stay refrigerated for weeks, but fish doesn\u2019t stay fresh for long. Catch reaches retailers days after it\u2019s harvested, said Herron, who then typically only have another day or two to get it into customers\u2019 hands. That doesn\u2019t leave the seller, ever-conscious of his profit margin, much time for cajoling someone into trying something new.\n\n* * *\n\nThe simplest way to make a fish catch on \u2013 that speaks much strongly to our unadventurous tendencies \u2014 is just to call it salmon. That may well be why spiny dogfish, called \u201crock salmon\u201d in England and \u201clittle salmon\u201d in France, works so well for Europe. The salmon trick seems to work for just about anything: When it appears on his menus, Moonan tells his staff to refer to Arctic char as \u201csalmon lite,\u201d and what he calls steelhead salmon is actually trout.\n\nRegardless of how salmon-y these alternatives are, we need them, because demand for the pink fish far outpaces what wild populations are able to supply. Customers who have learned to turn their noses up at farmed salmon, said Herron, have been known to insist upon purchasing the wild variety year-round, relying, when it\u2019s out of season, on wild cuts that, as he puts it, \u201ctaste like shit.\u201d\n\nOne of the best alternatives may be the barramundi. In the wild, barramundi can be found swimming in the waters of the Indo-West Pacific. A large fighter, it\u2019s a popular with recreational fishers armed with a line and rod. And unlike salmon, as Brian Walsh wrote in Time in 2011, the fish was born to be farmed.\n\nBarramundi was brought to American consumers via a single operation: Australis, an aquaculture facility located in Turner Falls, Mass. The clean, indoor tanks in which barramundi are raised pose no disease or escape risk. The fish itself evolved, in the wild, to thrive in tightly packed, stressful environments, and it subsists on a mostly vegetarian diet. High in omega-3s, it\u2019s increasingly recognized as a superfood, and it is, by common consensus, delicious.\n\nSmall, mild and easy to pan-sear, it too, Herron said, has trouble gaining traction among his customers \u2013 perhaps because wild barramundi has a reputation for tasting \u201cswampy.\u201d The farmed variety sold by Australis, though, is very clean. It\u2019s superior, for an eater, to the wild version. And from a sustainability perspective, it\u2019s a better choice than salmon, too.\n\nI would be loath to give up salmon completely, and I imagine many would agree. But there\u2019s a place for barramundi alongside the old favorite. Incorporating more of it onto menus and dinner tables would ease pressure on salmon populations, and it would also mean adding variety to our diets. As Hoffman put it, \u201cthere are so many flavors out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u201d seafood, after all, can mean many things: health, taste, price, availability and the impact eating it will have on larger systems all need to be taken into account. Some fish fit some categories better than others; few fit all. \u201cEverything we carry has some redeeming quality,\u201d Herron told me. The more we vary what we\u2019re willing to eat, the closer we can get to achieving a better balance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are plenty of (delicious) fish in the sea.
