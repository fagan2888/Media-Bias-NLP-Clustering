Whether it\u2019s worse than what we have now could be argued. We rather think because of its ability to enshrine and solidify the corporate domination of the health system, it\u2019s worse than what we have now. But whether it is somewhat better or a lot worse is immaterial. The health system isn\u2019t working in this country \u2014 fiscally, medically, socially, morally.\u201d\n\nYoung rejects the idea that President Obama should have compromised on single payer in the face of industry opposition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any sympathy for the idea that the president had to compromise because his opposition was strong,\u201d Young writes. \u201cWinning is not always winning the election. Winning is making a huge fight and then taking the fight to the people \u2014 re-electing people who are supporting your program and defeating those who aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYoung first met the young Barack Obama in the mid-1990s at social gatherings.\n\nAt the time, Obama was lecturing at the University of Chicago Law School and practicing law.\n\n\u201cWe did not become bosom buddies after a few of these social gatherings \u2014 I just viewed him as a nice, bright guy living in the neighborhood,\u201d Young says.\n\nWhen Obama ran for the Illinois Senate, Young supported him.\n\n\u201cI was happy with his views on health care,\u201d Young writes. \u201cHe recognized that major reform was necessary and indicated support for a single-payer approach. No blushing friend, I took every opportunity to solidify his position. While not an official adviser, I tried to influence him as much as I could. My colleagues and I sent him notes touting the advantages of single-payer and the form it might take and talked with him and his staff about it whenever I had the chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt I did influence him,\u201d Young said.\n\nWhen Obama ran for the Senate in 2003, Obama told the Illinois AFL-CIO:\n\n\u201cI happen to be a proponent of a single payer universal health care program. I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its Gross National Product on health care cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. And that\u2019s what Jim is talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out. A single payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. And that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we have to take back the White House, we have to take back the Senate, and we have to take back the House.\u201d\n\nBut just a year later, Obama had flipped and came out against single payer in Illinois.\n\n\u201cI was very disappointed by his move to the right to keep the insurance companies in command,\u201d Young told the Springfield State Journal Register in 2004. \u201cI\u2019m not accusing him of lying or misconduct. I\u2019m accusing him of a lack of courage.\u201d\n\nBut despite Obama\u2019s \u201clack of courage,\u201d Young supported Obama in his run for U.S. Senate and later for president. Young was just setting himself up for more disappointment.\n\nAt a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in August 2009, Obama was asked whether he supported a universal health care plan.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I want to make a distinction between a universal plan versus a single-payer plan, because those are two different things,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cA single-payer plan would be a plan like Medicare for all, or the kind of plan that they have in Canada, where basically government is the only person \u2014 is the only entity that pays for all health care. Everybody has a government-paid-for plan, even though in, depending on which country, the doctors are still private or the hospitals might still be private. In some countries, the doctors work for the government and the hospitals are owned by the government. But the point is, is that government pays for everything, like Medicare for all. That is a single-payer plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive. So what would end up happening would be, a lot of people who currently have employer-based health care would suddenly find themselves dropped, and they would have to go into an entirely new system that had not been fully set up yet. And I would be concerned about the potential destructiveness of that kind of transition.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right? So I\u2019m not promoting a single-payer plan,\u201d Obama said.\n\nIn March 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 by a narrow margin.\n\n\u201cPNHP\u2019s policy experts did a line-by-line examination of the bill and, while acknowledging that it contains some modest benefits that make changes around the edges of our existing system, basically gave it two thumbs down,\u201d Young writes. \u201cTo this day, much to the chagrin of many of our friends who wanted reform, I remain adamant in my rejection of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? We want a system that excludes the private insurance companies,\u201d Young writes. \u201c We demand such exclusion not because these companies are good or evil (although we think they\u2019re pretty evil). Rather, the reason to exclude them is that they don\u2019t address the needs of the American people.\u201d\n\nYoung also rejects the idea of a \u201cpublic option,\u201d pushed by Democrats such as Howard Dean. A public option \u201cwould not have made any significant difference on the overall impact\u201d of Obamacare \u201ccontrary to the view of many progressive who believed that it would,\u201d Young says.\n\n\u201cSince WWII, we have learned a lot about disease and certainly have had dramatic improvements in what we can do,\u201d Young writes. \u201cI\u2019m talking about surgery of the heart, vaccination, nutrition issues. All these things have been largely defined in the last half-century. We\u2019ve had something approaching a 12-year life expectancy rise just from scientific intervention.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have all this knowledge, all these options, but we have a very backward financing and delivery system and the result is a great deal of human suffering,\u201d Young says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we remain opposed to the Affordable Care Act. We think we have a winning proposition despite the reality in Congress. Polls repeatedly vindicate our position. A solid majority of the public and 59 percent of doctors support the single payer approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama could have made it happen,\u201d Young says. \u201cHe could have stuck to all the virtues of single payer. And I won\u2019t deny he may have been defeated in the first round. There\u2019s no question that this fight has been dirty and it\u2019s going to get dirtier.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.8.14", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A single payer health care plan, a universal health care plan.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any sympathy for the idea that the president had to compromise because his opposition was strong,\u201d Young writes.\n\u201cI was happy with his views on health care,\u201d Young writes.\n\u201cHad I been in Congress, I would have unequivocally voted against Obamacare,\u201d Young writes.\nWe rather think because of its ability to enshrine and solidify the corporate domination of the health system, it\u2019s worse than what we have now."}
