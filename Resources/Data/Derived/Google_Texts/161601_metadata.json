Smart Talk airs live every week day at 9 a.m. on WITF\u2019s 89.5 and 93.3. Listen to Smart Talk live online from 9-10 a.m. weekdays and at 7 p.m. (Repeat of 9 a.m. program) Host: Scott LaMar\n\nWhat to look for on Smart Talk Thursday, November 6, 2014:\n\nThe roll-out of the health insurance exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act last year was not without its problems.\n\nIn fact, the first few weeks were disastrous with website glitches and other issues, including confusion.\n\nImprovements were made and eventually 7.3 million people signed up for health insurance.\n\nIn many cases, so-called navigators helped Americans obtain insurance.\n\nThe open enrollment period for the second year of the health insurance marketplaces opens a week from Saturday -- November 15 -- and runs until February 15 of next year. Navigators will once again have a role to play.\n\nOn Thursday's Smart Talk, two organizations that help navigate the Marketplace will appear to explain what's new and different if anything and to answer questions about obtaining insurance.\n\nJoining us are Lynn Keltz, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Mental Health Consumers Association and Sue Walther, Executive Director, Mental Health Association in Pennsylvania. If you have questions about navigating the health insurance marketplace call 1-855-274-5626 (toll free) to make an appointments or speak with a navigator.\n\nListeners may also wish to consult the Getting Covered Guide on Transforming Health, which is a multimedia project of WITF that focuses on health care changes in America. The Getting Covered Guide contains the latest information on the Affordable Care Act and Healthy Pennsylvania.\n\nClick on the image to access the Getting Covered Guide\n\nAlso, exit polls during Tuesday's election showed many voters who supported Democrat Tom Wolf over incumbent Gov. Tom Corbett cited education and funding for schools as their main concerns.\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Education Association -- the state's largest teacher's union -- has expressed satisfaction that education was so important to voters. PSEA President Mike Crossey appears on Smart Talk to discuss the election.", "article_metadata": {"date": "Nov  5, 2014", "description": "Thursday's Smart Talk provides an introduction to year two of the health insurance marketplace and looks at PSEA's take on Tuesday's election.", "copyright": "WITF,Inc.", "url": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/2014/11/smart-talk-year-2-of-insurance-marketplace-psea-says-education-important-to-voters.php", "twitter": {"description": "Thursday's Smart Talk provides an introduction to year two of the health insurance marketplace and looks at PSEA's take on Tuesday's election.", "title": "Smart Talk: Year 2 of insurance marketplace; PSEA says education important to voters", "image": {"src": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/assets_c/2014/11/health%20insurance%20file%20held%20by%20woman%20600%20x%20340-thumb-600x340-17831.jpg"}, "creator": "@witfnews", "site": "@witfnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "a0ab0edf38b22322d1aeb144003b161c"}, "keywords": "lynn keltz, mental health association in pennsylvania, mike crossey, pennsylvania mental health consumers association, psea, sue walther, transforming health", "article": {"section": "Smart Talk", "published_time": "2014-11-05T16:14:25-5:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T10:09:38-5:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "witf.org", "description": "Thursday's Smart Talk provides an introduction to year two of the health insurance marketplace and looks at PSEA's take on Tuesday's election.", "title": "Smart Talk: Year 2 of insurance marketplace; PSEA says education important to voters", "url": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/2014/11/smart-talk-year-2-of-insurance-marketplace-psea-says-education-important-to-voters.php", "image": "http://www.witf.org/smart-talk/assets_c/2014/11/health%20insurance%20file%20held%20by%20woman%20600%20x%20340-thumb-600x340-17831.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "lynn keltz, mental health association in pennsylvania, mike crossey, pennsylvania mental health consumers association, psea, sue walther, transforming health"}, "article_summary": "PSEA President Mike Crossey appears on Smart Talk to discuss the election.\nThe Pennsylvania State Education Association -- the state's largest teacher's union -- has expressed satisfaction that education was so important to voters.\nIf you have questions about navigating the health insurance marketplace call 1-855-274-5626 (toll free) to make an appointments or speak with a navigator.\nSmart Talk airs live every week day at 9 a.m. on WITF\u2019s 89.5 and 93.3.\nOn Thursday's Smart Talk, two organizations that help navigate the Marketplace will appear to explain what's new and different if anything and to answer questions about obtaining insurance."}
