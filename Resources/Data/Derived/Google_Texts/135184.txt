BJ Cavnor, Executive Director of One in Four Chronic Health, joins State of Reform to talk about his concerns regarding the rising cost of medical treatment and its impact to consumer. He believes that policy makers need to better understand how costs—whether in prescription copays or specialist visits—are creating barriers to care. One federal policy piece that Cavnor is tracking closely is the anti-discrimination provisions written into the Affordable Care Act which are set to sunset in 2017.

“Our concern is that patients are not once again being discriminated against as they were before the ACA on the basis of condition or the cost of the care of that condition,” said Cavnor.

One in Four Health is a non-profit health care collaborative which advocates for patients with chronic health conditions in Oregon and Washington state.
