This is the first time that research has proven that the loss of tau protein function precedes the formation of beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Dr. Charbel Moussa, professor of neuroscience at Georgetown University Medical Center, and colleagues made the discovery.\n\nPhoto by Taylor Hill/Getty Images\n\nPreviously researchers thought that the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques signaled the onset of nerve destruction from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There have been numerous reports of people that had an accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques but no memory malfunction. The researchers proved that tau protein malfunction and eventual loss of function precede the formation of beta-amyloid plaques.\n\nCell death is the result of the accumulation of nonfunctional tau protein and beta-amyloid plaques in the nerve cells. The introduction of functional tau protein into nerve cells that had a loss of tau protein restored the normal nerve function. The discovery explains why some people can have beta-amyloid plaques and suffer no memory loss or nerve damage.\n\nA cancer drug called nilotinib was found to assist in the restoration of nerve function in cells that had some tau protein in them. If sufficient tau protein exists then the drug can reverse the effects of the previous loss of tau protein that is now confirmed to signal the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The researchers are in the process of testing the preventative potential of nilotinib in Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia, and Parkinson\u2019s disease.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study that identifies the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementia, and Parkinson\u2019s disease as the breakdown in function of the tau protein in nerve cells a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Examiner.com", "description": "As he struggles with Alzheimer&#039;s disease, country-music legend Glen Campbell embarks on his farewell tour in the U.S., Australia, and Europe.", "title": "New research points to tau protein malfunction as cause of Alzheimer\u2019s", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/39/6e/396e83b5aa44d79febd3dfb05578939c.jpg?itok=BFc_W5cx", "video": {"width": 480, "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 401}, "type": "movie"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study that identifies the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementia, and Parkinson\u2019s disease as the breakdown in function of the tau protein in nerve cells and shows that a drug that is presently a", "creator": "@PBHexam", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/39/6e/396e83b5aa44d79febd3dfb05578939c.jpg?itok=BFc_W5cx", "title": "New research points to tau protein malfunction as cause of Alzheimer\u2019s", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2014-11-02T04:09:20-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Science & Space, Alzheimers Disease, tau protein", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-02T04:09"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25bb\"", "article_summary": "The introduction of functional tau protein into nerve cells that had a loss of tau protein restored the normal nerve function.\nIf sufficient tau protein exists then the drug can reverse the effects of the previous loss of tau protein that is now confirmed to signal the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThis is the first time that research has proven that the loss of tau protein function precedes the formation of beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe researchers proved that tau protein malfunction and eventual loss of function precede the formation of beta-amyloid plaques.\nCell death is the result of the accumulation of nonfunctional tau protein and beta-amyloid plaques in the nerve cells."}
