Ferrari on Tuesday priced the shares in its initial public offering at the top end of a previously announced range, valuing the luxury car maker at $9.8 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which sold about 10% of Ferrari in the IPO, raised about $893 million in what is a victory for Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne. The shares sold for $52 a piece, according to the person familiar with the deal, compared with a previously announced range of $48 to $52. The stock is set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the symbol “RACE.”
