In 2011, Ash Carter \u2014 then the acquisition chief, now defense secretary \u2014 warned that the Pentagon would not support mergers among the biggest companies.\n\n\u201cWhat I said then, and still believe, is that it was important to avoid excessive consolidation in the defense industry, to the point where we did not have multiple vendors who could compete with one another on many programs,\u201d Carter told reporters Wednesday at the Pentagon.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon\u2019s New Bomber Faces a Potentially Costly Delay\n\nMergers of top-tier firms would not be good \u201cfor the taxpayer and warfighter in the long run,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe do need a competitive marketplace, to the extent that\u2019s possible within the defense industry.\u201d\n\nKendall called the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal the most significant change to the defense industry since the general consolidation that followed the Cold War. It is, at least, the largest of 2015. Earlier this year, radio-maker Harris acquired Exelis for $4.5 billion and rocket-makers Orbital and ATK merged to form a $4.5 billion company.\n\nDespite their concerns, the Defense Department leaders did not ask the Justice Department, which reviews such deals for antitrust concerns, to block the acquisition. The world\u2019s largest defense company by revenue, Lockheed is the lead contractor on the $400-billion-plus F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. But it does not build helicopters, which are Sikorsky\u2019s specialty, and so the Justice Department approved the deal last week.\n\n\u201cLockheed is not a helicopter manufacturer; that was at the heart of the Department of Justice determination,\u201d Kendall said.\n\nRelated: U.S. Defense Industry Outperforms S&P by 100 Percent\n\nKendall said the Pentagon would continue to work with the Justice Department to make sure company mergers do not limit direct competition. Already, much of the competition for major projects, such as planes and vehicles, is limited to a handful of companies, at most.\n\n\u201cIf the trend to smaller and smaller numbers of weapon system prime contractors continues, one can foresee a future in which the Department has at most two or three very large suppliers for all the major weapons systems that we acquire,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cThe Department would not consider this to be a positive development and the American public should not either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith size comes power, and the department\u2019s experience with large defense contractors is that they are not hesitant to use this power for corporate advantage,\u201d Kendall said.\n\n\u201cThe trend toward fewer and larger prime contractors has the potential to affect innovation, limit the supply base, pose entry barriers to small, medium and large businesses, and ultimately reduce competition \u2014 resulting in higher prices to be paid by the American taxpayer in order to support our warfighters,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Lockheed disputes Pentagon worries about larger defense contractors\n\nLockheed Martin pushed back against Kendall\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cWe understand and respect the department\u2019s concern about maintaining a proper balance between an efficient and competitive industrial base,\u201d Lockheed said in a written statement provided by a company spokeswoman. \u201cHowever, we believe that defense contractors should continue to be assessed based on the performance and effectiveness of the products and solutions offered, not on the size of their company.\u201d\n\nKendall is pushing for policy and legal changes to \u201cpreserve the diversity and spirit of innovation that have been central to the health and strength of our unique, strategic defense industrial base, particularly at the prime contractor level.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.\n\nRead more from DefenseOne:\n\nMeet the Man Reinventing CIA for the Big Data Era\n\nChina\u2019s Copycat Jet Raises Questions About F-35\n\nU.S., Russia Discussing Deconfliction in Syria \u2014 One Day After Russian Strikes Begin", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Pentagon\u2019s top arms buyer worries that\u00a0Lockheed Martin\u2019s upcoming", "title": "Pentagon Worried About Defense Contractor Monopolies", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/03/Pentagon-Worried-About-Defense-Contractor-Monopolies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-09-14T195107Z_1_CBRE88D1J5C00_RTROPTP_2_US-PENTAGON.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/03/Pentagon-Worried-About-Defense-Contractor-Monopolies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-09-14T195107Z_1_CBRE88D1J5C00_RTROPTP_2_US-PENTAGON.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Pentagon\u2019s top arms buyer worries that\u00a0Lockheed Martin\u2019s upcoming", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98c0\"", "article_summary": "Despite their concerns, the Defense Department leaders did not ask the Justice Department, which reviews such deals for antitrust concerns, to block the acquisition.\n\u201cThe Department of Defense is concerned about the continuing march toward greater consolidation in the defense industry at the prime contractor level.\u201dPentagon leaders have been expecting an uptick in industry mergers for several years.\nBut it does not build helicopters, which are Sikorsky\u2019s specialty, and so the Justice Department approved the deal last week.\n\u201cWe do need a competitive marketplace, to the extent that\u2019s possible within the defense industry.\u201dKendall called the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal the most significant change to the defense industry since the general consolidation that followed the Cold War.\nRelated: U.S. Defense Industry Outperforms S&P by 100 PercentKendall said the Pentagon would continue to work with the Justice Department to make sure company mergers do not limit direct competition."}
