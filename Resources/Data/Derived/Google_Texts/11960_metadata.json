Mark Warner in Virginia. By hammering his opponent on his unwavering support for President Obama\u2019s key policies \u2014 which the president declared \u201care on the ballot\u201d \u2014 and offering his own specific proposals, Gillespie has closed the race to 10 points. Without the independent on the ballot, that gap narrows to one point. This week Gillespie rolled out an Obamacare alternative plan that \u201cwould reduce insurance premiums, enhance access to doctors, and increase the number of people with private insurance by 6 million more than Obamacare will. Gillespie\u2019s plan would give a tax credit to everyone who buys health insurance in the individual market.\u201d (He also has rolled out an economic recovery plan and lambasted Warner for supporting sequestration that has led to huge cuts in defense.)\n\nSen. Mark Warner. (Bob Brown/Associated Press)\n\nThen things got very interesting when Warner was implicated in a scandal. The Post reported: \u201cThe son of a former Virginia state senator has told federal investigators that U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner discussed the possibility of several jobs, including a federal judgeship, for the senator\u2019s daughter in an effort to dissuade him from quitting the evenly divided state Senate.\u201d Gillespie told Right Turn, \u201cThe report that Sen. Warner may have suggested a federal judgeship or other job in relation to a political decision is deeply troubling. We all need more answers on this matter, and he owes Virginians a full explanation of his actions\u201d\n\nAt issue is whether the state senator was bribed by one side or the other in his decision to resign and thereby switch control of the state senate to Republicans. Warner\u2019s response was less than a full-throated denial: \u201cWarner spokesman acknowledged Friday that the conversation occurred, but he emphasized that the senator had made no explicit job offer.\u201d Not explicit but perhaps an obvious effort to induce her father not to resign his seat. (\u201cWarner was part of a string of high-powered Virginia Democrats who in early June pressed then-state senator Phillip P. Puckett not to go through with plans to give up his seat in the middle of a bitterly partisan battle over health care.\u201d)\n\nIn fact, Warner was a virtual career guidance counselor for the senator\u2019s daughter: \u201cOn June 6, three days before the state senator\u2019s resignation became official, Warner called Puckett\u2019s son, Joseph, and discussed an appointment to the federal bench as well as a potential corporate position for Martha Puckett Ketron, according to Joseph Puckett\u2019s attorney, Charles E. \u2018Chuck\u2019 James Jr. of Williams Mullen.\u201d This occurs in a state where a former governor, Robert McDonnell, was convicted on multiple felony counts for merely making phone calls and setting up meetings (deemed to be \u201cofficial acts\u201d) to benefit a donor and friend of his wife. Simply being \u201chelpful\u201d is no excuse and, as we learned in the McDonnell trial, there does not need to be an explicit (there\u2019s that word again) quid pro quo. The evidence of an attempt to sway the senator via help for his daughter is intriguing:\n\n\u201cSenator Warner was not in a position to offer, and never did offer, any job to Mrs. Ketron, Warner spokesman Kevin Hall said. \u201cWhen he spoke to Senator Puckett the following day, it was clear that he had made up his mind and had already drafted his letter of resignation.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Talked to Warner for an hour last night,\u2019 Joseph Puckett wrote in the message, read to The Washington Post by two people close to the matter. He went on to report, \u2018He had no answer for how Democrats could deliver for Martha except for a potential corporate gig of some kind, which is not what she wants.'\u201d\n\nIn other words, Warner was trying to persuade young Puckett but could not prove he could make the jobs all happen. (McDonnell wasn\u2019t able to deliver either, but that didn\u2019t matter to the jury.) Warner was not seeking pecuniary benefit for himself, but he was seeking something for his party. What might have seemed like political backscratching a year ago, in light of McDonnell, takes on the aura of something more sinister. Imagine if Puckett decided not to resign his seat because he understood Warner would use his office to give his kids extra help that no other Virginian would be getting. A potential headline \u2014 \u201cWarner keeps Puckett in line and Puckett kids employed\u201d \u2014 would have been damning.\n\nTo be clear, Warner has not been charged with anything. But involvement in a scheme under investigation by the feds is not going to help him keep his state. He has been laying low and essentially relying on name recognition and past popularity to slide through. If nothing else, the scandal may put him under the spotlight at a time anti-incumbent fervor is running high. Look for Gillespie to narrow the race even further.\n\nWhether Warner winds up in legal hot water remains to be seen, but for voters rocked by a trial detailing favoritism, greed and manipulation, this incident will put Warner, a once popular governor, in a different light and emphasize Gillespie\u2019s charge that Warner has become a captive of D.C. sleazy politics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
