Mark Gilliam of the Topsham Police Department said later that day. The woman couldn\u2019t free her dog and called for help.\n\n\u201cShe panicked, saying the dog was trapped,\u201d he said.\n\nCrew members from the Topsham Fire Department arrived first with an ATV and were able to help her free her dog from the coyote trap, Gilliam said. The trap does not have teeth, but instead is designed to fold up and catch the leg of an animal and prevent it from retreating or pulling away.\n\n\u201cIt holds the animal until the trapper comes along and euthanizes the animal,\u201d he said.\n\nThis particular trap was set by a trapper yesterday and since has been relocated to another area, according to Gilliam. Early coyote trapping season began on Oct. 20 and ended over the weekend. The statewide trapping season began Nov. 3 and runs until Dec. 31. Trappers are required to check their traps every day.\n\n\u201cI got the trap and turned it over to the Maine Warden Service,\u201d Gilliam said. \u201cThe trapper was more than cooperative. It\u2019s one of those unfortunate instances where dog and trap meet.\u201d\n\nAn 84-year-old bird hunter had to shoot and kill his dog in October in York County after it got stuck in a trap set in rural Newfield.
