Today in Obama:

Big Deal: At a White House early-education summit, President Barack Obama formally announced a $1 billion package of investments in early-childhood education, including $55 million from Disney Corp. The president also unveiled a celebrity-driven campaign to get more corporate investment in the program.

Big Elf: Obama and first lady Michelle Obama also stopped by the Marine Corps’ annual Toys For Tots holiday toy drive at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, delivering a couple of bundles of cheer. He helped volunteers sort toys while touting the drive as an opportunity to give back.

Today in Torture:

No Defense: It was a tough day for White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, who spent the daily briefing fielding all manner of questions on the Senate torture report, but also defending CIA Director John Brennan – a top Agency official when the “enhanced interrogation techniques” were developed and used – without really defending him.

No Excuse: The fact that Brennan hasn’t been sacked – and that Obama has pretty much ruled out prosecuting anybody for the human rights abuses detailed in the report – didn’t sit well with Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, a Democrat who had been a White House ally. In a floor speech Wednesday, Udall blasted Brennan and said the White House has shown “no moral leadership” on the issue.

No Surprise: Then again, it’s not like anyone in the public wants him to: the New York Times, citing recent Associated Press polls, reports that when it comes to preventing or revealing terrorist activities, 50 percent of respondents are OK with using torture to make them safe.

Drawn Conclusion:
