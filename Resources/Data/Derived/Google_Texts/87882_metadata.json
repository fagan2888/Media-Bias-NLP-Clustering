Back and forth.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Aaron Murray and LSU\u2019s Zach Mettenberger, friends, former teammates and once competitors for the same starting job, traded touchdown passes like jabs and uppercuts with neither team going away.\n\n\u201cLike a heavyweight fight between quarterbacks,\u201d Georgia tight end Arthur Lynch said.\n\nThey made the secondaries they threw against oftentimes look helpless and left fans, players and coaches from both teams wondering how a top-10 tilt would finish Saturday.\n\nWhen it came down to the end, Mettenberger\u2019s career-high passing day was topped by what just might be the most important throw in Murray\u2019s Georgia career.\n\nHis 25-yard touchdown pass to Justin Scott-Wesley with 1:47 to go put Georgia ahead for good as the No. 9 Bulldogs survived with a 44-41 victory over No. 6 LSU at Sanford Stadium.\n\nOK, now breathe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to pass out,\u201d said Georgia offensive coordinator Mike Bobo, who recruited both quarterbacks to Georgia. \u201cWhat a game, what a game. These kids kept believing and kept playing hard.\u201d\n\nMettenberger, the former Oconee County standout, headed off the field with his head down after Georgia\u2019s defense held. When the game ended, Murray threw the ball high in the air.\n\nThe most demanding stretch any team in college football has played so far this season \u2014 going up against three top-10 teams in the first four games \u2014 is now behind Georgia (3-1, 2-0 SEC), which remains in the national title chase and as the SEC East frontrunner.\n\n\u201cWe feel great right now, we feel like we\u2019re in a great position,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a long season to go. We\u2019ve got to keep winning.\u201d\n\nGeorgia rose up from its season-opening three-point loss against Clemson, to win against South Carolina and now LSU with the pressure on knowing a loss would end their ultimate goal.\n\n\u201cWe talked about that after the game, even during the game, we had to win that game if we wanted to get to Pasadena (for the BCS title game),\u201d said receiver Michael Bennett, who had a pair of touchdown catches.\n\nMurray jumped into the arms of offensive lineman Dallas Lee after his game-winning touchdown throw. Murray, Mettenberger and Lee were roommates after enrolling early in 2009, but Mettenberger was dismissed in 2010 after a spring break arrest outside a bar near Valdosta and plead guilty weeks later to two counts of misdemeanor sexual battery.\n\nWhen the game was over, an emotional Mark Richt got teary-eyed during his postgame interview on the field with CBS.\n\n\u201cJust so thankful,\u201d the Georgia coach said.\n\nLater in his postgame news conference, Richt said: \u201cCertainly the game itself and the emotion of the game and the drama of the game was part of it, but there\u2019s some other things that go on sometimes in life that not everybody knows about. I\u2019m not going to get into it, but they lifted me up. I told them at the end of the game in the locker room that they lifted me up and I needed it.\u201d\n\nMurray lifted Georgia to a victory on a day its defense gave up 449 yards and stopped LSU on third down on only five of 15 chances.\n\nThe fifth-year senior completed 20 of 34 passes for 298 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. He also rushed for a touchdown.\n\nMettenberger returned home to throw for a career-high 372 yards and three touchdowns while completing 23 of 37 passes. Richt said he gave Mettenberger a hug after the game and told him the same thing he told Murray \u2014 he was proud of him.\n\n\u201cIt was really a great performance by both quarterbacks, it was unreal\u201d Bobo said. \u201cI ain\u2019t ever seen a performance like that, just two quarterbacks like that in my time here at Georgia.\u201d\n\nLSU (4-1, 1-1) overcame an early deficit to lead 14-7 in the first quarter, but didn\u2019t lead again until 41-37 with 4:14 left on an 8-yard touchdown run from Jeremy Hill after Mettenberger directed an 8-play, 75-yard drive.\n\n\u201cI was pacing,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI remember at one point I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not watching.\u2019 ... It was stressful.\u201d\n\nMurray answered with a 75-yard drive of his own in six plays, completing all four passes on the drive, including the scoring pass \u2014 called \u201c63 chipper\u201d \u2014 even when LSU switched to a Tampa 2 zone.\n\n\u201cWe had two verticals into the boundary and the safety didn\u2019t get over and I was wide open,\u201d Scott-Wesley said.\n\nA wide open Scott-Wesley hauled in the game-winning touchdown near the sideline at about the 3-yard line and went into the end zone for the score.\n\n\u201cI just thought he was very calm,\u201d Bobo said of Murray. \u201cEvery time I talked to him on the phone, he responded.\u201d\n\nGeorgia won despite losing star tailback Todd Gurley to an ankle injury in the first half.\n\nHis status for Saturday\u2019s game at Tennessee is uncertain.\n\nKeith Marshall rushed for 96 yards on 20 carries.\n\n\u201cI think everybody in the nation,\u201d Murray said, \u201cknows what Georgia football is about right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, College Sports, Sports, Marc Weiszer", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "Back and forth.
