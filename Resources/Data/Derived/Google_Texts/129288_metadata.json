Williamson\n\nOct. 21 \u2014 As of Oct. 1, hospitals are required to make lists of their charges for procedures and services public.\n\nThat move toward price transparency was supported by major hospital associations, according to comments representatives from both the Federation of American Hospitals and the American Hospital Association made to Bloomberg BNA.\n\nHowever, a former CMS official now representing a state hospital association said the price transparency requirement is vague, which he said makes it difficult for hospitals to comply with the rule.\n\nThe requirement was in the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) final rule issued Aug. 22.\n\nAccording to the IPPS final rule, the Affordable Care Act amended Section2718(e) of the Public Health Service Act to require each hospital in the country to establish and make public a list of the hospital's prices for procedures. In addition, the ACA required hospitals to update their price list annually. The rule took effect Oct. 1.\n\nFlexibility Appreciated\n\nJeff Micklos, FAH executive vice president and general counsel, told Bloomberg BNA Oct. 21 that his group appreciated that the CMS allowed hospitals to meet the price transparency requirement in a flexible manner.\n\nThe final rule said \u201chospitals are in the best position to determine the exact manner and method by which to make\u201d the price list public. The rule never specified if the price list has to be posted in a specific place, whether online or at a physical location.\n\nThe rule said hospital charges are often billed, in full, to uninsured patients who cannot benefit from discounts negotiated by insurance companies.\n\nAs such, Micklos said insurers are important to price transparency efforts. Insured patients should check with their insurer about prices for hospital procedures and treatments, he said.\n\nVague Standard\n\nHowever, Herb Kuhn, president and chief executive officer of the Missouri Hospital Association, said the price transparency requirement was \u201cvery general\u201d in an Oct. 21 e-mail to Bloomberg BNA.\n\nKuhn, who formerly was director of the CMS's Center for Medicare Management, said the general nature of the rule \u201cmakes it difficult for hospitals to know exactly how to meet it, other than CMS encouraging hospitals to engage in a consumer friendly manner to meet the standard.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Kuhn said, \u201c[W]e are encouraging hospitals to post their charges for common procedures or post the information on how individuals can obtain that information. Perhaps in the future CMS will issue some sub-regulatory guidance to provide more clarification.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Kuhn said his association is unaware of any penalties that apply should a hospital fail to comply with the new standard.\n\nThe Missouri Hospital Association is based in Jefferson City, Mo.\n\nAHA Comments\n\nIn an Oct. 21 statement e-mailed to Bloomberg BNA, AHA spokeswoman Carly Moore said, \u201cThe AHA has long supported the need to provide patients with health care price and quality information and has worked with stakeholders, including HFMA [Healthcare Financial Management Association], to provide useful information that will help patients make health care decisions.\u201d\n\nThe AHA has developed tools and resources to assist member institutions make price information available to patients, Moore said.\n\nShe told BNA that \u201c[p]roviding understandable and useful information about the price of hospital care is one of the ways America's hospitals are working to improve the health of their communities.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michael D.
