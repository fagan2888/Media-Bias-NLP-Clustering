That said, the rationale that would put a woman who cited physical abuse in a cab back to her alleged abuser is \u201cterrible,\u201d according to one expert.\n\nAccording to California state law, a person can be denied release from the hospital if they\u2019re a danger to themselves or others, or are too mentally unstable to look after themselves.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "\"What kind of hospital releases a 60-year-old woman...\"", "published_at": "2016-03-05T09:10:16+00:00", "author": "Britt D.B.", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"What kind of hospital releases a 60-year-old woman...\"", "title": "The Hospital Sent an Abused Woman Back Home in a Taxi\u2014Her 'Solution' Was Devastating", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chowdhury-feature.jpeg", "height": 330}, "updated_time": "2016-03-05T12:40:51-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2016/03/552740-the-hospital-sent-an-abused-woman-back-home-in-a-taxi-her-solution-was-devastating/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"What kind of hospital releases a 60-year-old woman...\"", "creator": "@injo", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chowdhury-feature.jpeg", "title": "CA Hospital Sent Abused Woman Back Home in Taxi", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "post_id": 552740, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-05T09:10:16-04:00", "wp-categories": 482, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "tags": "Nation", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2016/03/552740-the-hospital-sent-an-abused-woman-back-home-in-a-taxi-her-solution-was-devastating/", "wp-category-slugs": "nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Nation", "published_time": "2016-03-05T09:10:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T12:40:51-04:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chowdhury-feature.jpeg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "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Last spring, Afroza Chowdhury told the police that her living conditions were unsafe and her ex-husband continually threatened her life.\nIn the medical records obtained, Chowdhury told doctors that she wasn\u2019t suicidal.\nAfter the evaluation, hospital staff put Chowdhury in a taxi cab bound for the one place she\u2019d explicitly said she couldn\u2019t bear to go\u2014back home to her husband.\nAccording to California state law, a person can be denied release from the hospital if they\u2019re a danger to themselves or others, or are too mentally unstable to look after themselves.\nAccording to the Mercury News, the instance is raising questions about county hospitals\u2019 practice of sending home patients in cabs who are mentally unstable, and who could be a possible a threat to themselves or others."}
