Taylor Lorenz/Twitter\n\nIt seems America just can\u2019t get enough of all things fall, including the season\u2019s ubiquitous flavor \u2014 pumpkin spice \u2014 as the nation\u2019s favorite cookie gets a flavor makeover. The folks at Nabisco made sure to make their own pumpkin spice mark this fall with the limited edition release of Pumpkin Spice Oreos on Sept. 24, a day after autumn starts. Originally starting as a rumor in August, and now becoming a tasty reality with various media outlets taste testing this sweet treat, can America\u2019s favorite cookie give Starbucks' iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) a run for its money?\n\nI had a chance to try one Pumpkin Spice Oreo today. Amazing. @NoshShow @junkfoodguy @theimpulsivebuy pic.twitter.com/Ce0k8mfTih \u2014 CT from Nerd Lunch (@nerdlunch) July 21, 2014\n\nEditors at The Huffington Post were among the chosen ones to receive a sample of these cookies in the mail. Hesitant but also curious to taste the reinvention, editors immediately gave their reactions upon opening the package of goods. \"Smells like a candle!\" said one editor. The cinnamon scent was comparable to the smells of Yankee Candle stores. Another editor said: \"The smell was way stronger than the taste. It's not too sweet, and the pumpkin flavors are mild, not overpowering at all.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail also got to do some taste testing of themselves with these pumpkin spice treats, with some reporters choosing the cookie over Starbucks \u201cfall in a cup.\u201d \u201cI want to marry them. I\u2019d much rather eat a handful of these than get a pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks,\" said a reporter.\n\nThe cookie wasn\u2019t well received by all, though. Another reporter noted, \u201cThe color of the pumpkin spice filling is terrifying. I guess if they\u2019re going for a Halloween vibe it fits. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of pumpkin anything, so the flavor was not my favorite.\u201d\n\nIntroducing Pumpkin Spice OREOs http://t.co/zilQT6meTN pic.twitter.com/CGBJ4AM8V4 \u2014 Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) September 9, 2014\n\nPerhaps the \u201cgolden\u201d vanilla cookies with a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg may not be as well received as the original pumpkin spice pioneer, the PSL, but the overall consensus is it\u2019s worthy of your taste buds. Also, they\u2019re real, unlike the release of Durex\u2019s \u201cpumpkin spice\u201d condom.
