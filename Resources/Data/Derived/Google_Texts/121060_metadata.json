On Friday, Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo broke with federal guidelines to impose a 21-day quarantine on any West African traveler who had encountered Ebola workers - no matter what their health upon arrival.\n\nHickox was given the standard medical screening at Newark Liberty International Airport, and had no fever. But given her travel history, she was taken to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quarantine station at the airport, where she said she was held for several hours.\n\nAfter a non-contact temperature registered a fever, she was transferred to University Hospital. Once there, she said doctors took her temperature with a conventional thermometer and she had no fever.\n\n\"Hospital personnel are keeping her in isolation and have not informed her of any next steps, including additional blood tests to confirm Ebola infection with certainty,\" said Delaunay, of Doctors Without Borders.\n\n\"She has been issued with an order of quarantine, which does not clearly indicate how long she must remain in isolation. While she is being provided with food and water, the tent is not heated and she is dressed in uncomfortable paper scrubs. She was permitted to bring personal belongings into the tent,\" Delaunay said.\n\n\n\n\"Doctors Without Borders is very concerned about the conditions and uncertainty she is facing and is attempting to obtain information from hospital officials,\" she added.\n\nKathleen O'Brien may be reached at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com, or at (732) 902-4557.
