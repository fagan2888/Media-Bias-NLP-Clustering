Directors and writers have been known to use this ruse to keep from getting in trouble with their unions when working on such nonunion shows as ABC\u2019s The Bachelor and The Bachelorette and Bravo\u2019s The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills. \u201cIt happens all the time, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said a veteran DGA director of reality shows. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for years. Even though the DGA\u2019s bylaws say they can\u2019t work nonunion, people can\u2019t afford not to work, so three things can happen: They can turn down the show; they can change their names and work under the radar in the hope they don\u2019t get caught, or they can go financial core.\u201d Members who opt for Fi-Core status essentially are dropping out of their unions.\n\nDeadline has found several instances \u2013 including a popular reality show on Starz \u2013 in which DGA members are working on nonunion shows under names that are different than the ones on their union membership cards. Sometimes the name change is as simple as adding or subtracting a middle initial; sometimes they work under their real last names but use nicknames instead of their real first names to avoid detection.\n\n\u201cThe DGA tracks all nonunion reality productions, investigates any situation in which a member is suspected of working on a non-guild-covered project and takes disciplinary action as appropriate,\u201d said DGA spokeswoman Sahar Moridani. \u201cIn no way do we allow members to work nonunion.\u201d\n\nThe Directors Guild\u2019s website states that \u201cDGA members may provide their professional services only to producers with current DGA signatory status.\u201d Its bylaws allow the guild to expel or fine members who work nonunion. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on non-DGA shows that used DGA people with \u2018bent\u2019 names,\u201d said a longtime writer-producer. \u201cThey\u2019ll turn James into Jim. It happens all the time because people have to eat. It\u2019s legion.\u201d\n\nThe DGA, which has signed some 950 shows to its Reality Television Agreements, has an ongoing campaign to organize nonunion reality shows and offers discounted terms to entice low-budget producers to sign its contract. \u201cThe DGA has done more to organize reality shows than any other union,\u201d said one well-known director.\n\nBut those efforts are undercut when its members work nonunion because doing so allows producers to use DGA talent without paying DGA rates. \u201cIf the guild catches people, they discipline them,\u201d said another veteran director.\n\nAnother common ruse directors use in an attempt to skirt DGA rules is to sign on with a nonunion show as a producer and still do the work of a director without taking the director\u2019s credit. \u201cThat\u2019s a much more common way they try to game the DGA,\u201d said a longtime reality show director. He said this is done on many reality shows, including CBS\u2019 Survivor, which claims that there are no directors employed on the show except for the in-studio portion that\u2019s shot at the very end of each season. \u201cI know for a fact that DGA directors have been employed on Survivor as directors but are given producer credits,\u201d he said. A director directs the cameras and the talent, and that\u2019s what many of these \u201cproducers\u201d on Survivor do, he said.\n\nDeadline has found other instances of this practice as well, including one in which a DGA member was not only working as a producer on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills but was doing so under a bent name to avoid detection.\n\nMany directors caught posing as producers of reality shows have been brought before the DGA\u2019s ethics committee in recent years. Typically, a source said, the director confesses, promises not to do it again and is fined the amount of money he or she earned on the show. For first-time offenders, the bulk of the fine usually is suspended, with the guild reserving the right to reinstate the full amount of the fine if the director is caught doing it again.\n\nThe WGA also prohibits its members from working on nonunion shows. The guild\u2019s Working Rule #8 states, \u201cNo member shall accept employment with, nor option or sell literary material to, any person, firm or corporation who is not signatory to the applicable minimum basic agreements.\u201d\n\nDeadline, however, has found several shows, including The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, on which WGA members have also worked under bent names to avoid being disciplined by their guild. Deadline also has found instances of WGA members working under their real names on nonunion shows such as The Real Housewives Of Orange County.\n\nThe WGA declined comment.\n\n\u201cReality television was born out of a nonunion, and even an antiunion, environment,\u201d said a longtime reality show writer-director. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality that the unions are up against.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Deadline", "twitter": {"image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/dgalogo.jpg", "title": "DGA & WGA Members Use Fake Names To Work Nonunion Reality Shows", "description": "DGA and WGA members use fake names to work on nonunion reality shows", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Deadline"}, "published_at": "2014-06-18 13:25:21", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://deadline.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0d8531262d92570876b84bba1cbad7f7?s=16", "news_keywords": "DGA, WGA", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "DGA & WGA Members Use Fake Names To Work Nonunion Reality Shows", "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/dgalogo.jpg?w=300", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613", "comment_count": 19, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "topics": "TV", "body": "EXCLUSIVE: It\u2019s one of the little-known realities of reality TV: DGA and WGA members sometimes use fake onscreen names so they can work on nonunion reality shows without getting busted by their unions.
