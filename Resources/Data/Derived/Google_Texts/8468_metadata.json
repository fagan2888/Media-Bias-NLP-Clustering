Heavy air strikes have also been reported north of Homs.\n\nSenior opposition figures who have asked not to be quoted have said pressure is growing for a speedy decision to leave talks being convened by U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura in Geneva, with no sign of progress towards discussion of a political transition sought by President Bashar al-Assad's opponents.\n\nThe statement announced the \"formation of a joint operations room to begin the battle... in response to violations by the army of Assad.\" It gave no geographic location for the new battle.\n\nSenior Syrian opposition negotiators on Sunday urged rebels to strike back against the Syrian army, accusing it of using a cessation of hostilities to gain ground, and cast doubt over whether they would continue Geneva peace talks indefinitely.\n\nThe cessation of hostilities agreement brokered by the United States and Russia came into effect on Feb. 27 with the aim of allowing peace talks to get underway.
