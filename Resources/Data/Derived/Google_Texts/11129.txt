Friday marks the 23rd anniversary of the Family Medical Leave Act. The federal law signed by then-President Bill Clinton required covered employers provide their workers with job-protected, unpaid leave for qualified medical reasons.

Allan Freyer, director of the NC Justice Center’s Workers’ Rights Project, says while the 1993 law provided important protections for workers, improvements should be made.

According to Freyer, Congress is currently debating the Family And Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act (H.R. 1439/S. 786) that could provide workers with family medical leave insurance. In exchange for a small premium of less than $5 a week, workers would receive a meaningful portion of their incomes for up to 12 weeks while they take time off to welcome a newborn or adopted child or provide care for family members suffering from serious health conditions.

Polling conducted in August by Public Policy Polling found 62 percent of North Carolinians surveyed support guaranteeing paid medical leave.
