Subsection 4(c) states that the existing HHS mandate regulations on the exemption and the accommodation \u201cshall apply with respect to\u201d section 4.

(If the bill were instead intended to preserve the exemption and the accommodation against regulatory abolition, it would be a fairly simple matter to say so clearly.)\n\nUnder the bill, if the exemption and the accommodation were abolished, religious entities would be subject to the HHS mandate under subsection 4(a) and would have no RFRA protections against it.\n\nI\u2019ll note that (as a reader called to my attention) the metadata to the one-pager that Senator Murray issued about the bill yesterday identified its author as Hillary Schneller of the National Women\u2019s Law Center.
