(AP) - The Connecticut Department of Children and Families is promising improvements to help prevent fatalities after a series of child deaths involving families who had contact with the agency.\n\nDCF is expanding its work with child abuse experts from Yale New Haven Hospital and Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center to improve how investigators, hospitals and primary care providers recognize abuse when a child suffers an injury. The experts are providing education and training and will be more routinely available to the department\u2019s care line, which receives reports of abuse and neglect, DCF announced this week.\n\n\u201cEvery child death is a terrible tragedy that the family will never forget or overcome,\u201d DCF Commissioner Joette Katz said. \u201cBut when a child dies in a family that the department was involved with, it causes a lot of soul searching and questions we ask ourselves about what we could have done differently and better. It\u2019s my hope that the actions we are taking today will prevent future tragedies.\u201d\n\nDCF said there were six child deaths involving allegations of maltreatment during the first five months of this year in a family with prior or current involvement with the agency. There were 10 such cases last year, six in 2012, seven in 2011, three each in 2010 and 2009, and seven in 2008, DCF said.\n\nThe Office of the Child Advocate said it was notified of the deaths of 11 children from families involved with DCF during the same period. Those children, mostly infants and toddlers, died from a variety of causes - not just from maltreatment - including a car accident, asphyxiation and possible unsafe sleeping conditions, the advocate\u2019s office said.\n\nOf the 11 cases, the child advocate has identified nine for further review.\n\n\u201cThe death of a child involved with DCF does not compel the conclusion that the death is the result of a systems failure or that more children should be removed from their homes when there are concerns of abuse or neglect,\u201d the advocate wrote in a report this month.\n\nChild fatalities in families with DCF involvement are routinely reviewed to identify lessons, including issues related to interactions with medical providers, schools, law enforcement and the courts, DCF said. The reviews have resulted in learning forums with about 400 DCF employees this year, the agency said.\n\nDCF says it\u2019s providing more training for its nurses to improve consultation with pediatricians regarding the identification of physical abuse when a child comes to their office with an injury. DCF is analyzing deaths of children 3 or younger to better understand the factors that correlate with these fatalities.\n\nDCF is starting a public awareness campaign this year to prevent infant deaths by educating parents on how to better keep them safe. In February, DCF announced that a review of child deaths in recent years showed that many were accidental and involved infants and toddlers in unsafe sleeping environments.\n\nConnecticut needs to strike the right balance between protecting children and ensuring that children are not unnecessarily taken from their families, Katz said. The department said it has 657 fewer children in care, a reduction of 13.7 percent, since January 2011.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Connecticut Department of Children and Families is promising improvements to help prevent fatalities after a series of child deaths involving families who had contact with the agency.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/21/connecticut-dcf-vows-changes-after-child-deaths/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The Connecticut Department of Children and Families is promising improvements to help prevent fatalities after a series of child deaths involving families who had contact with the agency.", "title": "Connecticut DCF vows changes after child deaths"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "The Connecticut Department of Children and Families is promising improvements to help prevent fatalities after a series of child deaths involving families who had contact with the agency.", "card": "summary", "title": "Connecticut DCF vows changes after child deaths"}, "Author": "JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "DCF is expanding its work with child abuse experts from Yale New Haven Hospital and Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center to improve how investigators, hospitals and primary care providers recognize abuse when a child suffers an injury.\nThe Office of the Child Advocate said it was notified of the deaths of 11 children from families involved with DCF during the same period.\nIn February, DCF announced that a review of child deaths in recent years showed that many were accidental and involved infants and toddlers in unsafe sleeping environments.\nNEW HAVEN, Conn.
