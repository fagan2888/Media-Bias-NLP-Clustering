Forecasters are predicting triple-digit temperatures and possibly record-breaking heat in some parts of the Los Angeles area.\n\nAt the Los Angeles Zoo, they're preparing for the worst (with some fun thrown in) with an event called \"Cool at the Zoo.\"\n\nMike Maxcy, the principle animal keeper at the L.A. Zoo says they'll be feeding the animals some special cool treats: \"fishsicles,\" \"fruitsicles\" and \"meatsicles.\"\n\nAnd what about the people that play animals? You know, the folks that wear those fuzzy costumes at Disneyland?\n\nGarrett Kraemer used to play Goofy, the Genie from \"Aladdin,\" and Baloo from \"The Jungle Book.\" As he explains it, \"it would be like going out in 100-degree weather wrapped in 10 quilts. And walking around and dancing in it? Yeah, it's not super pleasant in the heat.\"\n\nWhen temperatures got too high, Kraemer says, their regular 30-minute shifts would be shortened.\n\nAnd frequent Take Two guest and \"King of Kitsch\" Charles Phoenix will also have to contend with the brutal heat this weekend. He's planned a Disneyland-themed six-hour walking tour of downtown L.A.\n\nThe tour happens \"rain or shine,\" but this is a lot of shine, so he's traded in the school bus he usually uses for his tours for an air-conditioned coach.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Take Two checked in with a few folks around town to see how they will beat the heat, from a zookeeper to Charles Phoenix, heads a walking tour of downtown L.A.", "title": "Heat wave: How zoo animals, Disney characters and tourists are beating the heat", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/09/12/39321/heat-wave-how-zoo-animals-disney-characters-and-to/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/3dc4a67a6e2f87f8fd262570192ef101/91881-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 683}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
