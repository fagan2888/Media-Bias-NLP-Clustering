(AP) \u2014 Benjamin O. Davis Jr. entered West Point in 1932 as its only black cadet and spent the next four years shunned. He roomed alone, and no one befriended him. The future Tuskegee Airman and trailblazing Air Force general later said he was \u201can invisible man.\u201d\n\nNow, more than a decade after his death, the academy that allowed Davis to be ostracized is honoring him.\n\nA new cadet barracks being constructed among the fortress-like buildings of the U.S. Military Academy will be named for Davis \u2014 a rare privilege previously granted to graduates with names like MacArthur and Eisenhower. Officials at the storied academy say Davis was a natural choice by dint of his career and character. It also gives the academy a chance to belatedly do right by Davis.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what, \u2018Duty, Honor, Country\u2019 look like, just read a little bit about Benjamin O. Davis Jr., and your jaw will drop because he is the epitome of what we want at a time when we didn\u2019t know what \u2018right\u2019 looked like,\u201d said Col. Ty Seidule, the head of West Point\u2019s history department and a head of the naming committee. \u201cSo it\u2019s our chance to acknowledge one of our greatest graduates.\u201d\n\nDavis, who died in 2002 at age 89, has a history-soaked resume that includes commanding the all-black 332nd Fighter Group, known as the Red Tails, and becoming the first black general of the Air Force, which he joined in 1947. He retired as a three-star general in 1970 and was awarded a fourth star in 1998 by President Bill Clinton.\n\nWest Point graduated its first black cadet at the tail-end of Reconstruction in 1877, though no black cadet had graduated in the 20th century when Davis arrived at the academy along the Hudson River.\n\nSome cadets clearly wanted to keep it that way.\n\nDavis was \u201csilenced,\u201d a coordinated shunning usually reserved for cadets who violated the honor code. He roomed by himself, and fellow cadets spoke to him only as needed. Mess hall tables with empty places would be too full for him to sit at.\n\n\u201cI was to be silenced solely because the cadets did not want blacks at West Point. Their only purpose was to freeze me out,\u201d Davis wrote in his 1991 autobiography. \u201cWhat they did not realize was that I was stubborn enough to put up with their treatment to reach the goal I had come to obtain.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "West Point names barracks for black graduate who was shunned", "title": "West Point names barracks for black graduate who was shunned", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "West Point names barracks for black graduate who was shunned", "title": "West Point names barracks for black graduate who was shunned", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/west_point_names_barracks_for_black_graduate_who_was_shunned/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/west-point-outcast-honored.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "West Point names barracks for black graduate who was shunned", "title": "West Point names barracks for black graduate who was shunned", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/west-point-outcast-honored.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Hill", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc02e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsWEST POINT, N.Y.
