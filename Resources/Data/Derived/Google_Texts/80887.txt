You know this is the story the liberal media is dying to tell: Obamacare–The Triumphant Comeback! So like the dove returning to the Ark, there was the BBC’s Katty Kay, guest-hosting today for Mika Brzezinski on Morning Joe, first to proclaim the good news.

Based on the latest enrollment numbers, Kay enthused “amazing how quickly we are starting to see the Obamacare story change its tone.” Really?

Tell us, Katty: of the people who have enrolled in Obamacare, how many have actually paid their premiums? And what percentage were healthy young people, needed to avoid an actuarial disaster? Take your time; we’ll wait.

Here are some of the facts Kay didn’t cop to:

• A significant percentage of enrollees haven’t paid their premiums.

• A huge percentage of those who enrolled are getting taxpayer-funded

subsidies.

• The demographics are looking disastrous: to “keep premiums down, the exchanges were supposed to have 40 percent of their customers between the ages of 18-34. The demographics slightly improved in January, but young adults still make up only 25 percent of the market.”

But hey, none of that will stop the Katty Kay’s of the MSM world from claiming that Obamacare is the Comeback Kid.
