Some have suggested the VA take money from elsewhere in its budget while others have raised concerns about the impact on hometown projects \u2014 a concern reinforced by the April 21 letter.\n\nAt a hearing last week in Colorado, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., questioned the VA\u2019s strategy as he waved a list of projects that would be impacted.\n\n\u201cI know in West Haven, Conn., that this project on primary care facility upgrades has been delayed for years and years and years,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to see any veterans across the country have to sacrifice because of the incompetence or worse on the part of past VA administration.\u201d\n\nHe said the VA should find a different path to fund the Aurora medical facility.\n\nAmong the projects in the VA\u2019s cross hairs are plans to upgrade an ambulatory care clinic in Honolulu, replace an air handler in the Bronx and remodel a laboratory in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nColorado wouldn\u2019t be spared either.\n\nThe VA Medical Center in Grand Junction saw three projects totaling about $4.2 million trimmed, mostly repairs to its infrastructure, after meetings with Washington officials last week that looked at which plans could be put off.\n\n\u201cThe VA is a team,\u201d said Paul Sweeney, spokesman for the medical center. \u201cThese are projects that will need to be done eventually but can be postponed, though not indefinitely. If they had to make choices (for cuts), they made the right ones.\u201d\n\nThe trims Grand Junction said it could handle was a $1 million replacement of underground steam pipes and nearly $2 million to renovate portions of the hospital\u2019s fourth floor to accommodate doctors and other health-care providers, Sweeney said.\n\nHe said there was no immediate impact to patient care, although \u201ceventually it might if they\u2019re not funded\u201d in a few years.\n\nThe impact on projects nationwide, and the likelihood of a congressional fight, is one reason why U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Aurora, has suggested taking money from the VA bonus account to pay for the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe cost overruns need to come out of VA\u2019s hide, which is why my plan uses VA bonuses to complete the hospital,\u201d said Coffman in a statement.\n\nAdministration officials have pushed back against that idea, noting that the fund pays employees who put in long hours, such as doctors and nurses.\n\nMark K.
