SALT LAKE CITY - Gov. Gary Herbert released the details of an alternative plan for expanding eligibility for Medicaid in Utah.

The federal government said it will pay most of the cost if states allow more people to be eligible for the program.

Gov. Herbert said he would prefer to use the federal funds to help more than 100,000 low-income Utahns with private healthcare programs.

Now Gov. Herbert needs the Utah legislature to approve the plan.

The governor said his Healthy Utah plan is better for Utah for four reasons.

He said it respects the tax payer, supports private markets, promotes individual responsibility and connects underemployed with individual job assistance and it maximizes state flexibility.

Respect the taxpayer - brings $409 million in ACA taxes that Utahns have already paid back into our state economy #healthyutah — Gary R. Herbert (@GovHerbert) December 4, 2014

Support private markets - uses $ that would go into Medicaid to instead help low-income Utahns purchase insurance from private Utah vendors — Gary R. Herbert (@GovHerbert) December 4, 2014
