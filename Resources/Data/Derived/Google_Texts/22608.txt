(CNSNews.com) - In her opening statement at the third Democratic presidential debate hosted by ABC News at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire on Saturday night, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that Democrats have to “prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we’ve made.”

“They would repeal the Affordable Care Act--not improve it,” she said.

The Affordable Care Act is also known as Obamacare.

Here is former Secretary Clinton’s opening statement:

Well, thank you, and I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate. You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone--not just those at the top. That is the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.

I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts. From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we have made. They would repeal the Affordable Care Act--not improve it. They would give more tax breaks to the super wealthy and corporations--not to the middle class, and they would--despite all their tough talk about terrorism-continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns. So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people.
