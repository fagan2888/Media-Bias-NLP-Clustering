Kayvon Webster: shoulder. Montee Ball: groin. Ronnie Hillman: foot. Jacob Tamme: ribs. Quinton Carter: knee. Will Montgomery: knee. Demaryius Thomas: ankle.\n\nThe list of bumps and bruises to the Broncos seems to grow by the hour, turning what is usually their toughest practice of the week into a sparse, shells-only workout Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be sore,\u201d Peyton Manning said. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be sore coming off a game like Sunday (against the Chiefs).\n\n\u201cI think the effort\u2019s got to be made to take care of yourself physically, to take extra time in the cold tubs and getting treatment. That\u2019s the challenge here late in the season.\u201d\n\nBroncos fans can only hope Manning is right, especially in regards to Julius Thomas. Their star tight end has missed the last two games with an ankle injury and was clearly still favoring it Wednesday after running through some drills.\n\nPlaying without him for a third consecutive game, one against the Bills and their elite defense, is not a scenario Manning or the Broncos like to entertain.\n\n\u201cWhen you have your top players go out, you are going to miss them,\u201d Manning said. \u201c\u2026 We hope to get Julius back out there and, no question, when he\u2019s out there he makes a difference.\u201d\n\nBuffalo grades out as the No. 2 overall defense, according to Pro Football Focus, allowing 18.1 points per game (second in the NFL), 312.4 net yards per game (fifth) and totaling 25 takeaways (second).\n\nThese aren\u2019t the same Bills we\u2019re used to seeing in recent years.\n\n\u201cThey have an excellent defense, and we\u2019re still getting to know them; it\u2019s an unfamiliar opponent, kind of like Miami, and that\u2019s always a challenge,\u201d Manning said. \u201c\u2026 They\u2019re playing really well together, creating a lot of problems for teams on the early downs, getting teams into third-and-longs and just seem to be playing really well together as a unit.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 running game has come into its own in recent weeks, thanks to C.J. Anderson, but Manning says their offense is still lacking in the red zone, despite their 65.2 touchdown percentage in that area.\n\nBefore his injury, Julius Thomas scored seven of his 12 touchdowns in the red zone, but Manning refuses to point to Julius Thomas\u2019 absence as the reason for their red-zone shortcomings. Flat out, he said, they just need to improve on finishing and \u201cgetting more touchdowns.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomehow I have to find a way to help us get in the end zone,\u201d Manning said, \u201cwith Julius or without.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or at twitter.com/denverpost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning not fazed as injuries pile up for Broncos", "title": "Peyton Manning not fazed as injuries pile up for Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/03/peyton-manning-not-fazed-as-injuries-pile-up-for-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141120_111055_peyton-manning.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141120_111055_peyton-manning.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-03T14:30:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:55:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda815\"", "article_summary": "Julius Thomas: ankle.\nBefore his injury, Julius Thomas scored seven of his 12 touchdowns in the red zone, but Manning refuses to point to Julius Thomas\u2019 absence as the reason for their red-zone shortcomings.\nThat\u2019s the challenge here late in the season.\u201dBroncos fans can only hope Manning is right, especially in regards to Julius Thomas.\nAnderson, but Manning says their offense is still lacking in the red zone, despite their 65.2 touchdown percentage in that area.\nPlaying without him for a third consecutive game, one against the Bills and their elite defense, is not a scenario Manning or the Broncos like to entertain."}
