Once the EC endorses the Report, the next stage of the EU legislative process is for the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament to assess the RTS and ITS and, if necessary, to raise any objections. If there are no objections, then the RTS and ITS may be finalized , which may be anticipated in January 2016. While MAR is itself directly applicable in all EU member states, the governments of all 28 EU member states are required to take necessary measures to amend their local securities laws so as to bring the new market abuse RTS and ITS into effect on a country by country basis. The new rules will be applicable across all the European Union from July 3, 2016.\n\nThe Report is available online here.\n\nESMA\u2019s press release is also available online here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On September 28, the European Securities and Markets Authority published a final report (Report) containing draft regulatory technical standards and implementing technical standards on the new EU Market Abuse Regulation..", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On September 28, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a final report (Report) containing draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) and implementing technical standards (ITS)", "title": "ESMA Publishes Final Report and Draft Technical Standards on New EU Market Abuse Rules", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/esma-publishes-final-report-and-draft-technical-standards-new-eu-market-abuse-rules", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/badge_button_european_flag_800_6786_3.jpg?itok=0tFlN2Vl", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, regulatory technical standards, RTS, ITS, EU Market Abuse, MAR", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, world, European Union, European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, regulatory technical standards, RTS, ITS, EU Market Abuse, MAR"}, "article_summary": "Saturday, October 3, 2015On September 28, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a final report (Report) containing draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) and implementing technical standards (ITS) on the new EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR).\nA press release from ESMA (which also covers the contemporaneous release of draft RTS and ITS under Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) states that ESMA has sent the Report to the EC, which now has three months to decide whether to endorse the draft RTS and ITS.\nIf there are no objections, then the RTS and ITS may be finalized , which may be anticipated in January 2016.\nThe new rules will be applicable across all the European Union from July 3, 2016.\nThe Report, in line with ESMA\u2019s November 2013 consultation/ discussion paper, has nine principal sections covering the main topics on which mandates were given to ESMA (by the European Commission (EC) and set forth in MAR itself) to develop draft RTS and ITS."}
