In the rest of Texas the Muscovy has been introduced through human intervention and is considered invasive. These ducks are often purchased as show ducks, as pets or are raised for food. They have either been recklessly released into the wild or escaped captivity and are now invasive and displacing the native animals.\n\nAn invasive species is defined as a species which is not native to an ecosystem. Why should we care about invasive species? The introduction causes or will likely cause economic or environmental harm. An invasive species is one that grows/reproduces quickly because of favorable conditions and lack of natural predators. Muscovy ducks create problems through competition with the native species, can damage property and can transmit diseases to the native population. Often found in large numbers in parks and other public areas, they produce a large quantity of \u201cdroppings\u201d which can affect water quality. Muscovy populations expand rapidly and if they are accustomed to being fed like in parks, they can chase you looking for food.\n\nThe male Muscovy can be very aggressive towards other birds and this creates problems for our native species. They will fight and chase away other males in order to forcibly mate with the females. It is not uncommon for males to force themselves on other males when the females are sitting on eggs or raising their young.\n\nBecause of the natural migration into Texas, regulations protecting the Muscovy duck were issued by the US Fish and Wildlife Services in 2010. They are now protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. On the same day they gained protection, they became subject to the USFWS Control Order. Certain agencies and property owners are allowed to control free-ranging Muscovies except in the three counties of Texas where they are considered native. Under this order, any duck removed alive outside of the counties where they are considered native must be placed with a facility that will restrict its movement or it must be euthanized. If you have questions about the control order, go to: www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/mbpermits/Addresses.html\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP?\n\nBe a responsible pet owner. Before you purchase a Muscovy as a pet, be committed to caring for it for its entire life. Before buying, research the behavior of the duck, feeding and housing requirements and whether or not they will be a good fit for your situation.\n\nNever release a Muscovy into the wild. It is illegal.\n\nPhoto: Muscovy Duckling.", "article_metadata": {"sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "viewport": "width=100%, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dc": {"title": "TWRC Wildlife Center Column for April 6, 2014 - MUSCOVY DUCKS"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde35e\"", "article_summary": "Muscovy ducks create problems through competition with the native species, can damage property and can transmit diseases to the native population.\nAn invasive species is one that grows/reproduces quickly because of favorable conditions and lack of natural predators.\nAn invasive species is defined as a species which is not native to an ecosystem.\nIn the rest of Texas the Muscovy has been introduced through human intervention and is considered invasive.\nWhy should we care about invasive species?"}
