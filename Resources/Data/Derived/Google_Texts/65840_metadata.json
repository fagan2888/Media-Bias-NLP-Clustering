The testimony included a video from Brittany Maynard recorded 19 days before she took life-ending drugs.\n\nIn the video, Maynard implored California lawmakers to legalize \u201caid in dying.\u201d Maynard, who had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, took lethal medication last year in Oregon, where the practice is legal.\n\n\u201cThe decision about how I end my dying process should be up to me and my family under a doctor\u2019s care. How dare the government make decisions or limit options for terminally ill people like me. Unfortunately, California law prevented me from getting the end-of life-option I deserved,\u201d said Maynard, who died Nov. 1 at age 29.\n\nSeveral people testified against the bill, including doctors who said the practice was incompatible with a physician\u2019s role as a healer and warned that evidence from Belgium and the Netherlands, where physician-assisted suicide has been legal since 2002, showed that restrictions and safeguards meant to protect against abuse were difficult to enforce.\n\nDisability rights advocates emphasized this point, arguing some people\u2019s lives would be ended without their consent, through mistakes or abuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018deadly mix\u2019 to combine our broken health care system and assisted suicide, which would instantly become the cheapest treatment,\u201d said Marilyn Golden, senior policy analyst at the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund. \u201cDirect coercion is not even necessary. If insurers deny, or even merely delay, expensive, life-sustaining treatment, patients are steered toward hastening their deaths. Do we think insurers will do the right thing, or the cheap thing?\u201d\n\nBesides Oregon, the practice is legal in four other states: Montana, New Mexico, Vermont and Washington.\n\nAdvocates for aid-in-dying laws say legislators in at least 17 states have introduced similar measures this year. However, proposals in at least four states have already stalled for the year, and many have not yet received a hearing.\n\nIn the video, Maynard said people asked her if she had explored palliative sedation, a practice where the patient is given sedative drugs continuously until passing naturally, as an alternative to life-ending drugs. But Maynard said she found that option terrifying.\n\n\u201cI may be minimally conscious, still suffering and unable to move or speak,\u201d she said.\n\nMaynard\u2019s husband, Dan Diaz, who introduced the video at the hearing, said that he respects those who disagree with him and his wife, but that aid in dying should be an option for all Californians.\n\n\u201cEven the staunchest of opponents might say, \u2018Well, I may not use it, but I would certainly want the option,'\u201d Diaz said as he choked back tears.\n\nThe Senate Health Committee voted 6-2 to approve the bill Wednesday. The bill moves next to the Senate Judiciary Committee for a hearing on April 7.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the six-minute video, Maynard calmly implores California lawmakers to legalize aid in dying.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Posthumous Brittany Maynard Video Supports Calif.
