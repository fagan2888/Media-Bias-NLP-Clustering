If it bleeds, it leads, right?\u2019 Obama told Vox. \u2018You show crime stories and you show fires, because that's what folks watch, and it's all about ratings. And, you know, the problems of terrorism and dysfunction and chaos, along with plane crashes and a few other things, that's the equivalent when it comes to covering international affairs.\u2019 Obama said there was not going to be \u2018a lot of interest\u2019 in stories showing positive progress on issues like infant mortality or improving productivity for farmers. \u2018It's not a sexy story,\u2019 Obama said. \u2018And climate change is one that is happening at such a broad scale and at such a complex system, it's a hard story for the media to tell on a day-to-day basis.\u2019\u201d\n\nCompares role to \u201ca big city mayor\u201d fighting crime - \u201cIt is entirely legitimate for the American people to be deeply concerned when you've got a bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris. We devote enormous resources to that, and it is right and appropriate for us to be vigilant and aggressive in trying to deal with that \u2014 the same way a big city mayor's got to cut the crime rate down if he wants that city to thrive.\u201d \u2013 President Obama in an interview with Vox.\n\nKerry says U.S. \u2018on the road\u2019 to defeating ISIS - Fox News: \u201cSecretary of State John Kerry and a top White House official claimed Sunday that the U.S. strategy to defeat the Islamic State is working, despite warnings from other corners of the Obama administration that the terror network is in fact spreading. Following the purported deaths last week of two ISIS hostages and concerns about the U.S. needing to do more, Kerry told NBC's \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 that the U.S.-led coalition was \u2018on the road\u2019 to defeating the Islamic extremist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Iraq and Syria. He argued that coalition forces have recaptured 22 percent of the populated areas that ISIS once held in the region \u2018without launching what we would call a major offensive.\u2019 The claim came just days after Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, delivered a grim assessment of the group\u2019s evolution in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've had hundreds of Americans travel to fight in the region and some of those have returned. Talk about barbarians at the gate -- we need to keep them out of the gate and we need to monitor those who have gotten through the gate.\u201d -- House Homeland Security Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d\n\nMerkel arrives seeking to nix plans to arm Ukraine - USA Today : \u201cUkraine's beleaguered president appealed to Western leaders in Munich on Saturday for political, economic and military support against Russian-backed rebels, but Germany and the United States appeared divided over whether providing arms to Kiev would deter the separatists and keep Russian President Vladimir Putin at bay. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, freshly back from talks in Moscow with Putin and French President Francois Hollande to fashion another cease-fire deal, expressed doubts over any quick resolution to the crisis. Merkel and Hollande plan to discuss the latest proposal, which includes a broad demilitarized zone and greater autonomy for eastern Ukraine, in a phone call Sunday with Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko\u2026The latest talks are aimed at salvaging the so-called Minsk agreement reached in September in Belarus for a tentative cease-fire to end fighting in eastern Ukraine between government troops and Russian-backed rebels.\u201d\n\nFEDS START NEW HOTLINE FOR EXECUTIVE AMNESTY\n\nStephen Dinan reports: \u201cThe Homeland Security Department has set up hotlines for illegal immigrants who believe their rights under President Obama\u2019s amnesty policy have been violated. In a memo announcing the customer complaint line, U.S. Customs and Border Protection asked illegal immigrants to \u2018please tell us about your experience\u2019 if they believe they were treated \u2018contrary to the new DHS enforcement priorities.\u2019\u201d\n\nHomeland Security Secretary pushes for unconditional funding bill - WashEx: \u201cHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson pressed Congress to drop a directive to stop President Obama's executive order on immigration attached to a funding bill for his department, a move that has endangered support from Democrats. Johnson said that the rider threatened his department's operations. DHS funding is slated to run out Feb. 27 if Congress can't pass a new spending bill. \u2018I am on Capitol Hill now virtually every working day\u2019 to get a bill passed, Johnson said Sunday on CNN's \u2018State of the Union.\u2019\u201d\n\nGo ahead and go: - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s plan for keeping the Senate runs through the Senate amendment process. David Drucker reports: \u201cIn after action reports, Republican strategists said that a major driver behind the demise of Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s Democratic majority in 2014 midterms was his extraordinary ability to keep his caucus unified on Senate votes and President Obama\u2019s agenda\u2026. But his strategy for keeping his caucus from splitting had a side effect: Democrats had virtually no opportunities to collaborate with Republicans and establish their independence \u2014 either from the party or from Obama. This turned out to be fatal blow to the Democrats in a battle for the Senate that was fought largely on Republican turf. Ever the political tactician, Kentucky Republican McConnell is determined not to repeat Reid\u2019s mistake in 2016, when the Senate battleground is likely to favor the Democrats.\u201d\n\nShoot the lights out - WSJ: \u201cNewly empowered Republicans are looking to do something that hasn\u2019t been accomplished since 1996: funnel a budget through both houses of Congress and then pass timely appropriations bills. But first the party must agree on what its budget document should say.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The ObamaCare replacement plan] helps by giving more choice, more competition, reducing the regulatory burden, again, not only helping our businesses in terms of reducing costs, giving them more options, but for individuals as well. That's the kind of thing that makes our economy go.\u201d --Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., on \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d Watch here.\n\nHolder: \u2018Single failure\u2019 as A.G. was not getting Congress to pass gun control - \u201cIt is, I think, the single failure that I point to in my time as Attorney General, that I was not able to\u2026 convince Congress to really follow the will of the American people \u2013 which was to enact meaningful, reasonable, gun safety measures. The gun lobby simply won.\u201d \u2013 Attorney General Eric Holder in an interview with MSNBC\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nFred Kaps had possibly the hardest act to follow in show business history 51 years ago today as his debut on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d happened to fall on the same night the same night as another act\u2019s debut. The British invasion had finally reached the United States with the Beatles performance with over 70 million Americans estimated to have tuned in that night. Kaps was a world renowned Dutch magician having won the prestigious F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Magiques Grand Prix three times. Undeterred, Kaps worked the stage with his infamous Salt Shaker and card tricks. The Fab Four then returned to the stage to close the show. Thanks to his appearance, Kaps was offered movie roles and appeared on other shows performing worldwide, including shows for the Dutch and British royal families. He received numerous honors and commendations in the magic community before his passing from cancer in 1980.\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The pipeline would begin in North Dakota's Bakken oil fields and would pass through South Dakota and Iowa en route to a distribution point at Patoka, Ill. The Iowa section would cover 343 miles, including some of the state's richest farmland.\u201d\n\nAnswer man - \u201cI'm a very careful person, so I want to make sure I have all of the infrastructure in place.

Mrs. Clinton has not had to wade into domestic policy since before she became secretary of state in 2009, and she has spent the past few months engaged in policy discussions with economists on the left and closer to the Democratic Party\u2019s center who are grappling with the discontent set off by the gap between rich and poor\u2026 Although people close to Mrs. Clinton say she has not yet settled on a specific platform, she is expected to embrace several principles. They include standard Democratic initiatives like raising the minimum wage, investing in infrastructure, closing corporate tax loopholes and cutting taxes for the middle class. Other ideas are newer, such as providing incentives to corporations to increase profit-sharing with employees and changing labor laws to give workers more collective bargaining power.\u201d\n\nLondon Mayor's roadshow hits the US - The Independent: \u201cBoris Johnson will sit down for talks with Hillary Clinton this week during a six-day US tour seen by some as preparation for a future Conservative leadership bid.

Kerry, the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2004, told NBC\u2019s \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 that \u2018nobody ever says never.\u2019 However, he said he could think of \u2018no scenario whatsoever\u2019 in which he would start such a campaign\u2026\u201d\n\nDON\u2019T EVEN ASK WHERE THE PIG IS\n\nKTLA reports that last week Sacramento County firefighters responded to a rather bizarre call. Charles Campbell said his wife was forced to call for help for their 30-year-old horse, Phantom. The horse was prancing around the stall and tripped falling into the tub which doubled as a food trough. According to Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, \u201cShe was totally stuck, legs up in the air and all!\u201d Authorities were so perplexed by the initial call that they called back to clarify the situation, Campbell said, \u201c[The dispatcher] called her back and said, \u2018Your husband can\u2019t get out of the bathtub?\u2019 And she says, \u2018No it\u2019s my horse.\u2019\u201d Rescuers took about 20 minutes to free Phantom from her precarious position. After the successful rescue, Campbell joked that he would \u201chave to get one of those old folks tubs that has the door on it.\u201d The entire escapade was caught on video and posted online by Sacramento Metropolitan Fire.\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
