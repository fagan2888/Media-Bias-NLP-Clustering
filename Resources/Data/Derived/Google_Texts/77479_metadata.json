The county was asked to prove that the facilities were for government use or be forced to sell the properties.\n\nThe Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic is the only public health clinic in the community of 22,000 people, and dozens of residents came out to protest the sale of the building, which would have forced the clinic to move elsewhere.\n\nOne option put forward Tuesday was that the existing buildings be demolished and that the area be turned into an extension of Anisq \"Oyo\" Park. The costs to do that would come to $1.1 million, and yearly ongoing maintenance of the park would amount to $25,000.\n\nStaff recommended that they be sold and the proceeds be used to pay down existing debt, and recent appraisals had placed the value at $2.4 million for the church, and $1.65 million for the medical clinic.\n\nSome of the discussion revolved around the City of Santa Barbara's lobbying for some of the buildings within their RDA zone. A children's museum had been slated for one such area, but the dissolution of the RDA zone left that project in limbo until city officials made the argument that the state should allow them to keep it.\n\n\"If Santa Barbara can have a children's museum, I think Santa Barbara County can make the case that we need to keep a medical clinic in an area that is seeing high poverty rates,\" Supervisor Janet Wolf said.\n\nBrian Knowles, a Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics board member, said the clinics were going through a serious financial crisis the last time the item came before supervisors, but that the outlook is looking brighter now. Since then, they have received significant funding, he said, and hired Trula Ann Breuninger as their new interim CEO.\n\n\"We know we have a lot of work to do to right the ship \u2026 but the future is looking much brighter for the neighborhood clinics,\" Knowles said.\n\nThe clinic sees 1,100 patients a month, many of whom come under a county contract for homeless care, he said.\n\nIf the clinic goes away, \"the community will lose its only medical center,\" and that the neighborhood clinic has not been able to find a similar location in Isla Vista to operate.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act rolling out next year, \"most communities are rising to the challenge and increasing capacity,\" Knowles said. \"This would not be the case if this clinic closes.\"\n\nConsidering the density and population numbers of the area, one speaker after another said that the lack of services was a problem.\n\nResident Anna Sifuentes, who spoke through an interpreter, said many families in Isla Vista depend on the clinic.\n\nUsing the church as a community center also seemed to be a priority to speakers.\n\n\"Selling the clinic building is just not in the best interest of the county,\" Supervisor Doreen Farr said. \"The health and well-being of Isla Vista's residents depends on this.\"\n\nA county report released last week documents Isla Vista as one of four areas in the county experiencing high poverty.\n\nAny loss of services \"would greatly exacerbate\" the situation, Farr said, adding that the community had been long underserved.\n\nThe population in Isla Vista is heavily transit dependent, and bus connections to get from Isla Vista to the county clinic are tedious and time consuming, she said.\n\n\"We just can't lose the neighborhood clinic,\" Farr said, adding that she's willing to go to Sacramento to go argue before lawmakers to allow the county to keep the building.\n\nThe building has a fair amount of deferred maintenance, and Supervisor Peter Adam expressed concern about keeping an asset that needed significant repairs done, but eventually voted in favor of keeping the buildings.\n\nWolf said she believed they could make a \"strong case\" that the county should be able to keep the properties for its use.\n\n\"I will go with you to Sacramento,\" she told Farr. \"As we move forward with the Affordable Care Act \u2026 it is our county responsibility to maintain that property.\"\n\nSupervisor Steve Lavagnino called it \"shortsighted\" to sell the buildings with ACA laws looming and more people will have access to health care.\n\nThe board voted 4-0 to keep the clinic building, with Supervisor Salud Carbajal recusing himself because his wife is a former employee of the Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics.\n\nThe board voted 5-0 to retain the area's parking lot and 4-1 to retain the church building, with Lavagnino abstaining.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Lara Cooper can be reached at [email protected].
