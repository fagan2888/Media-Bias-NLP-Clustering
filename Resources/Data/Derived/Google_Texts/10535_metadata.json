Usually Donald Trump wins the primaries \u2014 where you go and vote, like in a real election. Cruz wins the caucuses \u2014 run by the state parties, favored by political operators and cheaters.\n\nUntil now, the only primaries Cruz has won are in Texas (his home state), Oklahoma (basically the same state) and Idaho (where Trump never campaigned).\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSo now, Cruz has finally won an honest-to-goodness primary. This is great news for him, provided: (1) the general election is a caucus, and (2) the national media universally denounce Cruz\u2019s Democratic opponent the same way the Wisconsin media denounced Trump.\n\nIn that case, Cruz should do fine.\n\nThe Cruz-bots don\u2019t care. They don\u2019t care that they\u2019re being used as a cat\u2019s-paw by the Never Trump crowd, and that a brokered Republican convention is more likely to end with Bernie as the nominee than Cruz.\n\nThe Cruz cultists don\u2019t even care about plain honesty, which I always thought was a conservative value. Republicans used to be appalled by guttersnipe, lying political operators like the Clintons. Now they are guttersnipe, lying political operators like the Clintons.\n\nIt\u2019s all hands on deck to stop the only presidential candidate who wants to save America from the cheap labor plutocrats.\n\nCruz has flipped to Trump\u2019s side on every important political issue of this campaign \u2014 which only ARE issues because of Trump. These are:\n\n\u2014 Quadrupling the number of foreign guest workers to help ranchers and farmers get cheap labor: Cruz was for it, and now is against it.\n\n\u2014 Legalizing illegal aliens: Cruz was for it, and now is against it.\n\n\u2014 The Trans-Pacific Partnership deal: Cruz was for it, and now is against it.\n\n\u2014 Building a wall: Cruz was against it, and now is for it.\n\nThese are all positions Cruz has changed since being a senator \u2014 most of them he\u2019s flipped on only in the last year. I\u2019m supposed to believe that U.S. senators can sincerely change their minds about policies it was their job to know about, but a New York developer can never change his mind about pop-offs he made more than a decade ago.\n\nBack in 1999 \u2014 17 years ago \u2014 when Donald Trump was considering a presidential run on the Reform Party ticket, he said this when asked about abortion by Tim Russert on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d: \u201cWell, look, I\u2019m very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still \u2014 I just believe in choice.\u201d\n\nRussert then asked him specifically if he\u2019d ban partial-birth abortion. Trump said, \u201cNo. I am pro-choice in every respect and as far as it goes, but I just hate it.\u201d\n\nA year later, Trump wrote in his book \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d: \u201cWhen Tim Russert asked me on \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 if I would ban partial-birth abortion, my pro-choice instincts led me to say no. After the show, I consulted two doctors I respect and, upon learning more about this procedure, I have concluded that I would indeed support a ban.\u201d\n\nSometime in the intervening 16 years, Trump became fully pro-life.\n\nYou can say you don\u2019t believe him \u2014 just as you might say you don\u2019t believe Cruz has truly changed his mind on amnesty, the wall, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, etc. But to claim Trump is pro-choice today \u2014 present tense \u2014 is what\u2019s known as a \u201clie.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s what Cruz says over and over again, including in a campaign ad \u2014 and not one of those \u201csuper PAC\u201d ads that count even less than a retweet. A Cruz ad plays the clip from that 1999 interview where Trump says, \u201cI am pro-choice in every respect,\u201d repeats it three times, and then cuts to a narrator proclaiming: \u201cFor partial-birth abortion, not a conservative.\u201d\n\nThese are the kinds of lies that used to drive conservatives crazy when the Clintons did it. Not anymore. All\u2019s fair in smearing Trump.\n\nTrump has said a million times that he\u2019d scrap Obamacare and replace it with a free market system (which, by the way, he explains a lot more clearly than Washington policy wonks with their think-tank lingo). Merely for Trump saying that we\u2019re \u201cnot going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country,\u201d Cruz accuses him of supporting \u201cBernie Sanders-style medicine.\u201d\n\nYes, because Trump is against people dying in the streets, Cruz says that Trump thinks \u201cObamacare didn\u2019t go far enough and we need to expand it to put the government in charge of our health care, in charge of our relationship with our doctors.\u201d Over and over again, Cruz has repeated this insane lie, telling Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly: \u201cIf you want to see Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine, Donald Trump is your guy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s alleged support for the kind of national health care they have in Scotland and Canada is another big fat lie. Trump was issuing his usual effusive praise before he drops the hammer \u2014 \u201cIt actually works incredibly well in Scotland. Some people think it really works in Canada.\u201d Then he continued, in the very same sentence: \u201cI don\u2019t think it would work as well here. What has to happen \u2014 I like the concept of private enterprise coming in. \u2026 You have to create competition.\u201d\n\nCruz and his cult-like followers lie about Trump wanting a health care system akin to Canada\u2019s and Scotland\u2019s. They lie about his supporting Obamacare. They lie about his supporting partial-birth abortion. They lie about his ever having been a Democrat. They lie about his campaign manager assaulting a female reporter.\n\nI tried being nice after Florida, when it became clear that Trump was the choice of a majority of Republican voters, nearly choking on a column praising Cruz for his admirable flip-flops to Trump\u2019s positions on immigration and trade. I censored loads of anti-Cruz retweets. But \u2014 as with the Clintons \u2014 you offer these Cruz-bots an olive branch and they bite off your hand.\n\nThe next thing I knew, the Cruz cult was accusing Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski of criminal battery for brushing past a female reporter. Anyone who claims this video shows a \u201cbattery\u201d is as big a liar as the liberals who lined up to say Clinton did not commit perjury when he denied having \u201csexual relations\u201d with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nIf James Carville and Paul Begala had a baby, it would be a Cruz supporter.\n\nThey lie about my own tweaking of Trump \u2014 I didn\u2019t like the Heidi retweet! \u2014 amid a tidal wave of support. Trump is the only presidential candidate in my lifetime who will build a wall, deport illegals and pause the importation of Muslims. He\u2019s the only one who cares more about ordinary Americans than he does about globalist plutocrats. Does anyone really think I\u2019m \u201ctiring\u201d of him because of a retweet?\n\nApparently, for slavishly devoted Cruz-bots, a normal human making a small criticism of her preferred candidate is unfathomable! That fact alone proves how dishonest they are about their own candidate.\n\nI was under the misimpression that I was dealing with adults and not swine like Carville and Begala, willing to twist someone\u2019s words to win a momentary political advantage. Mostly, I was under the misimpression that honesty was still a conservative value.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2016 ANN COULTER\n\nDISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSAL UCLICK", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ann Coulter takes on Ted Cruz and the current state of the Republican presidential primary.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ann Coulter takes on Ted Cruz and the current state of the Republican presidential primary.", "title": "Ann Coulter: Moonies for Cruz - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/coulter-headshot-640x480.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/04/06/ann-coulter-moonies-cruz/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ann Coulter takes on Ted Cruz and the current state of the Republican presidential primary.", "title": "Ann Coulter: Moonies for Cruz - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/coulter-headshot-640x480.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ann Coulter, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Wisconsin Primary,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Big Journalism,ann coulter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Wisconsin Primary", "published_time": "2016-04-06T14:30:55-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Big Journalism,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The Cruz cultists don\u2019t even care about plain honesty, which I always thought was a conservative value.\nBut you still \u2014 I just believe in choice.\u201dRussert then asked him specifically if he\u2019d ban partial-birth abortion.\nThe Cruz-bots don\u2019t care.\nCruz has flipped to Trump\u2019s side on every important political issue of this campaign \u2014 which only ARE issues because of Trump.\nYou can say you don\u2019t believe him \u2014 just as you might say you don\u2019t believe Cruz has truly changed his mind on amnesty, the wall, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, etc."}
