In the second set I pulled out the tough tiebreak and it just kind of carried me from there.\"\n\nOriginally from Snowmass Colo., Mehall, 21, now plays Division III tennis at Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in California. He defeated top-seeded Richard Johnson 7-5, 6-4 in the quarterfinals en route to the championship match.\n\nOn match point Sunday, Mehall returned the ball far from Cariov's reach. Out of breath, both players leaned over the net to shake hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCariov, a 35-year-old from Lithuania who now lives in Boulder, has been the conditioning coach for high-performance players at the Rocky Mountain Tennis Center for the past eight months. Earlier this month he won the Broomfield Open championship.\n\nCariov, who was seeded eighth, has been playing tennis since he was 6 but has not been actively practicing for seven years.\n\nCariov's children began to show interest in tennis a year ago, which pulled him back into the game.\n\n\"I decided to play some tournaments probably a month and a half ago so I've been out of tennis for seven years. I played in college 15 years ago,\" said Cariov.\n\nCariov said Mehall was a solid player and was able to defeat him because \"conditions suited him better. The high altitude, he was faster, he delivered the serve,\" said Cariov.\n\nMehall rallied in the second set because he \"went for more shots, he got confidence, and that carried him to the third set,\" Cariov said.\n\nIn the women's final, Watson continued her strong play a day after ousting No. 1 seed Alex Aiello, a University of Colorado player. Woodman had advanced to the championship match by defeating No. 2 seed Carla Manzi, a former CU player.\n\nAnnie Mehl: mehla@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-07-26T15:15:04-0600", "sailthru.author": "By Annie Mehl \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28541139:view"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Staying \"mentally strong,\" Bryan Mehall rallied after losing the first set  to defeat Jevgenij Cariov  in the men's open singles championship match of the Babolat Boulder Open tennis tournament Sunday.", "title": "Boulder Open: Bryan Mehall rallies to defeat Jevgenij Cariov for men's championship", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0726/20150726__27DCSTENw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-07-26T15:18:01-0600", "endDate": "2025-07-26T15:13:11-0600", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Boulder Colorado Sports news, Boulder Colorado news, Sports Boulder news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news.", "byline": "By Annie MehlStaff", "pubDate": "2015-07-26T15:18:13-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-26T15:15:04-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Open: Bryan Mehall rallies to defeat Jevgenij Cariov for men's championship", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0726/20150726__27DCSTENw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Staying \"mentally strong,\" Bryan Mehall rallied after losing the first set  to defeat Jevgenij Cariov  in the men's open singles championship match of the Babolat Boulder Open tennis tournament Sunday.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Staying \"mentally strong,\" Bryan Mehall rallied after losing the first set  to defeat Jevgenij Cariov  in the men's open singles championship match of the Babolat Boulder Open tennis tournament Sunday.", "title": "Boulder Open: Bryan Mehall rallies to defeat Jevgenij Cariov for men's championship"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0726/20150726__27DCSTENw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Bryan Mehall returns a shot in the men's open finals of the Boulder Open at Rocky Mountain Tennis Center.\nCollege student wins second-set tiebreaker on way to winStaying \"mentally strong,\" Bryan Mehall rallied after losing the first set to defeat Jevgenij Cariov in the men's open singles championship match of the Babolat Boulder Open tennis tournament Sunday.\nIn the women's championship match, Sammie Watson of Denver defeated Kelli Woodman, also of Denver, 6-1, 7-5.\n(Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)The men's championship match turned in the second set, when Mehall prevailed in the tiebreaker after he had lost the first set.\nIn the second set I pulled out the tough tiebreak and it just kind of carried me from there.\""}
