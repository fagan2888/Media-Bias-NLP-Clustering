But there is a difference according to a respondent's education level.Of those who have not attended college, 22 percent cite Ebola as the top problem, and 19 percent of those with some college education agree.Only 11 percent of Americans with a four-year college degree named the disease as their main concern.The results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey conducted Nov. 6-9.An Oct. 15-20 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center survey found 41 percent of Americans were concerned about possible exposure to the Ebola virus, an increase over the 32 percent who shared similar worries in a poll taken two weeks earlier.According to Gallup, the bird flu outbreak in 2005 and the H1N1 virus in 2009 both made appearances on the list of concerns at the height of news coverage, but were off the list when the crisis abated.On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the addition of Mali to its list of Ebola-affected countries for which enhanced screening and monitoring measures will be required.Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea currently require additional screening.Only about 15 to 20 people travel from Mali through other countries to the United States every day.
