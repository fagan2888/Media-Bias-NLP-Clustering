The satirical book of Cruz\u2019 rise to fame has been listed on the Amazon top-selling coloring books for at least twenty weeks.\n\nThe book, by Really Big Coloring Books, Inc, a St. Louis-based publisher is responding to the demand for the coloring book \u201cU.S. Senator \u2018Ted\u2019 Cruz to the Future\u201d by coming out with a new edition featuring eight more pages titled, \u201cTed Cruz Saves America.\u201d The company says there is no extra charge according to an article by Howard Koplowitz in the International Business Times. The publisher claims the book is a \u201cnon-partisan, fact-driven view\u201d of how Rafael Edward \u201cTed\u201d Cruz became a U.S. Senator and illustrates through pictures featuring his quotes, public information and his ideas for \u201cwhat he believes will help people grow.\u201d\n\nPublisher Wayne Bell told USA Today, \u201cThis book was so wildly crazy popular. Some parents consider this man a real superhero.\u201d\n\nThe new pages released in the supplemental edition of the book include Cruz fighting a multi-headed serpent that represents Obamacare, Illegal Immigration and High Taxes. It also contains a page showing a newly elected President Cruz walking up to the White House with his family after a successful 2016 campaign bid.\n\nOne page of the book shows a headshot of Cruz with a caption at the bottom that reads, \u201ca passionate fighter for limited government, economic growth and the Constitution.\u201d Another page reflects on the Senators strong Second Amendment beliefs by depicting him wearing hunting gear, carrying a rifle and reminding people about the importance of the Constitution.\n\nThe book also immortalizes Cruz\u2019 famous 21-hour filibuster where he made another book famous as he read \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d to his children from the Senate floor.\n\nNot everyone is happy about the Cruz coloring book. One Amazon customer, Scott Peterson wrote a satirical review of the coloring book and said, \u201cApart from the fact that it only provided me with a white crayon, I didn\u2019t get to finish it, because as soon as I started to work, the Republicans came in and filibustered me before I could finish. Now my book is shut down, and they\u2019re blaming me for political maneuvers.\u201d\n\nAnother review came from customer who said, \u201cI have been struggling to teach my nephew the meaning of hypocrisy. Thankfully, this Ted Cruz coloring book does a magnificent job of illustrating what I\u2019ve had trouble putting into terms an 8-year-old can understand. I hope they have a Michelle Bachman coloring book so that I can teach my niece about feminism!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make books for the entire slice of America,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI\u2019ve never talked to Mr. Cruz. I don\u2019t know him \u2026 But there are fanatic admirers of Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Sarah Larimer wrote, \u201cI was told to go color Ted Saves America, the supplement to the Ted Cruz coloring book which is \u2026 sort of hilarious. I mean, sure, also patriotic and stuff. But mostly just hilarious. And also, yes ANOTHER indication of the interest in building the Cruz #brand before his inevitable likely presidential candidacy. If people buy a Ted Cruz coloring book, how could they not buy his presidential bid? Right? Right?\u201d\n\nBob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.
