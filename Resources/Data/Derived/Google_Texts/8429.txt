Sioux Falls, SD

Almost 300 special athletes and their team partners take to the lanes in Sioux Falls this weekend for the Ninth Annual Unified Special Olympics Bowling Tournament. This unique two-day event allows parents, siblings and even friends to team up with their special athlete in some fun competition.

“It's creating an avenue for them to meet some of their peer s and it's a great opportunity for them,” Special Olympics Sports Director Melanie Frosch.

The tournament continues tomorrow. A Strikes for Special Olympics bowling fundraiser will also take place next Saturday in Sioux Falls.
