A suspect has been arrested in connection with a shooting that occurred at around 5:15 p.m. Saturday in a residential neighborhood outside Loveland.

Eric David Gray, 36, of Loveland, was arrested at 7:47 p.m. Saturday.

He was booked and is being held at the Larimer County jail on investigation of first degree murder, a Class 1 felony. The pending charges are allegations only.

The Larimer County Sheriff's Office received a call of a shooting in progress Saturday in the 5600 block of Thomas Court at a Loveland address just outside city limits.

An injured man had been shot and was lying on the ground in a driveway. The suspect was in a nearby home.

Patrol deputies located the wounded victim, pulled him to a safe location, and medical personnel attended to his injuries. The wounded victim died soon after at the scene.

The identity of the victim and cause and manner of his death have not been released yet by the Larimer County Coroner's Office.

Deputies made contact with the suspect in his home and an emergency response by SWAT was initiated in case he chose not to come out of the house. However, he cooperated after some time and came out to meet deputies, who placed in him custody.

Lt. John Feyen of Larimer County Sheriff's Office Investigations said the incident was likely a dispute among neighbors.

"This unfortunate isolated situation is the result of one neighbor being unable to communicate appropriately with another. Engaging a mediator to help reduce tensions and de-escalate disagreements is always preferred to avoid such tragic results," he said in a press release. No additional details are currently available.

The investigation is still pending. The investigators said it is clear that this case has no relationship to the recent shootings already under investigation in Northern Colorado.
