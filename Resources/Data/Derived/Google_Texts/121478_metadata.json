I\u2019m Christina Bellantoni, assistant managing editor for politics and your host today.\n\nCalifornians are about to get some face time with Hillary Clinton \u2014 some rich ones, at least.\n\nThe former secretary of state is slated to be in Los Angeles this weekend for a series of fundraisers before heading up to the Bay Area.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign manager Robby Mook was in the state this week to let any uneasy donors know that the political professionals back at campaign headquarters in Brooklyn have it all under control, writes Evan Halper, describing Mook\u2019s visit as \u201chigh stakes behind-the-scenes work.\"\n\nDonors who were invited to join the conversation told Halper that Mook was visiting homes of Esprit clothing founder Susie Tompkins Buell in San Francisco and businesswoman Amy Rao, a prodigious fundraiser. The goal: to reassure, re-energize and recommit some key players in the Clinton West Coast money machine after a less-than-stellar summer and ahead of the Oct. 13 Democratic primary debate.\n\nLast month I reported on two of the Democrat\u2019s fundraisers planned for this month.\n\nWe\u2019ve got some new details on those Clinton events kicking off on Sunday afternoon. Billed as chances for a \u201cphoto with HRC,\" and the last chance to see her \u201cbefore the first big Dem debate,\" there are three events that allow for photos with the candidate for $2,700 per person.\n\n\u201cSpace is limited but there are more tiers and more opportunities for folks to support the campaign and participate, so please share with your friends, family and colleagues,\" Clinton National Finance Committee member Michael Gilmore wrote in an email obtained by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nShe will appear at the homes of Rob and Shari Friedman and Noshaba and Dr. Asif Mahmood, as well as at the swanky Perch Rooftop in downtown Los Angeles. Another email from National Finance Committee members Sim and Debra Farar and obtained by The Times warned, \u201cSPACE IS LIMITED and we expect this event to reach capacity QUICKLY.\"\n\nIf you talked with Mook, or if you plan to attend the upcoming fundraisers, we\u2019d sure love to hear from you. Don\u2019t be a stranger.\n\nTODAY\u2019S ESSENTIALS\n\n-- Meet the Californians who scored entry to watch Pope Francis declare Junipero Serra a saint, and here is a look at why the canonization of Serra is happening in Washington, not California.\n\n-- And don\u2019t miss our robust coverage of his historic visit.\n\n-- \u201cI'm not going to let them tear up that law, kick 16 million people off their health coverage and force this country to start the healthcare debate all over again,\" Clinton said in Baton Rouge ahead of releasing her plans to expand Obamacare.\n\n-- She also is opposing the Keystone Pipeline.\n\n-- Southern California residents may have to pay taxes on rebates they received for replacing lawn with turf, Matt Stevens and Taylor Goldenstein report.\n\n-- Los Angeles leaders say they would declare a state of emergency over homelessness and commit $100 million to try to solve it.\n\n-- Cool idea alert.
