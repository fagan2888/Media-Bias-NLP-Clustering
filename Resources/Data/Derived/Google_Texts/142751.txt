NHS Erewash Clinical Commissioning Group is among the first CCGs to be given the go-ahead by NHS England to commission the majority of GP services from April.

NHS England announced that NHS Erewash CCG – which is responsible for planning, buying and monitoring healthcare services on behalf of the people of Erewash – is one of

the first set of CCGs to take on responsibility for greater ‘delegated’ commissioning responsibility for GP services.

This follows plans set out by NHS England Chief Executive Simon Stevens, early last year, to give patients, communities and clinicians more scope in deciding how local services are developed.

GP services are currently commissioned by NHS England’s Area Teams but CCG’s were given the opportunity last year to opt for one of three options for differing levels of co-

commissioning: ‘delegated commissioning’, ‘joint commissioning’ or ‘greater involvement’.

Dr Avi Bhatia, Chair of NHS Erewash CCG, said: “We are delighted to be among the first CCGs in the country to receive a mandate to commission GP services. This is a significant step in our mission to deliver better care, better health, and better value to the people of Erewash. Now we can put in place local commissioning arrangements that will deliver a high level of joined up care, both in and out of hospital, for patients in Erewash.

“As NHS England recognised we have a transparent and robust framework for managing conflicts of interest. Decisions on primary care and the funding of GP services will be governed by a separate committee which has a majority of lay members. A lay member will also chair the committee.”
