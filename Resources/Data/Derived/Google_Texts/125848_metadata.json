Unfortunately, her method for delivering that candy left a lot to be desired. Officials from the South Carolina school issued an apology on Monday after a faculty member distributed prescription pill bottles filled with \u201chappy pills,\u201d which turned out to be M&Ms, to children at a campus event last weekend.\n\n\u201cWe have heard from several concerned parents that a faculty member promoting her medical technology program at Horry Georgetown Technical College filled pharmaceutical bottles with M&M candy and distributed them to children at a public event over the weekend,\u201d read a statement posted to the college\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nStandard issue prescription bottles were addressed to \u201cA Great Kid\u201d and directions on the bottles read: \u201cTake 1 m & m every 2 to 4 hours\u2026 may refill 5 times by 2/13/2016.\u201d The unidentified faculty member distributed the phony pill bottles at the college\u2019s Family Fun Run on Friday, WMBF News reported.\n\n\u201cWhile we know this professor meant the candy to serve as a treat, the method of distribution may have confused pre-school children whose parents have taught them not to take pills from pharmaceutical bottles,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe college administration deeply apologizes for the distress and confusion this action may have caused and seeks your forgiveness for our thoughtlessness. We regret further that professors and administrators are human and, although eager to share information about growing careers, sometimes make mistakes. This particular mistake will not occur again.\u201d\n\nCollege faculty member hands out \"happy pills\" to children.
