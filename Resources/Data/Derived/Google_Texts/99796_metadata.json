Federal and state regulators aiming at reducing healthcare spending would benefit from creating new legislation focused on improving cost transparency.\n\nOne report called Liberating Data to Enable Healthcare Market Transparency: A Guide for Regulators and Policy Makers outlined that, despite the reforms and provisions of the Affordable Care Act, consumers are still not receiving enough data and cost transparency when it comes to their health insurance options.\n\nFor instance, many are still lost on their cost-sharing options, out-of-pocket costs, provider networks, premium spending, and prescription drug access. To learn more about this report and find out how the lack of data and cost transparency is affecting the health insurance industry, HealthPayerIntelligence.com spoke with Joel Ario, author of the report, former Director of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Managing Director at Manatt Health. Katherine Hempstead, Senior Adviser to the Vice President of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, also joined in on the exclusive interview.\n\n\u201cWhat are the benefits in the plans that are offered? What is the cost sharing structure? What\u2019s in the formularies and provider directories?\u201d Ario spoke about some of the transparency issues relevant to consumer decisions. \u201cWhen consumers are making choices between plans, they need to have as much information as possible.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What steps can health payers and federal regulators take to improve cost transparency for the average consumer?\n\nJoel Ario: \u201cThe first step is that the regulators would make available this data that allows the consumer to understand what their cost-sharing responsibilities would be under different health plan choices. Making this data available, which CMS has started to do and has done a good job at taking data about the types of plans that are offered on the marketplaces and making it available through standardized data templates and through public use files that make that data easier to use by researchers and other people who want to use that data to understand trends and help consumers understand their options.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur paper talks about how that\u2019s a part of the data but really, a lot of individuals still purchase off-exchange rather than on-exchange so state regulators should do the same as federal regulators in terms of making this information available about benefit plans and cost-sharing structures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, what happens next is that foundations and others interested in this can build on that regulatory data. If the regulators do their job right, then a foundation like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation can build on that to help the consumer.\u201d\n\nKatherine Hempstead: \u201cA big focus of our work has been to try to make the individual direct to consumer insurance market more efficient and better serve consumers by making people be able to compare the plans head to head. We\u2019ve funded the creation of this data set that has a lot of cost-sharing information for all 50 states for the plans on the ACA marketplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to release it on Friday and it\u2019s going to have an Excel version and a machine-readable file that people can download for research purposes. It\u2019s called Hicks compare. It\u2019s something that was now done ever since the market opened, but in the first year, it was only silver plans. We\u2019re reissuing 2015 and putting in 2016 for bronze, silver, and gold health plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea is for people to be able to really analyze what\u2019s going on in the market and compare the plans and also for people to use that information to help make decision-support tools for consumers so that they can make the best choices when they\u2019re shopping for a plan.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What are the most important topics outlined in your roadmap that health insurers should pay attention to?\n\nJoel Ario: \u201cI think that the four dimensions to the plan that are important to the consumer include what benefits are covered. Those are fairly standardized by essential health benefits, but they do vary some by state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second issue that varies quite a bit is what kind of cost-sharing applies. There\u2019s a big difference between buying a bronze plan where you could pay more than a $5,000 deductible and buying a richer plan where you\u2019d pay a much smaller deductible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe third and fourth dimensions, which are getting a lot of attention under the ACA, are the formularies and how to really understand the formulary structure. This can be quite complicated with different tiers of cost-sharing and different utilization management restrictions. Unpacking that and understanding how the formularies work and which plans cover prescription drugs and how much cost-sharing does a consumer have - those sorts of questions are very important.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, what probably gets the most attention these days, the provider directories and trying to understand my choices with a lot more narrow network products out\n\nthere. How do I understand whether the plan covers my doctor and whether I want a plan that\u2019s maybe a little cheaper and has a narrow network or do I still want a more traditional, broad network type of plan. Information about that dimensions of plans. All of that is critical to the consumer.\u201d\n\nKatherine Hempstead: \u201cI think plans have made a lot of progress. Whether it\u2019s the providers that make it complicated, payers are starting to realize it\u2019s not really adequate for carriers to act like they\u2019re not able to tell consumers whether providers are in their network or not. Consumers increasingly are feeling like they have a right to know that and they\u2019re even starting to not react well when it changes in a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s been an adjustment for carriers but I do see a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: Why is cost transparency important for the health insurance industry? How does it benefit health insurers?\n\nKatherine Hempstead: \u201cA lot of the all-payer claims databases that a lot of carriers don\u2019t want to participate in, but one of the things that they do is that they can shine a light on high negotiated provider prices. By putting that information out there, it can actually help negotiate more competitive networks. Even though they tend to resist participating in these things, they can also be the biggest beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nJoel Ario: \u201cA second dimension of this is, as consumers do have what the carriers like to call \u2018more skin in the game,\u2019 so higher cost sharing, then I think it\u2019s incumbent on the carriers then to be explaining a lot more about how that works and disclose a lot more about pricing in the marketplace so that consumers can actually be intelligent purchasers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t do a whole lot of good to say \u2018We want you to pay a higher share of the bill through cost-sharing but we\u2019re not going to provide much information about how much your cost-sharing is going to be.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAn example of where you see this now is mostly in the federal and state exchanges. They have what\u2019s called a total out-of-pocket cost calculator so that when you\u2019re comparing a few plans, you\u2019re not only seeing what the premium is for the plan but you see an estimate of what your out-of-pocket spending would be on that plan. If you\u2019re a traditional user or if you entered more data, then there could be an estimate that\u2019s based on your particular usage patterns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more consumers are expected to share in cost through cost-sharing, the more they\u2019re going to want good transparency around what those costs may be to them.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What are the biggest challenges that health payers face when it comes to cost and data transparency? Are there any solutions to these problems?\n\nKatherine Hempstead: \u201cIt depends on the market segment. I definitely think that most carriers would still probably say out-of-network issues in most states and provider high-negotiated rates, provider prices, and, of course, pharmaceutical prices are some of their biggest and most difficult cost items to control.\u201d\n\nJoel Ario: \u201cI do think that consumer education is an important part of this as well. The consumers that are not used to having a lot of cost-sharing and, therefore, aren\u2019t very well educated about what deductibles mean and what copayments mean. Increasingly, you want improvements in consumer literacy, which take not just data being available but, more importantly, consumer tools of the sort that you see on these web pages that help people sort through their options and understand them and help them become more literate consumers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The health insurance industry could benefit from greater cost transparency, as it could bring new methods for lowering healthcare spending.", "author": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/why-payers-should-improve-cost-transparency-for-consumers", "site_name": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "image": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Healthcare_Money.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Why Payers Should Improve Cost Transparency for Consumers"}, "twitter": {"description": "The health insurance industry could benefit from greater cost transparency, as it could bring new methods for lowering healthcare spending.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Healthcare_Money.jpg"}, "title": "Why Payers Should Improve Cost Transparency for Consumers", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Federal and state regulators aiming at reducing healthcare spending would benefit from creating new legislation focused on improving cost transparency.\n\u201cWhen consumers are making choices between plans, they need to have as much information as possible.\u201dHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What steps can health payers and federal regulators take to improve cost transparency for the average consumer?\nThe health insurance industry could benefit from greater cost transparency, as it could bring new methods for lowering healthcare spending and create a more competitive market among providers.\nWhat\u2019s in the formularies and provider directories?\u201d Ario spoke about some of the transparency issues relevant to consumer decisions.\nOne report called Liberating Data to Enable Healthcare Market Transparency: A Guide for Regulators and Policy Makers outlined that, despite the reforms and provisions of the Affordable Care Act, consumers are still not receiving enough data and cost transparency when it comes to their health insurance options."}
