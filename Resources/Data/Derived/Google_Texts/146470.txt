The homegrown STEAM Fest, started by four Boulderites, requires every exhibitor to include an activity, said Martha Lanaghen, an event co-founder.

There’s an obstacle course for computer coders, a bubbles exhibit and an AMA-sanctioned drone competition. You can also buy and build your own robot, learn to program it and race it. A video game organization will have a living room set up to play games that have not yet been released.

“Grab a soldering iron and learn to solder. Program a Lego robot. That’s the whole idea. It’s all hands on. All science and arts,” Lanaghen said. “You are given an opportunity to play, it’s not just a walk-on-by event.”

The event also has an educators track. Classes are included in the admission fee. One of the featured speakers is Temple Grandin, an animal science professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.
