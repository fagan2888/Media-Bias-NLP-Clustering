Satur said the warrant was served by the police department's SWAT team and its Special Enforcement Unit about 10:15 p.m. Friday.

“At this time, we still have an open investigation and we cannot release any further details,” Satur said in a Friday night email he sent about half an hour after the search began.

That remained the situation on Saturday afternoon, when Satur said that no more information about the case and what prompted the search -- or whether any arrests have yet been made -- were ready to be made public.

He said he'd issued the Friday night information about why the police were there "because SWAT usually causes a little stir in the neighborhood" when those officers show up.

Satur said, however, that the Emery Street search was unrelated to a Friday morning raid at Collyer St., a home where five people were arrested and a 5-month-old baby removed. Police said that Collyer Street home was believed to be a flophouse and home base for meth dealers.
