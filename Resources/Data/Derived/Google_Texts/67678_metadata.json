After a \u201cwindow shopping\u201d period last week, MarylandHealthConnection.gov will be fully accessible for signups on Wednesday, Nov. 19.\n\nThe website, which serves as the primary portal for Maryland users to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, will be closely watched. For one thing, it represents the Free State\u2019s version of the political lightning rod known as Obamacare. As if that\u2019s not enough cause for scrutiny, it didn\u2019t work so well last time.\n\nOn October 1, 2013, the site crashed within minutes of launching. In the ensuing months, the exchange hobbled along, and state officials decided to send some consumers to the federal exchange portal at HealthCare.gov. In the end, the state canned its $193 million contract with Noridian Healthcare Solutions, and scrapped the website.\n\nWith new contractors, Baltimore\u2019s Deliotte Consulting and Columbia-based Optum-QSSI, as well as a new website, the state \u2014 and the public \u2014 is looking for a better experience this time around that will attract more users.\n\nWe reached out to the Maryland Health Connection to see what has changed. Here are five differences that the marketing and outreach director Andrew Ratner highlighted:\n\nIt Has a New Platform: For the new website, Maryland used a platform that saw success for the state of Connecticut. With even the feds\u2019 version, HealthCare.gov, limping out of the gate, Connecticut was one of the few successes in 2013\u2019s initial exchange rollout. As a result, the man who ran the Connecticut exchange is now running HealthCare.gov, and states like Maryland are looking to use their success as a model. It\u2019s Incremental: According to Ratner, state officials have \u201cperformed months of extensive testing in advance of go-live to make sure that Connecticut\u2019s technology aligns with Maryland\u2019s system and meets the needs of consumers.\u201d After the testing period, the site was opened for \u201cwindow shopping\u201d last week, meaning customers could peruse their options, but couldn\u2019t sign up for a plan. As of Friday, 26,000 people had already compared prices before the site went live, according to Ratner. The launch is further staggered this week. The state\u2019s call center opened on Sunday, navigators and case workers will help clients sign up on Monday and Tuesday this week, and the site will be opened to the general public on Wednesday. This means the system won\u2019t be inundated all at once. It\u2019s Anonymous: One of the site\u2019s new features is anonymous browsing. That allows consumers to browse their options for coverage without having to pony up any personal information. Last year, healthcare shoppers had to enter personal data \u2014 including Social Security numbers \u2014 as soon as they logged in. That led to frozen screens and bottlenecks within the exchange servers. This year, they\u2019ll only have to provide personal data after they decide on a plan. It\u2019s More Specific: The new website provides more information about specific plans. Beyond just the premium, enrollees can see information about cost-sharing, and even get access to the cheapest plans in some classifications. Once they sign up, enrollees will also be able to receive notices in the mail and online. It\u2019s Automated: The new website also features upgraded back-end technology, which is designed to ensure sure applications will actually go through. According to Ratner, the new system uses a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) rules engine to determine applicants\u2019 eligibility for subsidies, and their options. \u201cThis rules engine is the same for both the self-service public portal and the caseworker portal, providing consistent eligibility outcomes to all users,\u201d Ratner said. Once consumers navigate the enrollment process, their information will be automatically sent to insurance carriers. That\u2019s a difference from last year, when the back-end often failed to match policies with providers. According to Ratner, the data will be securely sent, following federal protocol.\n\nOverall, \u201cMaryland\u2019s incremental roll out strategy, along with anonymous browsing, has given consumers more time to fully explore their options so they can make informed decisions about the health care coverage that is best for themselves and their families,\u201d Ratner said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe shall soon see.\n\n-30-", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new Maryland health exchange website features anonymous browsing, new back-end technology.", "og": {"site_name": "Technical.ly Baltimore", "description": "The new Maryland health exchange website features anonymous browsing, new back-end technology.", "title": "5 upgrades to Maryland's health exchange website for 2014 - Technical.ly Baltimore", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1094, "identifier": "http://technical.ly/baltimore/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/11/maryland.png", "height": 542}, "updated_time": "2014-11-18T01:18:57-04:00", "url": "http://technical.ly/baltimore/2014/11/18/5-upgrades-maryland-health-exchange-website-2014-open-enrollment/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Technical.ly Baltimore", "description": "After crashing in 2013, the new MarylandHealthConnection.gov features anonymous browsing, new back-end technology and an incremental rollout.", "creator": "@stephenbabcock", "url": "http://technical.ly/baltimore/2014/11/18/5-upgrades-maryland-health-exchange-website-2014-open-enrollment/", "image": "http://technical.ly/baltimore/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/11/maryland-400x198.png", "title": "5 upgrades to Maryland\u2019s health exchange website for 2014", "site": "@technicallybmr", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1011285523}, "article": {"section": "Civic", "tag": "state government", "published_time": "2014-11-18T08:56:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-18T01:18:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=0.96,width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced34\"", "article_summary": "In the ensuing months, the exchange hobbled along, and state officials decided to send some consumers to the federal exchange portal at HealthCare.gov.\nThe new version of Maryland\u2019s state-run health exchange is live and looking for new enrollees.\nIn the end, the state canned its $193 million contract with Noridian Healthcare Solutions, and scrapped the website.\nThe website, which serves as the primary portal for Maryland users to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, will be closely watched.\nIt\u2019s Automated: The new website also features upgraded back-end technology, which is designed to ensure sure applications will actually go through."}
