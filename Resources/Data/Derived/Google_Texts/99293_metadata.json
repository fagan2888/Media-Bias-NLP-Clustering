Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) voting present. Senators are expected to accept the patch to prevent an interruption in the nation's infrastructure spending during the busy summer construction season.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe House adjourned for the traditional August recess after the vote, forcing the Senate's hand.\n\nBut senators are planning to stay in Washington next week, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellRyan seeks to put stamp on GOP in Trump era Trump and Ryan to speak by phone Bill would require nominees to release tax returns MORE (R-Ky.) has vowed to finish a six-year transportation bill to jumpstart conference negotiations on a final bill.\n\nRepublican leaders sought to downplay the squabbling between the chambers as they punted the highway debate to the fall.\n\n\"Sen. McConnell and I, while we have a disagreement over this bill \u2014 we've had one \u2014 we both want to get to a long-term highway bill,\" Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return GOP senator: Reid's 'ramblings' are 'bitter, vulgar, incoherent' MORE (R-Ohio) said ahead of the vote.\n\n\"And Sen. McConnell and I have, frankly, worked very closely trying to minimize the differences,\" he continued. \"And so I'm confident as we get into this fall we're going to have \u2026 pretty smooth sailing.\"\n\nThe fight over road funding has cut across both parties, with Senate and House Republicans pitted against one another, and Democrats also divided in the Senate.\n\nHouse Republicans earlier this month approved a five-month funding extension, seeking to buy time for negotiations with the White House over a long-term bill funded by tax reform.\n\nBut rather than take up the five-month bill, McConnell negotiated a long-term funding measure with Sen. Barbara Boxer Barbara BoxerThe Hill's 12:30 Report Sen.

Since 2005, lawmakers have not passed a transportation bill that lasted longer than two years.\n\nThe decision to fund highways for three months also means the Export-Import Bank\u2019s charter will remain expired through the August recess.\n\nThe Senate highway bill includes a four-year renewal of the bank, which has run into opposition from conservatives but is backed by the White House, Democrats and a portion of the GOP.\n\nBut the House\u2019s three-month bill does not include Ex-Im, leaving the bank in limbo.\n\nThe House patch includes language allowing the Veterans Affairs Department to shift $3 billion within the agency to shore up a budget shortfall so hospitals and other facilities don\u2019t close in August, aides said.\n\nThe legislation also would ensure that veterans with service-related disabilities could use health saving accounts.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The measure would extend federal transportation funding until the end of October.", "description": "The measure would extend federal transportation funding until the end of October.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The measure would extend federal transportation funding until the end of October.", "title": "House passes three-month highway bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/249685-house-approves-three-month-highway-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/highway_012314thinkstock.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/249685-house-approves-three-month-highway-bill", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-29T17:34-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Mitch McConnell, Barbara Boxer, John Boehner, Boehner,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-29T17:34:06-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/249685-house-approves-three-month-highway-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The measure would extend federal transportation funding until the end of October.", "card": "summary", "title": "House passes three-month highway bill"}, "dcterms.title": "House passes three-month highway bill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffa3\"", "article_summary": "\"We'll take up that bill once the House sends it to us, and we'll continue working in the interim to finish our own multiyear highway bill, a bill that's fiscally responsible and won't raise taxes by a penny.\"\n\"In the meantime, we'll work with our friends in the House to give them the space they need to develop a multiyear highway bill,\" McConnell continued.\n\"That's especially true when you're talking about a measure as complicated and consequential as a multiyear highway bill.\"\nThe Senate highway bill includes a four-year renewal of the bank, which has run into opposition from conservatives but is backed by the White House, Democrats and a portion of the GOP.\nSince 2005, lawmakers have not passed a transportation bill that lasted longer than two years."}
