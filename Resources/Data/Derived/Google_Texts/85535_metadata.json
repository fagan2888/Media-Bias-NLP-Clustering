The kicker is that an additional 50% expects to cut back over the next five years.\n\nAlso, while 10% of the respondents have eliminated coverage for spouses and domestic partners with access to other coverage, 49% more are looking at doing that within five years.\n\nFurther, the proportion of companies adopting a \u201cunitized\u201d pricing approach, where employee contributions to health benefits are on a per-person basis, may expand from 5% now to 52% in five years. In such an arrangement, an employee with, say, five kids would pay a higher premium than one with four kids, and so on, rather than both having access to the same \u201cfamily\u201d plan at the same price a family with one or two kids would pay.\n\n\u201cPlan sponsors with generous dependent subsidy levels often become an \u2018employer of choice\u2019 for people who don\u2019t work there,\u201d says Jim Winkler, Aon Hewitt\u2019s chief innovation officer for health and benefits.\n\nIn cases where coverage is needed for only an employee and a spouse or domestic partner, it\u2019s commonly assumed that prohibiting the latter from using the employer\u2019s insurance when access to another employer\u2019s insurance is available is more expensive for the couple. But, says Winkler, that\u2019s not true unless, again, the premium rate for the non-employee is overly generous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the case for a long time that most employers subsidize employees more generously than their adult dependents,\u201d Winkler says. \u201cSo, assuming the two employers\u2019 plans are relatively on par with one another, paying for two employee-only plans will cost less than a single employee-plus-one plan.\u201d\n\nStill, having such a policy for adult-dependent coverage may be problematic, in that the company would be treating two groups of workers differently. Some would have spouses who don\u2019t work and thus are eligible for coverage, while working spouses with access to their own separate coverage wouldn\u2019t be, or perhaps they\u2019d be required to pay a surcharge. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d Winkler points out.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the arguments in favor of unitized pricing, he notes: it is inherently fair, as employees pay an incremental price for each person covered.\n\nImage: Momsrising.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're reducing dependent subsidies, eliminating coverage for some spouses and ditching 'family' plans in favor of per-person pricing.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Companies Get Stingier on Dependent Health Coverage\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2014\\/09\\/companies-get-stingier-on-dependent-coverage\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-12 11:25:07\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-12 11:25:07\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":261020,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"Aon Hewitt\",\"dependent coverage\",\"dependent health coverage\",\"Jim Winkler\",\"spousal coverage\"],\"categories\":[\"Corporate Finance\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/09\\/clip_image006.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "They're reducing dependent subsidies, eliminating coverage for some spouses and ditching 'family' plans in favor of per-person pricing.", "title": "Companies Get Stingier on Dependent Coverage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2014/09/clip_image006.jpg", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2014/09/companies-get-stingier-on-dependent-coverage/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "They're reducing dependent subsidies, eliminating coverage for some spouses and ditching 'family' plans in favor of per-person pricing.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Companies Get Stingier on Dependent Coverage", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Companies Get Stingier on Dependent Health Coverage", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20140912, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Human Capital & Careers", "tag": "unitized pricing", "published_time": "2014-09-12T11:25:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "aon hewitt, dependent coverage, dependent health coverage, jim winkler, spousal coverage, unitized pricing"}, "article_summary": "Also, while 10% of the respondents have eliminated coverage for spouses and domestic partners with access to other coverage, 49% more are looking at doing that within five years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the case for a long time that most employers subsidize employees more generously than their adult dependents,\u201d Winkler says.\nSome would have spouses who don\u2019t work and thus are eligible for coverage, while working spouses with access to their own separate coverage wouldn\u2019t be, or perhaps they\u2019d be required to pay a surcharge.\nIn a recent survey by consulting firm Aon Hewitt, 22% of 1,234 responding employers have already reduced their subsidies for covered dependents.\nFurther, the proportion of companies adopting a \u201cunitized\u201d pricing approach, where employee contributions to health benefits are on a per-person basis, may expand from 5% now to 52% in five years."}
