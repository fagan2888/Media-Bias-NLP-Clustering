There are plenty of factors that go into selecting a season\u2019s roster of operas; in this case, casting is an arduous task, with the title role demanding a weighty tenor voice and an artist with high acting skills.\n\nLast year, Pittsburgh Opera discovered its Otello in Carl Tanner, who made his local debut as Radames in another Verdi opera, \u201cAida.\u201d The tenor is becoming a regular in Pittsburgh, having performed in the company\u2019s gala concert last month.\n\nStaging this opera following a long break has several draws. The composer, plot and, one might say, musical language are familiar, even if the work itself is not; it provides another avenue for the company to expand the musical \u201ccontract\u201d it has with local audiences, as general director Christopher Hahn has told me.\n\nAlso compelling was the opportunity to cast Danielle Pastin, a former resident artist who still lives in Pittsburgh, as Desdemona. It was the soprano\u2019s debut in this demanding role, although she sang it like a veteran, with a liquid, honeyed tone that from her first entrance onward captured her character\u2019s purity and innocence. Those abilities were on display, too, in the major solos of the final act, Ave Maria and the Willow Song \u2014 was any moment more gut-wrenching than her farewell to Emilia (Laurel Semerdjian)? Watching a locally developed talent thrive in this production was the most rewarding part of the evening.\n\nMr. Tanner has lingering bronchitis, as Mr. Hahn announced from the stage after the first intermission. But outside of a few snaps and crackles (and a somewhat smaller size compared to last year\u2019s Radames), he still had a lot of pop in his voice, especially in a powerful second act duet with Iago that culminated in climactic high notes. One hopes his hoarseness doesn\u2019t worsen over the coming week.\n\nThe solid Iago of Anthony Michaels-Moore featured an attractive russet tone that somewhat lacked the edge of the opera\u2019s devilish character. Dressed in the 16th-century equivalent of motorcycle gear, the baritone had a slimy presence that elevated the dramatic element of the production directed by Kristine McIntyre.\n\nCurrent and former resident artists filled out most of the remaining roles, including a bright Cassio (Daniel Curran) and a confidently sung Montano (Alex DeSocio). Antony Walker conducted the orchestra, drawing out commendable woodwind solos but making some surprising tempo selections, as in an overly leisurely drinking song of the first act. The chorus sounded a bit thin in the opening scene, generating more grandeur by the third act.\n\nAllen Charles Klein\u2019s set, provided by Cincinnati Opera, allowed for two tiers of action with a wide staircase leading to a second-level stage. It was given a disquieting quality with red and blue lighting, designed by Marcus Dilliard.\n\nRepeats 7 p.m. Tuesday, 7:30 p.m. Friday and 2 p.m. Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tenor Carl Tanner had lots of pop in his voice in the title role despite lingering bronchitis.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Until Saturday night at the Benedum Center, it had been almost a quarter-century since Pittsburgh Opera last produced Verdi\u2019s \u201cOtello.\u201d Written late in the composer\u2019s career, the opera is a masterpiece not only for its music but for its libretto, by Arrigo Boito, that successfully adapted Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy for the operatic stage.
