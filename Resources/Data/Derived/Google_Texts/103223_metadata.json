Tim Bishop until late June, but Democrats are already trying to corner New York State Senator Lee Zeldin, who is vying for the GOP nomination.\n\nAs with Republicans hopefuls around the country, Democrats are hitting Zeldin for waffling on Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposal.\n\nZeldin won't say how he\u2019d vote the Ryan budget. He side-stepped the question in an interview Wednesday, saying Bishop should offer his own plan to balance the budget.\n\n\u201cI would like to talk about what is good and not good about both to figure out what the best plan is for next year,\u201d Zeldin said.\n\nBishop this spring voted against the Ryan plan and for a Democratic alternative.\n\nThe issue is one example of a pattern playing out in contested House races around the country: National Democrats want to attack Republicans for supporting Ryan\u2019s plan to cut Medicare and a host of other programs. If Republicans decline to give them the chance, Democrats attack them for ducking the question.\n\nFor Republicans challengers running in close districts like Bishop\u2019s NY-1 steering clear of the Ryan budget looks like the politically wise choice. Those challengers want to run against Obamacare and bad votes their opponent took. They can take advantage of their lack of incumbency by avoiding controversial issues Congress considered. Endorsing Ryan\u2019s proposal hands Democrats an easy line of attack.\n\nBut Zeldin, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, has talked expansively about the importance of \u201cpersonal courage\u201d on the stump.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee argues he is not showing much by declining to weigh in on the Ryan budget and other matters.\n\nThe DCCC on Wednesday announced they were sending Zeldin a version of the \u201cbadge of courage\u201d awarded to the Cowardly Lion in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d They said it will help him \u201cfind the courage to take a position on the Ryan Budget and other critical issues impacting Long Island.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s taking him so long to decide?\u201d a spokesman for the Democratic campaign arm said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one answer: Zeldin is either woefully uninformed, willfully ignorant or a coward.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC also released an $8.99 Amazon receipt for the purchase and photo-shopped image of Zeldin in a Cowardly Lion outfit.\n\nZeldin wouldn\u2019t take the bait interview Wednesday, repeatedly responding to questions about his views by focusing on Bishop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the height of irony and hypocrisy the Democratic operatives in Washington would be doing this given that I have repeatedly called on the Congressman to release his plan to balance the budget, so we can have a debate about what is good and not good about the Ryan budget and the Bishop budget,\u201d Zeldin said.\n\n\u201cHe is always trying to deflect and spin to try to make every election about someone else,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1792078.1403207995!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/badge-courage-wizard-oz-2.jpg", "description": "Republicans won\u2019t pick a nominee to take on Long Island Rep.
