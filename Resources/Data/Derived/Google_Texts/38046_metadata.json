I asked that question on Twitter on Monday, after the Texas senator announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCan you even imagine what a White House Science Fair might look like under Ted Cruz? \u2014 rebleber\n\nThe same day, President Barack Obama hosted the White House\u2019s fifth-annual science fair\u2014the event that once brought us the Marshmallow Cannon. It showcased experiments like a group of 6-year-old girl's page-turning robot and a high school senior\u2019s test to predict a cardiac arrest. The point of the event is to encourage kids to pursue an education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The U.S. lags much of the world in these areas, ranking 35th out of 64 countries in math and 27th in science among 15-year-olds internationally.\n\nBut if Cruz occupied the White House, it's fair to say that he would take the science fair in a more ... creative direction:\n\nNoah's Ark recreation\n\nWhile Cruz hasn't said revealed how old he thinks the Earth is, he did announce his candidacy at Liberty University, a Christian school that teaches students the Earth is only 6,000 years old. Students attending the school's Center for Creation Studies learn about the \"creation-evolution controversy\" and develop a \"consistent biblical view of origins.\" Cruz would no doubt want to see these teachings represented at his science fair\u2014perhaps by recreating the wooden vessel that allegedly preserved the world's fauna from a massive flood?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Can you imagine what a White House Science Fair would look like under a President Ted Cruz?
