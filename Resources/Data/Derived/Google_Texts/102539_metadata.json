Cox, executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, wrote in a USA Today column.\n\nAfter the mass shooting Dec. 2 that left 14 dead and 21 wounded in California, Obama called on Congress to pass more gun controls to make it harder for Americans to attain firearms.\n\n\u201cThe NRA is calling on the president to stop exploiting tragedies to push his failed political agenda,\u201d Cox writes, adding:\n\nIt\u2019s shameful. Given the reality that he\u2019s unlikely to listen, however, we will continue to stand and fight for law-abiding gun owners who are both disgusted and heartbroken by these heinous acts\u2014whether committed by madmen, gang members or terrorists.\n\nAuthorities said Syed Farook, 28, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, 27, killed 14 people in a conference room who were attending a holiday party for Farook and fellow county employees, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe AP reported that Malik had pledged her allegiance to the Islamic State, or ISIS, and the leader of the terrorist army in a Facebook post written around the time of shooting. The FBI said Friday it would investigate the shooting as an act of terrorism.\n\nThe couple were both Pakistani. Farook was born in America, while Malik came here from Saudi Arabia in 2014 on a fianc\u00e9e visa. They died in a gun battle with police.\n\nAlthough the San Bernardino attack soon was reported to be \u201cthe deadliest Islamic terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11,\u201d Democrats quickly called for stricter gun laws.\n\n\u201cSensible gun laws work,\u201d Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in a press conference Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve proven it in California. And we\u2019re not going to give up.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Congress pushed back against their Democratic colleagues\u2019 urge to tighten gun laws.\n\nIn his column, the NRA\u2019s Cox notes that California has the strictest gun control laws in the country:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThe NRA calls on the president to stop exploiting tragedies to push his failed political agenda,\u201d Chris W.
