Before finalizing the recommendation, the USPSTF is inviting public comments on the draft statement until March 10, 2014.

The Task Force is an independent group of national experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine that works to improve the health of all Americans by making evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services such as screenings, counseling services, and preventive medications.

After reviewing the evidence, the Task Force draft recommendation calls for screening people who have the following risk factors for hepatitis B:

People who were born in countries and regions with a high prevalence of HBV infection, such as Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the northern countries in South America.
