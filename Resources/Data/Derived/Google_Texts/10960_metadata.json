Drivers who accumulate too many negative reviews will get a warning and could be suspended if they fail to scrub up.\n\nMuhammad Ali, 44, wants to supplement the salary he earns working in a bank by driving a motorcycle taxi in the evenings. He has come prepared for the odor test.\n\n\"I have brought Rexona (deodorant) because, according to my wife, I have smelly body odor,\" he said. \"But I am really optimistic I can pass all the tests today.\"\n\n(Editing by Michael Perry)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - So stiff is competition between Indonesia's motorcycle taxis app c", "title": "Smell test for Indonesia's motorcycle taxi candidates", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/11/Smell-test-Indonesias-motorcycle-taxi-candidates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/indonesia-transportation_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/11/Smell-test-Indonesias-motorcycle-taxi-candidates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/indonesia-transportation_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - So stiff is competition between Indonesia's motorcycle taxis app c", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - So stiff is competition between Indonesia's motorcycle taxis app companies that new entrants are going to extreme lengths to stand out.\n\"The ones who have sweat smell and armpit smell mixed we don't give a pass.\"\nMuhammad Ali, 44, wants to supplement the salary he earns working in a bank by driving a motorcycle taxi in the evenings.\n\"I have already found many types of body odor smell,\" he says, clutching a clipboard which he uses to score candidates as they stand, arms outstretched, in front of a fan meant to simulate the headwind of a motorcycle ride.\nAris Wahyudi, the founder of the newest motorcycle-sharing company, reckons he has found a unique way to win business: not-so-smelly drivers."}
