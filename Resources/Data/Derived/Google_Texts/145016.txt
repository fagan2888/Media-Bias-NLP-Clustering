– Aric Holman’s first year at Mississippi State has been temporarily put on hold due to micro fracture surgery he’ll undergo this week on his left knee to correct a patellofemoral disorder.

In four months, he’ll be evaluated to see if he can return for conference play or if he’ll be redshirted.

The 6-foot-10, 195-pound forward from Owensboro, Ky., signed with MSU in May following a stellar prep career that included a state championship his senior year and an invitation to play in the prestigious Kentucky-Indiana All-Star game.

“I really hate this for Aric,” MSU coach Ben Howland said. “He has worked so hard this summer to improve and prepare for college basketball. I know he’ll do everything he can to recover and put himself in a position to come back stronger.”

The chronic disorder causes pain in the front of the knee under the patella and is common among athletes. It’s a result of repetitive stress that wears down the cartilage and eventually leads to the cartilage detaching from the bone.

Mississippi State, considered the team to watch by numerous basketball publications, begins practice on Oct. 5 and opens the season at home against Eastern Washington on Nov. 13.
