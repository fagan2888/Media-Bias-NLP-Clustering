However, the nutritional labels that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires food manufacturers to place on packaged groceries says the percentages \u201care based on a 2,000 calorie diet.\u201d\n\nAnd those 2,000 calories are supposed to be consumed in an entire day, not one meal.\n\nRestaurants have not historically been required to provide consumers with nutritional facts about their meals. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also referred to as Obamacare, changed that, requiring restaurants to display calories on menus and menu boards. While some provisions took effect immediately in 2010, the FDA\u2019s final ruling on the requirement takes effect in December.\n\nThis year\u2019s top chain restaurant diet-buster came from Red Lobster:\n\nRed Lobster\u2019s Create Your Own Combination (and Lobsterita drink)\n\nWhat you order: The combination comes with three dishes (CSPI chose Parrot Isle Jumbo Coconut Shrimp, Walt\u2019s Favorite Shrimp and Shrimp Linguine Alfredo), a side (french fries) and salad (Caesar). CSPI also added one Cheddar Bay Biscuit and ordered the 24-ounce Lobsterita alcoholic beverage.\n\nWhat you get: The meal combination has 2,710 calories, 37 grams of saturated fat and 6,530 mg of sodium. (\u201cIt\u2019s like eating an eight-piece bucket of KFC Original Recipe chicken with four sides of mashed potatoes with gravy, four pieces of corn on the cob, and eight packets of \u2018buttery spread,'\u201d CSPI quips.) The chain\u2019s signature extra-large margarita adds an additional 890 calories and 860 mg of sodium, bringing the grand total to 3,600 calories.\n\nYou can see the rest of the list at the CSPI website.\n\nLike this story?
