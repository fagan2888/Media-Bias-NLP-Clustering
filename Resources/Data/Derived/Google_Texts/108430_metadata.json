She previously put off a medical procedure because of cost. But with the threat of losing part of her vision a real possibility, she came to Emory to see a specialist.\n\nMitchell just learned she'll need a third eye surgery.\n\nWhile that's scary, it's not as worrisome as \"further co-pays [and] more out-of-pocket expenses,\u201d Mitchell says.\n\nMitchell notes she's pleased with her insurance \u2013 a silver-level plan she purchased through the insurance marketplace \u2013 but she says she struggles to keep up with her part of the bills.\n\n\u201cIf not for having availability on my credit card, we\u2019d probably be in the poor house,\u201d she says.\n\nMitchell notes she owes upward of $20,000. Each month, interest accrues. If she undergoes that third eye surgery, she\u2019ll face a $4,000 deductible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big burden,\u201d Mitchell says.\n\nA study released Thursday by Families USA shows a lot of folks with coverage like Mitchell's feel a similar burden.\n\n\u201cConsumers are still struggling with unaffordable, out-of-pocket costs,\" says Lydia Mitts, a Senior Policy Analyst with Families USA. The non-profit\u2019s new study shows many who buy their own insurance avoid seeking medical treatment because of cost.\n\n\u201cOne in four adults who were fully insured for the whole year still reported they went without some needed medical care because they couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d says Mitts.\n\nMitts says the majority of people who buy insurance on state or federal exchanges pick silver-level plans, which often carry a lower premium with a high deductible \u2013 $1,500 or more.\n\nMany in that situation skip follow-up care and don\u2019t fill prescriptions, which Mitts says only adds to long-term complications and costs.\n\nBut Mitts says it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\n\nShe points to Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida and Arizona, all of which have done away with deductibles on some silver-level insurance plans \u2013 which is the most common type of plan.\n\nSome other states \u2013 not including Georgia \u2013 require only a small co-pay for basic services.\n\nWhile co-pays, deductibles and co-insurance weigh heavy on Renee Mitchell's mind, they're not her only insurance concern. She says her monthly premium is getting more expensive due to her age. This year, she says, it jumped about $100 a month.\n\nMitchell wants to be clear though: she\u2019s not looking for a handout.\n\n\u201cI feel like people seem to think that we just want something for nothing,\" she says, tears in her eyes. \"I worked a lot of years. I took an early retirement to take care of my family. It\u2019s not my fault, so to speak, that I\u2019m here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "The main purpose of the Affordable Care Act is to provide affordable health insurance to those who might not otherwise be able to afford it.
