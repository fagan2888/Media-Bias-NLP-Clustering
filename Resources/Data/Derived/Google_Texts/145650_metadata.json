The absence of any serious mention of Israel-Palestine during the first Democratic presidential debate thus speaks volumes. It tells us that even as polls show more and more of the Democratic base shifting its support away from Israel, the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination are reluctant to talk about Israel. It will be interesting to see if they shift their stances at all in the next few months, given the stakes that are emerging. Recent polls have shown that Latinos, a critical constituency, are lending their sympathy to the Palestinians. They join the young, progressives, Blacks, and Asian Americans. This is not only the perception of supporters of Palestinian rights, this point of view is shared by advocates of Israel as well.\n\nEverything seems in play, and that calls for our attention. Here\u2019s what is unfolding on the American political scene:\n\nTo begin with, let\u2019s look at the reactions of the U.S. State Department regarding the escalation of violence in Israel-Palestine. On October 13, Secretary of State John Kerry declared \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that, unless we get going, a two-state solution could conceivably be stolen from everybody\u2026 And there\u2019s been a massive increase in settlements over the course of the last years, and now you have this violence because there\u2019s a frustration that is growing.\u201d\n\nUpon being accused of laying the blame for the violence on the building of settlements, the State Department rushed to back off from the October 13 statement:\n\n\u201cState Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Kerry had not been \u2018trying to affix\u2026 blame for the recent violence\u2019 during a Tuesday evening address at Harvard University, when the secretary told his audience that \u2018there\u2019s been a massive increase in settlements over the course of the last years and there\u2019s an increase in the violence because there\u2019s this frustration that\u2019s growing.\u2019 The two ideas, Kirby suggested, were not meant to be interpreted causally.\u201d\n\nRight. It\u2019s hard to believe anyone bought that spin. What this flip-flop indicates is precisely the fluid state of our political discourse on Israel-Palestine.\n\nIt is much more likely that Kerry knows exactly who is to blame for the violence, and his reaction to Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s bizarre and macabre statement that the blame for the Holocaust lay not with Adolf Hitler but with the Mufti of Jerusalem showed his growing impatience with the behavior of the Israeli government. Although he said after his October 22 meeting in Berlin with Netanyahu that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic,\u201d that feeble pronouncement, behooving a compassionate physician at the bedside of a terminal patient, was overshadowed by his statement in reaction to Netanyahu\u2019s Holocaust thesis:\n\nWe have to stop incitement, we have to stop the violence. And I think it\u2019s critical\u2026 It is absolutely critical to end all incitement and all violence, and to find a road forward to build the possibility that is not there today for a larger process.\n\nAnd this time the State Department, instead of retreating, doubled down. John Kirby characterized Netanyahu\u2019s comments as \u201cinflammatory\u201d and \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d and contradicted by \u201cscholarly evidence.\u201d\n\nAs we leave the State Department having to come up with a way to actually deal with the situation in real time, what about the presidential candidates?\n\nPredictably, the Republican candidates are either silent or unabashedly pro-Israel. Senator Ted Cruz said the U.S. should \u201cstop lecturing the Israelis,\u201d and suggested again that Kerry should resign, demonstrating once again that he cannot process the basic idea that if you annually give a country billions of dollars in aid, high-grade arms, and nearly unlimited diplomatic cover, you might allow yourself a word or two about the way they spend all those resources. Ben Carson similarly added his unequivocal support for Israel, seeming to want to make up in part for having used the Holocaust as an opening for arguing for easy access to guns. (\u201cWhat would have been the impact on Hitler\u2019s war machine if his victims had had more access to guns? It is something that we will never know for sure.\u201d)\n\nIn terms of the Democrats, not much as been said. During the first debate, Jim Webb spoke briefly about the Iran deal. Then, nothing. As the Israeli news source Ha\u2019aretz put it:\n\nNeither Hillary Clinton nor Senator Bernie Saunders picked up on the point. They had both supported the Iran appeasement, oblivious to the pleas of the Jewish state. Sanders was the first Democrat to declare that he would boycott Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s speech to the Senate. Clinton has stood silent during the feud between Obama and the government in Jerusalem. There were no expressions of concern over the build up of rockets by Hezbollah, of the Iranians above the Golan. Zilch.\n\nBut there is a discernible difference between the ways Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton talk about Israel-Palestine. Despite the fact that Sanders lost several family members in the Holocaust, his position is the more balanced one. Though the Forward asserts he is a \u201clefty except Israel,\u201d he seems a lefty compared to Clinton. Here is Bernie Sanders on Israel in a 2013 interview in Playboy; nothing he has said since indicates any change in position:\n\nIf you had the power, how would you negotiate an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where fundamentalism is so strong? The hatred, violence and loss of life that define this conflict make living an ordinary life a constant struggle for both peoples. We must work with those Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are committed to peace, security and statehood rather than to empty rhetoric and violence. A two-state solution must include compromises from both sides to achieve a fair and lasting peace in the region. The Palestinians must fulfill their responsibilities to end terrorism against Israel and recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. In return, the Israelis must end their policy of targeted killings, prevent further Israeli settlements on Palestinian land and prevent the destruction of Palestinian homes, businesses and infrastructure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most recent flare-up in the Middle East reveals America's shifting political fault lines", "title": "America is changing its mind on Israel: How Netanyahu is alienating his most essential ally", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The most recent flare-up in the Middle East reveals America's shifting political fault lines", "title": "America is changing its mind on Israel: How Netanyahu is alienating his most essential ally", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/25/america_is_changing_its_mind_on_israel_how_netanyahu_is_alienating_his_most_essential_ally/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/kerry_netanyahu2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The most recent flare-up in the Middle East reveals America's shifting political fault lines", "title": "America is changing its mind on Israel: How Netanyahu is alienating his most essential ally", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/kerry_netanyahu2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Palumbo-Liu", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Benjamin Netanyahu, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Israel, John Kerry, Palestine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And this time the State Department, instead of retreating, doubled down.\nHere\u2019s what is unfolding on the American political scene:To begin with, let\u2019s look at the reactions of the U.S. State Department regarding the escalation of violence in Israel-Palestine.\nThis is not only the perception of supporters of Palestinian rights, this point of view is shared by advocates of Israel as well.\nThe Palestinians must fulfill their responsibilities to end terrorism against Israel and recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist.\nThough the Forward asserts he is a \u201clefty except Israel,\u201d he seems a lefty compared to Clinton."}
