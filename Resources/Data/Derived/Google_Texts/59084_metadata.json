But Sponnick said the mission was never at risk.\n\n\u201cLiquid yydrogen is minus-423 degrees Fahrenheit, and it\u2019s extremely hard to design hardware to function at such an extremely cold temperature,\u201d Sponnick said. \u201cAs we practice and as we design our systems, we stop when the rocket is telling us that something is not right. \u201c\n\nThe fix turned out to be frequent and periodic cycling of the valves to keep them moving \u2014 a fix that was not necessary to use on Friday since Orion launched at the start of the launch window.\n\nEFT-1 brings NASA one step closer to the goal of crewed deep space flight: The agency will next launch an uncrewed Orion mission in 2018, and a crewed mission in 2021. Sponnick hopes Friday, however, will serve as inspiration for the next generation to dream big.\n\n\u201cMany of us got into this business because of the excitement of human spaceflight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was Apollo 11 as a young boy for me that got me so excited. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s events like today will serve to excite many, many others to do the same.\u201d\n\nLaura Keeney: lkeeney@denverpost.com, 303-954-1337 or twitter.com/laurakeeney", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Orion launch, flight, recovery, couldn\u2019t have gone better, ULA chief says", "title": "Orion launch, flight, recovery, couldn\u2019t have gone better, ULA chief says", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/05/orion-launch-flight-recovery-couldnt-have-gone-better-ula-chief-says/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__CD06ORIONLAUNCH_BL19853xp1-2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141205__CD06ORIONLAUNCH_BL19853xp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T12:06:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:41:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2cc\"", "article_summary": "CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. \u2014 Friday\u2019s launch, flight and recovery of NASA Orion Experimental Flight Test-1 could not have gone any better for United Launch Alliance, said an elated Jim Sponnick, vice president of ULA\u2019s Atlas and Delta rocket program.\nEFT-1 brings NASA one step closer to the goal of crewed deep space flight: The agency will next launch an uncrewed Orion mission in 2018, and a crewed mission in 2021.\nI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s events like today will serve to excite many, many others to do the same.\u201dLaura Keeney: lkeeney@denverpost.com, 303-954-1337 or twitter.com/laurakeeney\n\u201cAs we practice and as we design our systems, we stop when the rocket is telling us that something is not right.\nSponnick hopes Friday, however, will serve as inspiration for the next generation to dream big."}
