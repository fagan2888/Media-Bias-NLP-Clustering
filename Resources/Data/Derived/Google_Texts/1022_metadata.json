Unfortunately, the only two methods currently available to people who want to check for glaucoma require visits to the ophthalmologist, making early and effective treatment difficult.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the monitoring device has to be well-suited clinically and must be designed to be simple and reliable,\u201d said Tueng Shen, a collaborator and UW professor of ophthalmology, in a statement. Shen and her colleagues discovered the key to keeping tabs on glaucoma came in a tiny sensor, which physicians would implant into a person\u2019s eye during cataract surgery. Much like a person\u2019s blood pressure or heart rate, pressure on the eye fluctuates by the minute. Understanding the risk for glaucoma involves a long-term evaluation, which can only come through persistent tracking.\n\nThe sensor works by using radio frequency for wireless power and data transfer. Around the perimeter of the device is a small antenna, which picks up surrounding energy and powers a nearby pressure sensor chip. A receiver then receives the chip\u2019s signals, learning about any frequency, or pressure, difference. Senior author and professor of electrical engineering, Karl B\u00f6hringer, said the data can then be sent to a person\u2019s handheld device or possible his or her smartphone.\n\nCurrently, the prototype is still too large to fit into an artificial lens. (The team has only developed a model for cataract surgery, meaning patients with healthier eyes aren\u2019t yet eligible, in theory.) Their plan, however, argues the sensor\u2019s viability comes from its prevention efforts. Rather than undergo multiple surgeries in the future, implanting the sensor on the first cataract procedure would allow consistent feedback to forestall complications later.\n\nOther benefits include being able to avoid time-consuming follow-ups to see how a medication is faring. \u201cOftentimes damage to vision is noticed late in the game, and we can\u2019t treat patients effectively by the time they are diagnosed with glaucoma,\u201d Shen said. \u201cOr, if medications are given, there\u2019s no consistent way to check their effectiveness.\u201d\n\nMoving the lens from a prototype to a working product is the team\u2019s greatest priority, the researchers said. Being able to test the sensor on an actual artificial lens would mean a huge step forward for an aging Baby Boomer population. The ultimate goal is pricing the product so it can generate mass appeal.\n\n\u201cI think if the cost is reasonable and if the new device offers information that\u2019s not measureable by current technology,\u201d said Shen, \u201cpatients and surgeons would be really eager to adopt it.\u201d\n\nSource: Varel C, Shih Y, Otis B, Shen T, B\u00f6hringer K.
