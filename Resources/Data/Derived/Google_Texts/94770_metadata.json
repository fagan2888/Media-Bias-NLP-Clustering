(REUTERS/Yuri Gripas)\n\n4059315\n\nConservative radio host Hugh Hewitt slammed Rep. Paul Ryan Tuesday in a heated exchange over the federal spending bill\u2019s pension cuts for active duty military servicemen.\n\n\u201cThis will destroy retention, it will destroy morale and it is deeply unfair to the American military,\u201d Hewitt told Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget committee. \u201c\u2026On every level it is an outrage to what we stand for in the Republican party.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think I wanted to do this\u2026that\u2019s not true,\u201d Ryan said, later adding, \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t write this bill that\u2019s coming to the floor tomorrow\u2026this isn\u2019t a bill that I wrote.\u201d Ryan said that the House Appropriations committee wrote the bill that is expected to pass Wednesday. Ryan repeatedly claimed that he didn\u2019t want to have to support veteran cuts.\n\nThe spending bill announced in Congress this week leaves 90 percent of the veteran pension cuts from last months\u2019 Ryan-Murray budget deal in place.\n\nRyan pointed out that military servicemen have been given ten federal pay raises since 9/11. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t kick in until 2016,\u201d Ryan insisted, which will give lawmakers time to figure out \u201cperhaps another way\u201d to offset or reverse the cuts. In the meantime, Ryan said, \u201cwe just freed up $6 billion for [military] readiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not buying this,\u201d Hewitt said, referring to his audience. \u201cThey know that you can stop this and you\u2019re not\u2026\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller reported last week that a vast cross-section of Republican House members voted for the recent two-year budget deal without reading the bill and realizing that it slashes veteran pensions.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "\"Look, I didn't write this bill\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt slammed Rep.
