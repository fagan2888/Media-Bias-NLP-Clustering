Blocking Medicaid expansion.\n\nHouse Speaker William J. Howell already has contenders for his personal legacy file.\n\nBut as he approaches three decades in the General Assembly, the powerful Stafford County Republican wants Virginia to change workers\u2019 retirement benefits in the hopes of adding the commonwealth to the short list of states with zero pension-plan debt.\n\n\u201cThis would be kind of a capstone of a distinguished career of service,\u201d said Mark J. Rozell, dean of the School of Policy, Government and International Affairs at George Mason University. \u201cHe\u2019s a fiscally conservative guy. He\u2019s very proud of his record of managing the state budget responsibly.\u201d\n\nBut changing the state\u2019s retirement system is unlikely to happen easily, with many lawmakers still smarting from a round of revisions made a few years ago.\n\nIn 2012, the legislature adopted a plan that forced new hires to pay more into their retirement plans but offered them a raise to soften the blow. Now Howell wants to create a commission in the coming session to study the possibility of relying more heavily on a 401(k)-style defined-contribution plan, as is common in the private sector.\n\nSuch a change would probably cost workers and the state more in the short term, but Howell is betting that it would put Virginia\u2019s retirement funds on a long-term path to fiscal solvency.\n\n[In wake of Cantor loss, top Va. Republican faces primary challenge next year]\n\nTo that end, he\u2019s gearing up for what could be his most complicated fight yet \u2014 and one that probably wouldn\u2019t yield tangible fiscal results for years.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s better for the employee and it\u2019s better for the state,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe need to really take a hard look at our retirement plans and decide which way we want to go, what changes do we want to make.\u201d\n\nWhile Howell said a second round of reform is fraught enough to warrant study, he doesn\u2019t think the issue needs to wait for a Republican governorship to gain traction.\n\nDespite his frosty relations with Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) on a host of issues, including whether the state should accept federal dollars to insure 400,000 Virginians through the Affordable Care Act, Howell said the governor should be on board with pension reform.\n\n\u201cHe says he\u2019s a business guy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should understand this as well as anybody else. He sure doesn\u2019t want to see our bond rating jeopardized in any way.\u201d\n\nUntil there\u2019s a concrete proposal, McAuliffe is remaining mum.\n\n\u201cThe governor shares the goal of ensuring the solvency and long-term sustainability of the Virginia retirement system and is certainly open to policy conversation about the best way to do that,\u201d said McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy.\n\nThe issue doesn\u2019t fall neatly along partisan lines, but Republicans such as Howell will have some convincing to do.\n\nDel. Jennifer L. McClellan (D-Richmond), who represents many state employees, said it\u2019s too soon to tinker with the plans again.\n\n\u201cLast go-around they were understandably nervous because they hadn\u2019t had a raise and they worried about the impact reform would have on their retirement plans, which is a huge part of the compensation package we provide,\u201d she said.\n\nState Sen. John C. Watkins \u00ad(R-Powhatan), who played a leading role in the 2012 changes, shared her concerns about moving too quickly.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to get a lot of pushback from state employees and teachers unless something is done commensurately to raise compensation levels,\u201d said Watkins, who did not seek reelection this year.\n\nUnder Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R), the General Assembly passed a package of changes that meant new hires would have to contribute 5 percent of their salaries to a \u201chybrid\u201d plan, which combines the traditional defined-benefit package with a defined-contribution plan.\n\nVirginia is one of 10 states with hybrid plans. So far none of those have been able to erase their pension debt completely, but Oregon and Tennessee are close, according to Greg Mennis, director of public-sector retirement systems at the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nPension plans across the country are only 72 percent funded on average, and Virginia is slightly below that. But, Mennis said, as recently as 2002 most states were at 100 percent. That figure came down following volatile financial markets and the Great Recession.\n\nVirginia tried to fix its problem, but under the current plan workers may not be saving enough for retirement, said Mennis, who gave members of the state House Appropriations Committee a primer on the subject this month.\n\nStill, Howell and other proponents of defined-contribution plans say they\u2019re portable and make more sense in an age when workers tend to hop from job to job.\n\n\u201cThe magic of the stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes up and down, but over the long term it always seems to go up \u2014 [that] tells me that I kind of like the defined\u00ad-contribution plan better than the defined-benefit plan. But that\u2019s just my opinion.\u201d\n\nS. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he also favors more reliance on a defined-contribution \u00adplan. But for now, he\u2019s committed to having Virginia make full pension payments, which would chip away at the current $21 billion debt on plans worth $68 billion. \u201cThat would speak volumes to our commitment to addressing the unfunded liability,\u201d he said.\n\nGroups representing workers like this idea, but they are stopping short of joining Howell\u2019s call for what they see as watered-down benefits plans.\n\nR. Ronald Jordan, executive director of the Virginia Governmental Employees Association, which represents about 20 percent of state employees, said lawmakers shouldn\u2019t \u201cmake changes in retirement without making substantial changes in compensation.\u201d\n\nHowell says it\u2019s too early to talk about specifics.\n\nThe 72-year-old lawyer and grandfather with a shock of white hair also dismisses speculation about retirement and legacies, having just fought off a challenge from the right from a former political protege.\n\n\u201cI take everything a day at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just starting. I\u2019ve just won reelection, so don\u2019t be talking to me about retiring.\u201d\n\nHowell hasn\u2019t proposed touching teachers\u2019 pensions \u2014 yet \u2014 but Robley Jones, a lobbyist for the Virginia Education Association, noted that employees aren\u2019t the ones who got Virginia into debt in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe General Assembly dug the hole,\u201d he said. \u201c[Teachers], they\u2019re the ones being punished for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vapolitics, Bill Howell, Terry McAuliffe, pension", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The idea is controversial, but the powerful Republican may be looking to his legacy.", "title": "Va.
