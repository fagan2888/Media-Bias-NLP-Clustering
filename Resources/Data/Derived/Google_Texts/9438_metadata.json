No other details were announced.\n\nThe two countries also signed agreements to develop a 2250 Megawatt electricity plant with a cost of $2.2 billion, set up agriculture complexes in Sinai and develop a canal to transfer water, a statement from the Presidency said.\n\nThe statement also said that a company was set up to develop 6 square kilometers of the industrial zone around Egypt's Suez Canal worth $3.3 billion, without giving further details.\n\nThe investments are part of a change in strategy from Saudi Arabia to focus more on financial support that will also benefit Saudi Arabia with return on investment.\n\nSaudi Arabia, along with other Gulf oil producers, has pumped billions of dollars, including grants, into Egypt's flagging economy since the army toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 after mass protests against his rule.\n\nSome of the projects announced on Saturday include private sector investments. Last week the deputy head of the Saudi-Egyptian Business Council told Reuters that Saudi businessmen are investing around $4 billion in projects in Egypt and have already deposited 10 percent of that sum in Egyptian banks.\n\nEgypt is aiming for direct foreign investment of around $8-$10 billion in 2015/16.\n\nOn Friday, King Salman announced that a bridge connecting Egypt and Saudi Arabia would be built across the Red Sea. No details were given.\n\nEgypt also signed development agreements with Saudi Arabia worth $590 million, Egyptian International Cooperation Minister Sahar Nasr said on Friday.\n\nShe said the agreements, signed with the Saudi finance minister, covered development in the Sinai peninsula, agriculture, housing and a university.\n\nThe agreements also include a memorandum of understanding between Saudi Aramco and Egypt's Arab Petroleum Pipelines Company SUMED.\n\n(Reporting by Ali Abdelatty, writing by Asma Alsharif; Editing by Tom Brown and Franklin Paul)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement late on Saturday to set u", "title": "Egypt, Saudi Arabia sign 60 billion Saudi riyal investment fund pact", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/09/Egypt-Saudi-Arabia-sign-60-billion-Saudi-riyal-investment-fund-pact-state-TV", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-saudi_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/09/Egypt-Saudi-Arabia-sign-60-billion-Saudi-riyal-investment-fund-pact-state-TV", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/egypt-saudi_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement late on Saturday to set u", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The investments are part of a change in strategy from Saudi Arabia to focus more on financial support that will also benefit Saudi Arabia with return on investment.\nOn Friday, King Salman announced that a bridge connecting Egypt and Saudi Arabia would be built across the Red Sea.\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement late on Saturday to set up a 60 billion Saudi riyal investment fund among other investment agreements including an economic free-zone to develop Egypt's Sinai region, Egyptian state television reported.\nEgypt also signed development agreements with Saudi Arabia worth $590 million, Egyptian International Cooperation Minister Sahar Nasr said on Friday.\nShe said the agreements, signed with the Saudi finance minister, covered development in the Sinai peninsula, agriculture, housing and a university."}
