It is a drunken, hair-mussed, ill-shod debutante tripping and tumbling down one of those long, open, curving, red-carpeted staircases, and then, at the bottom, plowing directly through a gaggle of gasping society ladies.\n\nAnd that was just the website. Add the alarming swath of health care cancellations across the country, and you\u2019ve got the boozed-up debutante struggling to her feet, swigging from a whiskey bottle at the bar, and inexplicably punching her great-grandmother\u2019s sweet best friend Trudy in the face.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s weird about the whole thing: Despite watching this debacle from the beginning, and despite a clear viewing of the debutante\u2019s utter inability to operate in the real world, many of the gasping society ladies are not horrified. They are in denial. Millions of people losing health plans, these grandees intone, is actually a good thing -- and Obamacare, if we just give it a chance, is a great thing.\n\nMatt Yglesias, a columnist for Slate, noted this week that it is \u201cgood that you can\u2019t keep your insurance plan. \u2026 The wave of cancellation letters is part of Obamacare doing what it was supposed to do. There\u2019s little to regret about these plans vanishing from the earth.\u201d (Well, except that many people are having to pay thousands of dollars more to get an equivalent plan, and that certain doctors and hospitals are murmuring about revolting from the new system, but, gee, who\u2019s counting?)\n\nTaking the ball even farther down the field, Josh Barro, a columnist for Business Insider (and, as his many journalistic frenemies like to remind us, \u201cone of Obama\u2019s favorite writers\u201d), blasted the following snootiness out on Twitter on Oct. 29: \u201cVast swathes of policy are based on the correct presumption that people don't know what's best for them. Nothing new.\u201d\n\nNothing new indeed: If anything, \u201cpeople don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for them\u201d could be the central credo of the modern nanny state, and the binding tenet of liberalism. In this view, of course people shouldn\u2019t be able to choose \u201cinadequate,\u201d inexpensive health insurance -- which, in the government\u2019s definition, apparently includes any insurance that doesn\u2019t cover mammograms for 20-year-old males.\n\nOf course consumers shouldn\u2019t drink giant sodas or eat even a teaspoon of trans fats a year. Would-be business owners, meanwhile, certainly shouldn\u2019t be able to braid hair in a salon without a government license, and prompt, clean private town car services like Uber sure shouldn\u2019t make government taxis look bad. The list goes on and on.\n\nBut if you look closer, modern liberalism isn\u2019t all nannyism, all the time -- and for all of the talk about a pending conservative \u201ccivil war\u201d over social issues, if you\u2019re paying attention, it might be the liberals who are in trouble in the long run.\n\nTake abortion. In \u201cAfter Tiller,\u201d a recent documentary, Susan Robinson, a late-term abortion provider, offers the following justification for why she does what she does: Women, she argues, \u201care the greatest expert on their own lives.\u201d First of all, really? Has she heard of Miley Cyrus or Kim Kardashian? Does she know the latter named her baby North West? Also, just my opinion, but if you\u2019re 27 weeks pregnant with a viable baby and still haven\u2019t figured out whether or not you want an abortion, you might not have a Ph.D. in Expert Choices.\n\nI know, I\u2019m \u201cjudging,\u201d I know. I am so old and crotchety and boring. Or, as policy expert (and twerking expert!) Miley puts it in her hit song, \u201cRemember, only God can judge us.\u201d\n\nJudging is another big no-no in modern leftism, as the creators of the latest wave of Colorado-based \u201cThanks Obamacare!\u201d ads remind us. One of the more memorable new ads featured a grinning, slightly crazed young woman clutching a pack of birth control pills. She\u2019s standing next to a guy, and, no offense, but she\u2019s got \u201cstalker\u201d written all over her. I quote: \u201cLet\u2019s hope he\u2019s as easy to get as this birth control. My health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers.\u201d\n\nIn response to criticism of the ad -- along with widespread, open-mouthed disbelief that our society has fallen this far -- a spokesman, Adam Fox, gallantly offered that the ad \u201cshows a strong woman making a decision for herself and taking control of her situation.\u201d Let\u2019s agree with crazy Adam for a second and pretend that \u201cdesperate\u201d is the same as \u201cstrong.\u201d In any case, under modern liberal thought, wouldn\u2019t Birth Control Girl \u201cmaking a decision for herself\u201d and \u201ctaking control of her situation\u201d be bad? As always-certain guys like Josh Barro repeatedly inform us, she certainly doesn\u2019t \u201cknow what\u2019s best\u201d for her, right?\n\nThis is a prime example of the paradox of modern liberalism, as well as the mixed messaging it often produces. In leftist thought, when it comes to free exchange, or basic market issues, the government should be the decider of first resort. Have a simple supply and demand issue? Government bureaucracies are right there to muck up the process, forcing you to buy things at a more expensive price.\n\nWhen it comes to social issues, however, we get the left\u2019s repeated intonation on issues like abortion -- that people are, as the late-term abortion doctor argued, the \u201cgreatest experts on their own lives.\u201d In the social realm, the chief value is \u201cfreedom\u201d -- including freedom from consequence.\n\nWill the insurance market/government hybrid/utter disaster of Obamacare end up cracking liberalism, exposing its contradictions for the nation to see? Perhaps. But Obama and his health-care boosters are still scrambling. Meanwhile, in other news, the New York Times recently reported that China is still building mass-planned, central-controlled imitation \u201ccities\u201d and transporting uneducated farmers to work and live there. What could go wrong?
