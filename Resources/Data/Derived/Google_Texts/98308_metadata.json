Negotiators hope to sign a final pledge to fight climate change worldwide in December in Paris.\n\nIn showing corporate support for the talks, the White House hopes to contrast big businesses\u2019 opinions with those of congressional Republicans, who are trying to undermine and block the United States\u2019 participation in the negotiations.\n\n\u201cThese commitments show that international action on climate is not only good for our planet, it\u2019s good for the bottom line,\u201d top Obama adviser Brian Deese told reporters Monday.\n\n\u201cThey also show when the United States leads on climate issues, not only do other countries step up and make more progress, but you see businesses, as well as other key actors, also stepping up to rally the world to address this issue,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Monday meeting will include Obama and the heads of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co., Hershey Co., Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Johnson & Johnson and Intel Corp., all of whom have signed into the pledge.\n\n\u201cThe president will have a conversation with them about the efforts that they are taking to combat climate change and about our mutual goal of driving to a successful, ambitious outcome in Paris in achieving an international climate agreement,\u201d said Deese.\n\nTodd Brady, environmental director for Intel, said his company\u2019s commitment is a recognition of the business sense in fighting climate change.\n\n\u201cBy us both committing to reduce the impacts of our operations as well as introducing new products and technologies, we believe we can help others to reduce the impacts of their operations as well,\u201d he said.\n\nIntel\u2019s specific promises include a 10 percent reduction in its emissions intensity and continued installation of on-site clean energy production at its facilities.\n\nThe 68 companies on the climate pledge add to 13 who signed on when it was launched this summer, for a total of 81 companies.\n\nLater Monday, Vice President Biden will speak at a White House event on the current state of the climate talks and the role of business leaders in that effort.\n\nEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John Holdren and Deese will also speak.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "President Obama wants meets with five CEOs on Monday about the pact.", "description": "President Obama wants meets with five CEOs on Monday about the pact.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "President Obama wants meets with five CEOs on Monday about the pact.", "title": "Obama courts big business for support in climate talks", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/257292-obama-courts-big-business-for-support-in-climate-talks", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/obamabarack_100115getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-19T10:29:27-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-19T10:29-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/257292-obama-courts-big-business-for-support-in-climate-talks", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-19T10:23-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Climate change, international climate agreement,Brian Deese,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-19T10:23:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-19T10:29:27-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/257292-obama-courts-big-business-for-support-in-climate-talks", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "President Obama wants meets with five CEOs on Monday about the pact.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama courts big business for support in climate talks"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama courts big business for support in climate talks"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTIt\u2019s all part of Obama\u2019s efforts to shore up support domestically and internationally for the ongoing United Nations climate talks.\nPresident Obama is enlisting big companies to help him make the case for an international climate change pact.\nLater Monday, Vice President Biden will speak at a White House event on the current state of the climate talks and the role of business leaders in that effort.\nThe 68 companies on the climate pledge add to 13 who signed on when it was launched this summer, for a total of 81 companies.\nObama is meeting Monday morning with the chief executive officers of five major companies to talk about how they\u2019re cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and 68 companies signed on Monday to a White House pledge to reduce emissions and support the climate talks."}
