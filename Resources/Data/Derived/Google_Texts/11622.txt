State troopers have identified adult victims of a sport utility crash in Weld County in which two children were killed and four people were injured.

Five people were thrown from a 2001 Ford Escape during the crash Sunday on Interstate 76, according to a news release by CSP Trooper Josh Lewis. Only the driver was wearing a seat belt, and he remained in the car, Lewis said.

Two children who were thrown from the SUV were pronounced dead at the scene. Their names and ages were not released because of their ages, Lewis said.

Two other children were flown by helicopter to Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Aurora, where they were treated for serious injuries.

Luis Rodriguez-Sanchez, 34, of Northglenn, the driver, suffered life-threatening injuries. He was flown by helicopter to Denver Health Medical Center for treatment.

Graciela Cano-Villela, 32, of Lochbuie, was taken via ground ambulance to University Hospital with serious injuries.

The car was going west on Colorado 76 when it veered off the right side of the highway. Rodriquez-Sanchez swerved back onto the highway and the SUV rolled multiple times.

Criminal charges have not yet been filed. Authorities do not believe the driver was intoxicated.
