He was a Shriner, an Elk, a Jaycee, and a Freemason.\n\nHe loved all people and all people loved him. But my father was a giant when he taught my sister and I that when one group is discriminated against, we are all discriminated against. I am calling on all \"real men\" who have children who look up to them to renounce their Tennessee Freemason membership. Asking their gay members who do meaningful community work to step down should be an affront to us all.\n\nCindee Schreiber Gold, Nashville 37215\n\nMason vote reflected best choice\n\nAs a past master of a Masonic lodge with 40 years under my belt, it is good to see the Grand Lodge of Tennessee doing the right thing regarding the two homosexuals from West Tennessee.\n\nLeviticus 20:16 states very clearly what God thinks of this kind of activity. It is an abomination in the eyes of God.\n\nMasonry is made of men who believe in a supreme being. It is not a church, because it has no plan of salvation. Its purpose for the last few thousand years has been to take good men and make them better. There are none who are perfect.\n\nI heard a young man who had just been a Mason for a couple of years explaining to a news reporter that he believed the Grand Lodge was wrong in this decision. This young man has not been around long enough to be saying anything, one way or the other. He must have already forgotten the oath that he took when he was initiated into the craft.\n\nIt behooves the reporter to go down and talk to the Grand Master on Seventh and Broadway. If I were going to talk to someone about the school system, I would not seek out a first grader.\n\nI am not homophobic. I have common sense, and believe the Bible says just exactly what it means.\n\nI am serious enough in what I believe, that I will drop out of the Masons if they let this abomination to God continue without dropping the perpetrators from the rolls.\n\nAfter talking with several other Masons, I know that I'm not alone.\n\nHershel Butts, Mount Juliet, 37122\n\nMason vote out of step\n\nI've often wondered what the big secret was.\n\nI've heard the members of the Freemasons were outstanding citizens that do wonderful things for the community.\n\nReally, why the big secret? Well maybe now we know. Sounds like a bunch of good old boy homophobes patting themselves on the back for excluding members who don't fit their club mentality.\n\nGlad I'm not a member. Good riddance, dinosaurs.\n\nChase Adams, Madison 37115\n\nTrump vs. Cruz 2016 (Photo: Cagle Cartoons)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1MtAezB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers react to Freemasons vote on LGBT members.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Readers react to Freemasons vote on LGBT members.", "title": "Letters to the editor, March 28: Freemason vote on gays", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/03/27/letters-editor-march-28-freemason-vote-gays/82258392/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Readers react to Freemasons vote on LGBT members.", "title": "Letters to the editor, March 28: Freemason vote on gays", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1018987167a29ed85043434549545ae2e2f6f4e/c=0-89-534-623&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Nashville", "gci-categories": "Geography/Nashville", "gci-asset-type": "story", "title": "Letters to the editor, March 28: Freemason vote on gays", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c7e6945626ebe0d253725263318a2e7c9389806c/c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68886e1d3b73e7ccc59253069a1d37b76fba6987/c=0-89-534-623/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa671b2e61320c603162e22f003c763f485eac88/c=0-156-534-556/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2fe2471184649d1cc217f2492ce28a57a087b856/c=0-206-534-506&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-27T10:01:23.717000-05:00", "shorthed": "Letters to the editor, March 28: Freemason vote on gays", "articleid": 82258392, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ca1f55b3fb743e03597e9f17ac0b0eed27fbacd/c=0-206-534-506/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/97206c2dcf4cd44619c7b05a62a6a93f53f3c482/c=67-0-467-712/local/-/media/2016/01/19/Nashville/B9320578955Z.1_20160119184703_000_GL7D72RTF.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Freemasons, Freemasons of Tennessee, Freemasons vote,"}, "article_summary": "Letters to the editor: letters@tennessean.com (Photo: The Tennessean.com)Stand against discriminationRe: \"Freemasons in Tennessee vote to uphold ban on gay members,\" March 24.\nIts purpose for the last few thousand years has been to take good men and make them better.\nReaders react to Freemasons vote on LGBT members.\nI am calling on all \"real men\" who have children who look up to them to renounce their Tennessee Freemason membership.\nAsking their gay members who do meaningful community work to step down should be an affront to us all."}
