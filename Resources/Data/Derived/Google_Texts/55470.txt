Flu season is hitting the Tri-State hard and an additional stomach bug is making it even worse.

The Northern Kentucky Health Department had just five confirmed cases in November. Last week that number jumped to 176.

By Thursday, this week's total had already tripled to over 450 cases.

Epidemiologist Patrick Burke with the Cincinnati Department of Health said the situation is quite as bad north of the Ohio River but they have seen a recent spike.

There’ve been 64 influenza-associated hospitalizations among residents of Cincinnati between Dec. 1 and Dec. 17. That’s a seven-fold increase over November. There were just nine hospitalizes due to the flu during the entire month.

The illness is affecting people across all age groups.

“I've been in the Northern Kentucky/Cincinnati area for 15 years and I have never seen a flu season hit this hard," said Dr. Chuck Kelly of St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Edgewood, Kentucky. He added that an unrelated stomach bug that’s making the rounds is adding to the patient count.

Both illnesses are highly contagious.

Dr. Lynn Saddler, district director for the Northern Kentucky Health Department, drafted a letter being sent to all Northern Kentucky school districts so administrators know how to handle the situation.

"Most kids are going to be out of school after (Friday for winter break). That will help with stopping the transmission, but while the kids are out from school, we'd like them to make sure they do a good, thorough cleaning of surfaces,” she said.

That's what they're doing at Kenton County Schools – spraying disinfectant on surfaces kids tend to touch and wiping them down several times a day. They're also notifying parents with an auto-call system to keep them in the loop about the situation.

Above all, it's important to be smart and considerate when dealing with the flu, so if you're not feeling way, stay home.
