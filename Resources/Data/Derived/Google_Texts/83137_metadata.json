Frosh testified Thursday to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nLawmakers highlighted the case of one man, identified only as \u201cJoe,\u201d who was left with a severe cognitive impairment after a car accident 16 years ago. He was due a $100,000 settlement in 2021, but in 2013 J.G. Wentworth offered to buy $30,000 of the settlement for an immediate $10,000 payment. Joe jumped at the chance.\n\nUnder current law, those who want to sell their settlements must meet with a financial adviser and get approval from a judge, who must deem it a \u201creasonable\u201d decision by the seller.\n\nBut critics say the standard should be whether it\u2019s a reasonable deal for the victims. They also blast companies for venue-shopping for favorable judges.\n\nDelegate Samuel I. \u201cSandy\u201d Rosenberg, Baltimore Democrat, and Sen. Jamie Raskin, Montgomery Democrat, have introduced bills that would require judges to approve deals only in the interests of the victim. The legislation also would require that cases be tried in the victim\u2019s home jurisdiction.\n\nThe bill also would authorize Mr. Frosh\u2019s office to set a maximum discount rate, ensuring victims don\u2019t get tricked into a bad deal.\n\nThe National Association of Settlement Purchasers said it didn\u2019t mind more regulations, but opposed giving Mr. Frosh\u2019s office powers to oversee the regulations.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general would have unfettered authority to develop a system of regulating the industry with the industry having a very limited opportunity to participate in the abbreviated process,\u201d said Patricia LaBorde, the association\u2019s president.\n\nThe full scope of the settlement problem isn\u2019t known \u2014 though Mr. Frosh\u2019s office said it found a set of $21 million in settlement payments that companies had bought for $6 million.\n\nAttorney Saul E. Kerpelman said he has worked with nearly 4,000 people with lead poisoning, and many have struggled to make sound financial decisions. Many of his clients are mothers who win settlements for their children suffering from lead poisoning \u2014 and the mothers cash in, feeling the money is of more use now as they raise the children.\n\nLead poisoning was even a factor in case of Freddie Gray, whose death last year while in police custody sparked riots in Baltimore. The Washington Post reported that Gray had won a lead paint settlement worth nearly $100,000 today, but sold it for $18,300. His siblings sold a settlement with an eventual worth of $435,000 for just $54,000.\n\nSome lawmakers at Thursday\u2019s hearing said rather than new regulations, they would like to see a trustee system, where settlement money gets pooled and the state or a private caretaker would dole out funds as necessary.\n\n\u201cYou know what the problem is, but I don\u2019t know you found the right solution that\u2019s in the best interest of these folks,\u201d said Delegate Susan McComas, Harford Republican.\n\nIn the meantime, Joe is bombarded with emails, phone calls and leaflets from companies asking to buy the rest of his settlement, said his friend, Robyn Dorsey.\n\n\u201cJoe, and people like him, need strong safeguards in order to ensure that they are not taken advantage of by predatory, unregulated companies,\u201d Ms. Dorsey said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Having already tried to rein in pay day lenders, the Maryland General Assembly now is taking aim at predatory settlement purchasers, saying poor people are being bamboozled into selling their legal settlements for pennies on the dollar.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Having already tried to rein in pay day lenders, the Maryland General Assembly now is taking aim at predatory settlement purchasers, saying poor people are being bamboozled into selling their legal settlements for pennies on the dollar.", "title": "Maryland lawmakers take aim at predatory settlement purchasers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/28/maryland-lawmakers-take-aim-at-predatory-settlemen/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/25/Lead_Poisoning_Predatory_Schemes.JPEG-0ee20.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/25/Lead_Poisoning_Predatory_Schemes.JPEG-0ee20.jpg", "description": "Having already tried to rein in pay day lenders, the Maryland General Assembly now is taking aim at predatory settlement purchasers, saying poor people are being bamboozled into selling their legal se", "card": "summary", "title": "Maryland lawmakers take aim at predatory settlement purchasers"}, "Author": "Anjali Shastry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime"}, "article_summary": "The Washington Post reported that Gray had won a lead paint settlement worth nearly $100,000 today, but sold it for $18,300.\nLead poisoning was even a factor in case of Freddie Gray, whose death last year while in police custody sparked riots in Baltimore.\nAttorney Saul E.
