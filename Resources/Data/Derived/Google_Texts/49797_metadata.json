The report was the focus of a story posted on the Politico website. Miller is quoted as saying he now regrets filing the report.\n\n\u0093But I think they are very relevant to the issue about how we (Republicans) vote,\u0094 Conger said.\n\nWehby had no opportunity to respond because Conger spoke last at the forum. But Wehby was hustled away by campaign staffers and employees of the Sentinel Hotel before reporters could reach her to ask about Conger\u0092s remarks.\n\nWehby\u0092s campaign manager said later she was on her way to another campaign event.\n\n\u0093I\u0092m not sure just what happened, but it was bizarre,\u0094 Conger told reporters afterward.\n\nThe forum excluded the three other Republican candidates on Tuesday\u0092s primary ballot: Mark Callahan, an information technology consultant from Salem; Tim Crawley, a lawyer from Portland, and Jo Rae Perkins, a former Linn County Republican chairwoman from Albany.\n\nThe winner will face Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley of Portland, who seeks a second six-year term.\n\nStill a race\n\nIt was Wehby, in her opening statement, who broached the issue of an intensified campaign spotlight when she said she explained to one of her sons why she would give up her career as a pediatric neurosurgeon to run for public office.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s really ratcheted up in the last four weeks\u0094 as a poll put her ahead of Merkley, she said. The poll by the Vox Populi firm founded by Republicans, had her up by 1 percentage point over Merkley.\n\nThe only recent independent poll, conducted by DHM Research for Oregon Public Broadcasting, did not match either leading Republican against Merkley. But the poll did conclude that while twice as many voters sampled had a favorable view of Merkley in comparison with those opposed to him, about a third of the 400-member sample had no opinion or did not know him.\n\nThe poll also had Merkley less than 50 percent support, suggesting he could be vulnerable.\n\nConger, who unseated a Democratic incumbent in the Oregon House in 2010 and was re-elected in 2012, said a Republican can beat Merkley \u0097 but not if there are questions about the Republican.\n\n\u0093The more questions that surround her candidacy \u0097 the more issues that are out there \u2013 the more material is provided for her opponent in the general election should she be the Republican nominee,\u0094 he said. \u0093That puts a greater risk that we would lose \u0097 and I don\u0092t want to waste that opportunity.\u0094\n\nWehby, a newcomer to politics, has raised more than $1 million to enable her to broadcast commercials. Conger, who has raised about a third of that amount, has been unable to get on the airwaves. These amounts exclude third-party spending for and against the candidates, including money spent by Miller and Nevada businessman Loren Parks on advertising against Conger. Conger has been the beneficiary of spending by Oregon Right to Life, which is opposed to abortion.\n\nFriday\u0092s faceoff was the only public one between Conger and Wehby, excluding their joint appearance March 7 at the Dorchester Conference, an unofficial gathering of Republicans. Wehby rejected an offer by Portland television station KGW and The Oregonian for a one-to-one meeting.\n\n\u0093She seems to be campaigning away from the public in a controlled environment,\u0094 Conger said. \u0093That will not work in a general election.\u0094\n\nThe overall return rate of ballots as of Thursday was 17.8 percent, according to the Oregon secretary of state. Still, Conger said, that means many Republicans can return ballots by the deadline Tuesday. \u0093I think it\u0092s still a race,\u0094 he said.\n\nTough stance on Russia\n\nAlthough Conger and Wehby showed some differences, they generally agreed on key issues. On health care, both criticized the Affordable Care Act signed by President Obama in 2010 and enrolled 8 million Americans for coverage by March 31.\n\nOn federal forest lands, both preferred a House-passed plan to put half of Western Oregon acreage into a trust for timber production and county payments, rather than a pending Senate plan that would continue federal management.\n\nOn immigration, both resisted a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the United States without documents.\n\nOn Ukraine, both criticized Obama for not taking a tougher stance against Russia, which annexed the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nWehby did favor abolishing the electoral college, which is based on states, and choosing the president by popular vote. Conger opposed it.\n\npeterwong@portlandtribune.com or (503) 364-4431, ext. 326, or twitter.com/capitolwong\n\nPolitico: Wehby \u0091stalked\u0092 former boyfriend\n\nHere is a more detailed story, based largely on an account on the Politico website, about the police report on alleged stalking by Monica Wehby.\n\nMonica Wehby, a Portland physician and a leading candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, was accused by her former boyfriend in a 2013 police report of \u0093stalking\u0094 her.\n\nThe report, disclosed in a story on the Politico website, also said that Andrew Miller complained about Wehby entering his home without permission and \u0093harassing\u0094 employees of Stimson Lumber Co., where he is president and chief executive.\n\nWehby has raised over $1 million, far more than state Rep. Jason Conger of Bend, excluding other spending on their behalf. She has not run for public office before.\n\nMiller and Nevada businessman Loren Parks contributed $106,000 for broadcast and other ads aimed at Conger. The Democratic Party of Oregon has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission asserting that the spending by Miller, pegged at $31,000, was not truly independent of Wehby\u0092s campaign \u2013 an accusation denied by Wehby\u0092s campaign.\n\nThe Politico story said Miller filed the report with Portland police in 2013, near the end of a two-year relationship with Wehby.\n\nAccording to the report filed by officer Brent Taylor, Miller \u0093told me that he wanted to initiate a police report because Wehby has been \u0091harassing\u0092 his employees and \u0091stalking\u0092 him. He told me that he intended to get a stalking order tomorrow against Wehby. I asked Miller what Wehby had done specifically to make him desire to get a stalking order. He told me that Wehby has showed up at his home uninvited about 5 times within the last 10 days.\u0094\n\nMiller said he did not proceed to obtain such an order. The report adds: \u0093Miller told me that the last few times he has observed as Wehby knocked on the doors and rang the door bell repeatedly for the duration of about 10 minutes before finally leaving. Miller told me that tonight Wehby did the same thing as she has done the last few times. However, this time Miller told me that Wehby walked around to the back of the house and tried the door handle. Miller told me that after Wehby discovered that the door was unlocked she entered the residence and attempted to find Miller.\u0094\n\nWehby, in a statement to Politico, downplayed the incident.\n\n\u0093A year ago I went through the process of concluding a relationship,\u0094 she said. \u0093That relationship ended amicably, and while I\u0092m not pleased that it has been deemed newsworthy, I guess that is the cost of challenging the political status quo.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP candidates spar, wrestle with issues at forum, Local News, Portland local News, Breaking News alerts for Portland city.", "generator": "Pamplin Communications", "rights": "Pamplin Communications Corp.", "og": {"site_name": "Oregon Local News", "description": "GOP candidates spar, wrestle with issues at forum, Local News, Portland local News, Breaking News alerts for Portland city.", "title": "GOP candidates spar, wrestle with issues at forum", "url": "http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/221125-82127-gop-candidates-spar-wrestle-with-issues-at-forum", "image": "http://portlandtribune.com/images/artimg/00003483114862.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, United States Senate, City Club of Portland, Federal Election Commission, Oregon House, Portland police, Democratic Party of Oregon, Senate, pediatric neurosurgeon, businessman, lawyer and two-term state representative, president, physician, Oregon secretary of state, information technology consultant, officer, Senator, campaign manager, chairwoman, president and chief executive, lawyer, Brent Taylor, Jason Conger, Monica Wehby, Here, Obama, Loren Parks, Mark Callahan, Tim Crawley, Jeff Merkley, Andrew Miller, Portland television station KGW, Sentinel Hotel, USD, Stimson Lumber Co., Sentinel, Portland, Russia, United States, Ukraine, (503) 364-4431, ext. 326, information technology, peterwong@portlandtribune.com, Oregon Public Broadcasting, Nevada, Oregon, Linn County, The Oregonian, Western Oregon, KGW,", "my": {"tw": "on", "fb": "on", "google": "on", "in": "on"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd540\"", "article_summary": "\u0093I\u0092m not sure just what happened, but it was bizarre,\u0094 Conger told reporters afterward.\nHowever, this time Miller told me that Wehby walked around to the back of the house and tried the door handle.\nThe remarks and reaction came after an hour-long forum at the City Club of Portland, during which the candidates agreed on most issues.\nMiller told me that tonight Wehby did the same thing as she has done the last few times.\nTough stance on RussiaAlthough Conger and Wehby showed some differences, they generally agreed on key issues."}
