Our assistance programs should encourage these positive values.\"\n\nThe RSC is also calling for a boost in defense spending, and proposes $574 billion for national defense and $59 for overseas operations in fiscal 2017. That's an increase from the current budget plan for next year, which calls for just $551 billion in base defense spending.\n\nThe RSC calls for a complete repeal of Obamacare, replacing it with a plan that would provide a standard deduction for health insurance that \"would be a portable tax benefit that would encourage work while ensuring the federal government does not create another new entitlement program.\"\n\nThe plan calls for a health insurance tax deduction of $7,500 for individuals or $20,500 for families. The RSC calls for ending taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides women's health services as well as abortion.\n\nThe group also wants to reverse Obama's executive actions deferring the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants. The RSC noted a Congressional Budget Office calculation that said deferring deportations will cost $14.9 billion in new welfare benefits for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe RSC recommendations will undoubtedly play a role in shaping the GOP agenda. The group represents more than half of the Republican Conference and many of their views are shared by GOP lawmakers and the GOP leadership.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The largest faction of House conservatives has issued a set of recommendations for Republican lawmakers on issues like welfare reform, defense spending and repealing Obamacare, as GOP leaders assemble a party agenda that House Speaker Paul Ryan hopes will attract voters in November.\nThe Republican Study Committee released six recommendations, which correspond with the six task forces Ryan has assembled to construct the House GOP agenda.\nAs the largest caucus in Congress, we are in a unique position to help build the framework for a bold Republican agenda, said Republican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores, R-Texas.
