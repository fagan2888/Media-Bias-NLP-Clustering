(Photo: Chris Carlson, AP)\n\nLike Woody Allen\u2019s joke about a place that has terrible food \u201cand such small portions,\u201d Republican discussion of a top issue on American minds is often strangely removed from the real lives of real people -- and the portions are tiny.\n\nWhat do Republicans talk about when they talk about money?\n\nIt isn\u2019t tuition, that's for sure. That word appears exactly once in all seven Republican debate transcripts, including the one from Thursday night in Des Moines. John Kasich almost got there in the last five minutes when he mentioned decent jobs for children so they could \u201cpay down their college debt,\u201d and the topic was briefly addressed in October in Boulder, Colo., when Kasich received a direct question on college costs. But the actual word \u201ctuition\u201d has been spoken one time by one candidate \u2013 Jeb Bush, also in Boulder.\n\nThe Democrats have a field a fraction the size of the GOP free-for-all and they\u2019ve only held four debates. Yet the word tuition appears 33 times in the transcripts, between four and 11 times per debate.\n\nThat is an admittedly rough indicator, but it does reflect the disparate economic fixations of the two parties. Democrats are granular almost to a fault, with their multi-point proposals to address high tuition, low wages, unequal pay for women, and the like. Most of the Republican candidates are in a totally different head space -- less kitchen table, more business lunch or constitutional seminar or camp meeting for true believers.\n\nThey talk in general terms about growing the economy and shrinking the government, about balancing the federal budget and slashing waste, fraud and abuse (although \u201cthat really doesn't ever materialize. We all know that,\u201d as moderator Bret Baier said this week). Chris Christie talks about \u201centitlement reform,\u201d also known as cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits. Ben Carson talks about \u201cthe evil government that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can\u2019t survive.\u201d Rand Paul says he\u2019s worried about \u201chow much debt we\u2019re adding.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz rails about the \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact of Obamacare \u2013 \u201cMillions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.\u201d But fact-checkers have debunked most of these claims, and, in any case, only a small fraction of the country buys insurance through the law's exchanges (for instance, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 10 million buy private insurance via Obamacare marketplaces, compared with 149 million who have insurance through their employers).\n\nRepublicans also talk a lot about cutting taxes for business. How many normal Americans know what VAT means? I\u2019m guessing hardly any. That didn\u2019t stop Marco Rubio from budgeoning Cruz with phrases like \u201cyour VAT tax\u201d in last month\u2019s debate. Did either of them explain what it was? Well, sort of, if you count Cruz\u2019s description of the VAT or value-added tax as a sales tax, and not at all like his proposal for a business flat tax, which by the way he said would allow elimination of the corporate income tax and \u201cthe death tax,\u201d also known as the inheritance tax, which would help farmers, ranchers and business owners.\n\nYet only about one in 10 to 15 Americans owns a business, so the great majority aren\u2019t all that interested in what a VAT tax would do for business owners. As for the rank and file, Donald Trump reflected a typical view when he said he would not raise the minimum wage. \u201cTaxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,\u201d he said at a debate.\n\nThat was mild. At a Pensacola, Fla. rally this month, exasperated by a microphone that wasn\u2019t working right, he sounded about as sympathetic toward the working stiff as Mitt \u201cI like being able to fire people\u201d Romney. \"Whoever the hell brought this mic system, don't pay the son of a bitch,\" Trump said. \"This mic is terrible. Stupid mic keeps popping. Do you hear that George? Don't pay him! Don't pay him. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job like this stupid mic, you shouldn't pay the bastard. Terrible. Terrible. It's true.\" He added: \"So we're not going to pay. I guarantee you I'm not paying for this mic.\u201d Meanwhile, over at CNN, Trump\u2019s former butler was being interviewed.\n\nLook, it\u2019s not that these issues aren\u2019t important, and these topics are proven winners with the Republicans most likely to turn out during primary season. But the debates are great showcases that are going to waste. And surely even GOP primary voters are concerned about college costs. More than 68% of high school graduates go to college, which means that many, many families are paying tuition or worrying about future payments for their fifth-graders, and 40 million people have tuition debts.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a Democrat to show you care. Rick Perry, the former 14-year Texas governor and two-time presidential campaign dropout, pioneered the $10,000 college degree. He also argued at the National Press Club last year that \u201cthe high cost of everyday life\u201d in places like Baltimore or Detroit means minority families can have better lives in Dallas or Houston. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to get rid of strict zoning laws and environmental regulations, two of the reasons Perry says it\u2019s cheaper to live in Texas than in coastal cities, but he makes an interesting case.\n\nRepublicans have faced an idiosyncratic array of debate questioners, and a mix of questions heavier on personality conflicts than policy ideas. That\u2019s inevitable, given Trump\u2019s outsized, outrageous presence, even when he\u2019s absent. But all of these candidates learned in Politics 101 that whatever you\u2019re asked, you pivot to the topic you want to discuss. If they wanted to talk about concrete ways to solve concrete economic problems in debates watched by many millions of people, they\u2019d find a way.\n\nJill Lawrence is the commentary editor of USA TODAY.
