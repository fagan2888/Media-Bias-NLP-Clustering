Phew!\n\nAnti-Catholic bias\n\nThe making of the movie, \"Spotlight,\" and its subsequent selection as best picture, exposes the bigotry that exists in the entertainment industry, especially Hollywood. The entertainment industry is relentless in exposing any bigotry they perceive exits, but they themselves are bigots. The Catholic Church has long since fixed the problem of child abuse in its ranks. Hollywood cannot let bias against the Catholic Church wane and has seen fit to stir it up again. This movie was made because of Hollywood's anti-religion agenda in general and its vendetta to punish the Catholic Church for its stand against gay marriage. Spotlight is an insult to the 97% of Catholic priests, who at the time of the abuse scandal, led good lives and who devoted themselves to the service of their parishioners of all ages. It is a fact that even at the height of the abusive priest scandal, the incidence of abuse by Catholic priests was at same level as it was in other professions that dealt with children such as teaching, law enforcement, and other religious denominations. If this was truly to be a movie about investigative journalism, there are many more recent examples they could have chosen.\n\nLooking for \u2026\n\nThis is response to someone looking for a housekeeper once a month.

His advice was in my best interest with no salesmanship. His experience, love of his profession and accurate and complete opinion were greatly appreciated. He is clearly the top oral and maxillofacial surgeon in this area. I am so grateful to the patient of his who referred me to him.\n\nRoad problems\n\nWhy did VDOT remove the rumble strips on John Tyler Highway, just before Greensprings Road? Given the number of accidents at that intersection, I thought they were a good cheap warning until the county decided what to do at that intersection.\n\nBad weather\n\nAfter the recent severe weather and tornado warnings, it occurs to me that, as a resident of the Grove community, I don't know where I would go for shelter if a tornado was spotted here. There are many people living in many mobile homes in this area and it seems like a good idea for there to be a public building open for us in situations like these. If there is anyone with information about this issue or people I need to contact, please email kjeanh224@gmail.com. Thanks!\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nSomeone mentioned this week that the \"Affordable Care Act\" was passed after the House and Senate passed it. But, why didn't they read it first? Nancy Pelosi said the Congress needed to pass it so \"we can see what's in it!\" Is this the democratic way? What was the hurry? Now we see how undemocratic and unaffordable it is. Since when are we penalized for not choosing health insurance? The financial penalty was written into the law not to \"encourage compliance,\" but to trap people into choosing between paying a very, very high premium and deductible (just ask any middle class family with children) or paying a penalty and having no health insurance at all. This law diminishes our freedom and increases government control! This penalty has already increased from a year ago just as a landlord can increase rent, and what's to stop the government from increasing it year after year?\n\nDon't be fooled\n\nDiversity, opportunity, freedom of speech, hard work, a strong middle class, respect, cooperation, and compromise have made America great for many years. Exclusion, elitism, fear-mongering, and demagoguery as represented by Trump can only weaken our country. If Trump becomes president, it will be easier to understand why Americans were fooled by P.T. Barnum and how Italy and Germany allowed Mussolini and Hitler to become their leaders.\n\nVoting\n\nPlease tell the folks manning the polling sites not to announce the party out loud for a voter to select the ballot! Let the ballots be placed in stacks on the table for voters to select their choice without any identification being stated out loud!", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Last Word on movie bias, March 9", "Description": "Bad bowling news   It grieves me to learn that the Williamsburg Inn Lawn Bowling Green will be gone after this summer, so I won't be able to bring my friends and my grandchildren to enjoy this wonderful sport.
