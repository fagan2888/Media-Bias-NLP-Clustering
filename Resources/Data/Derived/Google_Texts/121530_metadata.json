The agreements allow the nurse practitioners to practice alone.\n\nThe bill would alter the requirement. Nurse practitioners would have to collaborate with physicians for three years and 3,600 hours, but they would have full practice authority after that time is up.\n\nThe bill is now moving on to the Senate floor, though it could bounce back and forth between the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nAdvocates, nonetheless, were pleased.\n\n\u201cWith this vote, Pennsylvania is one step closer to joining the growing number of states that enable nurse practitioners to serve seniors, rural communities, and all patients to the full extent of their education and training,\u201d Lorraine Bock, president of the Pennsylvania Coalition of Nurse Practitioners, said.\n\nPhysicians oppose the change\n\nMany physicians argue that giving nurse practitioners full practice authority would not improve patient care, because nurse practitioners have less training than physicians.\n\nCritics of S.B. 717 feel that patient care is better when nurse practitioners practice under the guidance of physicians.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Medical Society, in fact, would prefer to see more collaboration between physicians and nurse practitioners. It believes that the current legislation would break up the current team practice of physicians and nurses working together.\n\n\u201cThe Pennsylvania Medical Society is deeply disappointed in the Committee\u2019s action,\u201d said Dr. Scott Shapiro, president of the medical society and a practicing physician in Montgomery County. \u201cBy eliminating the collaborative ties that exist between nurse practitioners and physicians, S.B. 717 removes an important safeguard in patient care and fragments the health care team.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, or HAP, argues in support of S.B. 717 that existing health care teams need to be revamped to keep up with the changes in health care.\n\n\u201cThe 2010 Affordable Care Act is the largest overhaul to our nation\u2019s health care system since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965,\u201d HAP President and CEO Andy Carter said. \u201cIt has required a comprehensive rethinking of the way care is provided. This rethinking also must include the role of health care professionals in new, team-based models of care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Central Penn Business Journal", "description": "Wednesday, nurse practitioners in Pennsylvania won a small victory in their fight to be able to practice without being monitored by physicians, while doctors' groups continue to resist the change.", "title": "Senate panel OKs bill reforming nurse-practitioner rules | CPBJ", "url": "http://www.cpbj.com/article/20160519/CPBJ01/160519705/senate-panel-oks-bill-reforming-nursepractitioner-rules", "image": "http://www.cpbj.com/images/cpbj-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "cpbj.com", "description": "Wednesday, nurse practitioners in Pennsylvania won a small victory in their fight to be able to practice without being monitored by physicians, while doctors' groups continue to resist the change.", "title": "Senate panel OKs bill reforming nurse-practitioner rules | CPBJ", "image": {"src": "http://www.cpbj.com/images/cpbj-logo-share.jpg"}, "site": "@cpbj", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Wednesday, nurse practitioners in Pennsylvania won a small victory in their fight to be able to practice without being monitored by physicians, while doctors' groups continue to resist the change.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25e2\"", "article_summary": "717 that existing health care teams need to be revamped to keep up with the changes in health care.\nOn May 18 the Senate Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure Committee voted to advance a bill, Seenat Bill 717, that aims to allow nurse practitioners to practice independently.\nThis rethinking also must include the role of health care professionals in new, team-based models of care.\u201d\nPhysicians oppose the changeMany physicians argue that giving nurse practitioners full practice authority would not improve patient care, because nurse practitioners have less training than physicians.\nThe agreements allow the nurse practitioners to practice alone."}
