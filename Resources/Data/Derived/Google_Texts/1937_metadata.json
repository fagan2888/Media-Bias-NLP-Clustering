Marotta, of Marotta Wealth Management in Charlotte, Va., and writer of Forbes\u2019 \u201cMarotta on Money\u201d column, issued the advice in a pre-Christmas note to investors that included lists of what average people should have on hand in the event of a fiscal disaster or social upheaval.\n\n\u201cFirearms are the last item on the list, but they are on the list,\u201d Marotta wrote, according to the Washington Examiner. \u201cThere are some terrible people in this world. And you are safer when your trusted neighbors have firearms.\u201d\n\nMarotta says he is no survivalist anticipating a total societal breakdown and \u201cMad Max\u201d kind of world anytime soon. Just the sort of low, painful decline your basic Obamacare patient can expect in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\u201cThere is the possibility of a precipitous decline, although a long and drawn out malaise is much more likely,\u201d Marotta said.\n\nAnd the causes are the same those who worry about a financial apocalypse \u2014 Obamacare, the rise of the surveillance state with the National Security Agency\u2019s spying on civilians, ruinous federal spending.\n\n\u201cI, along with many other economists, agree with many of the concerns expressed in these dire warnings. The growing debt and deficit spending is a tax on those holding dollars. The devaluation in the U.S. dollar risks the dollar\u2019s status as the reserve currency of the world. Obamacare was the worst legislation in the past 75 years. Socialism is on the rise and the NSA really is abrogating vast portions of the Constitution. I don\u2019t disagree with their concerns,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe bottom line, though, is being prepared. Whether it\u2019s a natural disaster or the result of the most \u201cprogressive\u201d administration in United States history, an emergency is an emergency.\n\nKeeping a \u201cbug out bag\u201d on hand stocked with the immediate necessities of food, water and firepower is an idea for everybody.\n\n\u201cA bug-out bag is a good idea depending on where you live even if the emergency is just power outages, earthquakes and hurricanes,\u201d Marotta advised. \u201cBe prepared. Especially because it keeps you from being scared.\u201d\n\nRelated story: Nazi survivor\u2019s warning to Americans: \u2018Keep your guns and buy more guns\u2019", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A Forbes columnist who is also the founder of a wealth management firm has one big tip: Invest in guns \u2013 and lots of ammunition.
