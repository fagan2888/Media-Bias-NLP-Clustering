The \u201cSpanish Ninja\u201d is back in Street Fighter V with a new look. Hey, Capcom put a shirt on him.\n\nThe big news from today\u2019s reveal is Vega\u2019s fighting styles. In Street Fighter V, Vega can sheath his three-pronged claw during the fight. Doing so opens up several new moves including a command grab and \u201cnew attack properties.\u201d\n\nCapcom\u2019s Community Manager Peter Rosas says knowing when to switch between the two styles will be a must for anyone playing with Vega. Rosas also notes, \u201cVega will no longer be able to pick up his claw once it\u2019s knocked off, so knowing how to fight without the claw is a must!\u201d\n\nCheck out some of Vega\u2019s moves in the trailer below.\n\nThose of you at Gamescom this week will get a chance to play with Vega at Sony\u2019s booth.\n\nStreet Fighter V will hit the PS4 and PC in March 2016. As for the beta? Capcom\u2019s first beta was a disaster. In a recent blog post, Capcom says they are postponing future betas until the server issues are addressed. There will still be at least three beta tests before Street Fighter V is officially released.\n\nProps to Capcom for doing the betas in the first place. You know they are glad they did. The last thing anyone wants is for crippling server issues to pop up when Street Fighter V releases in March 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It wouldn\u2019t be Street Fighter without Vega.
