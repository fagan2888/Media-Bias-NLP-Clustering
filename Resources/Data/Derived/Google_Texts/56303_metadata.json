Kirsten Powers has spoken up for the compassionate idea of covering everyone. But she signaled on FOX News that it was getting harder to defend the botched rollout and, now, losing her own coverage, she is looking less and less willing to stand up for this deeply flawed program. Powers attributes all this confusion\u2014and the thirty-five \u201cfixes\u201dMr. Obama has unilaterally mandated\u2014to \u201cincompetence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy I\u2019m getting sick of defending Obamacare,\u201d was the blunt title of Ron Fournier\u2019s recent column in National Journal. Like Kirsten Powers, Fournier once hoped that this measure would bring greater equity in health care to millions who lacked coverage.\n\nThe failures of Obamacare are not a surprise to conservatives. We have been hostile to this thing from the outset. Not only do we oppose a government takeover of 1/6 of the economy, we have the deepest concerns about the dangers it poses to freedom. Under Obamacare, the states lose their unique standing in the federal system that is the United States of America. They become mere branch offices of HHS. Corporations, non-profit organizations, and individual citizens lose a great measure of freedom from the mandates that Obamacare imposes. As columnist George Will has noted, if Congress can require you to buy health insurance, why can\u2019t it require you to eat broccoli? After all, if health is the rationale, many things contribute to a healthy population. Might we see someday weigh stations on our Interstate Highways\u2014not for trucks, and not for cars\u2014but for the occupants of those vehicles?\n\nMost troubling of all is the HHS Mandate that forces corporations, non-profits, and citizens to violate their consciences by subsidizing drugs that can kill unborn children. This HHS Mandate represented the gravest expansion of abortion since Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn the midst of all this, and a time of the most lethal threat to religious and civil liberty in 225 years, it is understandable that some on the conservative side get overheated. For example, in Northern Virginia in `12, a GOP fundraiser showed a zombie portrait of the president\u2014with a bullet hole in his forehead! On a gun range in the South, one overly enthusiastic backer of a presidential challenger yelled to her favorite candidate: \u201cPretend it\u2019s Obama!\u201d The candidate probably never heard that comment as he fired away at the profile target, but the liberal media sure did. It was an ugly episode that did no credit to our side.\n\nBut when our cooler heads prevail, they often go too far in the other direction. For example, the claim that President Obama is a Marxist is offered as an example of right-wing rodomontade. If we want to keep the dialogue civil, we are lectured, then we need to avoid such lurid charges.\n\nWell, what if the President is a Marxist? Stanley Kurtz was one of those cooler heads in 2008 who rejected the claim that Barack Obama was a Marxist, a socialist. Then, he researched the record and wrote Radical-in-Chief. Kurtz\u2019s book is a long, detailed, and very carefully researched analysis of the Obama record.\n\nKurtz finds Obama acknowledging in his own words, in Dreams from my Father, that he was mentored as a teen growing up in Hawaii by a man he identifies only as \u201cFrank.\u201d We know now that that man was Frank Marshall Davis, a lifelong communist. Grove City College professor Paul Kengor has documented Davis\u2019 attachment to the USSR in his book, The Communist.\n\nOn campus, Barack Obama sought to prove he had not \u201csold out\u201d to the system, so he consciously sought out the Marxist professors on campus (p. 150) Sought them out. We can understand why President Obama may not want his college course grades spread all over the Internet. But there is something more than a little weird about the fact he won\u2019t even disclose the college courses he took.\n\nStanley Kurtz provides incontrovertible evidence that young Barack Obama attended the April 1983 Socialist Scholars Conference at Cooper Union in New York City. This big confab is doubly significant. It\u2019s important because it brought together committed Marxists from all over the country. It\u2019s important because it was held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Karl Marx\u2019s death.\n\nKurtz notes that Barack Obama himself admits he went to this meeting (and Kurtz believes but properly adds that he cannot prove that young Mr. Obama probably attended the follow-up socialist meetings in the 1980s, as well.)\n\nWhat Stanley Kurtz does not offer us in his otherwise very well-documented book is the historic context of these socialist conferences. The first of these was held just a month after President Ronald Reagan had warned of an \u201cevil empire.\u201d And a month after he called for a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).\n\nThe successive conferences were held after the USSR had shot down the Korean airliner KAL-007 and murdered 269 passengers and crew in cold blood.\n\nEven when making the case\u2014a powerful case\u2014that President Obama is a socialist, a devotee of Karl Marx, Stanley Kurtz does not engage in hysterics. He suggests that Obama seems to be tracking with the left wing of the Swedish Socialist Party. He is seeking to bring Marxist socialism to America, but not by employing the brutal methods of the Soviet-era KGB.\n\nWell, that\u2019s a relief. But it would explain Obamacare. Is it really incompetence? Is it really just a \u201cbotched\u201d rollout? Or, is it, as The New Republic\u2019s Noam Scheiber says, \u201ca deceptively sneaky way to get\u201d single-payer socialized medicine?\n\nFor a man as intelligent as Barack Obama is, it is hard to imagine that all of this trouble is accidental, that it all is the result of \u201cfolks\u201d who just made some mistakes in their zeal to do good.\n\nIf President Obama actually is a Marxist, then all of this suddenly makes sense. And he has never given us any indication he is anything else. That alone can explain the current crisis for this Great Republic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s getting harder even for sincere media supporters of President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement\u2014the government takeover of health care known as Obamacare\u2014to defend the indefensible..05/24/2016 13:37:40PM EST.", "author": "Ken Blackwell", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s getting harder even for sincere media supporters of President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement\u2014the government takeover of health care known as Obamacare\u2014to defend the indefensible.", "title": "Ken Blackwell - And What if He is a Marxist?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/kenblackwell/2014/02/14/and-what-if-he-is-a-marxist-n1795046", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2009/108/63864dc9-53d1-4a29-854f-bc2f8a14022b@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It\u2019s getting harder even for sincere media supporters of President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement\u2014the government takeover of health care known as Obamacare\u2014to defend the indefensible.", "title": "Ken Blackwell - And What if He is a Marxist?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/kenblackwell/2014/02/14/and-what-if-he-is-a-marxist-n1795046", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2009/108/63864dc9-53d1-4a29-854f-bc2f8a14022b@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "And What if He is a Marxist?, Ken Blackwell, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7ff\"", "article_summary": "For example, the claim that President Obama is a Marxist is offered as an example of right-wing rodomontade.\nStanley Kurtz was one of those cooler heads in 2008 who rejected the claim that Barack Obama was a Marxist, a socialist.\nIf President Obama actually is a Marxist, then all of this suddenly makes sense.\nOn campus, Barack Obama sought to prove he had not \u201csold out\u201d to the system, so he consciously sought out the Marxist professors on campus (p. 150) Sought them out.\nHe is seeking to bring Marxist socialism to America, but not by employing the brutal methods of the Soviet-era KGB."}
