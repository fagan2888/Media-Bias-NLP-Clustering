On Tuesday morning, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) showed off an April Fools’ Day Winston Churchill bicep tattoo, fooling at least one co-host of Fox & Friends.

Cruz was on the show to tout his plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and expand health savings accounts. Towards the end of the segment, co-host Steve Doocy asked the senator whether it’s true he has some new ink. Cruz rolled up a sleeve and showed off a cigar-smoking mug of Churchill painted in black on his arm, inspired by the Los Angeles street art depicting the lawmaker as a tattooed greaser.

While Doocy and Elisabeth Hasselbeck laughed at the faux-ink, Brian Kilmeade seemed genuinely interested in whether it was real.

Ultimately, it turned out this was a temporary tat. Because imagine how much a tattooed man would suffer in an Iowa caucus…
