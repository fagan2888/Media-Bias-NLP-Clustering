Attention: It has been reported that Chris Martin, the lanky Coldplay frontman and ex-husband of human mannequin Gwyneth Paltrow, is now dating American national treasure Jennifer Lawrence. I normally do not care at all about celebrity gossip, but Chris Martin, the embodiment of all-things-emo, and JLaw, an oft-GIF-ed woman who routinely throws up at parties, could not be more different, as far as cultural icons go:. There is only one way to process this news, as an unlikely mashup of JLaw reaction GIFs and Coldplay lyrics. Happy Friday, everyone:

“You left the sweetest of tastes in my mouth”
