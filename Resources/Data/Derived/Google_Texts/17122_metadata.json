( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nIf it's difficult to imagine the past life of the Metrolux building in Loveland \u2014 gutted-out now and lined with piles of rubble \u2014 it's almost impossible to picture its future use as a place of worship.\n\nBut not for members of Foundation Church.\n\nEver since the non-denominational church purchased the long-vacant building two years ago, members have been waiting and planning to move in.\n\n\"I've been in a number of times, and you just kind of close your eyes and envision what the big sanctuary room is going to look like,\" Foundations Church Executive Director Scott Mead said. \"We're all very excited to be able to see a building that's been an eyesore for a long time come alive again.\"\n\nPermanent Home\n\nDemolition work inside the 33,000-square-foot building at 3120 Denver Ave. began this month. The building has been vacant since October 2005, when the new Metrolux 14 opened in The Promenade Shops at Centerra.\n\nFoundations Church purchased the property for $1.8 million in early 2012 from a group of investors.\n\n\"Ever since then we've been in the planning stages,\" said Bob Sorensen, one of the elders at the church.\n\nA full build-out is designed, but this is just phase one, which Sorensen said includes finishing about half of the space. Church offices currently at 1905 W. Eighth St. will remain there at least for a couple of years before moving into the upstairs of the old Metrolux, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe top priority \u2014 and what church officials hope to have complete late this year \u2014 is the main auditorium space, a nursery and youth meeting areas.\n\n\"A permanent facility will allow our various ministry groups to meet during the week, instead of at people's homes,\" Mead said.\n\nThe auditorium space will have a stage and seating for about 1,400 people for the three Foundation Church services each weekend.\n\nSince forming in late 2011, Foundations Church has held its services at Thompson Valley High School.\n\n\"They've been meeting at a temporary facility, and everybody's ready to be in what we consider to be our home,\" Sorensen said.\n\nDestruction Phase\n\nThe project is one of many pieces and some surprises, too. Church officials knew, for example, that theater walls would have to come down to make the large open space needed for services. What they didn't know was that once those long-standing dividing walls were removed, the stability of the building would be in question.\n\nSo initial work has focused on stabilization, with crews installing helical piers as deep as 40 feet under the existing foundation. Another main focus will be leveling the sloped floors that had previously held aisles.\n\nThe church has a demolition permit for the space, and officials hope to have a building permit in the coming weeks.\n\n\"A lot of destruction has to occur before construction can happen,\" Sorensen said. \"We're in the destruction phase.\"\n\nThe first phase of the project is expected to cost just more than $5 million. Sorensen said the church sold construction bonds to members, and the support was overwhelming.\n\n\"We were limited to raising $5.3 million and we could have sold $6 million. We had to turn people away,\" he said.\n\nThe construction schedule depends on all those moving pieces and surprises but Sorensen said the hope is for Christmas services to take place in the new space this year.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Jessica Maher at 970-669-5050 or maherj@reporter-herald.com.
