The whole country\u2019s walking around wondering if this guy\u2019s really the president of a country. He sounds more like a maniac in an asylum,\u201d Mason said in a radio interview Sunday night.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s saying things that nobody believes. He was always lying every day of his life. Every time he talks it was a lie. The only time he told the truth is when you didn\u2019t hear from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is becoming so ridiculous, that even the biggest liar can\u2019t top himself,\u201d Mason, 82, told host Aaron Klein on WABC in New York City. \u201cHe looks at you straight in the face, and tells you that if you want your plan, you got your plan, you keep your plan. Now, a month-and-a-half later, you got no plan, you lost your plan, and he tells you you still got a plan.\u201d\n\nThe stand-up comic, who calls himself \u201cThe Ultimate Jew,\u201d continued on Obama: \u201cHe has a whole country walking around dizzy wondering who we\u2019re listening to. If this is a president of a country, how come he\u2019s the only one in America who doesn\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s going on here?\n\n\u201cNever did I expect a guy like this, the head of a country, to blatantly lie to your face, and then not only lie to your face, then lie about the fact that he never lied. Then lie again about the next lie he told. There used to be a time when you would worship the president, even if you didn\u2019t like him. You knew he told the truth because he\u2019s the president of a country. Now, he\u2019s the only guy in America who would have the nerve to lie this much.\n\n\u201cYou say to yourself, \u2018Wait a second. Who am I listening to? Was this guy actually elected to the presidency? A man who\u2019s completely out of his mind, who\u2019s out of touch with humanity, with America, who doesn\u2019t seem to know what\u2019s going on here? Does he read a paper?\u2019\n\n\u201cA guy like this should be locked up \u2026 If he wasn\u2019t the president, he\u2019d be in jail or in a sanitarium. He wouldn\u2019t be outside talking to people in this condition. He would be considered a danger to his own his own health, to his own life.\n\n\u201cThe latest is that it\u2019s only 5 percent of the people, only 15 [or] 20 million people who are going to lose their plan. \u2026 What if you shoot a guy? He\u2019s only one person out of 300 million. How come it\u2019s in the paper that you shot an innocent person and you go to jail for it? \u2026 Since when do you destroy people and it doesn\u2019t count because it\u2019s too small a percentage?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Legendary comedian Jackie Mason has uncorked a full-blown assault on President Obama and his troubled attempt at providing health care for Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s such a ridiculous thing.
