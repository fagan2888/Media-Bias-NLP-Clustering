Responding to a question from a pregnant woman, he wrote: \u201cAbort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. He said that he based this on his belief that suffering should be reduced whenever possible.\n\nThen came the rebuttal, on the Times\u2019s Op-Ed page, from Jamie Edgin of the University of Arizona and Fabian Fernandez of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which made the opposite case, though not on moral grounds, which they said was a different discussion. They wrote: \u201cRecent research indicates that individuals with Down syndrome can experience more happiness and potential for success than Mr. Dawkins seems to appreciate.\u201d They cited various studies and other kinds of evidence.\n\nSoon after, came the comments to that Op-Ed article, many of them very strongly felt. Some of them urged abortion and emphasized the social cost of caring for Down syndrome children.\n\nOne commenter, JohnB wrote this assessment of the parents of Down syndrome children:\n\nThey will never have an intelligent conversation with their child. They have no hope that their child will ever achieve anything of consequence in the world, and little hope that it will even rise to the level of mediocrity. Their child will never be able to care for them in their old age, and (hopefully!!!) will never give them grandchildren. You can rationalize all this after the fact, but this is NOT what any prospective parent wants! All rationalization aside, Down syndrome is an unmitigated tragedy, and abortion is the best choice.\u201d\n\nKari Wagner-Peck, whose son has Down syndrome, thinks those comments constitute a form of hate speech and should not have been posted. On her blog, she wrote about the discussion in the comments:\n\n\u201cIt was essentially an objectionable debate on whether people with Down syndrome should exist because they are such needy, worthless and pathetic creatures who suck up our social services. The comments were eventually closed but not before I wondered would any other group of individuals\u2019 right to exist be up for public discussion on the pages of NYTimes? If one were to replace \u201cDown syndrome\u201d with \u201cAfrican-American,\u201d or \u201cHispanic\u201d the NYTimes would be indistinguishable from a white supremacist discussion board. Would it be acceptable to discuss the value of poor people or welfare recipients? What if we evaluated the right of LGBT communities to exist?\u201d\n\nI heard from many readers who echoed Ms. Wagner-Peck\u2019s sentiments.\n\nBassey Etim, the Times\u2019s community manager, told me that The Times was following its own commenting rules when moderators approved those comments.\n\n\u201cReaders are allowed to discuss all of the same things an article does,\u201d he said in an email. He added that because the issue of abortion was expressly discussed in the article, \u201cWe really have no choice but to let readers take sides on that statement one way or another, even if the comments are ones we wouldn\u2019t usually approve. The same thing goes for 9/11 conspiracy theory comments \u2014 if an article is trying to debunk a conspiracy theory, we still must allow conspiracy theorists to respond, even if we normally wouldn\u2019t accept their comments.\u201d\n\nI understand Mr. Etim\u2019s reasoning on this but I would have preferred to see more sensitive moderation of comments in this case. To me, some of them do seem offensive, if not outright hateful.\n\n(By contrast, the letters that ran on the Times\u2019s editorial page managed to express a variety of views without being at all insensitive. But, of course, there were only a few letters published.)\n\nThis is not the only subject, of course, in which people write to me complaining about what they see as offensive comments. For example, I heard from Deborah Schneierson of Long Beach who objected to what she called the bashing of Hurricane Sandy victims in a recent comments section.\n\nShe wrote, describing one posted comment that described some victims of Sandy as \u201cstupid/idiot/morons,\u201d and that continued with \u201cI hope they continue to suffer.\u201d\n\nAn even easier decision, in my view, is not rewarding offensive comments with the gold star of the commenting world: the \u201cTimes pick.\u201d Ms. Wagner-Peck complains of this in the Down syndrome comments, where one comment explicitly urging abortion is recognized. (Times picks, as I\u2019ve explained, are not meant to signal agreement; nevertheless, they certainly seem to do just that.)\n\nIn the Sandy article, one Times pick goes to a harsh comment that refers to the \u201cstupidity\u201d of people who built too close to the water. Why give special affirmation to that, given the suffering of so many?\n\nThe Times makes a big and expensive commitment to civil discourse by having its comments moderated by human beings. Usually, it works well; reader comments often add a great deal to the discussion, and no one wants to reduce them to the blandness of pablum. Provocative, edgy comments are important to include. But basic civility matters, too.\n\nThe Times\u2019s comment policy describes the kinds of offensive comments that won\u2019t be published. Decisions on how to interpret that, of course, are subjective ones, but I\u2019d have to agree that some of the posted comments on both of these articles went over the line into unacceptability and added very little of value.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140909105827, "BN": "publiceditor", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/publiceditor", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/publiceditor/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 9, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/publiceditor/Readers Protest 'Hate Speech' in Comments Section on Down Syndrome ( 20140909 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Margaret Sullivan", "SCG": "The Public Editor", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Margaret Sullivan", "byl": "Margaret Sullivan", "twitter": {"description": "Comments on an article about a Hurricane Sandy rebuilding program provoked a similar reader response.", "creator": "@sulliview", "url": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/readers-protest-hate-speech-in-comments-section-on-down-syndrome/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "title": "Readers Protest 'Hate Speech' in Comments Section on Down Syndrome", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003101972, "description": "Comments on an article about a Hurricane Sandy rebuilding program provoked a similar reader response.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 9, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1410274707, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/thepubliceditor/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T15:43:54-04:00"}, "utime": 20150313154354, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140909, "pdate": 20140909, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Public Editor's Journal", "description": "Comments on an article about a Hurricane Sandy rebuilding program provoked a similar reader response.", "title": "Readers Protest 'Hate Speech' in Comments Section on Down Syndrome", "url": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/readers-protest-hate-speech-in-comments-section-on-down-syndrome/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/readers-protest-hate-speech-in-comments-section-on-down-syndrome/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Readers Protest 'Hate Speech' in Comments Section on Down Syndrome", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "This is not the only subject, of course, in which people write to me complaining about what they see as offensive comments.\nThe Times\u2019s comment policy describes the kinds of offensive comments that won\u2019t be published.\nAll rationalization aside, Down syndrome is an unmitigated tragedy, and abortion is the best choice.\u201dKari Wagner-Peck, whose son has Down syndrome, thinks those comments constitute a form of hate speech and should not have been posted.\nSoon after, came the comments to that Op-Ed article, many of them very strongly felt.\nOne commenter, JohnB wrote this assessment of the parents of Down syndrome children:They will never have an intelligent conversation with their child."}
