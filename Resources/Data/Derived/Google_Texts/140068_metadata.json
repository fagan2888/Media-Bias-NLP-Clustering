In a conversation with the Norwegian paper Aftenposten, Petrenko mansplained that orchestras \u201creact better when they have a man in front of them\u201d because \u201ca cute girl on a podium means that musicians think about other things.\u201d With great scientific authority, he added, \u201cMusicians have often less sexual energy and can focus more on the music,\u201d and \u201cWhen women have families, it becomes difficult to be as dedicated as is demanded in the business.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a weird rant, to say the least. As backward arguments against women\u2019s advancements go, it doesn\u2019t even make sense. Did Petrenko, who ostensibly works with musicians all the time, forget that orchestras are made up of men and women, gay and straight people? Or did he think that the mere presence of a female, any female, has the same disabling effect on everyone she stands before? Petrenko didn\u2019t do much to unmuddy his statements when he issued a clarification on the Oslo Philharmonic Web site, explaining, \u201cWhat I said was meant to be a description of the situation in Russia, my homeland. This situation is worsening with some new initiatives of the government. I deeply respect that many musicians, for example the famous violinist Gidon Kremer, feels the same way about the situation there.\u201d The outspoken Gidon Kremer certainly doesn\u2019t seem any opponent of female advancement \u2013 this summer he announced an October Berlin concert \u201cin support of the innocent victims of violence and human rights violations in Russia,\u201d including the members of Pussy Riot.\n\nPetrenko went on to say, \u201cTaken out of context I understand that what I said can very easily be perceived in the wrong way. I have the outmost respect for female conductors, for instance the extraordinary talented conductor Marin Alsop and the famous Veronika Dudarova. I\u2019d encourage any girl to study conducting. How successful they turn out to be depends on their talent and their work, definitely not their gender. I also want to add that my beloved wife is a choral conductor.\u201d\n\nSo were his remarks just a case of something lost in translation \u2013 the thoughts of a Russian, speaking to the Norwegian press, misinterpreted by the British one? Was he commenting on sexism \u2014 or simply perpetuating it? It\u2019s hard to say, though it\u2019s worth noting that even within the same newspaper on the same day, Petrenko\u2019s \u201ccute girl\u201d comment has also been interpreted as \u201csweet girl.\u201d Regardless, however, it\u2019s certainly safe to say that speculating on the sexual \u201cenergy\u201d of musicians and the relative sweetness or cuteness of the individual leading in front of the orchestra is wildly inappropriate at best.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Controversial remarks about female conductors show how far we have to go", "title": "Conductor: \u201cA cute girl on a podium means that musicians think about other things\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Controversial remarks about female conductors show how far we have to go", "title": "Conductor: \u201cA cute girl on a podium means that musicians think about other things\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/03/conductor_a_cute_girl_on_a_podium_means_that_musicians_think_about_other_things/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/marin_alsop.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Controversial remarks about female conductors show how far we have to go", "title": "Conductor: \u201cA cute girl on a podium means that musicians think about other things\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/marin_alsop.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, classical music, Feminism, Marin Alsop, Vasily Petrenko", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Or did he think that the mere presence of a female, any female, has the same disabling effect on everyone she stands before?\nI have the outmost respect for female conductors, for instance the extraordinary talented conductor Marin Alsop and the famous Veronika Dudarova.\nDid Petrenko, who ostensibly works with musicians all the time, forget that orchestras are made up of men and women, gay and straight people?\nPetrenko went on to say, \u201cTaken out of context I understand that what I said can very easily be perceived in the wrong way.\nHow successful they turn out to be depends on their talent and their work, definitely not their gender."}
