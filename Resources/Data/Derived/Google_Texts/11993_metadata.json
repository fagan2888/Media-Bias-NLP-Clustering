Instead, they hope to settle and make a new life in the pot industry.\n\nThe overstuffed vehicles parked outside Pueblo\u2019s Posada, a non-profit organization that helps homeless families, have license plates from as far away as South Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Texas.\n\nThose families have come in what social service agencies here see as a perfect storm: legal marijuana, Colorado\u2019s Medicaid Expansion (which extends coverage to all qualified adults under the 2010 Affordable Care Act), and the city\u2019s ranking as one of the least expensive cities to live in the US.\n\nOn the state\u2019s southern plains, Pueblo was once an industrial stronghold, a company town of steelworkers employed by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company.\n\nLike many towns devastated by the steel-market crash of 1982, Pueblo has never really recovered; its main employers are now the town\u2019s hospitals and nearby prisons. The county\u2019s unemployment rate in May was one of the state\u2019s highest, at 7.2%, according to the Colorado Division of Labor and Employment. The unemployment rate statewide in May was 4.3%.\n\nAccording to caseworkers at social service agencies, the newcomers are mostly from southern states where governors oppose expanding Medicaid to those with no insurance. Many arrive in town with little money and the expectation that they will easily find food, housing and a job in the marijuana industry.\n\n\u201cIn September, we helped 1,145 families and 3,214 individuals\u201d, says Edie De La Torre, executive director of Pueblo\u2019s Cooperative Care Center, which was founded by area churches in the wake of the steel mill closing in the mid-1980s. \u201cWe gave out $139,784 in food. These were our highest numbers ever.\u201d\n\nDe La Torre says the population served by the organization has changed dramatically in the past year.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that we helped a lot of people who were stretched very thin,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe they had lost a job or were working two jobs that didn\u2019t pay a lot ... Now we have people coming in from out of state who call us and say they\u2019re staying at a motel, they need food or maybe their medication, but they aren\u2019t residents of Pueblo County. We don\u2019t turn them away. But we tell them that if they\u2019re going to come back, they need to prove that they reside in Pueblo County\u201d.\n\nOn a recent weekday, the line stretched around the block when the agency opened at 9am.\n\n\u201cI had a wall I was building come down on my foot, and it got stuck,\u201d says a man in Cooperative Care\u2019s waiting room. \u201cI can\u2019t work right now, so this place is really helping me. I used to bring stuff here to donate; I\u2019m born and bred in Pueblo. Now look at me.\u201d\n\nAnother couple said they were there because of \u201chard times\u201d, but weren\u2019t from Pueblo. When asked about coming to town for legal marijuana, they didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cA good 25% of the people coming in for help are from Texas,\u201d says Mona Montoya, Cooperative Care\u2019s director of operations. \u201cA lot of people will give me a copy of their medical marijuana card or will just say \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll be honest with you, I came here to get into the industry\u2019.\u201d\n\nMontoya says that the hardest thing is seeing kids, who have no choice when their parents decide to come to Pueblo. \u201cJust last week I heard a little girl ask her mom if they were going to eat that day,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI call it the pot rush,\u201d says Anne Stattelman, director of Pueblo\u2019s Posada. \u201cMany people leave stable situations and maybe even have housing vouchers where they\u2019re from. But they hear about Pueblo on the internet and how it\u2019s this cheap place to live. They think they can find jobs. They uproot their kids. And then they don\u2019t have money for a rental deposit or much else when they get here.\u201d\n\nThough many are leaning heavily on social service agencies, some of these newcomers to Pueblo get settled on their own.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re from Oklahoma,\u201d say two young men aged 22 and 23 as they stood outside their RV in Pueblo West. \u201cYeah, we came here because pot is legal,\u201d one of them said, standing near their legal grow. \u201cBut we\u2019ve already been to social services to get our Medicaid cards and have some calls in for jobs next week.\u201d\n\nBut for many others, the road to self-sufficiency is more difficult.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had people passing through,\u201d said a young woman named April, who, along with two other homeless campers, has built a small camp hidden by a canopy of trees near the banks of the Arkansas river.\n\nShe said she had been there since last winter and used discarded shipping pallets to insulate the bottom of the camp\u2019s tents from the snow. \u201cI give them a place to stay for while, but then they move on,\u201d she said of the travelers coming to Pueblo, explaining that she had gotten stuck here a few years back when she and her husband were on their way to California from Ohio.\n\nApril and her friends are part of the growing population of Pueblo\u2019s homeless who intersect with those moving here for legal marijuana.\n\nOften these chronic homeless have drug addictions, mental illness or other problems that have led to them living in these camps or squatting in condemned buildings, according to Stattelman, who goes out weekly with an outreach team of case workers, nurses, and counselors to them to available services for food and shelter.\n\nBut despite the drain on social services, the legal marijuana industry is seen by some as a boon for the struggling local economy, where developers and county commissioners believe it has the potential to be the the Silicon Valley of marijuana\n\nThousands of acres east of Pueblo\u2019s city limits, where the Pueblo city council voted no in May on allowing recreational dispensaries, are being evaluated as the home of new, state-of-the-art grow operations that could provide the area much-needed jobs.\n\nIn June, the state recorded $60.7m in recreational pot sales to date for the year. In Pueblo County in 2014, the first year of legal sales, pot brought in $16.28m and resulted in $1.3m in sales tax and licensing fees.\n\nAnd for the first time since the first legal sale of marijuana in the state in January 2014, the pot industry surpassed $100m in monthly sales for the month of August, the Colorado Department of Revenue announced 9 October.\n\nThe Pueblo County commissioner and former Colorado state representative, Sal Pace, said that legalization has been an engine for economic growth for the area, citing that 36% of county construction projects in the last year have been related to the marijuana industry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another time in Pueblo\u2019s history when people came looking for jobs, and that\u2019s when the steel mill was booming,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the California gold rush, people who moved out here were not seen as a sign of failure, but a sign that it was something good for the economy.\u201d\n\nPace also points to Ballot Issue No 1B, which county voters will decide on 3 November, along with other marijuana-related measures. If passed, it will impose a phased in 5% excise tax on the sale of retail marijuana, with half of the proceeds going to a college scholarship fund for Pueblo County residents and the rest divided among funding to study medical marijuana, to fund a marijuana community impact, as well as a host of infrastructure improvements.\n\n\u201cThe question I ask is \u2018Has pot made Pueblo safer, better, or more prosperous?\u2019\u201d says Stattelman. \u201cI have no problem with pot,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the entire country legalizes, I say go for it. I understand that everyone didn\u2019t see these unintended consequences. But now that it\u2019s happened, we need help.\n\nShe says they gave a presentation to city council in spring 2014 about the issues they were seeing with pot, asking for support with sending new arrivals home. Posada, a non-profit, relies on a mix of grants, donors, and federal, state and local funding.\n\nBut Pace does not see evidence that this influx is pot-related. \u201cUntil I see hard numbers, I\u2019m not going to consider someone who\u2019s a prohibitionist give information because of their bias or subjective views,\u201d he says.\n\nStattelman disagrees, pointing out that many people who arrive in Pueblo for jobs in the pot industry are not homeless when they arrive. \u201cPeople come to Pueblo for opportunity that is not here,\u201d she says. Last month, she decided to post guidelines on Posada\u2019s website for those who are looking to seek a new life here so they know what to expect.\n\nStill, Pueblo County sends a welcoming message on its website to all who might want to relocate.\n\n\u201cSo come check us out. If you are just here for a tour of the \u2018Rocky Mountain high\u2019, you\u2019re more than welcome.
