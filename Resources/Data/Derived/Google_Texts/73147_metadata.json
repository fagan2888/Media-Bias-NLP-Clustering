[@brennadavis7], Director of Sustainability, Virginia Mason\n\nWith the advent of the Affordable Care Act, health care has taken the spotlight around the globe. Our industry is being driven by a mandate for high quality care at the lowest cost.\n\nAt Virginia Mason, we are well positioned to thrive in this new era, having been on a path to transform health care since 2002. For instance, we were the first health care organization in the U.S. to adapt principles of the Toyota Production System to remove waste, improve quality and safety, and lower costs.\n\nAs a recent Talkback post by Johnson & Johnson's Joe Wolk examined, hospitals are expensive to operate \u2013 and just as taxing on the environment.\n\nIn fact, hospitals represent 8 percent of the total U.S. commercial energy use, health care generates millions of tons of waste each year, and global health care supply chain expenditures are about $4.2 trillion.\n\nReducing Cost, Protecting the Future\n\nThink of a hospital as a small town, except that it is bustling and using energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We use eight percent of total commercial energy in the U.S. to power infrastructure that is essential to providing a safe and comfortable environment for our patients.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves and at Virginia Mason, we saw the opportunity early, deciding to focus on sustainability for three main reasons: reducing human health impacts, reducing cost and protecting the natural world for future generations.\n\nWhen our team members use alternative transportation, we reduce air pollutants that affect respiratory illness. When we conserve energy, we lower the cost of quality health care. When we reduce our carbon footprint, we protect the environment for future generations.\n\nAn Expanded Emphasis\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence then that, as the focus on health care quality intensifies, we are also seeing an expanded emphasis on sustainability. Industry organizations like Practice Green Health and Healthier Hospitals Initiative are expanding their efforts nationally and internationally. And health care sustainability leaders are becoming more sophisticated in their efforts.\n\nDespite all of this great work, health care sustainability efforts often haven\u2019t been included in the broader sustainability conversation. Without this cross-pollination of sustainability ideas with other industries, health care can sometimes lack innovation.\n\nWe are lulled into complacency about the magnitude of our own impact without a pair of \u201coutside eyes.\u201d It is crucial that we share information about health care sustainability efforts so that we all build an aptitude for the work. At the very least, we must all try and choose health care that provides the highest quality care at the lowest possible cost and environmental impact.\n\nWhen physicians take the Hippocratic Oath, they vow to \u201cfirst do no harm\u201d to the patient. It\u2019s heartening that the definition of \u201charm\u201d is expanding to include the patient AND the planet.\n\nBecause human health and environmental health are inextricably linked and Planet health is patient health.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nBrenna Davis is director of sustainability at Virginia Mason in Seattle, named one of the 50 greenest health systems in the U.S. in 2013.
