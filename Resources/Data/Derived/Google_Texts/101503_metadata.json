(Governor's Office/Tim Larsen) (Photo: Tim Larsen, Tim Larsen) Story Highlights Since the program was rolled out in Monmouth and Ocean and expanded to Camden County a few months ago, it\u2019s credited with helping save more than 40 lives\n\nMarlboro Police Chief Bruce Hall said his officers helped save a life within a week after completing training counter heroin addiction\n\nSince the program was rolled out in Monmouth and Ocean and expanded to Camden County a few months ago, it\u2019s credited with helping save more than 40 lives with \u201creversals\u2019\u2019 performed by certified EMTs and EMT-trained police officers\n\nThe opportunity to prevent a drug overdose death a month ago is having a lasting impact on Frank Moschella, a young Toms River police officer.\n\nAnd Moschella concedes that timing was everything: He wouldn\u2019t have been able to intervene effectively prior to the recent launch of a program at the Jersey Shore that has equipped police officers and first responders to administer the antidote Narcan to overdose victims.\n\n\u201cI had a gentleman who had overdosed, a gentleman who had been known to use narcotics, especially heroin,\u201d Moschella said. \u201cI was able to save his life and give him another opportunity at life.\n\n\u201cHopefully he\u2019ll make better choices and better decisions.\u201d\n\nMoschella and others from law enforcement and addiction specialists attended a press conference Tuesday at the Rescue Mission of Trenton, where Gov. Chris Christie announced that the effort to help reduce the number of heroin-related deaths begun in Ocean and Monmouth counties is getting a statewide expansion.\n\nPolice officers and first responders in all 21 counties now will be trained in how to administer the nasally injected Narcan antidote to overdose victims.\n\nFurther, the New Jersey State Police has ordered 900 of the recovery kits, with Superintendent Col. Rick Fuentes promising that the kits \u201cwill be part of the equipment that every trooper will take when they go out on a patrol shift.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s part of a developing trend as more police departments across the nation are turning to Naloxone, commonly known for its trademark Narcan. In Quincy, Mass., police officers have carried Naloxone since October 2010.\n\nNarcan dose packs typically cost $25 each and other equipment, such as medical gloves and syringe-atomizer, brings the total cost of a Narcan kit to $50.\n\nOfficials say there have been 41 \u201csaves\u201d in Ocean County since the program was rolled out in April. Monmouth\u2019s launch this month has resulted in two more recoveries and Camden County, another early participant, has 16.\n\nMarlboro Police Chief Bruce Hall said it won\u2019t take long to see the impact when the program starts elsewhere in the state. Hall said his officers helped save a life within a week after department training was completed.\n\n\u201cWe deployed June 2, and five days and two hours later, we had our first save,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we weren\u2019t able to do last year and we lost three of our residents. It\u2019s difficult to sit there and face the families, especially when two of these people were 21 and 22 years old. It\u2019s heartbreaking to tell the parents their child isn\u2019t coming home.\u201d\n\nChristie in his remarks called the national war on drugs an \u201cabject failure.\u201d He said breaking the cycle of addiction remains a priority, as is acting \u201cto prevent a loss, to prevent an unthinkable tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in March, we empowered 28,000 EMTs throughout the state by allowing them to administer Narcan. As a result, police officers and EMTs are now trained to be equipped to administer the antidote to overdose victims,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have the ability to prevent this type of tragedy and save lives,\u201d said Christie, who also met with recovering addicts being treated at the Rescue Mission, including former Edison resident Daniel Watkins, 33.\n\nWatkins said he\u2019s never been administered Narcan, \u201cbut I have been in situations where friends and family have had the drug administered to them,\u201d he said.\n\nThose who are saved from overdose episodes \u201cneed the proper outlet to get to a different place in life,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cThey need to be able to walk through that door to treatment for addiction or mental help. If you don\u2019t have that opportunity, you\u2019re going to have the same result.\u201d\n\nWatkins earlier shared his thoughts with Christie.\n\n\u201cIf you were asking me about him five years ago, given my drug use, I would have said, \u2018Governor who?\u2019 But I\u2019m glad to say with the help of counselors and family and friends, I\u2019ve been clean and am actually doing something to change my life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state Department of Human Services is also working on creating a so-called bystander program to train relatives and friends of users how to use Narcan, based roughly on an established program in Massachusetts that has in some areas reduced overdose death rates by nearly 50 percent.\n\nIn Monmouth County, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office purchased an initial 300 units of Narcan, which have been distributed to the police departments. The doses were paid for with money confiscated from drug dealers in a series of investigations conducted by the prosecutor\u2019s office with local law enforcement agencies. Ocean County has also tapped forfeiture money.\n\nContributing: Staff writer Dustin Racioppi Bob Jordan 609-984-4343, bjordan@app.com\n\nOcean County documented a record 112 drug overdose deaths in 2013, and 21 drug overdose deaths were linked to heroin for the first two months of this year. In Monmouth County, there were 61 heroin-related deaths in 2013, and 13 through February of this year.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1qa51CH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gov.
