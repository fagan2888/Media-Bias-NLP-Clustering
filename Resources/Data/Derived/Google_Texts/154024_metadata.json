James Dunford, the president\u2019s pick to be the next chair of Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Senate Armed Services earlier this month. He cited Russia\u2019s status as a nuclear state and its military forces ability to violate allies\u2019 sovereignty as key reasons why it should be at the top of the list.\n\nRelated: A New Warning About Putin\u2019s Russia from a Top U.S. General\n\n\"So if you want to talk about a nation that could pose an existential threat to the United States, I'd have to point to Russia,\" Dunford, the current commandant of the Marine Corps said. \"And if you look at their behavior, it's nothing short of alarming.\u201d\n\nFlash forward a few weeks later to when Army Gen. Mark Milley, tapped to be the service\u2019s next chief of staff was before the Armed Services panel.\n\n\u201cI would put Russia right now from a military perspective, as the number-one threat,\u201d he said.\n\nDays later, Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Robert Neller, Dunford\u2019s possible successor as commandant, followed suit saying, \u201cRussia is probably the biggest threat.\u201d\n\nThe evaluations contradict several administration officials, and some senior members of Congress who have long warned about radical extremist organizations and their potential to carry out or inspire attacks on the U.S. homeland by so-called \u201clone wolves.\u201d\n\nRelated: Dissent in Putin\u2019s Russia Just Got More Dangerous\n\nIn fact, the day after Dunford testified, a spokesperson for the State Department said Secretary of State John Kerry \u201cdoesn't agree with the assessment that Russia is an existential threat to the United States, nor China, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nNot that Russia hasn\u2019t given military leaders plenty of reasons to change their minds. Moscow invaded Ukraine early last year and annexed the Crimea peninsula. Russia has since provided material and logistical support to separatist forces in Eastern Ukraine and undertaken numerous provocative acts that have frayed its relationships with the international community, such flying military aircraft through or near the airspace of Western powers.\n\nThe reason for alarm among the incoming brass is \u201can awareness that, if Russia ever attacked a NATO state even with limited/asymmetric means, we would quickly be risking war with a nuclear superpower,\u201d according Brookings Institution senior fellow Michael O'Hanlon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a far greater threat than anything ISIL can pose. So the minute you have that fear in a realistic way, it necessarily trumps any kind of typical terrorist threat,\u201d he added.\n\nO\u2019Hanlon doubted the similar warnings represented a \u201ccoordinate position, though once one person said it, others may have become more likely to see their point and reiterate the same argument.\u201d\n\nHouse Armed Services chair Mac Thornberry (R-TX) attributed the increased chatter to Moscow\u2019s continued intransigence toward the U.S.\n\nRelated: Kremlin Critics Say Climate of Fear Grows in Russia\n\n\u201cAll year, when we have had sessions with military leaders, intelligence leaders, Russia\u2019s aggressive action plus the amount of money they\u2019re spending in key technologies \u2013 modernizing their nuclear deterrent, for example \u2013 keeps coming up,\u201d he told The Fiscal Times on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cSo you put those things together and I think that\u2019s the reason some people place them at the top of the list for now,\u201d he added.\n\nWhatever the cause, the Pentagon officials have found a receptive audience in Congress. Lawmakers in both chambers, such as Thornberry, have urged the Obama administration to get tougher with Russian President Vladimir Putin, like providing weapons to Ukraine\u2019s military. The president has adamantly resisted such calls, opting instead to impose waves of economics sanctions on Moscow, though it\u2019s unclear how much longer he can keep turning a deaf ear.\n\nLawmakers from both parties backed a provision in the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that would give the Obama administration $300 million for Ukrainian security assistance. The measure demands that half of the proposed funding be withheld until at least 20 percent of it is spent on lethal aid.\n\nMeanwhile temperatures continue to rise on Capitol Hill, thanks to Moscow\u2019s demeanor.\n\nRelated: Chinese Investors Bought Around $1 Billion of Russian Government Bonds\n\nLast week Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called it an \u201cact of aggression\u201d that two Russian bombers came within miles of the California coast earlier this month.\n\nTwo U.S. F-15 jets intercepted the foreign aircraft but not before the Russian pilots transmitted messages on an emergency frequency. \"Good morning, American pilots. We are here to greet you on your Fourth of July Independence Day,\" the messages said.\n\n\u201cIf you ever have any doubt whether the Cold War is back on, I mean these are the kind of maneuvers that show that it is,\u201d according to Kinzinger, a former Air Force pilot.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Despite a steady drumbeat from Obama administration officials and others that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and terror groups like it represent the biggest national security threat to the U.S., a new crop of Defense Department leaders argue that the focus should be on an old foe: Russia.", "title": "The Russian Bear is Back, Just Itching to Start a New Cold War", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/29/Russian-Bear-Back-Just-Itching-Start-New-Cold-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08222014_Russia_Tank.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/29/Russian-Bear-Back-Just-Itching-Start-New-Cold-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08222014_Russia_Tank.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Despite a steady drumbeat from Obama administration officials and others that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and terror groups like it represent the biggest national security threat to the U.S., a new crop of Defense Department leaders argue that the focus should be on an old foe: Russia.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Two U.S. F-15 jets intercepted the foreign aircraft but not before the Russian pilots transmitted messages on an emergency frequency.\n\u201cI would put Russia right now from a military perspective, as the number-one threat,\u201d he said.\nLawmakers in both chambers, such as Thornberry, have urged the Obama administration to get tougher with Russian President Vladimir Putin, like providing weapons to Ukraine\u2019s military.\nSo the minute you have that fear in a realistic way, it necessarily trumps any kind of typical terrorist threat,\u201d he added.\n\u201cIf you ever have any doubt whether the Cold War is back on, I mean these are the kind of maneuvers that show that it is,\u201d according to Kinzinger, a former Air Force pilot."}
