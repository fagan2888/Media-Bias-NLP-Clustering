Now, the Republican-led House in Texas has passed a bill that adds a label to insurance cards to identify people who purchased health insurance through exchanges and those who received subsidies.\n\nAccording to House Bill 1514, insurers would be required to add the label \"QHP\" to any card issued to a person who bought health insurance through the exchange. It would also add a \"QHP-S\" for anyone who received subsidies through the Affordable Care Act to help them buy insurance.\n\nDoctors who argued in favor of the bill told the Tribune the letters would help \"remind patients\" to continue paying their premiums in the exchange, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nThe federal government said 1.2 million Texas residents purchased health care through the exchanges, with many qualifying for subsidies to help afford the insurance.\n\nCritics of the bill, including the Texas Association of Health Plans, told the Tribune the bill's letter could be used by doctors to decide not to treat a patient that was covered through the ACA.\n\nThe \"S\" part of the label may be a moot point by June when the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case that will decide if the subsidies are legal.", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Texas government has rejected almost anything associated with the Affordable Care Act.
