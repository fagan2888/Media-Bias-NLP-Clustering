The move comes as the administration's self-imposed Nov. 30 deadline for fixing the site is just days away, and officials acknowledge it may not be fully operational by then.\n\nThe pilot program announced by CMS would initially launch for residents in Ohio, Florida and Texas, and is the latest effort to give users an alternative to the troubled site.\n\n\u201cThis is one more way we are working to offer consumers a variety of ways to enroll in affordable coverage,\u201d agency spokeswomen Julie Bataille said in announcing the pilot project. \u201cBy strengthening the multiple channels to enroll in quality, affordable coverage \u2026 we are ensuring that every American who wants it can gain access to these new coverage options.\u201d\n\nBataille said that direct enrollment has \u201cbeen there from the start.\u201d But the option was limited by the website problems, which have been fixed to the extent that insurance companies can now send applications to the site to assess enrollees' eligibility for coverage and potential discounts on premiums, she said.\n\nThough the option could help Americans frustrated by the HealthCare.gov\u2019s crashes, slow response times and other problems, it is another acknowledgement that the site probably will not be working for everybody by the administration\u2019s Nov. 30 deadline.\n\nOfficials originally vowed to fix the site by then. As the extent of the site's problems became apparent, officials lowered the bar on that goal -- vowing instead to significantly improve the site by the end of the month.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that improvements to the site are on schedule, including faster response times, and that it should be able to handle 50,000 concurrent users.\n\n\"If there are more than 50,000 people trying to use the website, individuals can choose to receive an email from CMS when the traffic on the website has been reduced,\" he said.\n\nAdministration officials have also been encouraging Americans to submit written applications, contact call centers or visit sign-up centers to enroll for insurance.\n\nThey continue to say the site will be working smoothly by the end of the month for \u201ca vast majority of Americans.\u201d And last week, they extended the enrollment deadline from Dec. 15 to Dec. 23 to get insurance coverage starting Jan. 1.\n\nAmericans, who are required to have insurance under the president\u2019s 2010 health care law, must enroll by the end of March or face a tax penalty.\n\nIn another development, GoHealthInsurance.com announced Monday that it has become the first private insurer to integrate with the so-called Federal Data Service Hub --- which includes IRS, citizenship and other personal information. So Americans can now use that as well to bypass the federal site and enroll in health plans under ObamaCare that kick in next year.\n\nThe company also said the process includes the capacity to calculate the subsidies.\n\nAs for the CMS announcement, Bataille said the pilot project will help improve the overall direct enrollment option because insurers and enrollees will provide federal officials with \u201cdetailed feedback on their experience.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/White House",
