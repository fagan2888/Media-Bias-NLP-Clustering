Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) apologized during Saturday night's GOP debate for his campaign’s decision to tell supporters on the eve of the Iowa caucus that Dr. Ben Carson had dropped out of the presidential primary race.

Cruz claimed that his campaign had misinterpreted a CNN report that Carson would not be continuing on to New Hampshire and South Carolina after the Iowa caucus. CNN, Cruz said, called the announcement “highly significant."

Cruz said that he had since apologized to Carson, whom he considers a friend.

Prior to Cruz's apology, Carson had made a bizarre, thinly-veiled attack on the Cruz campaign’s decision to tell its supporters that Carson had dropped out of the race.
