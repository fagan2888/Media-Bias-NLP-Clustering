President Obama has decided to rename Mount McKinley in Alaska to its original name of Mount Denali.

The president announced this on Sunday as he is now in Alaska promoting aggressive action to combat climate change, being the first sitting president to visit the arctic.

Many people are outraged by this change, especially in Ohio where President McKinley was from, but others don't see an issue.

"If it was originally called Mount Denali I don't personally have any kind of issue with it being changed back to what it was originally. Yeah, I can understand why native groups in Alaska and not just Native Americans but also Alaskans prefer the original name," says Marietta College History professor, Doctor Matthew Young.

President Obama is spending three days in Alaska for his efforts involving climate change and to improve relations with the federal government and the nation's Native American tribes.
