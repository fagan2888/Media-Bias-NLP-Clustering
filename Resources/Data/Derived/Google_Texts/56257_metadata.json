The currency's quick drop was partly responsible for the central bank deciding not to cut rates further in January as it waited to see what shape the promised fiscal policy would take.\n\nThe central bank cut rates twice last year to cushion the economy from the negative impact of the oil price shock, which sent Canada into a mild recession in the first half of 2015.\n\nA little less than a fifth of economists still forecast the bank will have to cut rates again sometime this year.\n\n\"It is premature to contemplate a hawkish stance from the Bank of Canada since the medium-term global and domestic outlook remains far from rosy,\" said Sebastien Lavoie, assistant chief economist at Laurentian Bank, taking the same view as many policymakers on the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nBut years of low borrowing costs sent the household debt-to-income ratio to a record high of 165.4 percent in the fourth quarter, reinforcing fears Canadians have taken on too much debt, particularly in the housing market where much of it is parked.\n\n\"Canada's economy remains highly leveraged once we combine the corporate, household and total government debt,\" said Lavoie. \"It remains to be seen if the tax relief offered to low and mid-income households in the federal budget will allow them to start deleveraging.\"\n\n(Polling by Anu Bararia and Sarmista Sen; Editing by Ross Finley and Bill Rigby)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BENGALURU/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy's strong start to the year allied wi", "title": "First Bank of Canada rate hike draws closer on fiscal stimulus: Reuters poll", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/First-Bank-Canada-rate-hike-draws-closer-fiscal-stimulus-Reuters-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-canada-economy_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/07/First-Bank-Canada-rate-hike-draws-closer-fiscal-stimulus-Reuters-poll", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-canada-economy_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BENGALURU/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy's strong start to the year allied wi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"Recent stronger growth reduces the chance of a rate cut,\" said Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.\nA little less than a fifth of economists still forecast the bank will have to cut rates again sometime this year.\nThe central bank cut rates twice last year to cushion the economy from the negative impact of the oil price shock, which sent Canada into a mild recession in the first half of 2015.\nThe currency's quick drop was partly responsible for the central bank deciding not to cut rates further in January as it waited to see what shape the promised fiscal policy would take.\nStill, at 7.3 percent, the unemployment rate is too high for the bank to raise rates, said Reitzes, who sees the first rate hike occurring in the third quarter of next year."}
