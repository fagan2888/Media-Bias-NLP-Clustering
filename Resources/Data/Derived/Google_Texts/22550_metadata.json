I\u2019ve included links at the bottom of this post to three articles in the series, which has been featured on Revealnews.org.\n\nWithin the last year we\u2019ve seen an increase in nonprofit public interest group reporting on workers\u2019 comp. The National Public Radio/Pro Publica series was welcomed by many workers and applicants' attorneys for its focus on how worker rights are being eroded in the workers\u2019 comp system.\n\nIn my view the current Center for Investigative Reporting series is just as important. It reveals aspects of the California system that have been out of control. Until those aspects are addressed, it will be hard for worker advocates to shift the pendulum back.\n\nJewett does an excellent job of summarizing some of the most egregious recent examples of medical provider fraud in California. Many of those cases have been referenced in this blog over time, but Jewett does a good job of connecting dots and demonstrating how some doctors and ancillary providers have used workers comp to profiteer, ignoring the health and well-being of the workers in their care.\n\nA lien system that ran amok essentially aided and abetted some of the bad behavior. That\u2019s not to say that all lien filers are abusers, but the system has been plagued with too many zombie liens and providers out to make a buck.\n\nMuch, though not all, of this problem has been in a handful of Southern California counties.\n\nLien reforms tightened things up for a while, but lien volume has been rising recently.\n\nMy last post detailed a number of practical measures that might help improve the comp system (see link below).\n\nBut I didn\u2019t focus on some of the issues noted by Jewett.\n\nShe highlights how Medicare and states providing Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have more tools to control workers\u2019 comp fraud than is available under the California workers\u2019 comp system.\n\nHer article, \u201cHoles in Oversight Leave California Workers\u2019 Comp Vulnerable to Fraud\u201d, notes that:\n\n\u201cLeveraging the power to zip the wallet, the federal Affordable Care Act handed a particularly powerful fraud-fighting tool to state Medicaid agencies. They must stop paying a health care provider if they determine there is a 'credible allegation of fraud.' Medical providers then can fight the determination in administrative courts.\n\n\"No such rule exists in California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program.\u201d\n\nFurther, she points out that:\n\n\u201cMedicare officials know scammers can be brazen enough to steal patient identities, fabricate a sham medical office and bill for phantom care. As a result, the federal program has set up a system to check on medical offices.\n\n\"Medicare uses its own data to determine whether classes of providers with track records of graft are medium- or high-risk, such as wheelchair merchants and home health agencies.\n\n\"Both types of providers are visited when they initially open, three or five years later \u2014 depending on the industry \u2014 and whenever officials get a complaint. A government-contracted auditor interviews operators and takes a look behind the counter, according to Jason Weinstock, a former supervisory investigator for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department\u2019s inspector general.\n\n\"In California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system, no such data reviews or facility vetting occur on a regular basis. In fact, no central authority performs inspections to make sure medical firms are doing what they claim to do.\u201d\n\nOne suggestion from Jewett is that workers could be empowered to identify billing fraud.\n\nMedicare and many health insurers provide patients with a letter detailing what services have been billed and what was paid. In my experience, I can\u2019t think of any insurer other than The Travelers which is sending an explanation of benefits paid to workers.\n\nI\u2019d be curious as to how this has worked out for The Travelers and whether it has uncovered fraud this way, how that has affected cases, and its assessment of the costs vs. benefits of such a notification letter.\n\nJewett also suggests that workers\u2019 comp ban providers who have been convicted of fraud related charges:\n\n\u201cIn Medicare, medical professionals may be banned from seeking money to see patients if they\u2019ve been convicted of defrauding a health care program or fraud-related offenses.\n\n\"But those banned providers have no problem starting a second career in California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d\n\nShe also notes that unlike workers\u2019 comp, Medicare cracks down on ownership of clinics by those with fraud histories:\n\n\u201cMedicare doesn\u2019t bar just doctors, pharmacists and chiropractors with histories of fraud. It also takes a look at who\u2019s in charge.\n\n\"Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 inspector general\u2019s office will investigate clinic operators\u2019 ownership and ban those with a 5% or greater stake who have a history of certain fraud convictions ...\u201d\n\nAnother possible solution to workers\u2019 comp fraud suggested by Jewett is to \u201cfree the data.\u201d Medicare data on physician billing practices have been released, but workers\u2019 comp data is not available. More transparency of data might help.\n\nThese seem like good suggestions.\n\nIt\u2019s in the interests of workers to root out abusers in the system.\n\nHere is a link to Jewett\u2019s article on holes in oversight.\n\nHere is a link to her article (and an interesting podcast) titled Billion Dollar Scam.\n\nAnd here is her article, Profiteering Masquerades as Health Care for California Injured Workers.\n\nThe CIR article, How California\u2019s Health Care System for Workers Forgot About Fraud, is here.\n\nAnd my WorkersCompZone recent post with ideas to improve the system is here.\n\nJulius Young is a claimants' attorney for the Boxer & Gerson law firm in Oakland.
