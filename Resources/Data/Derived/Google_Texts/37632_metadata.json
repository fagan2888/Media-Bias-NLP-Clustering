To make money, medical centers have to figure out what it actually costs to provide care and how to spend less while maintaining or improving outcomes.\n\nThe linchpin of this effort at the University of Utah Health Care is a computer program \u2014 still a work in progress \u2014 with 200 million rows of costs for items like drugs, medical devices, a doctor\u2019s time in the operating room and each member of the staff\u2019s time. The software also tracks such outcomes as days in the hospital and readmissions. A pulldown menu compares each doctor\u2019s costs and outcomes with others\u2019 in the department.\n\nThe hospital has been able to calculate, for instance, the cost per minute in the emergency room (82 cents), in the surgical intensive care unit ($1.43), and in the operating room for an orthopedic surgery case ($12).\n\nWith such information, as well as data on the cost of labor, supplies and labs, the hospital has pared excess expenses and revised numerous practices for more efficient and effective care.\n\nMichael Porter, an economist and professor at Harvard Business School, called the accomplishments \u201cepic progress.\u201d\n\nRecently, Dr. Porter and a colleague, Robert Kaplan, visited Utah and concluded that the hospital group was one of the few in health care to properly measure the costs of care. Elsewhere, with a very few exceptions, Dr. Porter said, \u201cit\u2019s a total mess.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther medical institutions, including MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the Mayo Clinic, based in Rochester, Minn., are also trying to get a handle on costs.\n\n\u201cI can give you an unambiguous endorsement\u201d of the Utah system, Dr. Russell M. Howerton, chief medical officer at Wake Forest Baptist Health in North Carolina, said after a recent visit.\n\nIt is not easy, said Dr. Thomas W. Feeley, who is leading the effort at MD Anderson. His group decided to go through every single process a patient experiences and figure out what the hospital paid for each person caring for the patient.\n\nThe group began with head and neck cancer, treatment of which turned out to involve 160 processes requiring measurement. To assess outcomes, it asked patients which they thought were most important. Head and neck cancer patients wanted to be able to talk and to swallow. (Survival, which many doctors had thought was a top priority, was not something patients raised; many assumed they would survive.)\n\nAt the Utah hospital, the group began by looking at how much supplies cost \u2014 bandages, sutures, medications. Then it started tracing use of those items to individual patients.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I need a hip replacement,\u201d said Dr. Robert C. Pendleton, Utah\u2019s chief quality officer. \u201cWell, how many bandages did you use for me, and how many did you use for the guy in the bed next to me and the lady in the next room who also had hip replacements?\n\n\u201cThen you can start to say, \u2018Well, wait a minute, patients who have their hips replaced by Dr. Jones are using twice as many bandages. Why is that?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThey added in labor costs, a more complicated question. Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Porter of Harvard tell hospitals to go in to hospital rooms with a stopwatch and time how long each staff member spends on each procedure and with each patient.\n\nAt the Mayo Clinic, the stopwatch is changing practices. Instead of having doctors in the emergency department type in notes on each patient, for example, the clinic has started a pilot project in using lower cost scribes do that work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith their new computer program, executives at the Utah hospital are also finding some simple ways to improve outcomes and reduce costs.\n\nWhen internal medicine doctors looked at their costs per day, they were stunned to see how much they were spending on lab tests. Each was cheap, $10 or $20, but the total bill came to about $2 million a year.\n\nStudies have found that 20 percent to 50 percent of hospital lab tests were completely unnecessary, ordered by residents with no questions asked. Most insurers were paying a lump sum for patients\u2019 treatment so the cost for extra tests was borne by the hospital. Patients were getting so many blood tests that some became anemic.\n\nThe Utah doctors decided to require residents to justify each lab test. Orders plummeted. The hospital saved $200,000 a year.\n\nChanges also involved bypass surgery in a project led by Dr. David A. Bull, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Utah. He and his colleagues asked what variables made a difference in costs and outcomes, hoping to improve both.\n\nThat led them to nine measures they called \u201cperfect care,\u201d the primary determinants of how long a patient stays in the hospital after surgery, which is a major contributor to costs and a harbinger of poorer outcomes.\n\nThe variables included such practices as keeping blood sugar under control \u2014 75 percent of their bypass patients had diabetes \u2014 and giving oxygen to patients who are having trouble breathing when they are taken off the ventilator. The usual quality measures, like giving antibiotics before surgery, did not affect length of stay.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group standardized the care after surgery with those nine items in mind, and nurses were permitted to give medications or oxygen without having to contact a doctor first.\n\nSome were skeptical the program would make a difference, Dr. Bull said. But costs fell by 30 percent because patients spent less time in the hospital and had fewer complications. Letting nurses initiate treatment meant patients got needed medications faster, and the emphasis on \u201cperfect care\u201d meant the most important things got done.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started working in health care, like everybody I thought: \u2018Oh, my God. It\u2019s such a tough problem,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Porter, the Harvard economist, said.\n\nNow he has changed his mind. \u201cI have no doubt we can solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know exactly what we have to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150907204019, "twitter": {"description": "Most businesses know the cost of everything that goes into producing what they sell \u2014 essential information for setting prices.
