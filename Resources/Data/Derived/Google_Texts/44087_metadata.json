It\u2019s not hard to see why: Cautious corporations and a still-sputtering economic recovery have put more workers in the position of taking on heavier workloads for less pay.\n\nThe impacts can be far-reaching. \u201cWe spend so much time at work that when we\u2019re unhappy there, the negativity can spill over to other parts of our lives,\u201d says Susan Klaubert, a vice president with ClearRock Inc., a Boston-based leadership development and outplacement firm. Being happier at work will also make you more productive and less prone to burnout, which can lead to more recognition in your current role.\n\nRelated: 6 Wise Ways to Boost Your Career in 2014\n\nThe first thing to determine is why you\u2019re unsatisfied \u2013 then start taking action to make your situation better. Start by answering these three important questions:\n\n1. Do you want to stay at your current job? If you generally like your job, your colleagues and your working environment but are feeling underpaid, underappreciated or bored, it\u2019s time to take action to improve your current position.\n\nFirst, determine whether you really are being underpaid. Check out a salary comparison website like GlassDoor.com to understand whether your compensation is similar to that of other workers in your area who are doing a similar job. If it\u2019s way off, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to speak with your manager about getting a raise. Just make sure you\u2019ve planned out how you\u2019ll plead your case before scheduling the meeting.\n\nMake sure your colleagues are aware of your contributions and are thinking of you when new projects and assignments arise. Look for ways to promote yourself without being a braggart. \u201cYou can toot your own horn without being too self-promoting,\u201d says Lisa Mandell, author of Career Comeback: Repackage Yourself to Get the Job You Want. \u201cInstead of sending an office email saying, \u2018Look what I did,\u2019 send a congratulatory note that reads, \u2018I want to thank this person for working with me to achieve this.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Ways to Boost Happiness at Work\n\nIt\u2019s important to also make yourself known outside of your department. Introduce yourself to other coworkers when you run into them at the water cooler or company functions, and force yourself to join intra-company clubs or committees. The more visible you can be within the company, the more likely you\u2019ll come to mind; companies know that more engaged workers will proactively change their work environment in order to stay engaged.\n\n2. Do you like your job but have a beef with the company? For some people who dread lugging themselves into the office everyday, the problem is not the work itself, but the company for which they work. If you feel like you\u2019re not a good fit for the corporate culture or the issues causing your stress have little chance of being resolved, it may be time to refresh your resume and start putting out feelers for a new gig. It\u2019s simple to sign up for email alerts from job hunting sites like Indeed.com, which will give you a sense of what kind of jobs are available.\n\nYou should always be networking outside of your company, but when you\u2019re in job-hunt mode, you\u2019ve got to turn up the efforts. In addition to ensuring your LinkedIn profile is current, start attending networking events. Join a trade group or reconnect with your alma mater\u2019s career development office to see make sure you know when events are coming up.\n\nMost importantly, don\u2019t check out of your current job. In today\u2019s market, it can take months to find a new job. Staying committed to fulfilling current work obligations means you\u2019ll be on the best possible terms with your boss and coworkers when you do finally leave, and you never know when you might need those connections later in your career.\n\nRelated: Hate Your Job? 5 Ways to Love it or Leave It\n\nYou also don\u2019t want to do anything that could jeopardize your current position or make you an easy target for a layoff. \u201cEven if you\u2019re really unhappy, don\u2019t make a compulsive decision to quit that you\u2019re going to regret later,\u201d says Roy Cohen, a New York-based career counselor and executive coach. \u201cIt\u2019s much better to find a job if you have one while you\u2019re looking.\u201d\n\n3. Are you in the wrong profession altogether? Making a big career change is never easy, but sometimes it\u2019s the only solution for workers who are truly unhappy in their profession. Any worker can find himself in this situation \u2013 from millennials who are just realizing that they don\u2019t really want to be in the industry they originally chose, to baby boomers who\u2019ve finally burned out on a profession after decades on the job.\n\nFor workers in this situation, the most important thing is to figure out how you can apply your current skills to another profession and which additional skills you need to acquire before making the switch.\n\nSit down with a career coach, or to use your network to find someone in your target to serve as a mentor of sorts as you consider transitioning. \u201cIt\u2019s going to depend on your tolerance for the risk and ambiguity of making that kind of move, and your ability to potentially go without a paycheck while you retool,\u201d says New York-based career coach Dani Ticktin Koplik.\n\nYou may also want to confer with a financial planner to check that you\u2019ve got the fiscal ability to make a move. Transitioning to a new industry might require taking classes or accepting a pay cut for a lower-level position in order to gain the knowledge and experience you need.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "To be happier at work, first determine why you\u2019re unsatisfied \u2013 and then start taking action to make your situation better.
