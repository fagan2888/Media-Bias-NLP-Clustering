In other words, the content they post on the social network without paying is reaching fewer people, leading some marketers to suggest the changes are designed to drive them to purchase advertising.\n\nOn Thursday Facebook took to its blog to rebuff those allegations. The company\u2019s ad product marketing lead, Brian Boland, denied that it\u2019s cutting brands\u2019 organic reach in order to make more money from advertising, and argued instead that the decline is simply a result of the growing amount of content published across its network.\n\n\u201cCompetition in News Feed \u2014 the place on Facebook where people view content from their family and friends, as well as businesses \u2014 is increasing, and it\u2019s becoming harder for any story to gain exposure in News Feed,\u201d Mr. Boland wrote.\n\nIn addition, the company has made recent tweaks to the way the News Feed surfaces content in order to keep its users happy. \u201cRather than showing people all possible content, News Feed is designed to show each person on Facebook the content that\u2019s most relevant to them,\u201d Mr Boland added.\n\nBut many marketers questioned, though, whether Facebook was thinking of its users or of its ad sales efforts. In March, online food ordering service Eat24 deleted its entire Facebook presence, claiming the social network was deliberately limiting the exposure of its posts in order to force it to pay for ads.\n\n\u201cWhen we first met, you made us feel special. We\u2019d tell you a super funny joke about Sriracha and you\u2019d tell all our friends and then everyone would laugh together. But now? Now you want us to give you money if we want to talk to our friends,\u201d the company wrote in a humorous blog post announcing its decision.\n\nEat24 isn\u2019t the only brand that feels this way. Many marketers paid significant sums to accumulate audiences or \u201cfans\u201d on the social network, only to find it\u2019s getting harder to actually put content in front of them without paying.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook\u2019s response seems to be that fans help boost the effectiveness of its ad products. In other words, marketers must pay for ads to extract value from the fans they may already have paid to acquire. The changes aren\u2019t designed to help Facebook sell more ads, but they might.\n\n\u201cFans make your ads more effective. When an ad has social context \u2014 in other words, when a person sees their friend likes your business \u2014 your ads drive, on average, 50% more recall and 35% higher online sales lift,\u201d Mr. Boland\u2019s post read, adding, \u201cFans also make the ads you run on Facebook more efficient in our ads auction. Ads with social context are a signal of positive quality of the ad, and lead to better auction prices.\u201d\n\nSome marketers don\u2019t seem impressed by Facebook\u2019s explanation. Shauna Hogg, owner of ecommerce site All Things Racing Apparel left a comment on the company\u2019s post stating, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make me feel any better, still as frustrated as ever. Our fans like our pages because they want to see our content. On my personal Facebook page, I\u2019d rather see content from pages I like than the paid sponsored ads! People are complaining about the volume of sponsored ads, however we\u2019re forced to do that so our own fans can see our content. There is something fundamentally wrong with that theory!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Eat24 says it doesn\u2019t regret its decision to ditch Facebook at all.\n\n\u201cWe closed our Facebook page, and absolutely nothing happened. The sky didn\u2019t cave in. Hell didn\u2019t freeze over. Tuesdays are still exclusively for Tacos. Everything is pretty much exactly the same as it was when we had a page. The only difference is now we don\u2019t have to think about things like optimal headline length, preview image resolution, and the proper ratio of cats to cheeseburgers to maximize virality,\u201d it said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "[wsj-ticker ticker=\"FB\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Facebook\" postfix=\"\"] has recently faced criticism from marketers because their \u201corganic reach\u201d is decreasing.
