See Altarum's indicators here: http://bit.ly/1Ujrn4G\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOne interesting nugget: Health care prices in January 2016 were 1.6 percent higher year-over-year, which is the highest rate since December 2014.\n\nAltarum says it's premature to conclude that the era of low price growth is over, but notes that the uptick could continue: The distorting effect of the ACA's Medicaid \"pay bump\" \u2014 that temporary boost for primary care docs \u2014 has run its course, and there's price inflation across the economy. At the same time, prescription drug price growth is sloping downward, partly because of the scrutiny on that industry.\n\nHow health care powers the economy, redux\n\nSince the recession began in December 2007\n\n\u2014 Health spending has increased 24.0 percent\n\n\u2014 GDP (excluding health spending) has increased just 6.5 percent.\n\nTHANK GOODNESS IT'S FRIDAY PULSE where we were amused to learn that at Republican debates, Ted Cruz is more likely to promise to \"repeal every word of Obamacare\" than say \"if I am elected president.\" Tell PULSE: What would your first priority be, if elected president? Answers and tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nWEDDING BELLS \u2014 Send good wishes to ace Pro reporter Sarah Karlin, who takes a break from covering the pharma beat to celebrate her marriage to Max Smith this weekend. When you've got love, who needs other drugs?\n\nWAR OF WORDS OVER TRUMPCARE \u2014 PolitiFact has a new post that concludes a Ted Cruz attack ad oversteps by saying that Donald Trump wants a government-run health care system. \"That ad relied on very selective editing of an interview Trump had on CBS News,\" PolitiFact concludes. \"We rate this claim False.\"\n\n\u2026 Washington Examiner's Philip Klein disagrees. He argues that PolitiFact misread the CBS interview. \"It's clear from the context that Trump was actually referring to Republicans as only wanting to cover the bottom 25 percent,\" Klein writes, \"a view that he disagreed with in favor of covering everybody.\"\n\n\u2014 Where Trump stands on health care has shifted over time, and POLITICO's Paul Demko traces his evolution from proposing dramatic changes to now spouting GOP boilerplate. ICYMI: Paul's story.\n\n\u2014 We watched; no health news at last night's debate. Trump did reference his goal to require drug companies to \"bid\" for Medicare \u2014 an idea that, interestingly, Trump left out of his new health plan last week.\n\nMACRA GETS A CHECK-UP \u2014 The House Energy & Commerce Commitee's Health subcommittee scheduled a March 17 hearing to review the payment reforms in the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, which passed in April 2015. Expect CMS to be grilled on how it's implementing the law's value-based payment changes, and we'll be keeping our ears pricked for any early grumbling from docs worried about how they'll fare under the new rule.\n\nCALIFORNIA SMOKES OUT YOUTH SMOKING \u2014 Major moment in public health: California's set to raise the smoking age to 21. The state Senate cleared the bill on Thursday, after a companion measure passed the California Assembly last week. The legislation, which also regulates e-cigarettes and opens the door to new tobacco taxes, is now waiting on a signature from Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS HOSPITALS SPLIT OVER BALLOT MEASURE \u2014 The SEIU is pushing a ballot measure to level out payments to the state's hospitals, based on the prices they charge. It would be a dramatic change in how hospitals get paid, and is only the latest effort to scrutinize Massachusetts providers' market power. http://bit.ly/1pAiZSS\n\n\u2014 If the measure goes through, Partners HealthCare would lose $440 million in payments. But Steward HealthCare \u2014 the lone hospital system to support the proposal \u2014 would gain $21 million.\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

He cites a Wells Fargo study that more than half of surveyed firms think they'll exceed the Cadillac tax, which is one reason why they're hiking premiums and increasing employee cost-sharing now.\n\n\"While the tax has been postponed two years, \"simply delaying it won\u2019t protect the employer-sponsored health plans millions of Americans rely on,\" Hackbarth concludes. \"Only repeal can do that.\" http://uscham.com/1Xgqb1b\n\nCAPPING OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING ON DRUGS: BAD IDEA? \u2014 That's what the Manhattan Institute's Yevgeniy Feyman argues in a new report. He notes that several presidential candidates have proposed out-of-pocket caps, but concludes that they wouldn't help most Americans and could even lead to a hike in insurance premiums.\n\nFeyman's proposal: \"policymakers should take a multipronged approach that harnesses market forces, treats drug spending as investment, and offers tax credits to the most burdened.\" http://bit.ly/1TytbaV\n\nCMS SHIFTS ON MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, AND STOCKS CLIMB \u2014 Cigna saw its market capitalization go up by more than $500 million on Thursday after CMS pardoned the company's Medicare Advantage plans from major cuts to its bonus payments, Bob Herman reports. http://bit.ly/1UXhn1s\n\nTHE STORY OF THE WEEK \u2026 is Ezra Klein's podcast with World Bank president Jim Yong Kim on diversity, poverty and so much more.

The group was protesting a United Nations meeting over lack of access to HIV medication, Mashable reports.\n\n\"Martin Shkreli has become a supervillain that everybody loves to hate,\" said Tabitha Ha, coordinator of Youth Stop AIDS. \"But he\u2019s a product of a broken system.\"\n\n189.75 DOLLARS \u2014 That's how much it cost to give birth in 1956, including a four-day hospital stay, according to a photo posted by the retired surgeon who goes by the pseudonym Skeptical Scalpel. http://bit.ly/1Xh1tha\n\n4,215.00 DOLLARS \u2014 That's how much it cost in 2011 on average, according to a recent Health Affairs study.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nNARAL CEO Ilyse Hogue and Democratic Rep.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
