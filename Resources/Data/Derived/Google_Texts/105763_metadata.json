Those in attendance wrote the names of loved ones who've suffered from breast cancer on the fire engine.\n\nThe day's events culminated with exhibition soccer matches between members of the women's team and its alumni in Tiger Stadium.\n\nThe philantrophy is especially important to the team as the mother of Head Coach Graeme Orr is in the later stages of breast cancer treatment. Sam Jackson of the Orange Beach Fire Department brought \"Cindy\" from the coast and presented Coach Orr with a special gift... a Teddy Bear.\n\n\"We present that bear to special people that are going through the struggles of cancer,\" said Jackson. \"We found out the coach's mother was a breast cancer survivor. What better person to receive a bear?\"\n\n\"It's not about myself,\" said Orr. \"It's about everybody as a whole, you know?
