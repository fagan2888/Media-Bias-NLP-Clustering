It was shallow, tedious, and wrong. In other words, it struck the perfect chord for today\u2019s GOP voters.\n\nMitt Romney definitely had his down sides as a candidate: the retread factor, and, as I noted two weeks ago, the fact that he made all those dramatic and (apparently) wrong predictions about the future of the economy. But I will say this for him. He did pass the this-guy-looks-and-sounds-like-a-plausible-president test. I always thought that was his greatest strength. He\u2019s central casting.\n\nNone of these remaining people looks much like a president, with the exception of Jeb Bush; and more to the point, they don\u2019t sound like presidents either. They sound like they\u2019re running for RNC chairman at best, or more likely leader of the Tea Party caucus. So despite all this spin from conservatives about what a strong field this is, as usual the opposite is the truth. It\u2019s an astonishingly weak field, unified not only in their opposition to Barack Obama and the federal government but also in their hostility to actual ideas that might stand a chance of addressing the country\u2019s actual problems.\n\nI\u2019ve just been reading through their \u201cbooks.\u201d Yes, I know. You\u2019re welcome. They\u2019re ridiculous. I can\u2019t say this with 100 percent certainty, but I may not have seen the word \u201cwages\u201d once. I certainly didn\u2019t see a discussion of wage stagnation anywhere. That\u2019s just one of a hundred examples I could cite.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that they come up short in terms of personal resumes. God knows, the current incumbent had a short one. Being a sitting or former governor, or a sitting senator\u2014those are qualification enough. And I don\u2019t doubt that they\u2019re intelligent people.\n\nBut the problem in the first instance isn\u2019t them. Let me put it this way. The greatest cardiologist in the world could move to town. But if everybody wants to eat chili-cheese fries all day and nobody wants to have bypass surgery, there\u2019s still going to be a lot of heart disease.\n\nYou follow me? There could be a man in this presidential field who is the political equivalent of that cardiologist\u2014Lincoln and TR and Reagan all rolled into one, with a little bit of Thatcher on the side and what the hell, a tiny dash of Clinton, just for crossover appeal. And it wouldn\u2019t matter. He wouldn\u2019t be able to demonstrate the breadth of his vision, because that isn\u2019t what the GOP base of today wants.\n\nI finally sat myself down and watched that Scott Walker speech from last week that everyone is raving about. If this was the standout speech, I sure made the right decision in not subjecting myself to the rest of them. It was little more than a series of red-meat appetizers and entrees: Wisconsin defunded Planned Parenthood, said no to Obamacare, passed some kind of law against \u201cfrivolous\u201d lawsuits, and moved to crack down on voter \u201cfraud\u201d\u201d\u2014all of that besides, of course, his big move, busting the public-employee unions. There wasn\u2019t a single concrete idea about addressing any of the major problems the country faces.\n\nWalker\u2019s blandishments toward the base were bland enough to get under the skin even of James Pethokoukis, the conservative economics writer who laid into the Wisconsin Governor for one particular bit of surreality:\n\nOpportunity is equal? The data, unfortunately, do not seem to support Walker\u2019s optimistic claim. First, there are other countries, such as Sweden and Canada, where the chances of escaping the bottom are just as good as in the United States. Second, American mobility rates have been stagnant over the past 40 years. Third, mobility rates vary greatly by race with 74 percent of white sons making it out of the bottom fifth versus 49 percent of African-American sons. Fourth, even the smartest kids have only a 1-in-4 chance of making it from the bottom fifth to the top fifth.\n\nThat\u2019s a conservative writer, remember. And he\u2019s right, obviously. But try to imagine Walker or any GOP candidate acknowledging these complications. That opportunity is not equal in America! That Sweden and Canada are our equals! That it\u2019s harder on black people! That candidate would be hooted out of Republican Party faster than you can say Charles Murray.\n\nWalker, I see, has surged in a new Iowa poll, while the only one who at least looks like president, John Ellis Bush, has taken a tumble and is viewed more negatively by potential caucus-goers than he once was (46 favorable, 43 unfavorable). We can\u2019t say for sure why Bush has fallen, but it seems clear that Walker has gained on the strength, so to speak, of his empty-calorie bromides.\n\nHe\u2019s gained because those items\u2014 kicking Planned Parenthood, denying your own citizens subsidized health-care coverage, pretending that voter fraud is a thing\u2014are what pass for ideas in today\u2019s GOP. Walker is even more vacuous on foreign policy, as Martha Raddatz revealed yesterday, twisting him around like a pretzel with a couple of mildly tough questions on Syria. The Democratic Party has its problems, but at least Democrats are talking about middle-class wage stagnation, which is the country\u2019s core economic quandary. Rick Santorum is, in fairness, but a) his solutions are the same ones conservatives have been advertising for years (lower taxes, less regulation, more two-parent families) and b) he\u2019s not going anywhere in the polls so far, undoubtedly precisely because he\u2019s trying to drop the homosexuality-is-bestiality shtick and talk about actual economic problems.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Scott Walker, u.s. poli, Rick Santorum, Jeb Bush", "publicationDate": 201502021045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "That Scott Walker speech was great?
