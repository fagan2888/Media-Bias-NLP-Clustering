"Whilst I have sympathy for her, she was very nasty to them," Thompson says. "She found it impossible to let go and allow her creation to be transformed in some way."

The psychological story behind the Disney-Travers relationship is interesting, Thompson says. Although working with Hanks — her on-screen adversary — was "heaven," she adds, they get to show "an unusual relationship between a man and a woman. It is quite peculiar — two bonkers artists at loggerheads."

Saving Mr. Banks proved hair-raising for both Hanks and Thompson. He had to sprout a mustache; she had to submit to a perm, because she prefers not to wear wigs. "It was the worst thing ever," says the actress. "My hair designer swore to me it was not a perm and more like a little kink. But it was a vicious perm, and it was desperate."
