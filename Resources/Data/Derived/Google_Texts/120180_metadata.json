One with the power to overturn and nullify all others? According to two sitting Utah legislators, Representatives Brian Greene (Republican \u2013 Pleasant Grove) and Marc Roberts (Republican \u2013 Santaquin), yes.\n\nTuesday evening, the two junior members of the Utah Legislature joined a national conference call and radio program advertised as \u201cThe place Tea Party Americans come together,\u201d hosted by right-wing strategist Charles Kacprowicz. The two Utah Republicans spoke in favor of a constitutional convention, more commonly known as a Con Con, where state legislators representing less than one in five Americans could vote to nullify any law or judicial ruling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the growth in interest in a [constitutional] convention. I\u2019m here to do whatever I can to move this forward,\u201d said Greene, who began his time in the Utah House of Representatives in January, 2013. The young attorney is perhaps best known for his attempt during the 2013 legislative session to pass a bill that would have made it a felony for any federal law enforcement officer, such as an FBI SWAT team, to enforce federal gun laws in Utah. The legislature\u2019s general counsel loudly cautioned that the bill was unconstitutional, but it still passed the House that year by a vote of 49-17 before dying in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe best chance we\u2019d have of doing this is the first time. After that, there will be more resistance from the other states.\u201d -Representative Brian Greene\n\nKacprowicz leads a movement on the Tea Party-aligned Right who are searching for a way to nullify federal laws and court decisions they disagree with, such as Obamacare and Roe v. Wade, but without opening the door for liberal state legislatures to be able to overturn the federal laws and SCOTUS rulings the Left disagrees with, such as the controversial Citizens United decision which opened the door for unlimited corporate campaign contributions. State-based nullification attempts are most often linked to Neo-Confederate secession groups (the number of them in the Rocky Mountain region have been growing), but the attempts have been quickly overturned by the courts who point out that Article VI of the constitution clearly says that the United States Constitution trumps any laws states may pass.\n\nThe solution, Greene, Roberts, and Kacprowicz say, is to organize a Con Con where legislators from each state join together to vote to overturn federal laws and rulings. But unlike Congress, where states are given a number of seats according to their population, this version of a Con Con would give every state the same number of votes. So although California has over 38 million people, they would only have the same voting power as Wyoming with its 576,000 residents. That enormous shift in the balance of power could theoretically allow representatives of only 16 percent of the U.S. population to call the shots and dictate the course of both domestic and foreign national policy.\n\n\u201cThe best chance we\u2019d have of doing this,\u201d says Greene, \u201cis the first time. After that, there will be more resistance from the other states. So it\u2019s imperative that we take as big of a bite of the apple as possible the first time around, rather than just taking nibbles with individual amendments.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a DVD on my desk titled \u2018Beware of Con Cons\u2019 from the John Birch Society. Traditionally they are with us on constitutional issues. But on this they\u2019re scared for some reason.\u201d -Representative Marc Roberts\n\n\u201cBrian and I are on the same page with this,\u201d Roberts added, who joined the legislature in the same 2013 freshman class as Rep. Greene. \u201cWe\u2019ve only got one shot at this, and if it works it\u2019ll be that much harder to do again. It\u2019s difficult to get nullification through.\u201d\n\nThe idea has received significant opposition from not only the Left, but even conservative organizations which are frequently associated with the \u201cfringe,\u201d such as the John Birch Society (formed in 1958 to counter the civil rights movement, which it called a conspiracy to create a \u201csoviet negro republic\u201d) who say that if the Right can overturn laws and rulings they don\u2019t like, so can the Left.\n\nRepresentative Roberts laughed at the Birch opposition to a Con Con. \u201cI\u2019ve got a DVD on my desk titled \u2018Beware of Con Cons\u2019 from the John Birch Society. Traditionally they are with us on constitutional issues. But on this they\u2019re scared for some reason. It\u2019s kind of like the Disney movie \u2018It\u2019s a Bug\u2019s Life,\u2019 when those little ants realized that there were more of them than the grasshoppers, they were able to run over the grasshoppers. When the John Birchers tell us to just nullify, we\u2019re happy to. But we need something stronger, like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that our friends at the John Birch Society and even our own [conservative] scholars are against us on this.\u201d Kacprowicz added. \u201cThey just don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nUtah Political Capitol reached out to Utah House Majority Whip Greg Hughes (Republican \u2013 Draper) after the call, who told us that the Con Con issue is a divisive one among the GOP nationwide. \u201cPeople are really worried about a Con Con getting out of hand. It\u2019s kind of turning into a circular firing squad among Republicans.\u201d\n\nGreene told the audience of mostly supporters that one of the things he\u2019d like to accomplish with a Con Con is a complete state takeover of all federal lands within Utah, a proposal which was put forward and passed by the legislature a few years ago by Representative Ken Ivory (Republican \u2013 West Jordan), which was also flagged by the legislature\u2019s attorneys as potentially unconstitutional. Currently, Utah is attempting to defend the policy in federal court.\n\nGreene criticized Ivory\u2019s strategy to use the courts to try and gain access to federal lands (which the state of Utah could then sell to private owners, corporations, or oil and gas companies), saying \u201cThe deck is unfortunately stacked against us, because the courts tend to side with the [United States] government. So we\u2019re spending tens of millions of dollars on these cases, where we don\u2019t get anything out of it.\u201d Greene says a Con Con would be the better way to go to force the United States to turn over public lands.\n\n\u201cNullification follows a pre-Fourteenth Amendment view of Constitutional law, before due process and equal protection were extended to cover the behavior of the several states.\u201d -researcher Rachel Tabachnick\n\nKacprowicz also pointed out a recent article by Salon, which quoted researcher Rachel Tabachnick\u2019s piece entitled \u201cNullification, Neo-Confederates, and the Revenge of the Old Right,\u201d which says that \u201cnullification follows a pre-Fourteenth Amendment view of Constitutional law, before due process and equal protection were extended to cover the behavior of the several states.\u201d She also points out that this latest attempt for a Con Con is by far not the first, and that in the past the idea of calling such a convention has been used for causes including overturning federal gun laws that prohibit private citizens from owning tomahawk missiles, to imposing Christianity as an official state religion.\n\nBut none of the opposition from the Left or the more traditional Right seems to be slowing down the two Utah County Republicans. At the end of the call, Kacprowicz offered them both a position on the national steering committee to advance the nullification movement.\n\n\u201cSign me up!\u201d Greene quickly replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d also be very interested, and am happy to be involved,\u201d Roberts added.\n\n\u201c[Senate] President Niederhauser has been going to some of these meetings to help decide what the rules of such a convention would be.\u201d -Speaker Becky Lockhart\n\nSo could a Con Con for nullification and the creation of what would essentially be an all-powerful 4th branch of government really happen? UPC asked outgoing Utah House Speaker Becky Lockhart (Republican \u2013 Provo) what kind of support the idea has among the Republican-dominated Utah legislature. \u201cThe issue of having a convention is getting more and more attention and support,\u201d Lockhart told us. \u201cThere is usually a bill run every five years or so calling for a [Con Con].\u201d She also said it\u2019s not just Utah Republicans who are warming up to the idea, and it\u2019s gaining traction with conservative state legislators around the country.\n\nThe last time a bill calling for a Con Con was proposed in Utah was in 2011 by Representative David Clark (Republican \u2013 Santa Clara), who later resigned mid-term to join Zions Bank as a Senior Vice President. The bill died in the House without receiving a full vote.\n\nBut despite that legislation\u2019s lack of success, some of Utah\u2019s most powerful politicians may still be in favor of the idea. \u201c[Senate] President Niederhauser has been going to some of these meetings,\u201d says Lockhart, \u201cto help decide what the rules of such a convention would be.\u201d\n\nHughes also said he thinks a Con Con would be \u201cappropriate,\u201d but added that it\u2019s not a priority for him. \u201cI just don\u2019t see the point of running forward with this.\u201d\n\nAlthough Lockhart declined to say whether or not she personally supports a Con Con, she did respond to Rep. Greene\u2019s statement that the legislature\u2019s lawsuit to force the U.S. government turn over all federal lands to Utah\u2014a move she is personally in favor of\u2014is a waste of tens of millions of dollars. Lockhart called that \u201cinteresting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb295\"", "article_summary": "According to two sitting Utah legislators, Representatives Brian Greene (Republican \u2013 Pleasant Grove) and Marc Roberts (Republican \u2013 Santaquin), yes.\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraged by the growth in interest in a [constitutional] convention.\nUPC asked outgoing Utah House Speaker Becky Lockhart (Republican \u2013 Provo) what kind of support the idea has among the Republican-dominated Utah legislature.\nThe solution, Greene, Roberts, and Kacprowicz say, is to organize a Con Con where legislators from each state join together to vote to overturn federal laws and rulings.\nI\u2019m here to do whatever I can to move this forward,\u201d said Greene, who began his time in the Utah House of Representatives in January, 2013."}
