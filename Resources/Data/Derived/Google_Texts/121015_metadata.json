It\u2019s pointless. So in an effort to end a debate quickly, I now politely ask individuals to explain how CO2, given how small it is relative to all around it, actually changes the entire system. That usually stops it with most of the crowd. Like many things I see with new age forecasters today, they will jump on one weather factor and not understand its behavior is because of everything around it.\n\nThe second thing I do is put the ball in their court. This requires knowing what went on historically with weather/climate. So I ask what the perfect number is for CO2 in the atmosphere. An example: Dr. Bill McKibben \u2013 one of the people I am frequently amazed with because his comments indicate he either does not know and understand what the weather has done before, or does and refuses to let that get in the way \u2013 runs a group called 350.org. He and his team want CO2 at 350 ppm (parts per million). So let\u2019s just go to 350 ppm and see what it was like.\n\nFirst, here is CO2 on the \u201ccorrect\u201d scale, which is the percentage of the atmosphere. This is not what you commonly see, which is the amount of CO2 in parts per million, where CO2 is grossly over-represented. The scale should be from one to a million, not a tiny fraction of a million.\n\nNow, by using the very tiny increment they do, and by not informing you that if you actually used the scale from one to a million, this would hardly show up, they\u2019re guilty of creative distortion of reality. After all, aren\u2019t we measuring this against the entire atmosphere? Just think how absurd it would be if we measured against the *entire system: ocean plus atmosphere. The oceans play a huge role in the climate. It\u2019s the reason for Dr. William Gray\u2019s spot on assessment of this whole charade.\n\nAnyway, on the graph below, the numbers on the left are in part per million. We are near 400 ppm now, and the last time it was near 350 ppm was back around 1988.\n\nHere are just a few samples of the weather that year.\n\nSummer:\n\nAverage since then:\n\nThat was the summer all the hysteria began on the upcoming climate disaster. But what about precipitation?\n\nSince then:\n\nWhat about hurricanes? What did the ACE Index look like? Gee, about the same as now.\n\nIn fact after the peak when the Pacific and Atlantic were warm in tandem, it looks like this recent downturn is lower than the late \u201880s. This may be because whenever there is a \u201cclimatic shift\u201d (in the late 1970s the shift was to warming because the PDO turned warm; it\u2019s now opposite), the atmosphere needs to adjust so that the processes which leads to above normal activity can readjust.\n\nWhat about ice caps? Look at the Arctic when the Atlantic was in its cold mode. 1988 had much higher anomalies than now.\n\nBut the Southern Hemisphere ice anomaly is much higher than it was then! In fact, it\u2019s trying for a record!\n\n1988 was as low against the averages in the Southern Hemisphere (more so, it dropped to -1.5) than it is now in the Northern Hemisphere, and the forecast continues to call for Arctic sea ice extent to rise above average against the late summer minimum. This would be the first time this has happened since the Atlantic went into its warm mode.\n\nGlobally we\u2019re well above average. Are we not supposed to consider the whole globe on this crucial matter? It was the ice caps \u2013 plural \u2013 that were supposed to melt. Could it be like almost everything in nature \u2013 a cyclical back and forth swing?\n\nSo far, the Arctic \u201cwarm season\u201d has been colder than 1988 (last year was the coldest ever recorded).\n\nHere it was in 1988:\n\nThe fact is, most of the \u201cglobal\u201d warming has occurred in the Arctic during the winter seasons, where temps 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal are frigid anyway. Given the amount of water vapor in such low temperatures \u2013 water vapor being the number 1 greenhouse gas (100x CO2) \u2013 it\u2019s a stretch to think this is affecting the entire global climate against anything that can be measured against normal stochastic and cyclical events.\n\nNow you may say, \u201cYou are cherry picking.\u201d I can cherry pick any time and find it worse. The fact I can instantly bring up any time where weather has been more extreme says that in the past, the weather has been more extreme! We can go on forever, believe me. Here\u2019s is another sample: How is it most of the states\u2019 high temperatures and the greatest decade for low temperatures were in the 1930s, when CO2 was under 300 ppm?\n\nWe are not even close now. Anyone ever consider this? We have added considerably more weather stations, yet the state records set during a time with less stations than now have not been exceeded. And even though it was hotter in summer, it was colder extreme wise in winter.\n\nHere\u2019s a fact: CO2, like anything, has some effect on the weather and climate, probably relative to its relationship with water vapor, which is most likely influenced by the greatest store of heat (energy) to the system (and its also the greatest store of CO2) \u2013 the oceans. But can you measure it against the natural cyclical reactions driven by much greater forces and even stochastic events? Can you assign a value when every single point brought up by the AGW side can be easily countered by anyone who knows and understands what has happened in weather and climate in the past? How do you know? And given what is facing us today, is CO2\u2019s value to the climate effectively rounded so close to zero that the whole issue is a red herring?\n\nLook at this. The title says it all.\n\nThe answer is, you can\u2019t.\n\nFinally, from IPCC reviewer Dr. Vincent Gray:\n\nFaith in things unseen defines something that is preached in religion. But with all the counter evidence here, it seems like this worship of CO2 as the climate control knob is more religion than science. I don\u2019t force my religion on another man; why is it these folks seem to be pushing theirs on us? And like so many other religions that believe they must convert all men to their belief, this too is a recipe for widespread misery and as in most cases, disaster.\n\nSo just what is the perfect level of CO2, and who among men thinks they are fit to decide that, given the overwhelming evidence that nature is in control?\n\nJoe Bastardi is chief forecaster at WeatherBELL Analytics, a meteorological consulting firm.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Patriot Post\n\n[Originally published at The Patriot Post]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/06/just-what-is-the-perfect-level-of-co2/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/plant.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Just What Is the Perfect Level of CO2?"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b66\"", "article_summary": "This is not what you commonly see, which is the amount of CO2 in parts per million, where CO2 is grossly over-represented.\nSo just what is the perfect level of CO2, and who among men thinks they are fit to decide that, given the overwhelming evidence that nature is in control?\nSo I ask what the perfect number is for CO2 in the atmosphere.\nSo in an effort to end a debate quickly, I now politely ask individuals to explain how CO2, given how small it is relative to all around it, actually changes the entire system.\nHe and his team want CO2 at 350 ppm (parts per million)."}
