About 40 percent disapproved.\n\nToday, those numbers are almost precisely reversed, a fact that Democrats were made keenly aware of in the fall campaign and in the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cThe public\u2019s confidence is gone, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be coming back,\u201d says Ross Douthat at The New York Times.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nMr. Douthat offers not a unified theory but four \u201cpartial\u201d ones: Republican intransigence, an incomplete economic recovery from the Great Recession, Obamacare and foreign policy crises.\n\nIndeed, partial theories are popular among observers, and many land on similar issues. In an account of Obama\u2019s second term, Juliet Eilperin and David Nakamura, writing at The Washington Post, detail what amounts to a war of attrition between the White House and Congress, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress on legislation of any kind.\n\nWhat all the parties had to show for it, after multiple failures on policy and a government shutdown, was nothing but disapproval, The Post reporters write: \u201cThe president\u2019s approval ratings took a nose dive, and Congress\u2019s were even worse.\u201d\n\nFor Andrew Sullivan at The Dish, \u201ca fanatically obstructionist and increasingly extreme GOP\u201d wanted to undermine the president with a strategy \u201chatched privately before Obama even took office.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey judged early on that the real promise of Obama \u2014 his ambition to transcend the old politics in favor of pragmatic reform \u2014 could be killed if they simply refused to play along,\u201d Mr. Sullivan writes.\n\nOn the economy, Peter Foster at The Telegraph says: \u201cSince Mr. Obama took office facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 6 percent and American businesses have created 10 million new jobs \u2014 that\u2019s more than Japan, Europe and every other advanced economy combined.\u201d\n\nProblem is, he adds, many of those \u201cjobs are \u2018McJobs\u2019 \u2014 that is, low-paid and part-time work that don\u2019t leave people feeling better off.\u201d On top of that, \u201cin numerical terms, G.D.P. has risen by 8 percent since Mr. Obama took office, but median household incomes are down.\u201d\n\nMr. Douthat agrees: \u201cEven with the improving employment picture this recovery is still basically a disappointment, especially for the middle class,\u201d and adds that it \u201cisn\u2019t necessarily a case study in the economy not mattering. It\u2019s an example of voter patience persisting for a while, and finally running out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most persuasive answer to the question\u201d \u2014 where did Obama go wrong? \u2014 \u201cwas the botched roll-out of healthcare.gov,\u201d Mr. Sullivan says. \u201cNo one else can be blamed for this, and it hit the president\u2019s ratings like a ten-ton truck.\u201d\n\nMr. Douthat points to competence as a general concern for the public with this administration and identifies the roll-out as a key moment: \u201cThe health care law is Obama\u2019s signature issue, it remains largely unpopular (even if support for full repeal is weak), and its initial stumbling coincided with the sharpest second-term drop in the president\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\nYet for Mr. Sullivan, this is only the start of the narrative: \u201cWhat this superficial version of events misses is what happened next. The truth is: the Obama team subsequently achieved a near-miraculous rescue of Obamacare, achieved real success in enrollment, and have seen core healthcare costs slow down in such a way that could yet shift our long-term fiscal liabilities for the better.\u201d\n\nStill, as Mr. Foster points out, \u201cLike George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Obama\u2019s approval numbers never recovered from the sight of his flagship piece of legislation capsizing so ignominiously before it had even left the harbour.\u201d\n\nMr. Douthat suggests that the president \u201chad an edge that Democratic politicians often lack: The public trusted him on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nBut, he writes, one crisis after another \u2014 Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Ebola \u2014 eroded that trust and \u201cmade Obama\u2019s position irrecoverable.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that Mr. Obama\u2019s refusal \u201cto engage in the theatrical parts of the presidency looks terrible during crises,\u201d Danny Vinik at The New Republic, like Mr. Sullivan, defends the president on issues like ISIS, at least on substantive grounds: \u201cIt\u2019s more important that the president craft effective policy responses to crises. Obama has done that \u2014 and the media coverage has missed it completely, focusing instead on Obama\u2019s rhetorical shortcomings and downplaying his policy successes.\u201d\n\nConor Friedersdorf at The Atlantic has an entirely different log of reasons to disapprove of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance. His list includes warrantless wiretapping, a failure to punish illegal torture, a costly and ruinous war on drugs, the unacknowledged moral costs of drone strikes, the president\u2019s \u201csecret kill list,\u201d an out-of-control national-security state and the president\u2019s persecution of whistle-blowers and journalists who\u2019ve worked with them.\n\n\u201cConfronted with all of those transgressions, more than four in 10 Americans still approve of the job Obama is doing,\u201d Mr. Friedersdorf writes. \u201cAnd most of them are loyal Democrats. Partisanship and tribalism are overriding the moral compass of too many liberals.\u201d\n\nFor Elias Isquith at Salon, the root of the president\u2019s problems is not to be found in specific events or issues but in his temperament. Many moderates see \u201cObama\u2019s penchant for working from within the system rather than trying to disrupt it\u201d as a real plus.\n\nBut, he asks, was this temperamental conservatism \u201cthe wrong fit for the current era, when major reforms are so desperately needed\u201d?\n\nMr. Isquith turns back to a 2009 Harper\u2019s article by Kevin Baker, predicting that Mr. Obama would fail, because he would be unable \u201cto seize the radical moment at hand.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Isquith, \u201cRather than recognize how ideological and partisan realignment and polarization had effectively changed the rules of the Senate,\u201d the president went looking for consensus where none existed.\n\n\u201cAt this point, there is no question that President Obama will fall short of initial expectations,\u201d Mr. Isquith says. \u201cBut more than the failure to pass any one particular bill, the disappointment stems from the president\u2019s dogged insistence on being a reformer during a radical era.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps our focus on the presidency is itself skewed. The presidency is the central element in our political system, but as Aaron David Miller writes, maybe the problem is our expectation of the presidency itself.\n\nHe argues at Foreign Policy (and in his book \u201cThe End of Greatness: Why America Can\u2019t Have (and Doesn\u2019t Want) Another Great President\u201d): \u201cThe centrality of the presidency must be reconciled with the limitations of the office and the constraints that bind it. The presidency has always been an implausible, some might even say an impossible, job. But the following mix of challenges and constraints \u2014 some old, some new \u2014 has made the post-World War II presidency harder still: constitutional and practical constraints on the office itself; the president\u2019s expanding reach and responsibilities; the expanding role of a government we trust less, even when we demand more from it; America\u2019s global role; and an intrusive, omnipresent, and nonstop media.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreatness in the presidency is too rare to be relevant in our modern times and \u2014 driven as it is in our political system by big crisis \u2014 too risky and dangerous to be desirable. Our continued search for idealized presidents raises our expectations and theirs, skews presidential performance, and leads to an impossible standard that can only frustrate and disappoint. To sum up: We can no longer have a truly great president, we seldom need one, and, as irrational as it sounds, we may not want one, either.\u201d\n\nHe concludes: \u201cHistoric greatness in the presidency has gone the way of the dodo. And it is unlikely to return any time soon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141114081037, "BN": "op-talk", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/optalk", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/op-talk/post", "per": "Bush, George W;Obama, Barack", "org": "Democratic Party (Japan);Foreign Policy (Magazine);HealthCare.gov;Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS);Senate", "keywords": "Bush George W,Obama Barack,Law and Legislation,Midterm Elections (2014),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Targeted Killings,United States Economy,United States Politics and Government,Democratic Party (Japan),Foreign Policy (Magazine),HealthCare.gov,Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS),Senate,United States,Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/How Did Obama Lose American Voters?
