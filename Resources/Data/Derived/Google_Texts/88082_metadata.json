Gun safety reform groups like the Brady Campaign and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America shared it on their respective Facebook pages, but so did the gun rights group Open Carry Texas, which called it \u201ca fairly balanced article.\u201d\n\nI also received feedback from people who were angry about the article, even though they had no idea what was in it. They\u2019d only seen the responses to my story that popped up in conservative media outlets and online forums, where my original message was deliberately distorted. But that\u2019s to be expected \u2014 lately, any story that voices cautious or moderate attitudes about guns (let alone actual policy changes) is quickly reappropriated. The formula is consistent: shoot the messenger, then rewrite the message.\n\nSurely part of the reason my story attracted so much attention was its provocative headline, which I actually didn\u2019t write. (Contributors often don\u2019t write their own headlines.) Conservative pundit Charles Cooke spends the first two paragraphs of his response in the National Review critiquing the headline. He then accuses me of making several improbable \u201cpredictions\u201d about what will happen in Texas if the state legislature removes current restrictions on open carry. Actually I made no predictions whatsoever. I described some real-life incidents involving open carry, and discussed the way people generally behave when they see or hold a weapon (These aren\u2019t predictions, but rather observations documented through 40 years of empirical research, conducted by social scientists at major universities and published in peer-reviewed journals).\n\nCooke waves all that science away, dismissing it as \u201cscience\u201d in incredulous quotation marks. He doesn\u2019t bother to articulate any specific flaws with the methodology of these studies. Instead, Cooke tries to impugn the source \u2014 he calls me a \u201cguru\u201d (do I need new business cards?) and implies that, because Salon is such a liberal, aloof publication, any analysis published here regarding Texas politics is inherently shady. (Never mind that I have lived in Texas for 18 years.)\n\nCooke uses my name fifteen times in his article, shifting the focus away from the content of the story and onto the author, as if I had dreamt up every detail from my own imagination. National Review readers left hundreds of comments, but most were only tangentially related to the issues in the original Salon story.\n\nTreading on the rattlesnake\n\nCommentators like Charles Cooke and Alex Jones want their audiences to think that journalists are waging a deliberate culture war, inciting panic and antagonizing gun owners who just want to be left alone. And to be fair, some journalists seem to be doing exactly that \u2014 often at their own peril.\n\nWhen the Sandusky Register, a small Ohio newspaper, published the names of 2,500 local concealed carry permit holders, gun rights organizations retaliated by publishing personal information about editor Matt Westerhold. According to Mother Jones, Buckeye Firearms released details of Westerhold\u2019s divorce and tips about how people could stalk his 12-year-old daughter. A similar scenario played out last year in New York state, when The Times Journal mapped the locations of concealed handgun permit holders throughout two suburban counties. Staffers received death threats and packages containing white powder. After blogger Bob Cox published the home addresses of many employees of the newspaper, the threats became more specific \u2014 credible enough that the publisher hired armed guards and encouraged some staff to change their phone numbers and sleep in hotels.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Robert Bateman seemed almost to invite the vitriol of Second Amendment activists when he wrote an essay for Esquire proposing sweeping gun reform, reappropriating Charlton Heston\u2019s rhetoric about prying guns \u201cfrom your cold dead fingers.\u201d Bateman later described the thousands of threatening e-mails he received, and quipped about the bad grammar of his would-be assassins (i.e., \u201cYou\u2019re days are numbered\u201d).", "article_metadata": {"description": "I learned first-hand that voicing cautious attitudes about guns will elicit quite a response from the right", "author": "Matt Valentine", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I learned first-hand that voicing cautious attitudes about guns will elicit quite a response from the right", "title": "Shooting the messenger: The time I dared to critique gun activists\u2019 agenda", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/18/shooting_the_messenger_the_time_i_dared_to_critique_gun_activists_agenda/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/jones_lapierre.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I learned first-hand that voicing cautious attitudes about guns will elicit quite a response from the right", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/jones_lapierre.jpg", "title": "Shooting the messenger: The time I dared to critique gun activists\u2019 agenda", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Shooting the messenger: The time I dared to critique gun activists\u2019 agenda", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alex Jones, Editor's Picks, Gun Control, gun rights, Media Criticism, NRA, open carry, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05c8\"", "article_summary": "He then accuses me of making several improbable \u201cpredictions\u201d about what will happen in Texas if the state legislature removes current restrictions on open carry.\nWhen the Sandusky Register, a small Ohio newspaper, published the names of 2,500 local concealed carry permit holders, gun rights organizations retaliated by publishing personal information about editor Matt Westerhold.\nand implies that, because Salon is such a liberal, aloof publication, any analysis published here regarding Texas politics is inherently shady.\nSurely part of the reason my story attracted so much attention was its provocative headline, which I actually didn\u2019t write.\nNational Review readers left hundreds of comments, but most were only tangentially related to the issues in the original Salon story."}
