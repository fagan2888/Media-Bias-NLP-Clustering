The Avalanche game story from Tuesday’s 5-2 loss to the Los Angeles Kings is here.

The Avs on Wednesday practiced like it was their last. Very spirited, intense practice. But no Semyon Varlamov, who was scratched Tuesday with another (or the same) groin injury. In his post-practice presser, coach Patrick Roy said he expects Varlamov to participate in Thursday’s morning skate and he might start against the New Jersey Devils. Roy also said the groin injury is not as serious as the one that forced him to miss 15 games over three stretches earlier in the season, or even to the same muscle. But he declined to get into it further.

As for speculation, there’s obviously a chance Varlamov’s groin might require long-term rest, and if the Avs don’t win their next three games it seems like a good opportunity to see what Calvin Pickard and Reto Berra can do the rest of the way, a nice challenge for both. But Roy said that’s not the case right now and it’s a playoff-push mindset all the way.
