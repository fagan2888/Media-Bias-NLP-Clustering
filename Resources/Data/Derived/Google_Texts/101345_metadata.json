But in some circumstances where a sub is needed for an in-between amount of time, it might not be worth the cost of the insurance.\n\n\"The thinking was let's work with the principals to come up with some sort of schedule that would limit, yes limit, the number of persons that would qualify and would require us to offer the insurance, which means some people are going to be told you're at your limit, you can't come back,\" said district General Counsel Domoine Rutledge.\n\nSuperintendent Bernard Taylor said the substitute issue is a small part of a much larger problem, as the district struggles to find teachers to fill slots in the lowest-performing schools. For example, Merrydale Elementary, which dropped to an F rating in the latest rankings, had eight substitutes for all of last school year because teachers couldn't be found.\n\n\"Our issue is not substitutes,\" Taylor said. \"Our issue is getting quality instruction to the kids who need it the most.\"\n\nThe district needs to look for creative ways it can help get the best instruction to kids, Taylor added, alluding to the possibility of using technology to have effective teachers teach multiple classes of students at once. Last year he offered bonuses to teachers willing to transfer to lower-performing schools, but that apparently wasn't enough to fill all the slots.\n\n\"How do we mitigate that, because we are reluctant to assign teachers if they don't want to go there (to the lower-performing schools),\" Taylor said. \"At what point do we say 'We need the best 5th grade math teacher in the district working with those children.'\"", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Diana Samuels, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "baton rouge schools, br-homepage, br-news, news", "title": "Baton Rouge schools have a harder time filling substitute slots due to Obamacare, board members say", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "Superintendent Bernard Taylor said the substitute issue is a small part of a much larger problem", "title": "Baton Rouge schools have a harder time filling substitute slots due to Obamacare, board members say", "url": "http://www.nola.com/education/baton-rouge/index.ssf/2014/11/baton_rouge_schools_have_a_har.html", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/education_baton_rouge/photo/13733210-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Superintendent Bernard Taylor said the substitute issue is a small part of a much larger problem", "title": "Baton Rouge schools have a harder time filling substitute slots due to Obamacare, board members say", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/education_baton_rouge/photo/13733210-standard.jpg", "creator": "@dzsamuels", "site": "@nolanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, November 07, 2014,  3:13 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, November 06, 2014,  8:28 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Superintendent Bernard Taylor said the substitute issue is a small part of a much larger problem"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02bf\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act is causing headaches for East Baton Rouge Parish schools as they try to find substitute teachers, school board members said Thursday.\n\"How do we mitigate that, because we are reluctant to assign teachers if they don't want to go there (to the lower-performing schools),\" Taylor said.\nSuperintendent Bernard Taylor said the substitute issue is a small part of a much larger problem, as the district struggles to find teachers to fill slots in the lowest-performing schools.\n\"At what point do we say 'We need the best 5th grade math teacher in the district working with those children.'\"\nLast year he offered bonuses to teachers willing to transfer to lower-performing schools, but that apparently wasn't enough to fill all the slots."}
