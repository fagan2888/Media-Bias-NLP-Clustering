He faced up to 10 years in prison. Instead, he was sentenced by Chief U.S. District Court Judge Sharion Aycock to six months in prison, two years probation and fines and restitution of more than $10,000.\n\nBain entered the federal correctional institution in Forrest City, Arkansas, in June 2014. The Federal Bureau of Prisons says he was released on Dec. 19, 2014.\n\nAfter serving about 54 weeks of two years supervised release, Bain filed a motion in federal court in Aberdeen on Jan. 4 asking that his probation end early. Two days later, the case was shifted from Aycock\u2019s court to U.S. District Court Judge Glen Davidson.\n\nThere is no time frame for the court to take action on the motion.\n\nBain owned an independent pharmacy on North Gloster across from Milam school. He sold the pharmacy in 2011, but continued to work for the new owners. Bain was elected to the Lee County School Board in November 2010. He resigned from the school board abruptly and without explanation in March 2012.\n\nIt was later learned that Bain was recorded on video in January 2012 selling hydrocodone to undercover federal agents on the pharmacy premises after hours. He surrendered his pharmacist\u2019s license the following month.\n\nwilliam.moore@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By William Moore Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Former pharmacist and ex-Lee County school board member Jim Bain has petitioned a federal court to end his probation almost a year early.
