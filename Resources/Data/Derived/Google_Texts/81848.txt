The real news sometimes passes us by, as we eke out our survival and freak out at the state of our lives.

I am grateful, therefore, to have been sent this snippet that might just change the way you think and live.

For here, at a White House press conference earlier this week, is President Obama revealing a "secret project we've been working on for some time."

What could this project be? A crowdsourced surveillance program? A health insurance Web site that works?

No, America is building Iron Man.

You don't have to take my word for it.

For here the president began by saying that he would be joined by America's finest researchers, digital cloud designers, and important people from the Pentagon.

He then uttered these words: "Basically, I'm here to announce that we're building Iron Man."

The journalists in the room erupted with laughter. In an attempt to quiet them, perhaps, the president then explained: "I'm going to blast off in a second."

That didn't work. So he had to add that this wasn't really a secret project America's been working on for some time. Or maybe it was.

"It's classified," he concluded.

This may well be, but in a world in which what is classified emerges through the recalcitrance of a 29-year-old with an old USB stick, there might be some truth in this joviality.

We really need to do something positive with our billionaire techies, whose priorities seem more skewed than a rapper's hat.

We really ought to co-opt them into saving our culture, rather than let it disappear into the sinkhole of flappy birds and snoopy glasses.

Please imagine Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg, with iron suits and will, soaring in to save us from our enemies and our own worst excesses.

We haven't seen all that much of these young men lately. Might they already be in training?
