At Miriam's Kitchen, in the basement of a Presbyterian Church, both military veterans and active duty service members took a special breakfast shift to help serve D.C.'s chronically homeless.

"The volunteerism brought me here today. On Veterans Day, we have to give back to the community," says Clint Trocchio, himself a veteran of the Coast Guard.

Veterans are disproportionately represented in the homeless community, living with greater likelihood of disability and for longer durations than the rest of the homeless community.

Trocchio says that is part of what motivated him to participate this Veterans Day.

"We're here to put a stop to that. It's not an unsolvable challenge," Trocchio says. "Giving back even fractionally so here in the kitchen this morning, taking part in the community, helps those folks that, like me, wear the uniform and served their country."
