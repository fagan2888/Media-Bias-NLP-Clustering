Frank Dechant was serving in an Army infantry unit when he was captured by Nazi forces during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nDechant\u2019s son, Dave, said his father was \u201cgreatly humbled\u201d by the award.\n\n\u201cHe is a man who never sought the spotlight, so it was great for the family to see him recognized in this way,\u201d Dave Dechant said.\n\nDechant, like many who have experienced the horrors of war, kept his tales to himself, his son said. The family always knew he was a hero, and they were proud to see him honored, he said.\n\nDechant, now 91, was held in Stalag VIII-A, in what is now Poland, and was forced to march to an unknown location in Germany.\n\nHe was liberated in April 1945, weighing less than 100 pounds. He served in the Army until February 1946.\n\nDechant has received numerous medals and commendations, including the Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three bronze service stars, the World War II Victory Medal and the Combat Infantryman Badge.\n\nThe ceremony, before family and friends, was held at the office of U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter. Perlmutter\u2019s office was contacted by Dechant\u2019s nephew for assistance in obtaining the POW medal.\n\nPerlmutter and retired Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Stecklein \u2014 Dechant\u2019s nephew \u2014 presented the POW medal to the technical sergeant.\n\n\u201cSgt. Dechant is a hero who courageously served our nation,\u201d Perlmutter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a special privilege to be with his family today to honor him and present him with this medal to recognize his sacrifice and service in defense of our freedom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Arvada man, a World War II vet, gets overdue POW medal", "title": "Arvada man, a World War II vet, gets overdue POW medal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/14/arvada-man-a-world-war-ii-vet-gets-overdue-pow-medal/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140414__Arvada_medalp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140414__Arvada_medalp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-14T15:39:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:11:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19d1\"", "article_summary": "A World War II veteran and Arvada resident was presented Monday with a medal commemorating his time as a prisoner of war.\nDechant has received numerous medals and commendations, including the Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three bronze service stars, the World War II Victory Medal and the Combat Infantryman Badge.\nPerlmutter and retired Air Force Lt.
