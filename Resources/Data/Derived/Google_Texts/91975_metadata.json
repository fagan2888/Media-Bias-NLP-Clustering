Andrew Cuomo to raise the minimum wage of tipped workers, mainly dining industry servers who earn a $5 minimum wage in New York.\n\nProtestors gathered outside an uptown Manhattan Domino\u2019s Pizza chain store Thursday to rally support for a $9 minimum wage.\n\nAutumn Austin, a bartender and server, says that she\u2019s only paid $5 an hour and that tips often fall short of allowing her to make even the regular minimum wage of $8 per hour.\n\n\u201cThey pay you the $5 an hour,\u201d she said of her employer. \u201cThey\u2019re not gonna reimburse you for the tips you missed on the table.\u201d\n\nNew York state law requires employers to make up the difference if tips fall short from the state-mandated minimum wage. But workers say this is rarely enforced.\n\n\u201cEveryone acknowledges that they don\u2019t consistently do that,\u201d said Paul Sonn of the National Employment Law Project. \u201cThere\u2019s no economic rationale for this system.\u201d\n\nSonn said that the average tipped worker makes more than the minimum wage, but the uneven distribution means that many routinely make below that.\n\nCuomo signed legislation last year that raised the minimum wage to $9 an hour by 2015, but a clause exempted food service workers.\n\nPolitical gridlock in the state senate deferred the decision to raise the tipped worker minimum wage to a Department of Labor wage board.\n\nSonn said that the wage board has the authority to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers to however high it chooses.\n\nJose Sanchez, a delivery worker who wore a Domino\u2019s Pizza cap at the protest, said that he often makes below the $8 minimum wage after tips, as do many of his co-workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our problem, not theirs, they\u2019re not worrying about that,\u201d he said.\n\nTwenty-three Domino\u2019s Pizza chains reached a $448,000 settlement with the state of New York in March to reimburse workers who were underpaid.\n\nBusiness associations oppose a wage increase, arguing that it would hurt restaurants.\n\n\u201cMost restaurants have raised prices many times over the years\u2014to cover increased rents, skyrocketing food costs, out of control fines levied by government, the Affordable Care Act, paid sick leave, and may other regulatory, operational, and labor expenses,\u201d said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance.\n\n\u201cThere are limits of how much restaurants can raise prices,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor activists are calling for Gov.
