Ward didn\u2019t hesitate when asked last week which member of the Broncos\u2019 defense would come up with the big play Sunday at Cleveland.\n\n\u201cPut the names in the hat,\u201d the Broncos safety said. \u201cWho knows? Somebody is going to make a play, though. I can guarantee that.\u201d\n\nShaquil Barrett\u2019s name was called \u2014 a few times and in a few ways, courtesy of his teammates who chanted \u201cShaq Diesel!\u201d and \u201cSack for a Shaq! Sack for a Shaq!\u201d afterward.\n\nThe former practice squad player who started in place of injured DeMarcus Ware (back) in the Broncos\u2019 26-23 overtime victory over the Browns recorded his third, but perhaps most impressive sack on a second-and-8 in the third quarter. Barrett plowed through the middle of the Browns\u2019 offensive line before spotting quarterback Josh McCown, swiping at the ball and tackling McCowen.\n\nThe ball, knocked loose, lay on the ground a few feet from Barrett, who stood and searched for his prize.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know where it was at,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt like it was 30 seconds before I realized where the football was, so I just hurried up and dove on it.\u201d\n\nThe game-changing strip-sack and fumble recovery, which led to a 25-yard field goal by Brandon McManus on the Broncos\u2019 ensuing offensive drive, is evocative of Von Miller, the fifth-year veteran who helped Barrett expand his repertoire of moves in the offseason and has been one of Barrett\u2019s ardent supporters.\n\nThis was no Miller-taught move.\n\nBut it was one the Broncos\u2019 continually stress in practices. In defensive coordinator Wade Phillips\u2019 3-4, the focus is and always will be to get the ball.\n\n\u201cThat strip-sack, we work on that week in and week out in,\u201d Ware said. \u201cInstead of just going for the sack, we try to always go for the ball, and it worked. It was a big play for us.\u201d\n\nBarrett split another sack with defensive end Malik Jackson in overtime to extend his total to 3.5 this season and made nine tackles, the second-most on the team behind Danny Trevathan\u2019s 10.\n\nHe confirmed his place on a defense that has made 26 sacks and has carried the team to a 6-0 record before the bye week.\n\nAnd he reaffirmed a depth that never was questioned, but certainly tested Sunday, when Shane Ray went down with an injury in the second quarter.\n\nRay, Denver\u2019s first-round draft pick this year, was helped off the field after getting caught in the fray on a tackle in the second quarter. Visibly upset, with a towel over his head, Ray was carted back to the locker room and did not return.\n\nHe sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee and could miss a few weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being optimistic,\u201d he said after the game. He was wearing a brace on the knee and walking with the help of crutches. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\nIt could have been worse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always concerned when we lose a guy,\u201d Ware said. \u201cBut this is a testament to how our guys are prepared. I went down, Shaq comes in and plays well. Shane goes down, Lerentee (McCray) is still in the game. With me coming back soon, we\u2019re not really worried about the depth.\u201d\n\nThat depth was on display in the second half against Oakland and again Sunday at Cleveland, when the tough blow of losing Ware was softened by the play of Barrett.\n\nOn Sunday, his name was called again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been that way all year,\u201d Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what his name is or where he\u2019s from, but I know that when it\u2019s down to a play, he makes plays. All I know is every time I looked up, he was making plays. What an opportunity he\u2019s gotten, and what a good job he\u2019s done taking advantage of it.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shaquil Barrett delivers big when name called by Broncos", "title": "Shaquil Barrett delivers big when name called by Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/18/shaquil-barrett-delivers-big-when-name-called-by-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151018_060517_shaquil-barrett-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151018_060517_shaquil-barrett-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-18T18:02:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T10:22:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b5f\"", "article_summary": "CLEVELAND \u2014 T.J.
