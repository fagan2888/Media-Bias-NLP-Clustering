She did that tonight.\n\nSchimmel who secured the win for the Cardinals (12-1) in the close game. Neither team led by more than six until Louisville broke it open with a 7-0 run to go up 53-46 with 6:42 left.\n\nColorado (9-1) chipped away at the lead. Brittany Wilson\u2019s layup with 24 seconds left cut the gap to 65-62.\n\nSchimmel sank two free throws to go up 67-62. The Buffaloes couldn\u2019t convert on the next possession and Schimmel\u2019s layup sealed the victory.\n\nIn last year\u2019s 70-66 win over Louisville, Colorado held Schimmel to four points.\n\n\u201cI watched the game clip and I worked on things that would help me for today\u2019s game,\u201d Schimmel said.\n\nWhen Louisville\u2019s outside shots weren\u2019t falling \u2013 the Cardinals were 1 of 10 from 3-point range \u2013 it went inside, scoring 30 points in the paint.\n\n\u201cWhat really hurt is today was dribble penetration,\u201d Colorado coach Linda Lappe said. \u201cIt was tough for us to guard (Schimmel) at times.\u201d\n\nLexy Kresl led Colorado with 17 points.\n\nJen Reese, wearing a protective mask for a broken nose she got in practice earlier this month, added 14 points and 14 rebounds for Colorado.\n\nKresl had nine of the Buffaloes\u2019 first 12 points and the junior\u2019s 3-pointer gave Colorado its first lead, 8-5. Louisville battled back and went ahead 16-12 on a three-pointer by Shoni Schimmel.\n\nOn two straight possessions, Asia Taylor twice completed a three-point play after being fouled while making a layup, bolstering Louisville\u2019s advantage to 22-16 midway through the first half.\n\nJude Schimmel\u2019s two straight layups closed out the first half to give Louisville a 33-29 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot more half-court now, and they don\u2019t expect us to do that, and when they don\u2019t expect it, we will run our regular press,\u201d Shoni Schimmel said. \u201cWe just like to mix things up and keep them on their toes.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals had 52 total rebounds, compared to 47 for Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been begging our players to do a better job on defensive rebounding the whole season,\u201d Lappe said. \u201cAbout five games ago I said it was going to hurt us at some point. When you\u2019re outrebounding teams by 12 or 15, they don\u2019t really understand what they\u2019re going to see when you face a team like Louisville, who crashes hard and gets in there and puts pressure on you.\u201d\n\nThe teams combined for 70 free throw attempts.\n\n\u201cMissing the free throw rebounds and not boxing out\u201d were miscues, said Kresl. \u201cThey got a few too many opportunities on the offensive boards.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No. 7 Louisville women edge No. 11 Colorado 69-62", "title": "No. 7 Louisville women edge No. 11 Colorado 69-62", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/21/no-7-louisville-women-edge-no-11-colorado-69-62/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131221_023128_colorado-louisville.jpg", "height": 844}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131221_023128_colorado-louisville.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-21T13:46:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:29:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1415\"", "article_summary": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Louisville coach Jeff Walz asked Shoni Schimmel, a prolific long-range shooter, to become more aggressive and drive the ball inside.\n11 Colorado on Saturday and wound up with a season-high 30 points, including 13 on 16 free throws, in No.\n\u201cShe shot more free throws today than she has all season,\u201d Walz said.\nIn last year\u2019s 70-66 win over Louisville, Colorado held Schimmel to four points.\nLouisville battled back and went ahead 16-12 on a three-pointer by Shoni Schimmel."}
