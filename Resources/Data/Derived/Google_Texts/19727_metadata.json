You had better be able to pass block.\n\n\u201cCoach E (Eric Studesville) makes it clear our job is to keep them off Peyton,\u201d Montee Ball said.\n\nManning threw the ball 659 times last season. The Broncos\u2019 aerial gumbo of audibles and short routes assaults the senses. It also humbles even the best athletes. Ball\u2019s breakthrough last summer ended abruptly. He landed on the bench when he couldn\u2019t keep Manning upright.\n\nThe Broncos believe in Ball, inserting him as the starter after Knowshon Moreno\u2019s defection to the Dolphins. Ball possesses NFL-workhorse qualities, including a sturdy frame and a college r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that included 924 carries and 77 rushing TDs at Wisconsin.\n\nHe can run, but can he hold his own in the octagon behind the line of scrimmage? Perhaps nothing is more important over the next six weeks than his ability to take on a fire-breathing blitzer.\n\nThat point was driven home Saturday. As part of the Broncos\u2019 first padded practice, the team held one-on-one drills. A daunting exercise involved running backs squaring off against safeties and linebackers, who were permitted a 4-yard running start. No chipping blocker, no tackle to change their paths. Full throttle into the running back. C.J. Anderson stood up T.J. Ward, drawing praise. Kapri Bibbs won against David Bruton.\n\nBall chose his opponents: Danny Trevathan and Nate Irving. It didn\u2019t insulate him from failure. By design.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make it is tough as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nTrevathan worked him over. Irving overpowered him. The drill tilted toward defenders, but was a reminder of the reps needed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was good. I didn\u2019t do well today, but I am challenging myself,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make me better. After practice, I am going to watch the film to see what I need to do to improve.\u201d\n\nBall weighs 215 pounds, and he added bulk in his upper body since last season. The weight won\u2019t hurt if he becomes a 241-carry back, like Moreno last season, and should will help him as a layer of Manning\u2019s security team.\n\n\u201cYou have to get your hands into them and have good balance,\u201d Ball said. \u201cWe all know how important it is. If you don\u2019t do it right, Peyton will let you hear it. That\u2019s what we expect.\u201d\n\nBall takes nothing for granted, regardless of the depth chart. He carried off his equipment Saturday, no rookies around as caddies. He had film to watch. And lessons to learn.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to the next time we do it,\u201d Ball said. \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about practice.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
