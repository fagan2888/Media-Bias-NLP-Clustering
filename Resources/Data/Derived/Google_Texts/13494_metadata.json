About 40 volunteers drive nearly 10 patients at any given time in Polk County. Some patients have daily treatments and no other form of transportation.\n\nVolunteer Coordinator Barb Sharp says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got four patients right now that have daily radiation treatments, so that\u2019s about 20 rides a week, so I do drive some of those myself just because we have such a need right now.\u201d\n\nPeggy Huppert with the American Cancer Society says, \u201cOur challenge is it\u2019s a 9 to 5 Monday through Friday, so people who have a regular job or work those hours, it\u2019s tough for them to help.\u201d\n\nSummer also presents problems as people go on vacation. You can call the American Cancer Society at (800) 227-2345, if you would like to volunteer or you need to set up a ride.\n\nMary Smith is one of the patients Sharp drives. Smith has breast cancer. The two found they have quite a bit in common during the rides. Sharp says, \u201cWe\u2019ve decided we\u2019re sisters by another set of parents.\u201d\n\nSharp also knows what it\u2019s like to have so many appointments. She says, \u201cIn 2012 I was living in Vermont and was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, so I went through surgery, chemotherapy, radiation.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to say, \u201cI felt like it was my turn to help out, and, I\u2019m retired, so I worked all my life always had a lot going on, so when I retired it\u2019s like I got to have something to do.\u201d\n\nSmith says she doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019d get to all her appointments without volunteers like Sharp. She says, \u201cIt is the most wonderful thing. It truly is wonderful thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- A program helping cancer patients get to and from appointments needs more volunteers.
