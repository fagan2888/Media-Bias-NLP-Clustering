Nearly 400 high school graduates are reconnecting with their old classmates this weekend.

Members of the Rosenwald Alumni Association held their 18th bi-annual high school reunion.

Back in the days of segregation, Rosenwald was the only black high school in Panama City from 1937 to 1967.

The reunion kicked off with a parade Saturday, and the group marched down 11th Street to Rosenwald High School.

Many former students say they're proud of how far many of their fellow alumni have come and they're excited to reconnect with old friends.

"I just love it cause you see people that you haven't seen in years, you meet your old classmates and it's just really a lot of fun. There's nothing like it, old memories popped up already this morning," said Elaine Griffin, event organizer.

The festivities continue all weekend long. The group is holding a casino night and a banquet on Sunday.
