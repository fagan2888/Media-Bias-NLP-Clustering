Such expirations typically lead to savings as cheaper generics replace brand-name drugs.\n\nThe 11.7 percent rise is a dramatic departure from the more modest average increases of 3.6 percent in annual drug spending during the past five years.\n\nThe report anticipates the pace of spending increases will slow to 7 to 9 percent in 2015, as the impact of the new hepatitis C drugs declines, less expensive biosimilar products become available and several brand-name drugs \u2014 such as cancer drug Gleevac and the antipsychotic Abilify \u2014 are replaced by generics.\n\n\u201cWe expect this bubble of innovation around hepatitis C will pass, so we won\u2019t see such a contribution to growth in outer years,\u201d said Murray Aitken, executive director of IMS Health. \u201cWe think the spike in growth will moderate next year, and further moderate in 2016.\u201d\n\nDrug costs are projected to increase between 3 percent and 5 percent in 2016, he said.The new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, made by Gilead Sciences and approved in December 2013, costs $1,000 a pill, with a 12-week course of treatment running about $84,000. Another hepatitis C drug \u2014 Harvoni \u2014 approved by the FDA in October, costs $1,125 a pill, or $94,500 for a 12-week course of treatment.\n\nAn estimated 3 to 4 million Americans have hepatitis C and are potentially eligible for treatment. Hepatitis drug treatments accounted for $8 billion of the approximately $40 billion in projected increased drug spending this year.\n\n\u201cThe hepatitis C drugs are Exhibit A when you look at escalating drug costs,\u201d said Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts, the country\u2019s largest pharmacy benefits manager. \u201cYou never had a drug that costs that much that can treat so many people.\u201dThe price of Sovaldi \u201ccaught payers by surprise,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Cost and Quality,Health Industry,Syndicate,The Health Law", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Increases are expected to moderate as more brand-name drug patents expire and the impact of the liver disease treatments lessens.", "title": "Costly Hepatitis C Treatments Help Drive 12 Percent Drug Spending Jump", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20141120/costly-new-hepatitis-c-treatments-help-drive-12-percent-drug-spending-jump", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "Increases are expected to moderate as more brand-name drug patents expire and the impact of the liver disease treatments lessens.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b52\"", "article_summary": "Hepatitis drug treatments accounted for $8 billion of the approximately $40 billion in projected increased drug spending this year.\nAnother hepatitis C drug \u2014 Harvoni \u2014 approved by the FDA in October, costs $1,125 a pill, or $94,500 for a 12-week course of treatment.\nAn estimated 3 to 4 million Americans have hepatitis C and are potentially eligible for treatment.\n\u201cThe hepatitis C drugs are Exhibit A when you look at escalating drug costs,\u201d said Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts, the country\u2019s largest pharmacy benefits manager.\nSeveral factors are driving the spending spike, including the introduction of expensive new hepatitis C drugs and fewer drug patent expirations than in previous years, the report found."}
