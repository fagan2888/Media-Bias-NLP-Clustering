Several schools barred teachers and children who had visited African countries that were nowhere near the epidemic. In Maine, a teacher was put on leave because she had visited Dallas.\n\nAnd then election-year politics kicked in.\n\nMembers of Congress, mostly Republicans, warned that Ebola could be carried into the country by illegal immigrants or even terrorists, and demanded a ban on travelers entering the United States from the affected countries.\n\nGovernors scrambled to draft quarantine regulations, producing a showdown between Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a nurse he tried to confine to a tent. The nurse won.\n\nAnd now? The crisis is all but forgotten. We\u2019ve moved on.\n\nThe epidemic is ebbing in Liberia, but still spreading in Sierra Leone. The World Health Organization estimates there have been about 18,000 cases, including more than 6,300 deaths: tragic numbers, but far below the apocalyptic scenario once predicted.\n\nOnly four cases of the disease have been diagnosed in the United States, two of them in people who contracted the disease in West Africa. And we\u2019ve learned that when Ebola is identified early, in a country with a functioning health care system, the disease is treatable after all.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the one word you haven\u2019t heard a politician say since Election Day?\u201d Democratic strategist James Carville asked me a few weeks ago. \u201cEbola!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not blaming ordinary people for reacting as they did to a deadly epidemic they\u2019d been told was difficult to stop.\n\nI\u2019m not even blaming governors who scrambled to impose quarantines to stop the spread of a disease they didn\u2019t know much about. Their job was to protect their citizens. And when they discovered that their initial reactions might have been too broad, they pared them back \u2014 even Chris Christie.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering, as well, that the Obama administration initially did a ham-handed job of mastering the crisis. Dr. Thomas Frieden of the CDC started out by assuring the country that the situation was under control \u2014 even though it wasn\u2019t, at first.\n\nBut there is one list of politicians who still deserve a measure of scorn: the ones who fanned fear for fear\u2019s sake.\n\nThis month, those politicians shared in an award they probably didn\u2019t want: the annual \u201cLie of the Year\u201d prize conferred by PolitiFact, the fact-checking arm of the Tampa Bay Times. They won, the paper said, because they deliberately \u201cproduced a dangerous and incorrect narrative\u201d about an important global problem.\n\nBefore you dismiss that as another liberal media attack on the GOP, consider this: Last year\u2019s PolitiFact winner for \u201cLie of the Year\u201d was President Barack Obama, for his promise that under his 2010 health care law, \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u201d\n\nThe politicians mentioned in this year\u2019s citation included Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., an ophthalmologist who may run for president.\n\nHis advice on Ebola included this warning: \u201cThis is an incredibly contagious disease. People in full gloves and gowns are getting it.\u201d\n\nWell, no, as thousands of medical workers in Africa can testify \u2014 not when true precautions are in place.\n\n\u201cThis is something that appears to be very easy to catch,\u201d Paul added. \u201cIf someone has Ebola at a cocktail party, they\u2019re contagious and you can catch it from them.\u201d\n\nTheoretically true \u2014 but only if your cocktail party acquaintance is emitting fluids in your direction; Ebola can\u2019t be transmitted by air.\n\nThen there was Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., another physician, who managed to combine two hot-button issues, Ebola and immigration. Gingrey announced that he had received \u201creports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever and Ebola.\u201d\n\nOther members of Congress speculated that terrorists might infect themselves, sneak into the United States and try to spread the disease in crowded places. PolitiFact carefully said it couldn\u2019t count that as a lie, since it was mere speculation.\n\nBut it was surely intended to increase fear. And fear is a powerful emotion, much easier to provoke than to ease.\n\nSo now that the acute fear of Ebola has ebbed, we should pause for a moment to thank some Americans who didn\u2019t panic \u2014 and, more important, even did something to bring the epidemic closer to an end: the courageous relief workers who went to Africa, not knowing whether they\u2019d be allowed to return home, relief workers that included roughly 3,000 U.S. military personnel who accepted deployment to Liberia as part of their jobs, and whose clinic-building mission will be complete soon.\n\nAnd yes, even those politicians, beginning with Obama, who didn\u2019t panic.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1AWRNiW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The nation has shown that it can handle an outbreak.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "The nation has shown that it can handle an outbreak.", "title": "Where have Ebola\u2019s fear-mongers gone?", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/12/28/ebolas-fear-mongers-gone/20940465/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The nation has shown that it can handle an outbreak.", "title": "Where have Ebola\u2019s fear-mongers gone?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/295680fe6e5d28b5fba020e2d6c4d44bdac72045/c=0-0-3157-3157&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/12/27/B9315653113Z.1_20141227133102_000_GDR9H5UAB.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb761\"", "article_summary": "Amid such reports, it took only one case to touch off near-panic inside the United States: that of Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan after he was misdiagnosed by a Dallas hospital.\nOnly four cases of the disease have been diagnosed in the United States, two of them in people who contracted the disease in West Africa.\nI\u2019m not even blaming governors who scrambled to impose quarantines to stop the spread of a disease they didn\u2019t know much about.\nSeveral schools barred teachers and children who had visited African countries that were nowhere near the epidemic.\nBut there is one list of politicians who still deserve a measure of scorn: the ones who fanned fear for fear\u2019s sake."}
