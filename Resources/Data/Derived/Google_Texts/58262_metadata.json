The 2013 voting changes prohibited the counting of provisional ballots cast in the right county but the wrong precinct.\n\nTerrilyn Cunningham, a minister in Concord, had a similar experience on election day. When she went to vote early before work, she learned that she was in the wrong precinct, but was told she could cast a provisional ballot. Like Farrington, she later learned that her vote wouldn\u2019t count.\n\nThe elimination of same-day registration kept others from voting at all, as did the shortening of the early voting period.\n\nWilliam Kittrell of Greensboro told the court on Tuesday that he went to vote during the early voting period in October 2014 only to learn that his voter registration was not in the system. He had previously lived in Henderson and thought that if he was registered in North Carolina, he could vote anywhere in the state. Under the old law, he could have registered and voted that same day.\n\n\n\nRev. Gregory Moss, pastor at St. Paul Baptist Church in Charlotte, said the new law undercut efforts he and other ministers had made to improve voting participation by their predominantly black congregation members, including \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d early voting on Sundays \u2014 which was eliminated under the 2013 laws.\n\nMoss added that many in his church community are hourly-wage workers who depend upon public transportation and can\u2019t easily take time off to vote.\n\nAcademics also took the stand to elaborate on lawmakers\u2019 intent when passing the election changes and the impact those changes had on minority voters.\n\nJ. Morgan Kousser, a professor of history and social science at the California Institute of Technology, testified that he thought Republican state legislators had racially discriminatory intent in passing the election law.\n\nAllan J. Lichtman, a statistician and American University professor of political history, echoed that sentiment and talked about events leading up to the law\u2019s passage, which he said demonstrate that lawmakers knew and understood its discriminatory impact.\n\nAs originally filed, the law focused only on voter ID. Once the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the pre-clearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act, though, lawmakers quickly pushed through a massively expanded bill with the additional restrictions being challenged in the case.\n\n\u201cNow we can go with the full bill,\u201d Sen. Tom Apodaca said at the time.\n\n\u201cPrior to the passage of HB 589, there was a fundamental shift in voting strength in North Carolina with respect to the percentages of registered African-American and Latino voters versus whites,\u201d Lichtman said. \u201cIn response, HB 589 was knowingly and deliberately adopted to place a disproportionate burden on African-American and Latino voters in North Carolina in respect to registration and voting.\u201d\n\nCharles Stewart, a professor of political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, discussed his conclusion that the new law disproportionately impacts black voters because those voters used early voting, out-of-precinct voting and same-day voter registration at much higher rates than whites.\n\nBarry Burden, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of the Elections Research Center, reached a similar conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn general, disruptions to voting habits raise costs and deter participation,\u201d Burden said. \u201cWhat may appear to be \u2018equal\u2019 costs imposed by a restriction on voting practices are, in fact, more acute for black and Latino voters. These groups are doubly burdened because they have fewer of the resources needed to overcome those costs and vote.\u201d\n\nYoung voters also suffer under the new law, D. Sunshine Hillygus, a professor of political science at Duke University, told the court \u2014 referring to the law\u2019s elimination of the preregistration of 16- and 17-year old voters.\n\nRegistration is the largest obstacle to getting them to vote, Hillygus said, and preregistration helped alleviate that problem.\n\nNearly 150,000 young people preregistered here in 2012, she added, and a disproportionate number of them were black.\n\nTrial will continue day-to-day at the federal courthouse at 251 N. Main Street, Winston-Salem, and is expected to last at least two weeks.
