Tre’vell Anderson, THE LOS ANGELES TIMES



(The Los Angeles Times) — The year of diversity in television is in full swing. Cemented by history-making Emmy nominations for “Empire’s” Taraji P. Henson and “How to Get Away With Murder’s” Viola Davis for lead drama actress — which two black women have never been nominated for together, and no black actress has ever won — Hollywood’s efforts to diversify its representations of people of color is giving many veteran actors their due recognition.

Also receiving nominations were Anthony Anderson (“black-ish”), Queen Latifah, Michael Kenneth Williams and Mo’Nique (“Bessie”) and Angela Bassett (“American Horror Story: Freak Show”) among others.

Just as deserving, however, are a (new) lot of young black actors storming big and small screens. Check out our list of up-and-coming black Hollywood stars to keep an eye on.
