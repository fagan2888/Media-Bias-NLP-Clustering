Duggan becomes the first woman to lead the organization in its 70-year history.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe NFIB board voted unanimously to appoint Duggan, who NFIB Chairman Steve Schramm called a \u201cstrong and tireless advocate.\u201d\n\nShe succeeds longtime NFIB official Dan Danner, who has been with the business group for 22 years, including the last seven years as its leader. He plans to retire in February.\n\n\u201cI have known Juanita Duggan for more than 25 years and her energy and enthusiasm are unmatched. Coupled with her broad experience, she is uniquely qualified to lead NFIB going forward,\u201d Danner said in a statement.\n\nUnder Danner, the organization has been a leading voice in tax and regulatory reforms, including mobilizing its grassroots network on issues such as healthcare and labor rules.\n\nDuggan says her passion for small business runs in the family, with her grandfather opening a business 100 years ago.\n\n\u201cMy whole family worked there, and it is still in existence today,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I understand the obstacles that business owners and operators face.\n\n\u201cThe next few years will be critical to the future of America\u2019s small businesses as we wrestle with the issues of tax reform, ever expanding government regulation, and the continuing challenges created by Obamacare,\u201d Duggan said in a statement.\n\nDuggan has been with the American Apparel & Footwear Association since last July. Prior to that, she spent about three years at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck \u2014 now the third-largest K Street firm by revenue.\n\nShe is also a past president and CEO of both the American Forest and Paper Association and the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. She served as vice president for federal relations at Philip Morris Companies, Inc. during the tobacco settlement with state attorneys general.\n\nShe also has public sector experience, having worked in the White House of both President Ronald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to be an outspoken advocate for the interests of America\u2019s small businesses,\u201d Duggan said.\n\nDanner's base salary in 2013, the most recent forms available, is listed at $905,677. Tax forms for the American Apparel & Footwear Association are unavailable for the year that Duggan served as its chief executive.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Juanita Duggan will lead the National Federation of Independent Businesses.", "description": "Juanita Duggan will lead the National Federation of Independent Businesses.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
