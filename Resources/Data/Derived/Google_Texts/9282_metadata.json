And the need is growing thanks to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion, which gave greater access for low-income residents to receive dental care, local hygienists said.\n\nExpanded practice dental hygienists can provide their entire scope of care everywhere from schools to prisons to nursing homes and adult daycare centers, according to Teresa Haynes, Oregon Board of Dentistry licensing manager.\n\nIlya Babiy became an expanded practice dental hygienist, and started his business, On-Site Oral Health Care, just over a year ago because he wanted to \u201cadd some variety to my regular clinical practice, where I am not rushed by a full schedule of patients.\u201d\n\nBabiy enjoys the ability to take time with his patients, particularly the elderly and special needs population.\n\n\u201cThe need for preventive oral care for the elderly is enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cMany elderly folks may not have the money or stamina to go through extensive dental procedures such as fillings and crowns, but a cleaning can improve their quality of life and how they feel.\u201d\n\nRobin Fatafehi, who started Northwest Mobile Hygiene LLC in April 2013, agreed that many of the patients she sees have lacked needed dental care.\n\n\u201cIn many cases most patients whom I have seen while serving and working as an EPDH are 20 plus years old and have never been to a dentist or had a dental cleaning,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of which spanned 10 to 30 years of their adult life without having any type of dental care.\u201d\n\nBesides the regular struggles of running their own business, expanded practice dental hygienists who are trying to be independent are finding themselves surrounded by some unexpected hurdles to provide care and earn money.\n\n\"We have to do a lot of work to go through credentialing,\u201d Babiy said.\n\nFatafehi has a contract with MODA Health, and can provide care to its members covered by Medicaid through the Oregon Health Plan. But some of the low-income patients that these hygienists can treat have their dental coverage through other health plans under the OHP, and that poses a huge hurdle because different plans require a different credentialing process, Fateafehi said. When, for example, Fatafehi visits patients in a nursing home, she can only take care of those covered by MODA or who are uninsured.\n\nFatafehi and Babiy say it\u2019s time to change the federal Medicaid law and only require expanded practice dental hygienists to be credentialed once before they can treat low-income or non-mobile patients regardless.\n\n\"My biggest hope is that there can be a change in the laws for EPDH's now and in the future to be seen as independent and allow for more access to (Oregon Health Plan) funding without the hassle of barriers with credentialing,\u201d Fatafehi said.\n\nShelby can be reached at shelbs123@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "In Oregon, 468 dental hygienists are permitted to offer expanded practice, according to Stephen Prisby, interim executive director of the Oregon Board of Dentistry.\nFatafehi and Babiy say it\u2019s time to change the federal Medicaid law and only require expanded practice dental hygienists to be credentialed once before they can treat low-income or non-mobile patients regardless.\nAnd the need is growing thanks to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion, which gave greater access for low-income residents to receive dental care, local hygienists said.\nFatafehi has a contract with MODA Health, and can provide care to its members covered by Medicaid through the Oregon Health Plan.\nExpanded practice dental hygienists can provide their entire scope of care everywhere from schools to prisons to nursing homes and adult daycare centers, according to Teresa Haynes, Oregon Board of Dentistry licensing manager."}
