Micah is comfortable around the children and his diligence and warm-personality have earned him the respect of his co-workers.\n\n\u201cI like my job,\u201d Micah said, \u201cI have made a lot of friends.\u201d\n\nHe makes a valuable contribution to the child care center thanks to the help of a dedicated team of vocational rehabilitation counselors and staff at the Chickasaw Nation Vocational Rehabilitation department.\n\nDetermined her son would not be limited by his disability and to secure a brighter future him, Micah\u2019s mother, Shellie Horton, sought the assistance of vocational rehabilitation services.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, Micah attended Ada public schools. He was engaged with other children, made friends and learned valuable life skills,\u201d Ms. Horton said.\n\nBut after graduation, Micah was not exposed to much social interaction. He became largely inactive, spending his days watching TV with his grandmother while his mother was at work.\n\nMicah, of Allen, Oklahoma, still pursued a variety of interests such as, music, books, cars, drawing, sports, design and songwriting. He also participated in Special Olympics, but Ms. Horton remained concerned about his overall lack of social interaction and lack of employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cIndependent living was not an option for Micah,\u201d Ms. Horton said, \u201cBut I wanted him to be out exercising and meeting people.\u201d\n\nMs. Horton reached out to the vocational rehabilitation department to see what could be done to improve Micah\u2019s quality of life.\n\nAfter assessing Micah\u2019s strengths and limitations, the vocational rehabilitation staff was able to secure a suitable employment situation for the young man, while fulfilling a need and providing a valuable service.\n\n\u201cWhen we learned Micah enjoyed folding laundry, we started exploring which (Chickasaw Nation) department might have a need for this service. We were able to work with the child care facility to create a position where Micah could be successful and beneficial for the facility,\u201d vocational rehabilitation counselor Nicholas Buckley said.\n\nBefore Micah became the laundry attendant for the facility, a teacher in each classroom was responsible for the laundry of the classroom.\n\nChickasaw Nation Child Care staff is grateful to have Micah on staff, because of his dedication and positive attitude.\n\n\u201cThe love and gratitude that has been reciprocated as a result of working with Micah, has left my co-workers and I with a lifetime of memories,\u201d Ms. Johna Engel, special education teacher assistant said, \u201cMicah has a true desire to learn and grow. He enjoys the sense of accomplishment that working brings. We are so glad to have Micah as part of our Team!\u201d\n\nChickasaw Nation Vocational Rehabilitation assists Chickasaws, and other Native Americans with disabilities who live within the Chickasaw Nation boundaries, secure employment or return to suitable employment.\n\nOnce eligibility has been verified and confirmed, individuals work with a vocational rehabilitation counselor to design an individual development plan.\n\nA monthly job club is also available to vocational rehabilitation clients.
