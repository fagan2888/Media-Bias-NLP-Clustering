The measure was designed to prevent Medicaid funding from going to private mental institutions to avoid warehousing of mental patients.\n\nDrug rehabilitation centers are turning away new Medicaid beneficiaries who are entitled to treatment under Obamacare.\n\n\"The unintended consequence is that you are discriminating against an adult who needs help,\" said Elizabeth Stanley-Salazar, a vice president at the Phoenix House, which offers drug treatment in a dozen states, including California, Florida and Virginia. \"We don't do that for any other illness or disease.\"\n\nA 'DUMB' RESTRICTION\n\nHealth officials and treatment centers have raised concerns about the restriction.\n\nIn a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services last month, Toby Douglas, California's Health Care Services Department director, said just 10% of the available inpatient beds in the state are in facilities that meet the federal government's size restrictions. He asked the federal government to give the state some flexibility in counting beds.\n\nSimilarly, the vast majority of the substance abuse treatment in Colorado is located in centers with more than 16 beds, said Arthur Schut, chief executive officer of Denver-based Arapahoe House. There are ongoing conversations among treatment providers statewide about how to legally get around the restriction so they can offer the newly available benefits to more people, he said.\n\n\"Everyone is in agreement about how dumb this is,\" he said. \"It doesn't work economically, and it doesn't work for the people seeking treatment.\n\nThere are no plans to change the law, said Suzanne Fields, a SAMHSA senior adviser on health care financing. The federal government is working with states on other options, including treating patients under programs paid for with other federal money.\n\nFields said federal health officials are meeting with insurance providers and trade groups to supply information and help them ease the transition to the new system of expanded benefits.\n\nIn addition to the protections under the Affordable Care Act, long-awaited rules for another federal law \u2014 the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act \u2014 were released late last year requiring that coverage for substance abuse and mental health treatment not be more restrictive than other medical coverage. Insurance companies can't have different rules for co-payments or visit limits for substance abuse or other behavioral issues than for medical issues.\n\nEven so, some of the changes have been slow to take root, and despite the new coverage and protections, treatment centers still fight with insurance plans over how long they can keep patients in care.\n\n\"There is that natural tension between a payer and a provider that continues,\" said Les Sperling, chief executive officer of the Central Kansas Foundation.\n\nAt the Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center in Pasadena, Calif., administrators said they constantly are trying to persuade insurance carriers to pay for longer stays. \"We have to paint a picture for the insurance companies of this sick person who needs a lot more help,\" said Mark Paquet, admissions director.\n\n'IT TAKES A LONG TIME'\n\nTake Jessica Schabel, 19, from Yucaipa, Calif., who is covered through her parents' plan. Her insurance benefits ran out after 30 days of addiction treatment, but administrators could not get her treatment extended. The facility paid for her to stay an additional 30 days.\n\nSchabel started using heroin and methamphetamine when she was 15, a habit she says she supported by selling drugs. She dropped out of high school and was arrested numerous times.\n\n\"For people who have used for years, it takes a long time to break that habit,\" she said.\n\nDespite all the unanswered questions and obstacles, the new benefits are a relief for those covered under Obamacare, said Tom Delegatto, executive director of business development for the Gateway Foundation in Illinois.\n\n\"Nobody is jumping for joy when they have to go into substance abuse treatment,\" he said. \"But they are grateful to have the ability to pay for it. ... They have an opportunity they did not have before.\"\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1gwtElc", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Despite Obamacare mandate, old federal law limits the number of beds for drug, alcohol treatment", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Despite Obamacare mandate, old federal law limits the number of beds for drug, alcohol treatment", "title": "Despite Obamacare, a gaping hole in addiction treatment", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2014/04/05/obamacare-drug-alcohol-treatment-addictions-medicaid-beds/7256127/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite Obamacare mandate, old federal law limits the number of beds for drug, alcohol treatment", "title": "Despite Obamacare, a gaping hole in addiction treatment", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f3c694498cf6aa5b64de537bc2ea0cddf8443fa/c=521-0-4751-4230&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/04/03//1396546186000-XXX-impact-house-1.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Health issues", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Health issues", "title": "Despite Obamacare, a gaping hole in addiction treatment", "author": "Anna Gorman", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ba60c99dbd4a3fbb315975538a1251acaf1f209/c=2261-0-5424-4204/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/04/03//1396546186000-XXX-impact-house-1.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3c1f4e86f8ccc17f40f7f6d80a20821e6aa8df6/c=521-0-4751-4230/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/04/03//1396546186000-XXX-impact-house-1.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb6d596ea11d2dfb22853934015688933535cecc/c=356-0-5983-4204/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/04/03//1396546186000-XXX-impact-house-1.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b3c942da4021c1aca70a1ffb7fb2295cc0b2fe05/c=0-0-6351-3557&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/04/03//1396546186000-XXX-impact-house-1.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-05T06:02:09.217000-04:00", "shorthed": "Why many addicts don't get help", "articleid": 7256127, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aebc228f7e0c6bdd3e48f48463425bd50ec22312/c=0-0-6351-3557/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/04/03//1396546186000-XXX-impact-house-1.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f64e07730819e39e9f6ad683743f5aa2a89acb22/c=3074-0-5424-4204/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2014/04/03//1396546186000-XXX-impact-house-1.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "obamacare, drug, alcohol, treatment, addictions, medicaid, beds, affordable care act, SAMHSA"}, "article_summary": "\"Nobody is jumping for joy when they have to go into substance abuse treatment,\" he said.\nSerious impediments to widespread access remain, including a federal Medicaid law that limits available beds nationwide, say treatment experts and government officials.\nA 'DUMB' RESTRICTIONHealth officials and treatment centers have raised concerns about the restriction.\nUnder the decades-old federal restriction, drug treatment centers with more than 16 beds can't bill Medicaid for residential services provided to low-income adults.\nDespite Obamacare mandate, a dated federal law limits the number of beds available for drug and alcohol treatment via MedicaidJessica Schabel, 19, is receiving treatment at the Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center in Pasadena, Calif., for heroin and methamphetamine addiction."}
