But is Medicaid good for their health, bad for their health, or does it make no difference from being uninsured? All three claims found a political champion recently, and all refer to the same study for support.\n\nAccording to Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry, the health outcomes for people on Medicaid are no better than for those without insurance.\n\nFellow candidate Sen. Ted Cruz went further, saying health outcomes are \u201cmarkedly worse when people get on Medicaid\u201d and that \u201cpeople\u2019s life expectancy goes down on Medicaid.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama and others in his administration, meanwhile, credit the Medicaid expansion for improving people\u2019s health and saving thousands of lives.\n\nThe academic evidence is heavily on Obama\u2019s side. But both the president and Perry are cherry-picking from the same study, while Cruz distorts it.\n\nPerry and Cruz claim the expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act is a waste of money because, they say, studies show Medicaid doesn\u2019t work. The Rand Corporation estimated that 6.5 million people who newly enrolled in Medicaid from September 2013 through February 2015 were previously uninsured. Other estimates \u2014 from both the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Urban Institute \u2014 say about 4 million additional uninsured could gain coverage if all states expanded Medicaid. There are currently 21 states that have not expanded.\n\nIn a speech at the National Press Club on July 2, Perry said, \u201cWe spend $450 billion a year on Medicaid. And yet, health outcomes for those on Medicaid are no better than those who have no health insurance at all. Instead of reforming Medicaid, the president expanded it under Obamacare.\u201d (His remarks start at the 12:15 mark).\n\nA few days earlier in a Yahoo News interview, Katie Couric asked Cruz what would happen to the 16.4 million who have gained insurance through the ACA if the law were repealed, as Cruz has called for.\n\nCruz, June 29: Well, that figure is a deceptive figure. The large chunk of that is people who have been put on Medicaid. And one of the things about Medicaid \u2014 if you look at the health outcomes on Medicaid, health outcomes are markedly worse when people get on Medicaid. Medicaid is not performing well. And in fact people\u2019s life expectancy goes down on Medicaid. It is markedly worse.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, meanwhile, claimed just the opposite, saying that those states that have expanded Medicaid have \u201ca healthier population\u201d than those that have not.\n\nObama, July 1: I will tell you the states that have taken full advantage of all the federal options available, they have an even lower uninsured rate, and a healthier population, and more people signing up for the options that are available than those states that have not taken full advantage of those options. And that\u2019s just a fact.\n\nInterestingly, all three base their claims, at least in part, on a single study called the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on May 2, 2013. The study took advantage of a Medicaid expansion in Oregon that was based on lottery drawings and compared data from 6,387 adults who were able to apply for Medicaid coverage to 5,842 adults who were not selected.\n\nThe Oregon Experiment\n\nThe authors of the study concluded: \u201cThis randomized, controlled study showed that Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first 2 years, but it did increase use of health care services, raise rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and reduce financial strain.\u201d\n\nThere was a little something for everyone in that conclusion. The White House Council of Economic Advisers, for example, highlighted the study\u2019s findings that Medicaid coverage expanded access to medical care and improved mental health benefits.\n\nIn a June report, the CEA said that the states that have expanded Medicaid \u201cwill reduce the number of people experiencing symptoms of depression by 382,000,\u201d and that if the other states did choose to expand Medicaid, an additional \u201c393,000 fewer people would experience symptoms of depression.\u201d\n\nThe Oregon study found that after two years, those covered by Medicaid had a lower probability of screening positive for depression than those who were not covered by Medicaid. The difference amounted to 9.2 percentage points, which the CEA then applies to estimates from the Urban Institute on the number gaining or not gaining insurance because of states\u2019 decisions on Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe CEA makes similar calculations using the Oregon study\u2019s finding that those with Medicaid coverage were more likely to self-report that they were in good, very good or excellent health (as opposed to fair or poor health). About 572,000 additional people in Medicaid-expansion states, and another 556,000 in other states, should they decide to join the expansion, would achieve that outcome, CEA said. The CEA makes other calculations on increased usage of preventive screenings by those gaining Medicaid coverage, another finding of the Oregon study.\n\nThe study also provides some backing for Perry\u2019s claim that \u201chealth outcomes for those on Medicaid are no better than those who have no health insurance at all.\u201d But the study wasn\u2019t as all-encompassing as Perry suggests.\n\nAs we noted in an article last year, the study measured only three health indicators \u2014 blood-pressure, cholesterol and glycated hemoglobin levels (which measure diabetic blood sugar control) \u2014 and only over a two-year period. We pointed out then that there could be other improvements that the study didn\u2019t attempt to measure, or that could show up once patients are covered for longer than two years.\n\nThere was nothing in the study to back up Cruz\u2019s claim that Medicaid caused people to fare worse than if they remained uninsured, even though his campaign pointed to the Oregon study when we asked for support for his claims.\n\nOne of the authors of the study, Amy Finkelstein, told us via email that Cruz\u2019s statement was \u201creally not a fair characterization of the results from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur randomized evaluation finds that Medicaid improves mental health (i.e. reduces depression \u2013 by 9 percentage points or 30 percent),\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWe find no statistically discernible effects of Medicaid on physical health measures or mortality. But that means we don\u2019t have evidence that Medicaid has an impact; it does not mean that we have evidence that Medicaid is bad for people\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nNor was the Oregon study the only word on this issue in the academic community.\n\nOther Evidence\n\nA study published on May 6, 2014, in the Annals of Internal Medicine compared mortality rates before and after the health care overhaul in Massachusetts to a control group with similar demographics and economic conditions in other states and concluded, \u201cHealth reform in Massachusetts was associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality and deaths from causes amenable to health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an important piece of the puzzle,\u201d Katherine Baicker, a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health and a coauthor of both the Oregon and Massachusetts studies, told the New York Times. \u201cPutting the evidence together paints a very strong picture that expanding insurance substantially improves the well-being of people who get it.\u201d\n\nAnother study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012 \u2014 also coauthored by Baicker, a former member of President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers \u2014 compared several states that substantially expanded Medicaid (before the ACA) to neighboring states that did not expand Medicaid and concluded, \u201cState Medicaid expansions to cover low-income adults were significantly associated with reduced mortality as well as improved coverage, access to care, and self-reported health.\u201d\n\nA 2013 report from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation looking at the breadth of academic study \u2014 including the Oregon study \u2014 concluded simply that \u201c[h]aving Medicaid is much better than being uninsured.\u201d\n\nKaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2013: Consistently, research indicates that people with Medicaid coverage fare much better than their uninsured counterparts on diverse measures of access to care, utilization, and unmet need. \u2026 A large body of studies over several decades provides consistent, strong evidence that Medicaid coverage lowers financial barriers to access for low-income uninsured people and increases their likelihood of having a usual source of care, translating into increased use of preventive, primary, and other care, and improvement in some measures of health. Furthermore, despite the poorer health and the socioeconomic disadvantages of the low-income population it serves, Medicaid has been shown to meet demanding benchmarks on important measures of access, utilization, and quality of care. This evidence provides a solid empirical foundation for the ACA expansion of Medicaid eligibility to millions of currently uninsured adults, and individuals and communities affected by the Medicaid expansion can be expected to benefit significantly.\n\nObama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers points to the 2014 Massachusetts study and the 2012 Medicaid study to claim that the risk of death will be lower in states that have adopted the ACA expansion. The Massachusetts study found a 2.9 percent reduction in mortality rates for Massachusetts counties from the four years before the 2006 health care overhaul to the three years after, as compared with other states\u2019 counties. The 2012 Medicaid study examined five-year periods before and after state Medicaid expansions from 1997 through 2007 and found a 6.1 percent reduction in adults\u2019 mortality rates in those states, compared with adults in neighboring, nonexpanding states.\n\nThe CEA report says that because there are uncertainties with this type of data and \u201cin the interest of being conservative,\u201d it uses the smaller effect found in the Massachusetts study to estimate \u201c5,200 fewer people would die each year\u201d if all states expanded Medicaid and that 5,000 fewer deaths per year will occur in states that have expanded the insurance program.\n\nThat Massachusetts study said it found an \u201cabsolute decrease of 8.2 deaths per 100,000 adults\u201d and that the changes it found were \u201clarger in counties with lower household incomes and higher prereform uninsured rates.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s claim of a \u201chealthier population\u201d in expansion states is vague, and the CEA analysis shows relatively small numbers for improved health outcomes compared with the millions who have gained or stand to gain Medicaid coverage under the ACA. But past studies do show some improvement in mental health, self-reported health status and mortality rates for those gaining Medicaid coverage. It remains to be seen what health impacts expansion states actually will experience.\n\nThese are only estimates, extrapolated from other studies. The CEA notes several times in its report that there are limitations to this type of research and analysis. The evidence available from studies of past policy changes \u201cis necessarily an imperfect guide to the future, and the actual effects of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act could be larger or smaller than the estimates presented herein,\u201d it says.\n\nCruz\u2019s Previous Claims\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Cruz has made claims about Medicaid increasing the risk of death. In his first-ever speech from the Senate floor, Cruz claimed that studies showed people on Medicaid were \u201cmore likely to die\u201d and had \u201cworse health care outcomes\u201d than those who were uninsured (starting at the 11:10 mark).\n\nCruz, Sept. 18, 2013: Now, the data demonstrate that Medicaid beneficiaries face worse health outcomes than just about anybody else in the marketplace. In 2010, the Annals of Surgery issued a landmark study that examined the outcomes from nearly 900,000 individuals undergoing surgery from 2003 to 2007. The conclusion of that study was that Medicaid patients were almost twice as likely to die as those with private insurance. Medicaid patients, their hospital stays were 42 percent longer and cost 26 percent more. Even more striking, Medicaid patients, when compared to people without health insurance, people who were uninsured, Medicaid patients were 13 percent more likely to die. And they stayed in the hospital for 50 percent longer and cost 20 percent more. In 2011, Johns Hopkins did a study of patients undergoing lung transplantations. And their conclusions were very much the same. They found that Medicaid patients were 8.1 percent less likely to be alive 10 years after the transplant compared with those with private insurance and also compared to those without any insurance at all. Overall, the Johns Hopkins study found that Medicaid patients faced a 29-percent greater risk of death, and yet Obamacare is moving more and more of the economically disadvantaged onto Medicaid, which subjects them to those worse health care outcomes.\n\nIt\u2019s true that in the two studies Cruz referenced \u2014 one published in the Annals of Surgery and the other out of Johns Hopkins \u2014 patients on Medicaid fared worse than those who were uninsured on some measures. But neither suggests they fared worse because the patients were on Medicaid.\n\nRather, it has been shown that patients on Medicaid are, in general, poorer and sicker than those without insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nKFF, 2013: Because of Medicaid\u2019s eligibility criteria and the strong correlation between poverty and poor health and disability, Medicaid beneficiaries are poorer and have a poorer health profile compared with both the privately insured and the uninsured. This is true even within the low-income population, as Figure 2 illustrates for adults. The distinctly higher rates of poverty, chronic illness, and disability in the Medicaid population are important to bear in mind when considering the evidence on Medicaid\u2019s impact.\n\nIrving Kron, a coauthor of one of the studies cited by Cruz, said the Texas senator\u2019s statement is incorrect.\n\n\u201cBoth Medicaid and uninsured did equally poorly,\u201d Kron told us in an email. \u201cHowever the uninsured were healthier than Medicaid and should have done better than Medicaid. They did not because they had more emergency operations presumably due to lack of resources or access. The Medicaid patients were the sickest of all groups.\u201d\n\nKron said the purpose of the studies was to show whether payer status is a predictor of risks of surgery faced by patients. The \u201cpurpose of the studies was not to show, and does not show, that the Medicaid program negatively affects patients\u2019 health,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley and Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "And one of the things about Medicaid \u2014 if you look at the health outcomes on Medicaid, health outcomes are markedly worse when people get on Medicaid.\nEven more striking, Medicaid patients, when compared to people without health insurance, people who were uninsured, Medicaid patients were 13 percent more likely to die.\nAnd yet, health outcomes for those on Medicaid are no better than those who have no health insurance at all.\nBut is Medicaid good for their health, bad for their health, or does it make no difference from being uninsured?\nBut past studies do show some improvement in mental health, self-reported health status and mortality rates for those gaining Medicaid coverage."}
