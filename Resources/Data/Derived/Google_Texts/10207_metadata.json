The law requires most Americans to carry health insurance or pay a fine when they file their federal income taxes.\n\nDuring this time, current enrollees can make changes to their plan or select a new plan. Individuals without health insurance can also shop for coverage during this period. People can sign up for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) through AHCT, too.\n\nAHCT officials hope to enroll an additional 33,000 previously uninsured individuals during the three-month enrollment period. An estimated 147,166 state residents remain uninsured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConnecticut\u2019s uninsured rate stands at 4 percent \u2014 reflecting a 50 percent drop since implementation of health care reform. Fifty-four percent of the 256,666 people who enrolled in private plans and Medicaid though AHCT during last year\u2019s enrollment period were previously uninsured. Access to the exchange also narrowed racial disparities among state residents with health insurance \u2014 26 percent of private health plan enrollees and 44 percent of Medicaid enrollees were black or Hispanic. Three-quarters of all enrollees have used their insurance since signing up, with seven in 10 stating they have a primary care doctor.\n\nHere\u2019s what consumers need to know to make informed decisions about their 2015 coverage.\n\nThe Marketplace\n\nIndividuals who are uninsured, buy coverage on their own or work for small employers can compare and buy health plans at AHCT with coverage beginning as early as Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nThis year, people can choose from plans offered by Anthem, ConnectiCare, Healthy CT and United Healthcare.\n\nThe plans are organized into categories \u2014 bronze, silver, gold and platinum \u2014 based on how an individual and the insurer will share costs. For example, platinum plans have a higher premium but lower out-of-pocket expenses, while bronze plans have the lowest monthly premiums but the highest out-of-pocket costs. People younger than 30 and individuals with very limited incomes can purchase catastrophic plans to cover worst-case scenarios.\n\nAnne Melissa Dowling, deputy commissioner of the state Department of Insurance, urges consumers to look beyond the cost of monthly premiums when choosing a plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to review all the plans carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes plans with the lowest monthly premiums have significantly higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d\n\nConsumers can apply online, call the Access Health Call Center at 855-805-4325, use AHCT\u2019s free mobile application for smartphones and tablets or receive in-person assistance.\n\nDiscounted Coverage\n\nAHCT is the only place Connecticut residents can apply for financial assistance from the federal government to help pay for health insurance. People with moderate and low incomes can apply for tax credits toward monthly premium payments. Another subsidy lowers the cost of out-of-pocket expenses for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.\n\nEligibility for discounted coverage depends on household size and income. People earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line ($46,680 for individuals and 95,400 for a family of four) qualify for tax credits. (State residents don\u2019t need to worry about recent court decisions challenging whether the federal government has the authority to issue premium tax credits because these cases only apply to federally operated marketplaces.)\n\nIn addition to tax credits, people earning 250 percent of the federal poverty line ($29,175 for individuals and $59,625 for a family of four) qualify for subsidies to help with out-of-pocket costs \u2013 but only if they select a health insurance plan from the silver category.\n\nTaking the time to carefully estimate 2015 income and family size will make it easier to shop for insurance during the open enrollment period. Consumers need to provide an estimate of their 2015 household income and family size to qualify for tax credits and subsidies. People who overestimate their income may miss out on a larger subsidy. Those who underestimate their income will need to repay the government when filing their taxes.\n\nAll plans sold at AHCT meet federal requirements to include essential benefits and cover at least 60 percent of all medical costs, so consumers get coverage that complies with the law.\n\nConsumers can buy health insurance in the private marketplace. But the federal tax credits and out-of-pocket subsidies do not apply for private plans sold outside AHCT.\n\nAutomatic Renewals\n\nRenewal tool kits were mailed to all consumers currently enrolled in a qualified health plan through AHCT, detailing the steps required to either auto-renew or select a new plan for 2015. Most current enrollees will be eligible for auto-renewal, provided their income, household size, tax filing status and home address remain the same.\n\nPeople with changes need to log into their AHCT account and update their information and documentation. This is critically important because tax credits and out-of-pocket subsidies are based on household size and income.\n\nAlthough auto-renewals offer convenience, health advocates advise consumers to view the enrollment period as an opportunity to reassess their health needs and compare all available plans to ensure they\u2019re making the best choice.\n\nTax Penalty\n\nThe tax penalty for people who can afford coverage but go without insurance for more than three consecutive months will go up in 2015. The penalty involves a flat fee based on household size or a percentage of taxable income \u2013 whichever amount is higher.\n\nIn 2015, the tax penalty will be 2 percent of household income above the federal tax filing threshold or $325 per adult ($162.50 per child under 18) with a maximum family penalty of $975. Some people may qualify for an exemption from the penalty, including those who are members of a federally recognized Native American tribe, object to health insurance for religious reasons, are part of a health care sharing ministry or have a qualifying hardship. Check HealthCare.gov for a complete list of people who are exempt from the tax penalty.\n\nKeep Track Of Deadlines\n\nConsumers who currently have a plan from AHCT must re-enroll or select new plans by Dec. 15 to avoid coverage gaps and potential tax penalties. Open enrollment ends Feb. 15, 2015.\n\nPeople who miss the open enrollment period must wait until next year to buy health insurance unless they qualify for a special enrollment due to marriage, divorce, birth or adoption of a child, or loss of employer-based coverage.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the protections provided by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBans Discrimination For Pre-Existing Conditions\n\nInsurers must cover people with pre-existing conditions and they cannot arbitrarily cancel a policy because an enrollee gets sick.\n\nFree Preventive Care\n\nThe law continues to broaden access to free preventive care. New rules regarding testing and medications to reduce the risk of breast cancer went into effect this fall. Plans that begin Sept. 24, 2014, must cover (without cost-sharing) risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, prescribed to women with increased risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that approximately 76 million people (57.8 million adults and 18.6 million children) have received free preventive services. The law requires new commercial health plans to cover wellness visits and evidence-based preventive measures (such as immunizations and cancer screenings). Additional preventive measures for women include free screenings for gestational diabetes, breast-feeding supplies, domestic-violence screening and contraception. Workplaces run by religious organizations that object to birth control do not have to pay for contraception, but insurers must pick up the cost.\n\nExpanded Coverage For Young Adults\n\nYoung adults up to age 26 who do not have access to job-based health insurance can stay on a parent\u2019s plan whether or not they live at home or attend school. The law applies to all health plans, even those that are self-insured.\n\nAnnual And Lifetime Dollar Limits\n\nThe law ends lifetime and yearly dollar limits on coverage of essential health benefits. That means Connecticut residents with insurance no longer need to worry about going into debt when their coverage runs out.\n\nEssential Benefits\n\nInsurers must provide a minimum level of coverage under 10 categories known as \u201cessential benefits,\u201d including preventive care, emergency services, hospitalizations, outpatient care, maternity services, laboratory services, mental health and substance abuse treatment, pediatric care (including vision and dental), prescription drugs, and rehabilitation and habilitation services. The law applies to all plans sold in the private market or through AHCT \u2014 except plans from self-insured employers and \u201cgrandfathered\u201d policies sold before March 23, 2010.\n\nStandardized Benefit Explanations\n\nHealth insurers must provide policyholders with standard disclosure forms (no more than four pages) summarizing benefits and coverage, including information about deductibles, copayments, out-of-pocket limits and excluded services. The standard format allows consumers to make informed decisions based on apples-to-apples comparisons of health plans.\n\nConsumer Rebates\n\nConsumers whose private insurance carriers do not spend at least 80 percent of premium dollars on health care and quality improvements can expect to receive a rebate each year. This year a total of 69,186 Connecticut residents received $3 million in rebates on their 2013 coverage, with an average family rebate of $72.\n\nPrescription Drug Savings For Older Adults\n\nIn 2015, Medicare recipients who reach the prescription coverage gap \u2013 known as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d \u2013 will get a 55 percent discount on brand-name prescription drugs and a 35 percent discount on generic drugs. The donut hole, the point at which people must start paying for their medications, disappears by 2020.\n\nScrutinizing Premium Increases\n\nInsurance companies seeking premium increase rates of 10 percent or more for plans in the individual market trigger an automatic review by the Connecticut Department of Insurance.\n\n>>> Sources: Access Health CT, Connecticut Health Foundation, Connecticut State Department of Insurance, HealthCare.gov and Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (www.c-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "title": "What Connecticut consumers need to know when purchasing coverage at Access Health CT", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141106/NEWS/141109731", "image": {"width": "941px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20141106/NEWS/141109731/AR/0/AR-141109731.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "673px"}, "type": "article", "title": "What Connecticut consumers need to know when purchasing coverage at Access Health CT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "Connecticut consumers who carefully consider their health status and financial needs stand to reap the greatest benefits when shopping for insurance during the 2015 open enrollment period.", "title": "What Connecticut consumers need to know when purchasing coverage at Access Health CT", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141106/NEWS/141109731", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20141106/NEWS/141109731/AR/0/AR-141109731.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Health, Health news, New Haven Health news, CT Health news, US Health news, world Health news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Connecticut consumers who carefully consider their health status and financial needs stand to reap the greatest benefits when shopping for insurance during the 2015 open enrollment period."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5f9\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s what consumers need to know to make informed decisions about their 2015 coverage.\n>>> Sources: Access Health CT, Connecticut Health Foundation, Connecticut State Department of Insurance, HealthCare.gov and Kaiser Family Foundation.\nThe standard format allows consumers to make informed decisions based on apples-to-apples comparisons of health plans.\nAdvertisementConnecticut\u2019s uninsured rate stands at 4 percent \u2014 reflecting a 50 percent drop since implementation of health care reform.\nDiscounted CoverageAHCT is the only place Connecticut residents can apply for financial assistance from the federal government to help pay for health insurance."}
