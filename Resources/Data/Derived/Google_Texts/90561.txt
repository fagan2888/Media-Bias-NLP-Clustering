The Washington Post ran an editorial this weekend that uses a Louis C.K. joke to come to the defense of Stacey Dean Rambold, the 49-year-old high school teacher who will serve a whopping 30 days in prison for the rape of a 14-year-old student.

Writer Betsy Karasik argues that the “utter hysteria with which society responds to these situations” (“these situations” being the rape of high school students) has “consequences,” which, she suggests, can be neatly summarized by a Louis C.K. bit about child molestation.

“Why do kids disappear sometimes?,” wonders Louis C.K. in the aforementioned bit. “I think it’s because somebody took them and had sex with them. And once you have sex with a kid, you have to toss them. Because people hate folks who have sex with kids, more than pretty much anything… So, here’s the thing, if you have sex with a kid, you have to chuck them out because if the kid tells anybody, you’re screwed. So I can’t help but thinking that if we took down a few notches the hatred for kids-having-sex-people, at least you get the kid back.”

After grounding her case for the acceptability of the sexual assault of minors in the musings of a standup comedian, Karasik goes on to suggest that most sex between teachers and students is consensual and part of a “nuanced continuum of sexual interactions.” Ignoring completely the implicit power imbalance created by a teacher’s discretionary authority over a student, Karasik says that, “Throughout high school, college and law school, I knew students who had sexual relations with teachers. To the best of my knowledge, these situations were all consensual in every honest meaning of the word, even if society would like to embrace the fantasy that a high school student can’t consent to sex.”
