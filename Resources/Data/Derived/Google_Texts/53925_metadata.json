They hold, as a matter of religious conviction, that it would be sinful and immoral for them intentionally to participate in, pay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support access to abortion, which destroys human life,\u201d the complaint explains.\n\n\u201cThey hold that one of the prohibitions of the Ten Commandments (\u2018thou shalt not murder\u2019) precludes them from facilitating, assisting in, serving as the conduct for, or enabling the use of drugs and devices that can and do destroy very young human beings in the womb. The health benefits they provide to their employees reflect these convictions.\u201d\n\nThe case alleges the Obama administration is violating the Administrative Procedure Act, the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, the Free Speech Clause, the Establishment Clause, the Free Exercise Clause and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nFurther, evidence suggests religious believers who object to abortion-causing drugs are deliberately being targeted, the case claims.\n\n\u201cThe Final Mandate forces the plaintiffs to facilitate government-dictated education and counseling concerning abortion that directly conflicts with their religious beliefs and teaching,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cFacilitating this government-dictated speech directly undermines the express speech and messages concerning the sanctity of life that the plaintiffs seek to convey.\u201d\n\nFurther, the government\u2019s demand \u201cadvances no compelling governmental interest\u201d and such drugs already are commonly available through \u201cnumerous alternative mechanisms.\u201d\n\nThe government easily could provide the \u201cbenefits,\u201d the lawsuit said, or \u201cthe government could simply exempt all conscientiously objecting organizations, just as it has already exempted the small subset of nonprofit religious employers that are referred to in Section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d\n\nAfter all, the government already provides a multitude of other \u201cexemptions,\u201d it said.\n\nThe government, through its actions, already admits that the mandate is not part of any \u201ccompelling interest.\u201d\n\nSo why is the demand being pursued?\n\n\u201cThe Final Mandate was promulgated by government officials, and supported by non-governmental organizations, who strongly oppose religious teachings and beliefs regarding marriage, family, and life,\u201d the case states.\n\n\u201cDefendant [former HHS Secretary Kathleen] Sebelius, for example, has long been a staunch support of abortion rights and a vocal critic of religious teachings and beliefs regarding abortion and contraception,\u201d the complaint continues. \u201cOn Oct. 4, 2011, six days after the comment period for the original Interim Final Rule ended, Defendant Sebelius gave a speech at a fundraiser for NARAL Pro-Choice America. She told the assembled crowd that \u2018we are in a war.\u2019\n\n\u201cShe further criticized individuals and entities whose beliefs differed from those held by her and the others at the fundraiser, stating: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t you think that people who want to reduce the number of abortions would champion the cause of widely available, widely affordable contraceptive services? Not so much,'\u201d the complaint states.\n\n\u201cOn July 16, 2013, Secretary Sebelius further compared opponents of the Affordable Care Act generally to \u2018people who opposed civil rights legislation in the 1960s,\u2019 stating that upholding the Act requires the same action as was shown \u2018in the fight against lynching and the fight for desegregation.'\u201d\n\nThat attitude leads to the conclusion that the administration is intending to discriminate against religious organizations, the complaint says.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be plausibly maintained that the fate of the entire enterprise rests in any measurable way on forcing these four plaintiffs to facilitate access to four drugs and devices \u2013 which represent one-fifth of the one of the 143 required items,\u201d the case says.\n\n\u201cIn any event, the government has already conceded that it has no interest in imposing the mandate upon religious employers like the plaintiffs,\u201d it says.\n\nSo Washington\u2019s \u201caccommodation,\u201d which \u201cdoes not sufficiently diminish their ethical objection to complicity with sin,\u201d still \u201cconscripts the plaintiffs into the government\u2019s scheme, hijacking their health plans and using them as conduits for the delivery of life-destroying drugs and devices to members of their religious communities.\u201d\n\nThe government still demands that the Christian groups identify to the government their insurance policy administrators, play a \u201ccentral role in facilitating free access to abortifacient services\u201d and make them victim to \u201ca shell game that attempts to disguise the religious organization\u2019s role as the central cog in the government\u2019s scheme for expanding access to contraceptive and abortifacient services.\u201d\n\nThe case was filed in federal court in Colorado.\n\n\u201cThe government should not force religious organizations to be involved in providing abortion pills to their employees,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Gregory S. Baylor. \u201cThe best way to respect everyone\u2019s freedom would have been to extend the existing religious exemption to religious non-profits in addition to churches. The administration has failed in its duty to uphold the freedoms guaranteed to every American under the Constitution and federal law. These religious organizations had hoped to avoid this action, but the cause of religious conscience and liberty compelled them to take this step.\u201d\n\nAdded ADF Senior Counsel Kevin Theriot: \u201cAll Americans should oppose unjust laws that force people \u2013 under threat of punishment \u2013 to give up their fundamental freedoms in order to provide insurance. That\u2019s no different for these Christian organizations, which simply want to abide by the very faith they espouse. The government is forbidden from punishing people of faith for making decisions consistent with that faith.\u201d\n\nThere have been multitudes of lawsuits filed over Obamacare, and WND reported only a few days ago that another case over the same contraception mandate issue resulted in a loss for Obama.\n\nIt was a federal judge in Florida who ruled that the government\u2019s latest revisions to the mandate still \u201cdon\u2019t do enough to protect people of faith.\u201d\n\nThe ruling came from Judge James Moody Jr. in a suit by Ave Maria University, which charged the Obamacare requirement violates the faith on which it operates.\n\nThe judge said: \u201cDefendants do not dispute that Ave Maria is a nonprofit Catholic university purposed with \u2018educat[ing] students in the principles and truths of the Catholic faith.\u2019 \u2026 One such element of the Catholic faith that Ave Maria holds and professes concerns the sanctity of life. Ave Maria \u2018believes that each human being bears the image and likeness of God, and therefore any abortion \u2013 including through post-conception contraception \u2013 ends a human life and is a grave sin. Ave Maria also believes that sterilization and the use of contraception are morally wrong.'\u201d\n\nHe said the \u201crule\u201d that was intended to provide an \u201caccommodation\u201d to faith members was not a satisfactory solution.\n\n\u201cAfter dozens of court rulings, the government still doesn\u2019t seem to get that it can\u2019t force faith institutions to violate their beliefs,\u201d said a spokesman for that legal team, assembled by the Becket Fund. \u201cFortunately, the courts continue to see through the government\u2019s attempts to disguise the mandate\u2019s religious coercion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Obamacare has been challenged in court since it was launched, with charges that it is unconstitutional, violates religious rights, invades privacy and unlawfully orders consumers to purchase a product.
