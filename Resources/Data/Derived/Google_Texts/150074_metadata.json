Gore. Hobby Lobby. Citizens United. Gutting the Voting Rights Act, affirmative action, gun control, the Violence Against Women Act, and\u2014one last middle finger raised against human progress\u2014EPA regulations to control global warming. These are just a few of the disastrous 5\u20134 Supreme Court decisions in which Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week at the age of 79, participated. If it were all up to him, we\u2019d be even worse off: He was in the minority voting against the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage, and in favor of people being executed for crimes they committed as children. In his world, women would be barred from the Virginia Military Institute (and who knows where else), Roe v. Wade would be long overturned, and Miranda warnings would be history. The list goes on and on. Ad Policy\n\nGranted, Scalia loved opera. He was Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s friend. Those who knew him say he was convivial and witty and enjoyed life. He had a big vocabulary, including many colorful synonyms for nonsense (\u201cjiggery-pokery,\u201d \u201cargle-bargle\u201d). I sympathize with his lack of interest in healthy eating and exercise. But he doesn\u2019t deserve all the nice things liberals are saying about him. Just because someone is dead, they don\u2019t become a cuddly teddy bear.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many people of whom one can say that if it weren\u2019t for them, we\u2019d be living in a different world. The five conservative justices of the Supreme Court who installed George W. Bush as president certainly qualify. By stopping the vote count in Florida, they changed the course of history\u2014and in a way that, unlike many judicial decisions, cannot be revisited. The damage from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq cannot be undone or repaired; over a decade later, their consequences have spilled out into an even larger region of the Middle East. At home, Republican candidates vie with one another over who is the most willing to torture. This is the world Scalia helped make.\n\nIt is astonishing that Scalia, a conservative Catholic with rigid views on sexual morality, whose judicial philosophy of \u201coriginal intent\u201d specifically barred interpreting the Constitution in the light of modern circumstances, so successfully imprinted his views on the legal world. When Reagan appointed him in 1986, his views on social issues weren\u2019t so far out of the mainstream. Homosexuality was taboo. Gay marriage was an oxymoron. The Equal Rights Amendment was dead. Americans have evolved a lot since then, including those who call themselves conservative, but Scalia was set in cement. Today, his writings on gay rights sound like the ravings of a radio shock jock: In his dissent in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), which struck down that state\u2019s anti-sodomy law, he wrote of \u201cthe homosexual agenda.\u201d Over the years he compared homosexuality to murder, polygamy, bestiality, incest, child abuse, prostitution, the \u201crecreational use of heroin,\u201d and \u201cworking more than 60 hours a week in a bakery.\u201d Some day a psychoanalyst will have a field day with Scalia\u2019s subconscious.\n\nThe country is progressing in other ways as well. Scalia\u2019s enthusiasm for capital punishment was mainstream when he joined the bench. In 2015, a mere four states accounted for the vast majority of executions in America, and there are fewer every year. Scalia deferred to religion even as Americans are becoming less religious\u2014including Catholics. His casual racism could be breathtaking: The Voting Rights Act was \u201ca racial entitlement\u201d; black students might do better at \u201ca slower-track school.\u201d His final vote, issued just four days before his death, was to join yet another 5\u20134 majority to thwart President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan\u2014even as the country finally accepts the fact of climate change. Citizens United has produced an uproar in both parties, leading directly to insurgent campaigns by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Sanders, by the way, has said that a willingness to overturn Citizens United would be a litmus test for his Supreme Court nominees.\n\nOn women\u2019s rights, Americans have moved way ahead of Scalia, who voted against Lilly Ledbetter\u2019s right to sue for sex discrimination because she didn\u2019t discover soon enough that she was paid less than her male colleagues. (Congress amended the law in response to the court\u2019s decision, something Scalia frequently challenged lawmakers to do if they didn\u2019t like his rulings.) In 2011, he said discrimination against women wasn\u2019t prohibited by the Constitution. (Scalia walked that back a few years later. Maybe his good friend RGB reminded him that the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal-protection clause has been applied to women for 40 years.)\n\nAbortion rights appear to be one area in which Scalia\u2019s views have some popular backing. Although most Americans support Roe v. Wade, polls show majority support for restrictions that violate Roe, like 20-week bans and the federal \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d ban. A minority also favors laws that make it harder for clinics to stay open, like the ones in Texas at issue in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, which the Court will hear March 2. But according to a National Institute of Reproductive Health survey, 55 percent of respondents don\u2019t know about the broad scope of these restrictions (318 state laws since January 2010) and, when they\u2019re informed, don\u2019t approve: \u201cLarge majorities of voters say they want the experience of abortion to be safe, legal, respectful, supportive, affordable, accessible, and without shame.\u201d Visit Cuba with The Nation!

A long time ago, I said some things along those lines myself\u2014but whatever sense that made 20 years ago is long gone. We\u2019re in a different era now. Whether or not Obama is able to name Scalia\u2019s replacement, two or even three seats will probably become vacant in the next administration, giving Obama\u2019s successor tremendous power to shape the direction of the Court for the next 20 or 30 years. Supreme Court justices tend to be very long-lived.
