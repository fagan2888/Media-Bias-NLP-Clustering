The ruling, however, was open-ended in a way \u2013 the Republican-appointed justices didn\u2019t say which part of the Constitution the VRA violated, and it invited Congress to \u201cfix\u201d the law (though the justices didn\u2019t say how).\n\nWith this in mind, a bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers got to work, and in January they unveiled the Voting Rights Amendment Act, a reform bill intended to address the Supreme Court\u2019s concerns. Zachary Roth reported yesterday that proponents haven\u2019t given up the fight.\n\nCivil rights advocates pressed lawmakers Wednesday at a contentious Senate hearing to advance a bill that would strengthen the Voting Rights Act, saying a failure to do so would represent a historic betrayal of African-American aspirations for political equality. But Republicans appeared unmoved. \u201cIf the Voting Rights Act is not modernized, then you are effectively ending the second Reconstruction of the United States,\u201d Rev. Francys Johnson, the president of the Georgia NAACP, told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nAt this point, the key barrier is finding Republican support. When Congress last considered the VRA, support for the law was nearly unanimous \u2013 and in the Senate, it was literally unanimous \u2013 but in the wake of the high court ruling, GOP support has evaporated. Indeed, as Roth\u2019s report noted, at yesterday\u2019s hearing, the Republican senators and the conservatives witnesses \u201cacknowledged that race bias in voting still exists\u201d; they just don\u2019t intend to support any new measures to prevent voting discrimination.\n\nAs of this afternoon, the Voting Rights Amendment Act has zero Republican co-sponsors.\n\nAll of which leads us to a gentleman by the name of Thad Cochran.\n\nCochran, of course, is the senior senator from Mississippi, and just this week, he survived a very competitive Republican primary thanks in large part to support from African-American Democrats who saw the incumbent\u2019s challenger as vastly more offensive.\n\nsuggested yesterday that Cochran, as a gesture of goodwill and gratitude, can repay the favor by \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 throwing his support to the new Voting Rights Act. He\u2019d already voted for the old one so it\u2019s really a fairly modest request.\n\nI\u2019m hardly the only one who thought of this.\n\nIn an interview with HuffPost Live, Derrick Johnson, president of the Mississippi NAACP, said that Cochran could thank black voters by supporting efforts to re-establish protections in the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court struck down last year. \u201cOur advocacy towards his office is to support amending the Voting Rights Act, free of any conditions such as voter ID,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI think this is an opportunity for him to show some reciprocity for African-Americans providing a strong level of support for him.\u201d\n\nT he editorial board of the New York Times is on board , too.\n\nThe prospect of electing an intemperate Tea Party candidate who was openly nostalgic for Confederate days was so repellent to many black voters in Mississippi that they did a remarkable thing on Tuesday, crossing party lines to help give the Republican Senate nomination to Thad Cochran, in office for 36 years. Now it\u2019s time for Mr. Cochran to return the favor by supporting a stronger Voting Rights Act and actively working to reduce his party\u2019s extreme antigovernment policies.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but Cochran is positioned to keep his job because black voters showed up to save his skin. Why not return the favor by showing some leadership on voting rights?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Black Democrats rescued Sen.
