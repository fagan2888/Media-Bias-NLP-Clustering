Colorado’s prep quarterbacks have been putting up some gaudy numbers lately.

The 2014 season has yielded four of the all-time top 10 most passing yards in a game, including Air Academy’s Adam Brown’s record-setting 589 yards against Sand Creek.

The latest accomplishment may have them all beat.

D’Evelyn junior QB Owen Burke has thrown for more than 500 yards twice this season — the first time in state history that someone has done that in their career, let alone a season.

What’s more impressive is that Burke did it in consecutive games.

In a 38-35 loss to Conifer on Friday, Burke completed 39-of-54 passes for 530 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. The previous week he was 23-of-38 for 535 yards and five TDs in a 34-33 win over Lewis-Palmer.

The two games are ranked No. 5 and No. 6 all-time. Burke isn’t the only D’Evelyn player to be ranked in the top 10. The Jaguars have had several quarterbacks over the years who have put up big single-game numbers. Cody Marvel threw for 523 yards in 2011, Mark Schaffer had 486 in 2006, and Caleb Fleck had 461 in 2011.

Burke is third in the state in total passing yards with 1,762 yards behind Holy Family’s Chris Helbig (1,935) and Brown (1,929).
