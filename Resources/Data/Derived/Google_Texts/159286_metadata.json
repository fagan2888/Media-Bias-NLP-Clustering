I, President Newt, he vowed, would reduce the price of gas to $2.50 a gallon and thus lead an economic recovery.\n\nBanging the same drum in the same year, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney assailed Obama for the country\u2019s 8% unemployment rate, which he promised to get down to 6% in his first term. It was Obama\u2019s fault, he argued, that the economy had not recovered from Bush II\u2019s 2008 mess, when it was contracting at an 8% annual rate and losing 800,000 jobs a month.\n\nAlthough the Dow Jones industrial average, which had declined to 6,627 in March 2009, had more than doubled to 13,610 in October 2012, the spawn of Newt and Mitt, like Fox News Republican apparatchiks everywhere, simply waved off the president\u2019s re-election, and fiercely argued for the next two years that Obama was wrecking the American economy.\n\nThe demagoguery worked: Just before the 2014 Republican landslide mid-term election, 62 percent of Americans described the economy as \u201cpoor.\u201d\n\nAnd yet: Gas is now down to $2.38 a gallon, unemployment is at 5.8%, the economy grew at a record 5% rate in the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. has seen 57 straight months of private-sector job growth, consumer confidence is up, the proportion of people without health insurance is declining and the budget deficit is dwindling.\n\nOh, and by the way, Obama\u2019s approval rating is up to 48% \u2014 the highest it\u2019s been since August 2013.\n\nAs Michael Grunwald wrote at Politico the other day: The Chicken Littles who predicted a double-dip recession, runaway interest rates, Zimbabwe-style inflation, a Greece-style debt crisis, skyrocketing energy prices, health insurance \u2018death spirals\u2019 and other horrors have been reliably wrong.\n\nAll right-thinking people agree: Sometimes it seems there\u2019s only one thing President Obama can\u2019t do that might quiet his Republican critics: change from black to white. Tim Egan summed up that case in a recent splendid column, which examined vicious right-wing attacks on Obama, headlined \u201cA Deficit of Dignity\u201d:\n\nI want to believe this is not about race, but it sure looks that way. Barely nine months into his presidency, a Republican congressman, Joe Wilson, shouted out \u201cYou lie!\u201d at the president in the decorous setting of a joint session of Congress \u2014 a flagrant show of disrespect for the man and the office. For this, Wilson became a hero in conservative media.\n\nPointing to race as the source of all this stuff is unfair, of course. There are, no doubt, some right-wing, reality-denying critics of Obama who aren\u2019t driven to distraction by their subconscious bigotry. We just don\u2019t know any of them.\n\nWe hasten to note that Calbuzz does not consider Obama a saint, nor view current conditions in the nation as awesome: Wage growth still is pathetic; Obama still sells out the Democrats when it suits his needs (see damage to Dodd Frank and McCain Feingold); he\u2019s allowed the NSA to tap your underpants; his Obamacare roll-out created unnecessary angst; and his communications skills overall are pathetic for someone who\u2019s so eloquent when he delivers a prepared speech.\n\nBut on the substance of big issues \u2014 war and peace, the economy and jobs, health care, justice and the social contract \u2014 Obama has been a damn good president. He could have been a great president if he hadn\u2019t taken the White House at a time when the Republican Party decided that compromise is capitulation and governing is not a genuine priority, compared to destroying the opposition.\n\nAs we enter 2015 and presidential contenders on the right begin to rally their troops \u2013 including, we fear, the loathsome and spectacularly unaccomplished Carly Fiorina \u2013 the airwaves, news pages and internets will be filled with morons who have been proven wrong at every turn, bewailing the tragedies facing America unless we change course.\n\nMay our Higher Powers save the Republic.\n\nA look back at 2014: We admit we\u2019ve been mostly intemperate since the opening kickoff of the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, five days before Christmas, and expect to remain so until mid-January, when the College Football Championship Game (Oregon beats the thugs from Florida State; take Ohio State plus the points against Alabama in the semi-finals) will be, alas, a fuzzy memory.\n\nFurther weakened by the incessant demands of chasing grandchildren, we currently lack Blinding Political Insights to celebrate the New Year, and therefore turn to the hoary journalism cliche of offering the most outstanding quotes that sum up the Calbuzz view of 2014:\n\n\u2013 \u201cWhen I had hair, Methuselah was walking the streets\u201d \u2013 Jerry Brown.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t at all interesting, let alone exciting \u2013 zzzz \u2013 but Brown\u2019s landslide election to a fourth term as governor, at the age of 76, was truly historic, and thus California\u2019s biggest political story of 2014. Seema Mehta and Michael Finnegan of the By God L.A. Times contributed the above quote to benefit future Brown biographers.\n\n\u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re pushing the party outside of its comfort zone, and we\u2019re already seeing the benefits.\u201d \u2013 Jim Brulte.\n\nCalifornia Republican Party chair Brulte was the MVO (Most Valuable Operative) of 2014, as his from-the-ground-up strategy to return his endangered-by-evolution party to relevance succeeded in a) restoring its financial stability; b) diversifying the GOP\u2019s candidate base; c) toning down the whack-job rhetoric and; d) denying Democrats two-thirds majorities in both legislative houses. The Great Man summed it up in a comment captured by conservative scribe John Hrabe.\n\n\u2013 \u201cHearings for (former senators Leland and Ron) Yee and Calderon would have opened up a Pandora\u2019s box of questions about what constitutes a bribe versus a political contribution \u2013 not a subject politicians want to discuss openly or in detail.\u201d \u2013 Willie Brown.\n\nAmid the worst state Senate corruption scandals since Alan Robbins went to jail, ex-Assembly Ayatollah Brown publicly revealed the realpolitik concern of elected officials in his Chronicle column explaining why their former colleagues felt compelled to boot the shady solons from the Legislature.\n\n\u2013 \u201cThank you very much. It\u2019s good to see all four of you.\u201d - Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe Lite Gov, and hopeful future gov, addressed the Democratic state convention as the last speaker of the day, semi-seriously blaming Brown for being stuck at the end of the parade. Comment captured by Bee Man David Siders, far and away the most talented reported currently covering the Capitol.\n\n\u2014 About the only thing Propositions 1 and 2 have in common is they\u2019re\u2026handy stage props for the governor\u2019s reelection campaign. You\u2019ve got to tip your hat to a political magician who can meld a water bond with a rainy-day fund and create a shield that protects him from having to talk about his plans \u2014 if any \u2014 for a record fourth term. The English language with its endless opportunities for mixed metaphors helps immensely: Banking water. Storing money.\u201dSave water. Save money,\u201d Brown urges in a TV ad promoting Props. 1 and 2. \u2013 George Skelton.\n\nFor the 86th consecutive year, Grumpy George is our pick as Sacramento\u2019s best columnist, as demonstrated by his summation of Brown\u2019s non-campaign, which captures the singular Skelton brand of thoughtful, prudent and perceptive analysis, buttressed with Actual Reporting and an old-school, clear and plain writing style that belies the hours of labor that go into making it so.\n\n\u2013 How many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation? The world\u2019s pretty dangerous, very competitive. I think we need to stay alert, if not 24 hours a day, more than some of the potheads might be able to put together.\u201d\u2013 Jerry Brown.\n\nJust because, from Governor Gandalf\u2019s March 2 appearance on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Extreme inequality, it turns out, creates a class of people who are alarmingly detached from reality \u2014 and simultaneously gives these people great power. \u2013 Paul Krugman.\n\nThe growing 99-1% wealth chasm that defines U.S. economics and society remains the nation\u2019s biggest, and most under-reported political story, and Timesman Krugman\u2019s regular rants remain the most entertaining and insightful coverage of the crucial subject.\n\n\u2014 Just 31,385 people \u2014 one tenth of one percent of the overall U.S. population \u2014 are responsible for nearly 30 percent of the $6 billion (yes, billion with a \u201cb\u201d) contributed to federal campaigns and committees in the 2012 election. -Washington Post.\n\n\n\nAny doubt that the fix is in back in the Beltway on behalf of the plutocrats was boldly erased by the Sunlight Foundation, in a must-read report boiled down by the Washpost\u2019s Chris Cillizza.\n\n\u2013 More than three-quarters of all political fundraising done in D.C. over the past five years was done within three blocks of the U.S. Capitol building. \u201cThese fundraisers are concentrated in and around congressional working hours and on days when the House and Senate are in session,\u201d according to the Sunlight analysis of the numbers.\n\nSee above.\n\n\u2013 Female politicians with more feminine features tend to win election, while those with more masculine features tend to lose. Whether a female politician was going to win or lose an election could be predicted within just 380 milliseconds after participants were exposed to her face. \u2013 Social Psychological and Personality Science.\n\nTalk about your War on Women. Oy.\n\n\u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t see any easy out. All of the forces are on the side of undermining public trust in science.\u201d \u2013 Norton Wise, UCLA historian of science.\n\nThe success of right-wing demagogues in spreading doubt about evolution, climate change, vaccines, the evils of tobacco and the law of gravity is so great that it\u2019s spawned a new field of academic research \u2013 \u201cagnotology,\u201d or the study of the \u201ccultural production of ignorance,\u201d as reported by the indefatigable Michael Hiltzik.\n\n\u2013 Time Inc. will abandon the traditional separation between its newsroom and business sides, a move that has caused angst among its journalists. Now, the newsroom staffs at Time Inc.\u2019s magazines will report to the business executives. \u2013 The New York Times.\n\nThis one\u2019s a bit of cheat, since Time actually announced this fascinating if depressing development in the ongoing decline of journalism in the final days of 2013, a guaranteed dead zone for bad news. Except for the Times media desk, apparently.\n\n\u2013 As many of you already know, those kinds of projects can be hellish, soul-sucking, doubt-inducing affairs. But if you\u2019re the type of sicko who likes holing up in a tiny, closed office with reporters of questionable hygiene to build databases from scratch by hand-entering thousands of pages of documents to take on powerful people and institutions that wish you were dead, all for the glorious reward of having readers pick up the paper and glance at your potential prize-winning epic as they flip their way to the Jumble\u2026 well, if that sounds like journalism Heaven, then you\u2019re our kind of sicko.\n\nThis, the greatest employment ad in the history of the world, was list-served to the online world by an editor of the Florida paper. it serves as a happy and hopeful counter to Time magazine\u2019s dreadful move, and lends hope for the New Year that Actual Journalism is still being committed, somewhere in the nation.
