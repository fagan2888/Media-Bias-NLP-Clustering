Jim McDermott will face an intraparty challenge in 2016 from a fellow Democrat: state Rep. Brady Walkinshaw.\n\nSince he was first elected to Congress in 1988, U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott has faced mostly token opposition and coasted to easy re-election victories in Seattle\u2019s solidly liberal 7th Congressional District.\n\nBut 2016 could be different, as the 14-term congressman will face an intraparty challenge from an ambitious Democratic state lawmaker.\n\nState Rep. Brady Walkinshaw, D-Seattle, confirmed in an interview Wednesday he\u2019ll run for McDermott\u2019s seat.\n\nWhile stressing he has \u201cincredible respect and admiration\u201d for McDermott, Walkinshaw said it\u2019s time for a change. \u201cI believe this region is ready for its next progressive leader,\u201d he said.\n\nMcDermott said he has every intention of seeking a 15th term and has been fundraising and meeting with voters. He said he welcomes the competition.\n\n\u201cThe district is entitled to good representation, and good people should run,\u201d he said. \u201cNorm Dicks used to kid me about being \u2018congressman for life.\u2019 I said, \u2018Stop that stuff.\u2019 People should have choices.\u201d\n\nTaking on McDermott is an audacious gamble for Walkinshaw, 31, a relatively new legislator who was 4 years old when McDermott was first elected to Congress.\n\nA former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation program officer, Walkinshaw was appointed to his 43rd Legislative District seat in 2013 to fill a vacancy. He ran unopposed for election the next year. In order to run for the federal office, he won\u2019t seek re-election to his state House seat.\n\nStill, the political calculation for Walkinshaw is that he\u2019ll have a better shot at the seat taking on the incumbent than he would in an open-seat free-for-all that would ensue if McDermott were to retire.\n\nDuring his short time in the Legislature, Walkinshaw has had some successes, including passage of \u201cJoel\u2019s Law,\u201d which gives families the ability to petition courts to involuntarily detain relatives who are in danger due to mental illness.\n\nAs a relatively young, gay Cuban American, Walkinshaw said he can appeal to the region\u2019s changing demographics. He\u2019ll be a contrast with McDermott, 78, who is of Irish heritage and hosts an annual \u201cPotato Festival.\u201d\n\nWalkinshaw said he doesn\u2019t so much disagree with McDermott on issues \u2014 he could only cite McDermott\u2019s long-ago vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Instead, Walkinshaw said he wants to focus on bringing Seattle\u2019s progressive ideals \u2014 such as raising the minimum wage and decriminalizing marijuana \u2014 into the national mainstream.\n\nHe\u2019s already obtained endorsements from some Democratic legislative colleagues and lined up veteran Democratic political consultant Christian Sinderman to help run his campaign.\n\nBut Walkinshaw likely will face a tough battle to unseat the locally popular congressman, who was last re-elected in 2014 with 81 percent of the vote.\n\nWhile McDermott critics labeled him \u201cBaghdad Jim\u201d for a 2002 Iraq visit, McDermott\u2019s local popularity only grew as he became known for strong denunciations of President Bush and the Iraq war.\n\nMcDermott is a senior member of the tax-policy-writing House Ways and Means Committee and is ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health. A former Navy psychiatrist, he was elected to the state House in 1970 and the state Senate four years later.\n\nDespite being in the minority party, McDermott said he remains committed to working on policies he\u2019s passionate about, such as changes to the Affordable Care Act to bring down costs and add subsidies for more people.\n\nExperience matters in Washington, D.C., McDermott added. \u201cAround here, we\u2019ve had a lot of people come in with no experience, and you see the good luck we\u2019ve got,\u201d he said, referring both to tea-party Republicans and President Obama.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t give a Maserati to a 15-year-old,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the government that runs the world.\u201d\n\nSome Democratic insiders said there have been quiet efforts to recruit someone to take on McDermott, who has been grumbled about by some who believe he isn\u2019t an effective representative. That included calls to other potential candidates, who declined.\n\nWalkinshaw said \u201ca variety of folks\u201d encouraged him, but he was motivated by his own carefully considered belief the region is ready for a competitive congressional election.\n\n\u201cThis is disruptive,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s an opportunity for new leadership.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fourteen-term U.S. Rep.
