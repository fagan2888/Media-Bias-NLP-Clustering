A new Senate report alleges the Department of Labor failed to consider recommendations from non-partisan experts at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget in crafting its proposed fiduciary rule .

The Senate Committee report claims the communications it has been able to access reveal that Labor indeed sought input from SEC in crafting its proposal, but that DOL disagreed with and ultimately ignored SECâ€™s input.

In November 2014 the SEC received a full version of the proposal and provided edits and comments to DOL in January 2015, about three months before the proposal was released in April 2015.
