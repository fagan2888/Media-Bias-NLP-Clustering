ATHENS, Ga. (AP) â€” The Georgia Bureau of Investigation says a man has been shot by a police officer in northeast Georgia.

GBI spokesman Mike Ayers says Athens-Clarke county officer David Kelley shot 22-year-old Justin Tramell Scott when he reached for a firearm early Saturday.

Ayers says Kelley was on a routine patrol when he stopped at a store and encountered two men pouring liquor into a cup before the officer saw Scott with a firearm. Kelley commanded Scott multiple times to drop his weapon.

But Ayers says Scott reached for his firearm. Kelley then fired shots at Scott, who fled before being apprehended.

Ayers says Scott was taken to a local hospital for treatment of a non-life threatening injury.

No officers were injured. The race of Kelley and Scott were not immediately provided.
