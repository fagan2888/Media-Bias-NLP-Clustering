It gives more than 95% of its profits each year to religious nonprofit causes across the globe.\n\nThe company is among several hundred plaintiffs that have filed lawsuits against the federal contraception mandate, a provision under the Affordable Care Act, which requires employers to offer health-insurance plans covering contraception, sterilization and some drugs that can cause early abortions. Employers who fail to comply with the mandate face crippling penalties.\n\nMany of the lawsuits filed against the mandate are still working their way through the courts. The majority of plaintiffs have received a temporary injunction protecting them from the demands of the mandate while their case continues through the court system.\n\nIn the case of Tyndale House, however, the court has issued a final ruling, granting a permanent injunction that prevents the federal government from enforcing the mandate against the Bible publisher.\n\n\u201cAmericans should be free to live and work according to their faith without fear of punishment by the government,\u201d said Bowman in a statement released after the ruling. \u201cThat includes Bible publishers, who should be free to do business according to the book that they publish.\u201d\n\nBased in Carol Stream, Ill., the Christian-owned publisher objects specifically to providing coverage for the drugs that can cause early abortions. In May 2013, the Obama administration withdrew its appeal of a preliminary injunction that had offered temporary protection to Tyndale House.\n\nOther lawsuits against the contraception mandate remain in courts across the country.\n\nIn June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in, striking down the mandate as it applied to arts-and-crafts retailer Hobby Lobby and other closely held for-profit companies.\n\nThe federal government responded by issuing a new rule saying that Hobby Lobby and similar companies would be subject to a modified version of the mandate, which governs religious nonprofit groups.\n\nMany of these groups, however, say the modified rules still force them to violate their religious beliefs by signing an objection form that is then sent to the government, which then instructs their insurance companies to provide the objectionable coverage directly.\n\nThe government says that contraception coverage is cost-neutral to insurance companies because birth control reduces overall costs through fewer births and \u201ctremendous health benefits\u201d to women. However, some contest these claims, arguing that contraception will not be free to insurers, and the costs will ultimately be passed on to the employers that originally objected to them.\n\nAmong the objecting religious employers is the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of religious women that has spent 175 years caring for the elderly and dying.\n\nOn July 14, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Little Sisters, saying that they must follow the demands of the contraceptive mandate or else face fines of up to $2.5 million a year, or about 40% of the $6 million the Sisters beg for annually to run their ministry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tyndale House will not be subject to the contraception mandate after a federal district court\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "Tyndale House will not be subject to the contraception mandate after a federal district court delivered a final ruling in the Christian p...", "title": "Bible Publisher Wins Lawsuit Against HHS Mandate", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/bible-publisher-wins-lawsuit-against-hhs-mandate/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Bible_Credit_Y_M_via_Flickr_CC_BY_NC_SA_20.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/bible-publisher-wins-lawsuit-against-hhs-mandate/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Bible_Credit_Y_M_via_Flickr_CC_BY_NC_SA_20.jpg", "description": "Tyndale House will not be subject to the contraception mandate after a federal district court delivered a final ruling in the Christian p...", "card": "summary", "title": "Bible Publisher Wins Lawsuit Against HHS Mandate"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, hhs mandate, religious freedom", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1816\"", "article_summary": "CHICAGO \u2014 A Bible publisher based in Illinois has won its lawsuit against the federal contraception mandate, with a final ruling delivered July 15 by a federal district court.\nTyndale House is the world\u2019s largest privately held Christian publisher of books, Bibles and digital media.\nIn May 2013, the Obama administration withdrew its appeal of a preliminary injunction that had offered temporary protection to Tyndale House.\nOther lawsuits against the contraception mandate remain in courts across the country.\nThe ruling means that Tyndale House Publishers cannot be subject to the mandate, which was issued four years ago by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)."}
