W. Bush Treasury, Mr. Graetz believes that someday Congress and a future president will realize that piece-by-piece changes to the individual and corporate income tax system won\u2019t work. At that point, he predicts, the U.S. will follow every other developed economy and adopt a tax on consumption.\n\nAnd when Congress and the president get to that point, Mr. Graetz is ready with a revenue-neutral tax reform plan that combines a value-added tax with an income tax that would hit only the best-off.\n\nAt a meeting of the National Tax Association last week\u2013 where Mr. Graetz was awarded the Daniel M. Holland Medal for outstanding contributions to the study and practice of public finance \u2013 he offered an updated version of a plan he detailed in a 2008 book.\n\nHe would impose a new national value-added tax and use the money, in part, to eliminate the income tax \u2013 and the filing of income tax returns \u2013 for families with incomes under $100,000. For others, there would be three marginal tax brackets (14%, 27% and, for income above $600,000, 31%.) He\u2019d also lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, cut the payroll tax and give cash to low-income families with children. For more, see the full tax plan.\n\n\u201cIt does not tear up the tax code and start over,\u201d Mr. Graetz says. \u201cIt simply returns the nation to its pre-World War II tax system, where most revenue came from taxing consumption \u2014 then in an archaic way, through tariffs \u2014 and the income tax was limited to its proper function of providing tax justice through progressivity for folks at the very top. My proposal is designed to promote more economic growth without shifting the tax burden away from the top to families with less income.\u201d\n\nNumber crunchers at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution think tanks, say the current version of the Graetz plan would raise as much money as today\u2019s tax code without shifting the tax burden among income groups.\n\nThe chairmen of Congress\u2019s tax-writing committees \u2014 Rep. Dave Camp (R., Mich.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont) \u2014 are, of course, going in a different direction. They\u2019re hoping to launch a major tax reform push by starting with corporate taxes.\n\nMr. Graetz doubts that\u2019ll work. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Congress can get to a corporate rate low enough to solve the international tax problems we now face,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a gap between those like Dave Camp, who seem to want only to tax income earned in the U.S by U.S. multinational corporations, and Max Baucus and Senate Democrats, who seem to want to tax income earned anywhere in the world by a U.S. company. That gap is simply too large to bridge without a new revenue source to get the corporate rate down to a level where that doesn\u2019t matter much, if at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoreover, it is impossible to do corporate tax reform without dealing with noncorporate businesses\u2013a problem for which there is no credible solution now on the table,\u201d he adds. (A large fraction of business income now goes to partnerships and other entities that are taxed through the individual tax code.)", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Columbia tax-law professor Michael Graetz advocates a tax overhaul that would adopt a tax on consumption.", "title": "Tax Professor Pushes Plan to Tax Consumption", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/25/tax-professor-pushes-plan-to-tax-consumption/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Tax Professor Pushes Plan to Tax Consumption", "description": "Columbia tax-law professor Michael Graetz advocates a tax overhaul that would adopt a tax on consumption.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "David Wessel", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Columbia tax-law professor Michael Graetz advocates a tax overhaul that would adopt a tax on consumption.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-25T11:45:39-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/25/tax-professor-pushes-plan-to-tax-consumption/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-42038", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Columbia tax-law professor Michael Graetz advocates a tax overhaul that would adopt a tax on consumption.", "title": "Tax Professor Pushes Plan to Tax Consumption", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/25/tax-professor-pushes-plan-to-tax-consumption/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-42038", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-25T12:21:46-05:00"}, "article_summary": "He would impose a new national value-added tax and use the money, in part, to eliminate the income tax \u2013 and the filing of income tax returns \u2013 for families with incomes under $100,000.\nHe\u2019d also lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, cut the payroll tax and give cash to low-income families with children.\nAnd when Congress and the president get to that point, Mr. Graetz is ready with a revenue-neutral tax reform plan that combines a value-added tax with an income tax that would hit only the best-off.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gap between those like Dave Camp, who seem to want only to tax income earned in the U.S by U.S. multinational corporations, and Max Baucus and Senate Democrats, who seem to want to tax income earned anywhere in the world by a U.S. company.\nFor more, see the full tax plan."}
