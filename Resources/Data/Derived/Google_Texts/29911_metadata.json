The secret is the Mediterranean diet ... we should eat a little of everything,\" she said at the nutrition-themed Expo World's Fair in Milan.\n\nThe much-touted Mediterranean diet calls for a balance of healthy fats such as olive oil, non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, carbohydrates such as pasta, and proteins such as cheese.\n\nANTIPASTO\n\nThe WHO report was splashed across the front pages of Italian newspapers on Tuesday - as elsewhere in the world - and alarmed producers of Italian prosciutto, a thinly-sliced, dry-cured raw ham considered such a delicacy it is often served alone and unseasoned as an \"antipasto\" before a main meal.\n\n\"We might suffer an economic hit,\" Nicola Levoni, whose family company has been producing ham, salami and mortadella sausage in northern Italy for four generations, told La Repubblica newspaper.\n\n\"At the moment there's a risk that someone standing in front of a greengrocer and a butcher's shop will only go into the former, but they should be shopping in both, because our meat is good,\" Levoni said.\n\nSome reports suggested fear had already spread among consumers. The head of FIESA Confesercenti, an association of nutrition specialists, was quoted on Tuesday as saying that red meat sales had already started to fall at traditional butchers'.\n\n\"Confusion reigns. People are bewildered and are going straight to the sellers to ask them to explain,\" FIESA Confesercenti head Gian Paolo Angelotti told AGI news agency.\n\nThe health ministry has asked the national Commission for Food Safety to look into the matter.\n\n(Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ROME (Reuters) - The home of Parma ham, trumpeting the benefits of a traditional Medit", "title": "No prosciutto panic, please: Italian producers respond to WHO meat alarm", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/27/No-prosciutto-panic-please-Italian-producers-respond-WHO-meat-alarm", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/health-meat-italy_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/27/No-prosciutto-panic-please-Italian-producers-respond-WHO-meat-alarm", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/health-meat-italy_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ROME (Reuters) - The home of Parma ham, trumpeting the benefits of a traditional Medit", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7bf\"", "article_summary": "Italians on average eat a lot less than that, according to the National Meat and Charcuterie Association, which estimates consumption at 25 grams of processed meat a day.\nROME (Reuters) - The home of Parma ham, trumpeting the benefits of a traditional Mediterranean diet, is urging consumers not to get into a prosciutto panic after a warning that processed meat can cause cancer.\nThe secret is the Mediterranean diet ... we should eat a little of everything,\" she said at the nutrition-themed Expo World's Fair in Milan.\nThe WHO said each 50-gram (1.76 oz) portion of processed meat - usually beef or pork which has been transformed through processes like salting and smoking - increased the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent.\nThe much-touted Mediterranean diet calls for a balance of healthy fats such as olive oil, non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, carbohydrates such as pasta, and proteins such as cheese."}
