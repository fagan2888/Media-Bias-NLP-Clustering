Doctors across the nation are seeing a surge of sudden meat allergies in people bitten by a certain kind of tick.\n\nThis bizarre problem was only discovered a few years ago but is growing as the ticks spread from the Southwest and the East to more parts of the United States. In some cases, eating a burger or a steak has landed people in the hospital with severe allergic reactions.\n\nFew patients seem aware of the risk, and even doctors are slow to recognize it. As one allergist who has seen 200 cases on New York\u2019s Long Island said, \u201cWhy would someone think they\u2019re allergic to meat when they\u2019ve been eating it their whole life?\u201d\n\nThe culprit is the Lone Star tick, named for Texas, a state famous for meaty barbecues. The tick is now found throughout the South and the eastern half of the United States.\n\nResearchers think some other types of ticks also might cause meat allergies; cases have been reported in Australia, France, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Japan and Korea.\n\nHere\u2019s how it happens: The bugs harbor a sugar that humans don\u2019t have, called alpha-gal. The sugar is also is found in red meat \u2013 beef, pork, venison, rabbit \u2013 and even some dairy products. It\u2019s usually fine when people encounter it through food that gets digested.\n\nBut a tick bite triggers an immune system response, and in that high-alert state, the body perceives the sugar the tick transmitted to the victim\u2019s bloodstream and skin as a foreign substance, and makes antibodies to it. That sets the stage for an allergic reaction the next time the person eats red meat and encounters the sugar.\n\nIt happened last summer to Louise Danzig, a 63-year-old retired nurse from Montauk on eastern Long Island.\n\nHours after eating a burger, \u201cI woke up with very swollen hands that were on fire with itching,\u201d she said. As she headed downstairs, \u201cI could feel my lips and tongue were getting swollen,\u201d and by the time she made a phone call for help, \u201cI was losing my ability to speak and my airway was closing.\u201d\n\nShe had had recent tick bites, and a blood test confirmed the meat allergy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never have another hamburger, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Danzig said. \u201cI definitely do not want to have that happen to me again.\u201d\n\nIn Mount Juliet near Nashville, Tennessee, 71-year-old Georgette Simmons went to a steakhouse on June 1 for a friend\u2019s birthday and had a steak.\n\n\u201cAbout 4:30 in the morning I woke up and my body was on fire. I was itching all over and I broke out in hives. Nothing like that had ever happened to me before,\u201d she said.\n\nA few weeks later, for a brother\u2019s birthday, she ordered another steak. Hours later she woke \u201calmost hysterical\u201d with a constricted throat in addition to hives and a burning sensation. She, too, recalled tick bites.\n\nDr. Robert Valet at Vanderbilt University said Simmons was one of two patients he diagnosed with the meat allergy that day. He warned her it could be worse next time.\n\n\u201cI never did eat a lot of red meat anyway but when I go out I like a nice fillet. Right now I wouldn\u2019t even eat hamburger meat,\u201d Simmons said.\n\nAt the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, \u201cI see two to three new cases every week,\u201d said Dr. Scott Commins, who with a colleague, Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, published the first paper tying the tick to the illness in 2011.\n\nOne of the first cases they saw was a bow hunter who had eaten meat all his life but landed in the emergency department several times with allergic reactions after eating meat. More cases kept turning up in people who were outdoors a lot.\n\n\u201cIt seemed something geographical. We thought at first it might be a squirrel parasite,\u201d Commins said. \u201cIt took us a while to sort of put everything together\u201d and finger the tick, he said.\n\nDr. Erin McGintee, an allergy specialist on eastern Long Island, an area with many ticks, has seen nearly 200 cases over the last three years. At least 30 involved children, and the youngest was 4 or 5. She is keeping a database to study the illness with other researchers.\n\n\u201cIt is bizarre,\u201d she said. \u201cIt goes against almost anything I\u2019ve ever learned as an allergist,\u201d because the symptoms can occur as long as eight hours after eating meat, rather than immediately, and the culprit is a sugar \u2013 a type of carbohydrate \u2013 whereas most food allergies are caused by proteins, she said.\n\nAllergic reactions can be treated with antihistamines to ease itching, and more severe ones with epinephrine. Some people with the allergy now carry epinephrine shots in case they are stricken again.\n\nDoctors don\u2019t know if the allergy is permanent. Some patients show signs of declining antibodies over time, although those with severe reactions are understandably reluctant to risk eating meat again. Even poultry products such as turkey sausage sometimes contain meat byproducts and can trigger the allergy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know yet how durable this will be\u201d or whether it\u2019s lifelong, like a shellfish allergy, Valet said.\n\nThe meat allergy \u201cdoes not seem to be lifelong, but the caveat is, additional tick bites bring it back,\u201d Commins said.\n\nMichael Abley, who is 74 and lives in Surry, Virginia, near Williamsburg, comes from a family of cattle ranchers and grew up eating meat. He developed the meat allergy more than a decade ago, although it was only tied to the tick in more recent years.\n\n\u201cNormally I can eat a little bit of dairy,\u201d he said, but some ice cream landed him in an emergency room about a month ago. He admitted having had recent bug bites.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surrounded by ticks here,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 09 Aug 2014 16:12:57 -0400", "Description": "A bug can turn you into a vegetarian, or at least make you swear off red meat.
