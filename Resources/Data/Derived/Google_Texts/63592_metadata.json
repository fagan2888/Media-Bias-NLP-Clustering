Ben Cardin, D.-Md., doesn\u2019t seem to be taking any chances, introducing a bill on Sept. 15 providing potential back pay for federal employees in the event of a shutdown.\n\nRelated:6 things to know if the government shuts down\n\nThe Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2015 would authorize Congress to pay furloughed federal employees as soon as the government reopens following a shutdown, that is, if there is a shutdown.\n\nCongress has until Sept. 30 to fund the government for FY2016, but a brewing fight over the funding of Planned Parenthood, has at least 28 Republican congressmen pledging to vote against federal appropriations.\n\nCardin; alongside senators Barbara Mikulski, D.-Md., Mark Warner, D.-Va., Tim Kaine, D.-Va., Tom Carper, D.-De., and six others; sponsored the bill, which also so-called \u201cexcepted employees\u201d, those required to come to work during a shutdown, to take leave while the government is closed.\n\nNational Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon said, in a statement,\n\n\u201cSen. Cardin\u2019s proposal would treat federal employees fairly in the event of a government shutdown. Employees who are furloughed or forced to work without pay during a shutdown shouldn\u2019t be punished because they didn\u2019t create the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe last shutdown was in 2013, when a fight over funding the Affordable Care Act closed the government for 16 days. Congress authorized back pay on Oct. 5, 2013, in the midst of the shutdown. Federal employees were compensated for their furlough days once the government re-opened on Oct. 17.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fedtimes.ly/1iPljCb", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The buzz on Capitol Hill this month can be summed up in one word: shutdown.", "og": {"site_name": "Federal Times", "description": "The buzz on Capitol Hill this month can be summed up in one word: shutdown.", "title": "Cardin\u2019s bill sets up back pay in case of shutdown", "url": "http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/management/budget/2015/09/16/cardins-bill-sets-up-back-pay-case-shutdown/32506419/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/federaltimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The buzz on Capitol Hill this month can be summed up in one word: shutdown.", "title": "Cardin\u2019s bill sets up back pay in case of shutdown", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/81006a860f181fea7b5053aa6c53fab12a3e1c61/r=x643&c=640x640/http/cdn.tegna-tv.com/-mm-/d3eb17bea74b45b3ef48620b56476b504b43eba2/c=0-0-2212-2212/local/-/media/2015/09/16/FederalTimes/FederalTimes/635780095461026333-FED-Ben-Cardin-1.JPG", "creator": "@federaltimes", "site": "@federaltimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 516378808461640}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Government Shutdown 2015, federal back pay Government Shutdown 2015, federal back pay bill 2015, Ben Cardin Federal back pay bill, Mark Warner federal back pay, Tom Carper federal back pay, Tim Kaine federal back pay, Barbara Mikulski federal back pay,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda61\"", "article_summary": "Cardin\u2019s proposal would treat federal employees fairly in the event of a government shutdown.\nFederal employees were compensated for their furlough days once the government re-opened on Oct. 17.\nSen.
