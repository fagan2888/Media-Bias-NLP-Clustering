MANCHESTER, N.H. – During a meet and greet here Friday, Sen. Lindsey Graham said that it has “been a tough three weeks” in his home state of South Carolina.

He addressed the controversy surrounding the confederate battle flag that, until today, flew on the South Carolina Statehouse grounds.

“The flag came down today, it was the right decision,” said Graham, R-S.C., who is a Republican candidate for president in 2016.

He said removing the flag was the state’s way of “moving forward” after the fatal shooting of nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

Graham then turned to his presidential campaign, saying he decided to enter the race because there are “too many terrorists, too much debt and too few jobs.”

“I think I’d be a good president because during my time in the Senate, I’ve tried to do things that somebody needs to do that are hard,” Graham said. “Like immigration reform.”

“I’m tired of yelling about immigration reform,” he said, and the time has come “to get it done.”

“As to the 11 million illegal immigrants, most of them come here to work,” Graham said. “Some of them are bad but most of them are really good, hardworking, decent people, and I’m not going to be part of a debate that takes 11 million people and puts a cloud over who they are.”

He said he wants to create an immigration system where “we can pick and choose” who comes into the country.

“If you don’t have a rational immigration system, the ability to grow your economy dies,” Graham said.

He said he wants a Republican party “that’s conservative but also cares.”

After taking questions, Graham played and won three games of pool with those in attendance.
