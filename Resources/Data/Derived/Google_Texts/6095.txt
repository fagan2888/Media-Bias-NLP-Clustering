Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor's campaign launched two TV ads Wednesday going directly after his Republican opponent's legislative record on Medicare.

The Democrat's ads, airing statewide behind a "substantial" six-figure buy, feature one woman in each looking at their computers and highlighting what they had read about Rep. Tom Cotton.

The ads fit into the theme Democrats have pushed from the outset of the campaign — that Cotton has been "reckless and irresponsible" during his first term in the House. That messaging continued last week when Cotton voted against the farm bill conference report. Watch "Courtney":

Meanwhile, conservative super PAC Americans for Prosperity announced Tuesday that it will soon begin airing a TV ad attacking Pryor over his vote in support of the Affordable Care Act. The ad will be released Wednesday.

“We want all Arkansans to know where Senator Pryor stands on this issue,” AFP-Arkansas Director Jason Cline said in a statement.

The race is rated Tossup/Tilts Republican by Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call.
