You\u2019re familiar with every brand on that list, except for the very last: G.J. Gardner Homes. Calling itself \u2018the biggest builder no one ever heard of,\u2019 G.J. Gardner has climbed to become Denver\u2019s 12th largest builder by reaching buyers that the big production builders can\u2019t touch \u2013 those who want things done their own way.\n\n\u201cThe difference in our buyers is that they\u2019re people who want things to fit their lifestyle,\u201d says Brenda Calvin, project manager for G.J. Gardner in Parker and Elbert County \u2013 putting the finishing touches on a spacious walkout ranch on a five-acre site for the 2014 Parade of Homes (you can preview it today).\n\n\u201cWith us, they can design every space to fit the way they live,\u201d Calvin adds, \u201cinstead of being forced into spaces that work for everybody else.\u201dThat starts with location: G.J. Gardner has ten Colorado franchisees building from Colorado Springs north to Cheyenne \u2013 with builders that specialize in acreage properties such as the Parade ranch in Elbert County; to growingly popular city neighborhoods like Highlands and Berkeley, with walk-to dining, parks and entertainment.\n\nThose niches \u2013 ones that big production companies typically won\u2019t touch \u2013 used to be handled by custom builders; but custom firms don\u2019t do the job of competing with production builders that G.J. Gardner does, says Scott Moberg, G.J. Gardner\u2019s Parker/Elbert builder. \u201cMy customer is usually somebody that won\u2019t even look at production-built homes,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut finds most custom builders are either too slow or too expensive.\u201d\n\nG.J. Gardner uses technology to fill the gaps \u2013 systemization that allows franchisees to compete against larger companies. Gardner also allows buyers to pick from three levels of personalization; saving on costs for a less-personal experience; ratcheting up for buyers who really want a custom home. Those levels include a \u2018Value That Matters\u2019 option in specific communities around Colorado, where buyers can deposit at around $5,000, go to contract for 3.5% of estimated price, and use builder-arranged financing. Higher up the scale, buyers can opt for \u2018Prestige\u2019 services for more options and a wider lot selection for homes $450,000 to $700,000; or for a Signature option \u2013 a true custom home involving a $10,000 lot deposit, premium finishes included.\n\nAt Elkhorn Ranch southeast of Aurora Reservoir, you\u2019ll preview that Parade home on a 5-acre site \u2013 around 27 times bigger than an 8,000-foot lot.

Gardner builders are available this weekend to discuss specifics on your project; check GJGardner.com for builders in Adams County, Boulder, Cheyenne, Denver, Douglas County, Falcon, Golden, Grand Junction, and Loveland.
