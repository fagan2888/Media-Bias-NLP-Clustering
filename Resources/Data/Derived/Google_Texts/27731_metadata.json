Courtesy of to Hampton Creek Foods, Inc.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning letter earlier this month to Hampton Creek Foods Inc., saying the labels on two of its products, Just Mayo and Just Mayo Sriracha, make false nutrient content claims. After pointing out the company\u2019s \u201ccholesterol free\u201d claim does not meet legal requirements, the agency noted that \u201caccording to the standard of identity for mayonnaise, egg is a required ingredient.\u201d\n\nThe products also contain other ingredients not permitted by the standard, the FDA stated, including modified food starch, pea protein, and beta-carotene (to impart simulated egg yolk color).\n\nWorst of all, Hampton Creek \u201cprominently\u201d features an image of an egg on its mayo product labels, the FDA noted. This, the agency implied, screams deception.\n\nNo Egg, No Mayo\n\nGetting cozy, the FDA noted, \"mayo\" has long been used as slang for mayonnaise, so using this term along with the image of an egg may be misleading. The company, which must respond to the agency by Thursday, had not posted information regarding the government warning on its website or Twitter feed as of the publication time of this article.\n\nMeanwhile, vegan fans of Just Mayo might be wondering, Is this warning letter an indication of some general trend happening at the FDA? Could FDA, which has been criticized (frequently) for its acceptance of genetically-engineered food products, be anti-vegan and more generally anti-natural?\n\nYou Decide\n\nIn three recent actions, the agency has issued decrees or warnings against one tofu and sprout manufacturer and distributor; one manufacturer of frozen organic bagels; and one growing, processing, and packaging facility of soybean and mung bean sprouts.\n\nIn the first case, the FDA\u2019s decree requires Henh Wong Fresh Produce, a tofu and sprout manufacturer based in California, to hire a sanitation expert and implement a sanitation control and food safety plan before it may resume operations. Investigators who inspected the facility \u201cmultiple times\u201d found insect and rodent filth, insanitary employee practices, and improperly cleaned equipment.\n\nIn the second case, FDA\u2019s warning letter to Bageladies, LLC of Virginia, notes some of its Bake'mmm Bagel labels do not meet the legal requirements for nutrient content, including a claim of \u201c60 percent fewer sugars.\u201d\n\nFinally, in the third case, FDA warned Good Seed Inc., a Virginia-based growing, processing, and packaging facility of soybean and mung bean sprouts, following an inspection that discovered Listeria monocytogenes, a potentially deadly germ, in the facility. According to the FDA, this demonstrates \u201cthe sanitation efforts are inadequate\u2026 to prevent contamination of food.\u201d\n\nMost of us, whether we eat vegan/organic or not, would find the FDA justified in its actions toward these three companies. Apparently, the job of a federal agent isn't always pretty.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda, false advertising, mayonnaise, just mayo, vegan, natural foods, organic foods", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA says 'Just Mayo' and 'Just Mayo Sriracha' contain no eggs, so they can't be mayo.", "title": "FDA Ruling: If It's Vegan, It Can't Be Mayo", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-cracks-down-just-mayo-vegan-mayonnaise-company-beginning-anti-natural-trend-349616", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/26/just-mayo.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA says 'Just Mayo' and 'Just Mayo Sriracha' contain no eggs, so they can't be mayo.", "title": "FDA Ruling: If It's Vegan, It Can't Be Mayo", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-cracks-down-just-mayo-vegan-mayonnaise-company-beginning-anti-natural-trend-349616", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/26/just-mayo.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/26/just-mayo.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-08-26T11:09:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-26T11:08:59-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA says 'Just Mayo' and 'Just Mayo Sriracha' contain no eggs, so they can't be mayo."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb482\"", "article_summary": "The FDA says 'Just Mayo' and 'Just Mayo Sriracha' contain no eggs, so they can't be mayo.\nCould FDA, which has been criticized (frequently) for its acceptance of genetically-engineered food products, be anti-vegan and more generally anti-natural?\nMeanwhile, vegan fans of Just Mayo might be wondering, Is this warning letter an indication of some general trend happening at the FDA?\nWorst of all, Hampton Creek \u201cprominently\u201d features an image of an egg on its mayo product labels, the FDA noted.\nNo Egg, No MayoGetting cozy, the FDA noted, \"mayo\" has long been used as slang for mayonnaise, so using this term along with the image of an egg may be misleading."}
