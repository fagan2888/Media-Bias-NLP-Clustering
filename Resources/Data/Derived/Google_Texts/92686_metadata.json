That helps explain why some conservatives insisted up to Election Day that Mitt Romney was going to send Barack Obama packing.\n\nIt's still early for definitive pronouncements about whether Republicans will pick up the six seats they need to make Mitch McConnell majority leader. However nationalized the election, these are a series of local races.\n\nBut when Chris Matthews, a former Tip O'Neill aide, is talking down his party's chances, it's a recognition of reality. \"It's going to be very hard to hold the Senate--I think the Senate goes,\" he said on MSNBC.\n\nGive him points for honesty: Matthews isn't glossing over the bad news for the Dems, He added that Republicans have \"passion\" and Democrats are \"not sure of themselves.\"\n\nAnother MSNBC commentator, who famously worked for the president, is similarly downbeat. As Mediaite noted, Robert Gibbs served up his pessimism with one caveat involving his former boss.\n\nUnless Obama steps up his fundraising for Democratic candidates, Gibbs said on \"Meet the Press,\" \u201cyou lose the Senate. And if you lose the Senate, turn out the lights, the party\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nWhen Gibbs jumped from the White House to MSNBC, he told me he wouldn't just be an administration mouthpiece. And with those comments, he proved it (though he is, understandably, consistently pro-Obama).\n\nMaybe some liberal commentators will shift to cheerleading mode when the midterms enter their stretch run. But for now, some of MSNBC's top voices are engaged in reality-based programming. Or maybe they're just depressed.\n\nSome liberal columnists are reacting by giving their team advice. The Washington Post\u2019s Eugene Robinson says the Democrats should talk up ObamaCare, but also \u201cgive their voters a compelling reason to go to the polls \u2014 and that means explaining, in the most urgent terms, just what is at stake.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Republican Party is not \u2018conservative\u2019 by any reasonable definition of the word. It is a radical party seeking to dramatically alter the social compact by which we have lived for decades.\u201d\n\nBest defense is a good offense, and all that.\n\nTo be sure, many factors could change by November. Whether such Democrats as Mary Landrieu and Mark Begich can hang on involves local dynamics as well as national issues. But the president's unpopularity, the rocky rollout of ObamaCare and the anemic economy spell big trouble for the party holding the presidency -- which almost never does well in the sixth year of an administration.\n\nBack in 2010, when he was presidential press secretary, Gibbs said on the air that the Democrats could lose the House. He was right, of course, and merely stating the obvious, but Hill Democrats went haywire.\n\n\u201cI still have tire tracks from Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Gibbs told David Gregory. \u201cHonesty can only go so far in Washington when you\u2019re employed.\u201d\n\nNew York Times loves blind quotes\n\nPublic Editor Margaret Sullivan has launched \u201cAnonyWatch,\u201d an effort to spotlight her paper\u2019s promiscuous use of unnamed sources.\n\nOn Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo:\n\n\u201c\u2018De Blasio went into this thinking that he and Cuomo were friends,\u2019 a Democratic insider said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of concern over retribution, \u2018but Andrew Cuomo doesn\u2019t really have friends.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhoa! How does that square with The Times\u2019s clear written rule not to smear people anonymously? (\u201cAnonymity should not be used as a cloak for personal attacks.\u201d) And what exactly is a Democratic insider, I wonder. A Cuomo insider? A De Blasio insider? A guy inside Democratic headquarters after hours with a mop?\u201d\n\nGood for Sullivan. May I refer her to yesterday\u2019s piece on CNN\u2019s ratings boost over coverage of the missing-plane story?\n\n\u201c\u2018It is a tremendous story that is completely in our wheelhouse,\u2019 said a senior CNN executive, who asked not to be identified defining the network\u2019s strategy for its coverage\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s an incredible mystery full of human drama, with an international element,\u2019 the senior CNN executive said. \u2018Anything international plays into our hands because we have more reporters to deploy all over the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nNo one from CNN would praise the network on the record? It had to be some super-secret background deal?\n\nThis is not to detract from CNN\u2019s success on the Malaysia story (though I\u2019ve criticized the excessive speculation, which the story mentions). But the idea of granting anonymity is so a person can criticize his own company or agency without fear of reprisal. Fulsome praise ought to be on the record.\n\nPhone-hacking payoffs\n\nThe British phone-hacking trial has been dragging on for many weeks, but Tuesday was a rough day for the former editor of News of the World.\n\nThere was a bombshell accusation about Andy Coulson, who ran the Rupert Murdoch tabloid and went on to become a top aide to Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nA key witness said Coulson agreed to pay for the paper to hack the phones of aides to Prince William and Prince Harry. This, he said, involved paying a private eye 500 pounds a week to break into the voicemail of the royal staffers.\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t just any witness. It was Clive Goodman, former royal editor of News of the World, who went to jail in 2007 for phone hacking.\n\nThe defense will undoubtedly raise questions about Goodman\u2019s credibility. But Cameron is undoubtedly ruing the day he hired Coulson.\n\nClick for more from Media Buzz.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
