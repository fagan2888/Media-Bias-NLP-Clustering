ISIS is now knocking at the doors of Syrian President Bashar Assad, only miles away in Syria\u2019s capital.\n\nThe United Nations estimates approximately 18,000 civilians find themselves trapped between Assad\u2019s forces and ISIS militias. Britain\u2019s Syrian Observatory for Human Rights added Syrian jets had bombed ISIS positions near the camp Saturday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT \u201cThe situation in Yarmouk is an affront to the humanity of all of us, a source of universal shame,\u201d U.N. Relief and Works Agency spokesperson Chris Gunness said.\n\n\u201cYarmouk is a test, a challenge for the international community,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe must not fail. The credibility of the international system itself is at stake.\u201d\n\nISIS launched its assault on Yarmouk on Wednesday. The terrorist organization is looking to grasp more territory from Assad\u2019s government and other rebel factions in the troubled Middle Eastern nation.\n\nISIS fighters mainly encountered Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis forces in Yarmouk, a group largely comprised of Palestinian and Syrian refugees opposing Assad\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nTayseer Abu Baker, head of the Palestinian Liberation Front in Syria, told Reuters on Saturday that ISIS had killed 21 fighters and civilians in Yarmouk since Friday.\n\nThe Islamists are widely thought to have partnered with the Nusra Front, al Qaeda\u2019s Syrian chapter, during their campaign against the camp.\n\n\u201cSome families are trying to exit the camp but with Islamic State snipers on rooftops of high buildings, that is very difficult,\u201d Baker said.\n\nYarmouk housed roughly half a million displaced Palestinians before the Syrian Civil War erupted in 2011. The conflict has since killed 220,000 people and displaced millions of Syrians.\n\nISIS rules chunks of eastern Syria as part of its so-called \u201cglobal caliphate.\u201d The U.S. has led airstrikes on the group there despite its stated opposition to Assad\u2019s government as well.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The terror group is now just miles away from Bashar Assad in Damascus.", "description": "The terror group is now just miles away from Bashar Assad in Damascus.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The terror group is now just miles away from Bashar Assad in Damascus.", "title": "ISIS seizes 90 percent of refugee camp near Syrian capital", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/237916-isis-seizes-90-percent-of-refugee-camp-near-syrian-capital", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/syrianmilitant04022015getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/237916-isis-seizes-90-percent-of-refugee-camp-near-syrian-capital", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-04T10:27-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Mark Hensch", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-04T10:27:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/237916-isis-seizes-90-percent-of-refugee-camp-near-syrian-capital", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The terror group is now just miles away from Bashar Assad in Damascus.", "card": "summary", "title": "ISIS seizes 90 percent of refugee camp near Syrian capital"}, "dcterms.title": "ISIS seizes 90 percent of refugee camp near Syrian capital"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb44f\"", "article_summary": "The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on Saturday made major gains in Syria by conquering most of a refugee enclave near Damascus.\nBritain\u2019s Syrian Observatory for Human Rights added Syrian jets had bombed ISIS positions near the camp Saturday.\nISIS is now knocking at the doors of Syrian President Bashar Assad, only miles away in Syria\u2019s capital.\nISIS fighters mainly encountered Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis forces in Yarmouk, a group largely comprised of Palestinian and Syrian refugees opposing Assad\u2019s dictatorship.\nReuters reported the radical group now controls 90 percent of the camp in Yarmouk."}
