The center tracks and supports states\u2019 rights initiatives across the country.\n\n\u201cPeople are becoming more and more concerned about the overreach of the federal government,\u201d said the group\u2019s spokesman, Mike Maharrey. \u201cThey feel the federal government is trying to do too much, it\u2019s too big and it\u2019s getting more and more in debt.\u201d\n\nWhile federal law ultimately supersedes state law \u2013 if enforcement power is exercised \u2013 the Tenth Amendment, part of the Bill of Rights, says that the federal government is limited to powers granted in the US Constitution.\n\nFor instance, a bill that would \u201cblock any future federal bans on firearms or magazines\u201d passed the Montana state House on Monday. Montana\u2019s bill is one of eleven nationwide, according to the center, that aim to counter federal gun control measures.\n\nREAD MORE: South Carolina lawmaker wants mandatory NRA gun classes in schools\n\nTwelve states are seeking to challenge federal surveillance authority vested in the likes of the National Security Agency, revealed in June 2013 to be operating a global spying regime to advance American domestic and foreign policy goals.\n\nREAD MORE: Snowden fine, speaks Russian, still single \u2013 lawyer\n\nIn another 12 states, bills have been introduced to legalize some form of marijuana, whether it be medical, recreational, or both.\n\nThe DC Council's #marijuana hearing today has been downgraded to avoid angering Congress http://t.co/y5irU2Gnztpic.twitter.com/jmhZbv9EZE \u2014 DC Inno (@DC_Inno) February 9, 2015\n\nBoth the New Jersey state Assembly and Senate have passed a measure to halt the state\u2019s participation in the Pentagon\u2019s 1033 program, which supplies surplus military weaponry to local law enforcement agencies. Gov. Chris Christie has yet to sign the bill into law.\n\nThe 1033 program and police militarization overall have received heightened scrutiny \u2013 especially after the civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo. last year, when, after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed teenager, the angered community was besieged by local police driving armored vehicles and tossing tear gas into protesting crowds.\n\nAs RT has reported, New Hampshire is one of five other states seeking laws to curb its participation in federal combat-gear programs.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Less-than-lethal' ammunition makers profiting off unrest from Ferguson to Israel\n\nSeven states have introduced measures that would mean opting out of the federal government\u2019s purported authority to indefinitely detain a person within the US, a power that was granted under the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force. The NDAA provision was signed by President Barack Obama in early 2012 amid the Occupy movement in the US.\n\nThree states \u2013 California, Michigan, and Virginia \u2013 have passed some form of an anti-indefinite detention law.\n\nREAD MORE: Congress reaffirms indefinite detention of Americans under NDAA\n\nIn recent years, the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has been the favorite federal law that states have tried to redress.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 21 states have passed laws and measures that challenge or attempt to opt out of the health reform law.
