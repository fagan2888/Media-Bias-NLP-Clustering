DENVER -- Republican U.S. Senate candidate Cory Gardner maintained that there is no federal legislation that is tantamount to Colorado's personhood initiative during an interview that aired Sunday morning on #COpolitics: From The Source.

Gardner, who disavowed the statewide ballot initiative weeks after launching his campaign, is still listed as a co-sponsor on the federal Life Begins at Conception Act, which the bill's authors have explained is an effort to establish personhood.

"There is no federal personhood bill," Gardner said four different times during the interview with FOX31 political reporter Eli Stokols when the conversation turned to women's health issues (at around 13:00 into the clip above).

Gardner attributed the conclusion that the federal bill is practically the same thing as the statewide ballot measure -- a conclusion agreed to by Personhood USA, the legislation's authors and the independent website FactCheck.org -- to his opponent, Democratic Sen. Mark Udall's inability to defend his own record.

"This is a political campaign and he is trying to do everything he can to change the subject, to run away," Gardner said.

Gardner also talked about his support for repealing the Affordable Care Act, for making birth control pills available over the counter without a prescription and issues ranging from immigration reform to renewable energy and economic growth during the 22-minute interview, his most extensive of the campaign to date.
