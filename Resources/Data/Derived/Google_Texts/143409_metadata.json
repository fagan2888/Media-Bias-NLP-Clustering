She is serving a 40-year sentence.\n\nAfter Lesyshen shot her son, Asher Lesyshen-Kirlan, during the early morning hours of May 29, 2013, Lesyshen shot herself in the neck area. She was flown to Denver Health Medical Center and underwent medical procedures while being guarded by Routt County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies. Two days after the shooting, Lesyshen officially was arrested, and her expenses then were the county\u2019s responsibility.\n\n\u201cBy statute, we are not responsible until we take her into custody,\u201d Routt County Undersheriff Ray Birch said Tuesday.\n\nThis meant the county did not have to pay for Lesyshen\u2019s air ambulance flight to Denver and the initial surgery.\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office first used their own deputies to constantly guard Lesyshen at Denver Health. This meant the county was paying for deputy salaries, hotel rooms and food. It cost between an estimated $800 and $1,000 per day.\n\nAfter doing a cost-benefit analysis, the county contracted with a security company to guard Lesyshen at a cost of about $580 per day.\n\nIn total, the county spent $66,461 guarding Lesyshen while she was at Denver Health. Medical costs were $108,847.\n\nThe Routt County Jail was not equipped to care for Lesyshen, who was paralyzed and needed constant access to medical attention and rehabilitation services. Between treatments at Denver Health, arrangements were made to have Lesyshen held at the Denver County Jail infirmary at a cost of $586 per day. That total expense ended up being $193,380.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t have any other options,\u201d Birch said.\n\nOther expenses related to Lesyshen\u2019s care were $3,393.\n\nSome costs are harder to account for. Lesyshen\u2019s court hearings were held at the Lindsey-Flanigan Courthouse in Denver, but they were overseen by members of the judicial system in Routt County, which meant law enforcement officials, attorneys and court personnel had to travel to the hearings.\n\nBirch said that weeks before Lesyshen\u2019s planned trial in Routt County, doctors finally cleared Lesyshen to be moved to the Routt County Jail.\n\n\u201cWe discussed it, and we prepared for it,\u201d said Laurie Voit-Perry, a nurse practitioner who works for the Routt County Jail.\n\nAlterations were done at the jail to accommodate Lesyshen, including the installation of a sink and safety bars. Ultimately, Lesyshen accepted the plea deal before being transferred to Routt County for a trial.\n\nRoutt County Jail Lt. Michelle Richardson said they went to great efforts to be fiscally responsible with Lesyshen\u2019s costs, and they monitored the bills closely.\n\n\u201cWe questioned everything,\u201d Richardson said.\n\nThey also looked for savings.\n\nFor example, once the Affordable Care Act went into law, the Sheriff\u2019s Office worked with Lesyshen\u2019s attorney to get her signed up for the health insurance. Voit-Perry said that unlike private health insurance, the Affordable Care Act provides coverage for people who are incarcerated, and it did save the county money.\n\nRoutt County Manager Tom Sullivan said the Lesyshen expenses would require the Routt County Board of Commissioners to approve an emergency supplemental budget by the end of this year.\n\n\u201cI wish we didn\u2019t have to pay for them,\u201d Commissioner Tim Corrigan said Tuesday. \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d\n\nSullivan said the Lesyshen expenses would come out of the county\u2019s cash reserves.\n\n\u201cOur reserves are still healthy,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nCorrigan said that during the Lesyshen case, the Sheriff\u2019s Office regularly would update the commissioners about the case and expenses.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely kept us in the loop,\u201d Corrigan said. \u201cWe were getting updates on a very regular basis about what our obligations were going to be.\u201d\n\nTo reach Matt Stensland, call 970-871-4247, email mstensland@SteamboatToday.com or follow him on Twitter @SBTStensland", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taking care of the paralyzed Routt County woman who killed her 9-year-old son came with a hefty price tag.", "og": {"url": "http://www2.steamboatpilot.com/news/2014/dec/09/caring-convicted-murder-costs-routt-county-267234/", "site_name": "steamboatpilot.com", "type": "article", "description": "Taking care of the paralyzed Routt County woman who killed her 9-year-old son came with a hefty price tag.", "title": "Caring for convicted murderer costs Routt County $267,234"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taking care of the paralyzed Routt County woman who killed her 9-year-old son came with a hefty price tag.", "title": "Caring for convicted murderer costs Routt County $267,234", "site": "@steamboatpilot", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@steamboatpilot"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 days", "slurp": "noydir", "tout": {"article": {"id": 170667}}, "article": {"author": "Matt Stensland"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "googlebot": "all"}, "article_summary": "Routt County taxpayers are on the hook for $267,234 in costs related to caring for Lisa Lesyshen, 47.\nBirch said that weeks before Lesyshen\u2019s planned trial in Routt County, doctors finally cleared Lesyshen to be moved to the Routt County Jail.\nRoutt County Manager Tom Sullivan said the Lesyshen expenses would require the Routt County Board of Commissioners to approve an emergency supplemental budget by the end of this year.\nShe was flown to Denver Health Medical Center and underwent medical procedures while being guarded by Routt County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies.\n\u201cBy statute, we are not responsible until we take her into custody,\u201d Routt County Undersheriff Ray Birch said Tuesday."}
