Pat McCrory was in attendance to support the economic impact of these programs, which will create 100 new positions in the Triad, bring 700 new students to campus and prepare graduates to take on health care roles that are growing in demand in the Triad and across the nation. HPU will be the only university in the Triad with a School of Pharmacy.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing here today is responding to our future needs,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cIf N.C. is going to compete, we need places like High Point University that understand we must prepare for our future instead of reacting to our past. That\u2019s exactly what your leader [President Nido Qubein] has been doing and continues to do. If you stand still, you lose. You\u2019ve got to keep growing and anticipating, and with that, we all win.\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh Point University is a $465 million economic engine for our community,\u201d said High Point Mayor Bill Bencini. \u201cNow they are building medical programs that will attract accomplished students and professors to our community. That\u2019s in addition to the 80,000 annual visitors they bring to our city. We are proud of the commitment they\u2019ve made to our city, and we\u2019re proud to call ourselves the home of HPU.\u201d\n\nThe two academic schools were also officially named the Congdon School of Health Sciences and the Fred Wilson School of Pharmacy in honor of two local families who are supporters of HPU. Earl Congdon is executive chairman of the Old Dominion Freight Line, one of America\u2019s leading transportation logistic companies with 10,000 employees. Wilson is chairman of the board of Piedmont Chemical Industries, Inc. including five companies with plants in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\n\u201cThis is the American dream personified,\u201d Qubein said. \u201cThis is what happens when you believe in the fundamentals and principles that built this country. This day is another page in our history book because when you make the right choices and have God\u2019s grace as your guide and your leader in all you do, good things happen.\u201d\n\nThe schools represent a total investment of $120 million \u2013 the university\u2019s single largest investment. They will be housed in a 220,000-square-foot complex that will include advanced biomedical research facilities, a cadaver lab, standardized client space that will record students\u2019 interactions with patients to allow for critiquing, a medical simulation lab and much more.\n\nThe construction, technology and new equipment alone will have a $90 million, one-time economic impact on the Triad. Once completed, the schools will increase HPU\u2019s annual impact to nearly $500 million (adding $33 million to the current $465 million). The facility is scheduled to be completed in spring 2017.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the future of health care requires more providers across the board to care for the aging baby boomer population and the millions of individuals being introduced to the system through the Affordable Care Act. Programs offered in these schools will prepare students to fill these roles right here in the Triad, throughout the nation and around the world.\n\nAbout the Schools:\n\nThe School of Health Sciences began offering two new programs this year \u2013 a master\u2019s degree in physician assistant studies and a master\u2019s degree in athletic training, in addition to its existing exercise science bachelor\u2019s degree program. It will grow to offer a doctoral degree in physical therapy starting in 2017.\n\nThe School of Pharmacy will offer a six-year PharmD degree and is scheduled to welcome its first class in fall 2016.\n\nJobs in High Demand:\n\nBLS data shows demand for providers in these fields will grow up to 38 percent by 2022 \u2013 much faster than the average for most occupations. HPU will house the only pharmacy school in the Piedmont Triad and fourth in the state of North Carolina. The schools will create a cornerstone for medical innovation at HPU.\n\nBy the Numbers:", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,www.highpoint.edu", "author": "High Point University", "og": {"site_name": "High Point University", "description": "HIGH POINT, N.C., Sept. 9, 2015 \u2013 High Point University broke ground on the $88 million School of Health Sciences and the School of Pharmacy facility today \u2013 a monumental moment in HPU\u2019s 91-year history.\r \r Gov.
