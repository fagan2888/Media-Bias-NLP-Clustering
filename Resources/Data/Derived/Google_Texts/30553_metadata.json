Nikki Haley, R-S.C., requested an investigation following the release of a series of undercover videos depicting Planned Parenthood executives describing the harvesting of fetal organs at the organization\u2019s affiliates.\n\nSpokespersons for Planned Parenthood have denied that they profit from their tissue donation program.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said it issued an Administrative Order of Suspension for a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia due to 21 cited violations of state laws and regulations including:\n\n\u2026 non-compliance with the Woman\u2019s Right to Know Act, incomplete medical and employee records, expired medications, improper infectious waste disposal practices, and failure to report abortions to DHEC Vital Statistics in a timely manner.\n\nThe Greenville clinic was cited for six violations including \u201cnon-compliance with the Woman\u2019s Right to Know Act, incomplete medical record documentation, and improper infectious waste disposal practices.\u201d\n\nAccording to DHEC, the two clinics have until Sept. 28 to correct the violations or face closure.\n\nA third clinic, the Charleston Women\u2019s Medical Center, was cited for four \u201cminor\u201d violations, which DHEC characterized as \u201cdocumentation errors.\u201d The clinic must submit a plan of correction to the agency.\n\nIn a statement provided to Columbia\u2019s WLTX, Jenny Black, the CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, called the investigation \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur health center was inspected less than a year ago and was found to have 100 percent compliance with all state regulations,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe reported administrative and operational issues do not rise to the level of shutting down health centers. We are reviewing all of the issues that were raised in these inspections and will of course comply with all state requests. We are deeply concerned that this investigation is politically motivated and that this political interference could prevent some women from getting high-quality care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One is a Planned Parenthood facility.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One is a Planned Parenthood facility.", "title": "Two of Three Abortion Clinics in South Carolina Suspended", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150914_SouthCarolinaPP_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-14T21:44:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1M71IXS"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One is a Planned Parenthood facility.", "title": "Two of Three Abortion Clinics in South Carolina Suspended", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150914_SouthCarolinaPP_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-09-14T13:27:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T21:44:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, South Carolina, Planned Parenthood videos, Nikki Haley"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1a2\"", "article_summary": "The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control has suspended two of three abortion clinics in the state\u2014including a Planned Parenthood facility\u2014for violating state law, the agency announced Friday.\nSpokespersons for Planned Parenthood have denied that they profit from their tissue donation program.\nNikki Haley, R-S.C., requested an investigation following the release of a series of undercover videos depicting Planned Parenthood executives describing the harvesting of fetal organs at the organization\u2019s affiliates.\nWe are reviewing all of the issues that were raised in these inspections and will of course comply with all state requests.\nWe are deeply concerned that this investigation is politically motivated and that this political interference could prevent some women from getting high-quality care.\u201d"}
