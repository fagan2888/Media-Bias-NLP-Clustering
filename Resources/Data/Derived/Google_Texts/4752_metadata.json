We always have been and always will be.\n\nWe have always depended on each other for help, guidance and really, survival.\n\nThe libertarian notion of the self-made man is largely a myth, and if it is possible, it takes a whole lot of luck - including the luck to be born in the right time, place, and family - that many people simply don't have.\n\nFinally, the Koch brothers-funded curriculum focuses a lot on the libertarian talking point that our government has too much power.\n\nAccording to MacNeal, \"The curriculum constantly questions how much power and authority the federal government should have and subtly asserts that the federal government has gained too much power since 1789.\"\n\nAnd a portion of the curriculum says that, \"It seems that fewer people are making more decisions about the nature of our fundamental rights.\"\n\nBasically, in this section of the curriculum, the Koch brothers are complaining about the rules of the game that protect We the People from the harmful effects of capitalism.\n\nAs you and I both know, industrialists have screwed us over repeatedly throughout history, but that's a little fact that the Koch brothers don't want our schoolchildren to know. Nothing in here about the Pullman Porters, for example.\n\nRegulations are in place to protect us from being screwed over even more.\n\nThe curriculum being taught in North Carolina schools is not history.\n\nIt's not civics.\n\nIt's about whitewashing reality, and turning Gilded Age oligarchs like the Koch brothers into national heroes.\n\nThe ALEC-inspired, Koch brothers-funded North Carolina curriculum represents the Ayn Randification of our education system and our society.\n\nIt's bad enough that the Koch brothers have a stranglehold on our democracy and political system, courtesy of our Supreme Court. We don't need them in our classrooms too.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Truthout sparks action by revealing systemic injustice and providing a platform for transformative ideas through investigative reporting and analysis.", "title": "Is the Koch Brothers' Curriculum Coming to Your Child's School?", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "The Koch brothers are trying to rewrite history.", "title": "Is the Koch Brothers' Curriculum Coming to Your Child's School?", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/27965-is-the-koch-brothers-curriculum-coming-to-your-child-s-school", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2014_12/2014_1211schools.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2014_12/2014_1211schools.jpg", "creator": "@truthout", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Is the Koch Brothers&#039; Curriculum Coming to Your Child&#039;s School?"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "The Daily Take Team", "keywords": "Truthout, truth-out, truth out, independent news, nonprofit news, ad free news, progressive news, investigative reporting, critical analysis, BuzzFlash, headlines, commentary, fracking, Guantanamo, mass incarceration, prisons, new economy, police militarization, climate change", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde85a\"", "article_summary": "The ALEC-inspired, Koch brothers-funded North Carolina curriculum represents the Ayn Randification of our education system and our society.\nIt's bad enough that the Koch brothers have a stranglehold on our democracy and political system, courtesy of our Supreme Court.\nFinally, the Koch brothers-funded curriculum focuses a lot on the libertarian talking point that our government has too much power.\nIt's about whitewashing reality, and turning Gilded Age oligarchs like the Koch brothers into national heroes.\nAnother hunk of the Koch brothers-funded curriculum talks about \"individual responsibility\" - another pillar of a libertarian paradise."}
