(Photo: 2012 Getty Images photo)\n\nThe public conversation about vaccine safety and choice began after Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, shielding drug companies from product liability and doctors from vaccine-injury lawsuits. Under that law, $3 billion has been paid to the vaccine injured while liability-free drug companies enjoy profits from a multibillion dollar market.\n\nU.S. health officials now recommend 69 doses of 16 vaccines for every child. States mandate up to 15 of them \u2014 twice as many as 30 years ago.\n\nOUR VIEW: Vaccine opt-outs put public health at risk\n\nWith 95% of U.S. kindergarteners fully vaccinated and one child in six learning disabled, one in 10 asthmatic and one in 50 living with autism, educated parents and health care professionals are asking legitimate questions about why so many highly vaccinated children are so sick. They're examining vaccine science shortfalls and wondering why Americans are coerced and punished for declining to use every government-recommended vaccine while citizens in Canada, Japan and the European Union are free to make choices.\n\nVaccines carry two risks: a risk of harm and a risk of failure to prevent disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admit that U.S. pertussis outbreaks are not due to a failure to vaccinate but failure of the vaccine to confer long-lasting immunity.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine acknowledges major gaps in scientific knowledge about how and why vaccines cause injury and death and who will be more susceptible to suffering harm. Vaccine risks are not shared equally by all because \"no exceptions\" vaccine mandates discriminate against and penalize those vulnerable to vaccine complications.\n\nPublic health officials and pediatricians are not infallible. What is considered scientific \"truth\" today may not be true tomorrow. When doctors cannot predict who will be harmed by a vaccine and cannot guarantee that those who have been vaccinated won't get infected or transmit infection, the ethical principle of informed consent becomes a civil, human and parental right that must be safeguarded in U.S. law.\n\nNon-medical vaccine exemptions immunize individuals and the community against unsafe, ineffective vaccines and tyranny.\n\nBarbara Loe Fisher is co-founder and president of the non-profit National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC.org).\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1kmnABC", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Vaccines carry two risks: a risk of harm and a risk of failure to prevent disease.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Vaccines carry two risks: a risk of harm and a risk of failure to prevent disease.", "title": "Leave parents free to choose vaccines: Opposing view", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/04/13/vaccine-safety-choice-parenting-editorials-debate/7682095/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vaccines carry two risks: a risk of harm and a risk of failure to prevent disease.", "title": "Leave parents free to choose vaccines: Opposing view", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5839c376d069c3422d67961312aff3f9a4a51ea6/c=300-0-2370-2070&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/13//1397435988000-vaccines.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Children's health", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Children's health", "title": "Leave parents free to choose vaccines: Opposing view", "author": "Barbara Loe Fisher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2717936e432c2430cc67bff3edaef51f16316219/c=1002-0-2556-2070/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/13//1397435988000-vaccines.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ec66a9a17f1279d193bcdc456595837f4835f8e/c=300-0-2370-2070/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/13//1397435988000-vaccines.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7d20bc1646044d94356fea64d9bf74bba4ea6170/c=120-0-2874-2070/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/13//1397435988000-vaccines.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/10b144c7a0cf069cdae3f3af5f4de0d1de9084f8/c=0-198-3000-1890&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/13//1397435988000-vaccines.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-13T21:14:45.083000-04:00", "shorthed": "Let parents choose vaccines: Opposing view", "articleid": 7682095, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/acaa8f15cd3be966970d03837174642cccf9014c/c=0-198-3000-1890/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/13//1397435988000-vaccines.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7200308e6cbf0b4daf2b661deebb0860f0bdb7b0/c=918-0-2076-2070/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/13//1397435988000-vaccines.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "vaccine, anti-vaccine trend, immunization, safety health and wellness, risks, herd immunity, autism"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe117a\"", "article_summary": "Vaccine risks are not shared equally by all because \"no exceptions\" vaccine mandates discriminate against and penalize those vulnerable to vaccine complications.\nVaccines carry two risks: a risk of harm and a risk of failure to prevent disease.\nVaccines potentially could harm the patient as well as fail to prevent disease.\nU.S. health officials now recommend 69 doses of 16 vaccines for every child.\nNon-medical vaccine exemptions immunize individuals and the community against unsafe, ineffective vaccines and tyranny."}
