Middle-skill jobs have actually contracted.\n\n\"The decline in the share of middle-skill jobs has largely been driven by technological advancements and outsourcing of jobs overseas,\" Aleman and Khan explain. \"Middle-skill jobs are classified as those that require some routine set of tasks, while high- and low-skill jobs perform non-routine tasks. Workers in routine professions have been increasingly displaced by the widespread use of computers.\"\n\nSomeone has to make those computers.\n\n\"With the increase in technology, the demand for high-skill workers continues to expand,\" the economists write.\n\nIt may be counterintuitive that low-skill jobs aren't being replaced by robots. But the world just isn't that simple.\n\n\"High-skill jobs are typically those that require some post-secondary education, while low- skill occupations, including food preparation and building and grounds maintenance require face- to-face interaction,\" they add. \"These factors make these functions very difficult to outsource or automate.\"\n\nAmong other things, this has implications for inequality.\n\n\"Occupations that are high-skill are those that have an annual wage greater than $60,000,\" they note. \"The top occupations in this category include management, computer and mathematical, legal, and architecture and engineering. Middle-skill occupations are jobs that bring home an annual median wage of $25,000 to $59,000, while low- skill occupations are jobs with an annual median wage of less than $25,000.\"\n\nRead More at Business Insider:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The labor market is extremely complex and it's constantly evolving.", "title": "Here\u2019s Why the Middle Class Is Being Hollowed Out", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/25/Here-s-Why-Middle-Class-Being-Hollowed-Out", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03062012_Falling_Middle_Class_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/25/Here-s-Why-Middle-Class-Being-Hollowed-Out", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03062012_Falling_Middle_Class_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The labor market is extremely complex and it's constantly evolving.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"The decline in the share of middle-skill jobs has largely been driven by technological advancements and outsourcing of jobs overseas,\" Aleman and Khan explain.\n\"Middle-skill jobs are classified as those that require some routine set of tasks, while high- and low-skill jobs perform non-routine tasks.\nMiddle-skill jobs have actually contracted.\n\"Occupations that are high-skill are those that have an annual wage greater than $60,000,\" they note.\nMiddle-skill occupations are jobs that bring home an annual median wage of $25,000 to $59,000, while low- skill occupations are jobs with an annual median wage of less than $25,000.\""}
