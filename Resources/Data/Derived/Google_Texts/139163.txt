Story highlights A federal judge denied a request by the Obama administration to immediately appeal whether the House of Representatives has the legal right to challenge a provision of the Affordable Care Act

Judge Rosemary Collyer set a briefing schedule with oral arguments occurring sometime after January 18, 2016

Washington (CNN) In a significant win for House Speaker John Boehner and congressional Republicans, a federal judge Monday denied a request by the Obama administration to immediately appeal whether the House of Representatives has the legal right to challenge a provision of the Affordable Care Act.

U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer ruled last month that one part of the challenge could go forward because the House had shown it had the standing necessary to bring the case. Lawyers for the Obama administration -- concerned by what they called an unprecedented ruling on the threshold issue of standing -- sought to appeal Collyer's ruling before her court heard arguments on the underlying merits of the case.

Monday, Collyer said the Obama administration will have to wait. She set a briefing schedule with oral arguments occurring sometime after January 18, 2016.
