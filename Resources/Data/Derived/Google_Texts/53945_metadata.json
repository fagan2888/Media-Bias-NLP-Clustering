It\u2019s complex and fascinating, and engages with questions about the male entitlement to female bodies, and the female gaze challenging the male.\n\nAnd, oh yeah: It\u2019s about a blow job.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t been keeping up with the show: Perpetual wannabe Valerie Cherish has been cast in an HBO show called \u201cSeeing Red.\u201d Good news! Except that \u201cSeeing Red\u201d is an account of Valerie\u2019s time on the sitcom \u201cRoom and Bored\u201d \u2014 and specifically, her run-ins with its chauvinist, bro-y showrunner Paulie G \u2014 created, written and directed by, well, Paulie G. Some parts are fictionalized, barely. Others are told from a completely different point of view. And while Valerie is playing herself \u2014 \u201cMallory\u201d \u2014 schlubby Paulie G is played by movie star Seth Rogen.\n\nIt\u2019s already a situation with complicated dynamics, one where fact and fiction are being confused so much that no one is totally clear about what they\u2019re doing truly means, or really depicts. And when I say \u201cno one,\u201d I mean the producers of the HBO show, the actors involved and even the audience; \u201cThe Comeback\u201d draws everyone into the confusion of trying to adapt a \u201creal\u201d story into \u201cauthentic\u201d television. (I have completely forgotten that Lance Barber\u2019s slimy Paulie G is not a real HBO showrunner more than once while watching this show \u2014 the rest of the show feels so accurate.)\n\nThis lack of distinction between real and not-real is the major tension of the blow job scene. Paulie G writes and directs a scene where his character commands Valerie\u2019s character to get on her knees and perform oral sex. It never happened in real life, Valerie keeps telling everyone; it didn\u2019t even come close to happening in real life. But Paulie G is calling the shots, and Paulie G says it\u2019s happening for \u201cSeeing Red.\u201d\n\nIt is incredibly disturbing. Paulie G has written a scene where a woman he worked with, and is still working with, sexually services him. As is made abundantly clear in \u201cThe Comeback,\u201d Paulie hates Valerie \u2014 outright despises her. \u201cSeeing Red\u201d is a whole show mostly blaming her for his slide into heroin addiction. They\u2019ve spent their entire working relationship at loggerheads, which has now spanned almost a decade. And he\u2019s responding to that intense dislike by choosing to portray her as giving him oral sex \u2014 his way of ultimately humiliating her (which shows a depressing view of both Valerie and sex). Blow jobs aren\u2019t inherently demeaning, but Paulie G intends for it to be demeaning. As he tells Valerie, from behind the camera, when she asks for notes: The entire scene came out of him angrily dismissing her opinions on the last show they worked together on. \u201cWhen you said that shit, I\u2019d think to myself: Blow me. Blow me, Valerie. Blow me.\u201d\n\nSo, let\u2019s recap. Valerie is being forced to act out something she didn\u2019t do for someone who hates her. Every time she tries to elevate it to the level of art \u2014 because she is a performer, after all! \u2014 her boss makes it abundantly clear that the situation is just for her to be humiliated, as a character and a person. It\u2019s justifiable, on some level, because it\u2019s Paulie G\u2019s show \u2014 his vision \u2014 his fantasy, which has gotten a lot of funding from HBO to be made \u201creal.\u201d And it has just enough of a veneer of make-believe \u2014 it\u2019s all a show! None of it is real! \u2014 that it\u2019s allowable.\n\nThe person who ends up interrogating Valerie is the woman behind our camera: her producer Jane, a woman, whose interpretation of \u201cSeeing Red\u201d is the female gaze responding to the male. Her interrogation takes the form of a literal question at the beginning of the episode, when the audience is introduced to the idea: \u201cPaulie G wrote a scene where you blow him?\u201d Valerie brushes her concern off. Actors often have to be out of their comfort zone. \u201cI once played a brunette with migraines,\u201d she says, with no trace of irony.\n\nBut the upcoming scene is clearly bothering her, and as it grows in her consciousness, it grows in the audience\u2019s too; an oncoming train that can\u2019t be stopped. Naturally, as we watch, everything keeps getting worse. Paulie G\u2019s issues with Valerie are front-and-center in every high-pressure situation; at one point, Seth Rogen makes a joke about Paulie, and then has to step in to stop Paulie from taking it out on Valerie, who\u2019s also in the conversation. Rogen is given free rein to liberally riff off his lines, but Valerie is held to every word, meaning that Rogen is essentially shouting more and more colorful abuse at Valerie while she stands there, mute.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This groundbreaking episode deals powerfully with many unspoken tensions about women in the entertainment business", "title": "\u201cThe Comeback\u201d keeps getting better: Tonight\u2019s episode dismantles male privilege in 22 minutes", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "This groundbreaking episode deals powerfully with many unspoken tensions about women in the entertainment business", "title": "\u201cThe Comeback\u201d keeps getting better: Tonight\u2019s episode dismantles male privilege in 22 minutes", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/23/the_comeback_keeps_getting_better_tonights_episode_dismantles_male_privilege_in_22_minutes/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/the_comeback2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This groundbreaking episode deals powerfully with many unspoken tensions about women in the entertainment business", "title": "\u201cThe Comeback\u201d keeps getting better: Tonight\u2019s episode dismantles male privilege in 22 minutes", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/the_comeback2.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, HBO, Lance Barber, Lisa Kudrow, Seth Rogen, The Comeback, TV, Valerie Cherish", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb4d\"", "article_summary": "But Paulie G is calling the shots, and Paulie G says it\u2019s happening for \u201cSeeing Red.\u201dIt is incredibly disturbing.\nPaulie G has written a scene where a woman he worked with, and is still working with, sexually services him.\nAs is made abundantly clear in \u201cThe Comeback,\u201d Paulie hates Valerie \u2014 outright despises her.\nPaulie G writes and directs a scene where his character commands Valerie\u2019s character to get on her knees and perform oral sex.\nAnd while Valerie is playing herself \u2014 \u201cMallory\u201d \u2014 schlubby Paulie G is played by movie star Seth Rogen."}
