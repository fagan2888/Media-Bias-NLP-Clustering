But it could go much higher before the auction ends on August 3.\n\nA high-profile sexual harassment suit has rocked Yahoo, but this time its from an ex-employee who alleges her female boss forced her into sex and fired her when she complained.\n\nEngineer Nan Shi claims that her boss, Maria Zhang, forced her to have sex on multiple occasions. \u201cZhang told Plaintiff she would have a bright future at Yahoo if she had sex with her,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cShe also stated she could take away everything from her including her job, stocks and future, if she did not do what [Zhang] wanted.\u201d\n\nZhang has filed a countersuit, claiming Shi was terminated for doing a bad job.\n\nAs more and more health-care authorities are recommending Truvada for gay men at risk of unsafe sex, the Washington State Department of Health has launched a program that will cover the cost of a prescription.\n\nA month\u2019s supply of Truvada, the most common form of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) can run up to $1,300 per month\u2014but the program will cover the cost whether or not a participant has insurance.\n\n\u201cCost is one of the biggest barriers to PrEP,\u201d said Fred Swanson, executive director of Seattle\u2019s Gay City Health Project. \u201cEven with the Affordable Care Act, people are choosing plans that still require really large co-pays, so when they go to access PrEP, it\u2019s not really plausible for them. We have seen that even people with insurance aren\u2019t able to afford the prescription.\u201d\n\nState health officials hopes to reduce new HIV infections by 25% by 2016. Currently, the program only has 17 participants, mostly gay men.\n\n\u201cIn Washington, we really see PrEP as a new and important tool in the toolbox for HIV prevention,\u201d David Kern, manager of the Department of Health\u2019s Infectious Disease Prevention Section, told Buzzfeed. \u201cIt is a strategy that supports our overarching public health goals and it\u2019s an important part of what we\u2019re doing with resources.\u201d\n\nCosmopolitan magazine\u2019s sex tips are usually the stuff of punchlines, but a recent feature on lesbian sex positions is getting the thumbs up from lady-lovers.\n\n\u201c28 Mind-Blowing Lesbian Sex Positions\u201d gives visual and text instructions on such sapphic TK as Rockin\u2019 Rockette, the Hot Hair Salon and the Lazy Girl\u2019s 69.\n\nWe anxiously await \u201c32 Toe-Curling Sex Positions for Gay Men\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "#ThisIsForTheGaymers", "og": {"site_name": "LOGO News", "description": "#ThisIsForTheGaymers", "title": "Gay PlayStation Auctioned, Washington State Paying For Truvada: Today In Gay", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/today-in-gay-20/07/2014/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:logotv.com:10690628?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "height": 810}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newnownext.com/today-in-gay-20/07/2014/", "image": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:logotv.com:10690628?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "description": "#ThisIsForTheGaymers", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gay PlayStation Auctioned, Washington State Paying For Truvada: Today In Gay"}, "sm4": {"category": "News Articles - Life News", "parent": "mgid:wordpress:siteloc:www.newnownext.com:hp", "pubdate": "2014-07-29 6:39:02 PM +0000", "author": "NewNowNext Staff", "creator": "20D502000002D52000010002D520", "alias": "post", "mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:160104", "type": "post"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:160104"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"admins": "unset", "app_id": "unset"}, "MTVNVevoHelper": {"beacon": "D4F4BE78-454E-44C3-B142-F9D269B9303E"}, "thumbnail": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:newnownext.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tmulq1l-300x177.png?quality=0.8&format=jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac3a\"", "article_summary": "\u201c28 Mind-Blowing Lesbian Sex Positions\u201d gives visual and text instructions on such sapphic TK as Rockin\u2019 Rockette, the Hot Hair Salon and the Lazy Girl\u2019s 69.\nWe anxiously await \u201c32 Toe-Curling Sex Positions for Gay Men\u201d\n\u201cCost is one of the biggest barriers to PrEP,\u201d said Fred Swanson, executive director of Seattle\u2019s Gay City Health Project.\nA special Pride edition of the Playstation 4 console is being auctioned off to raise money for LGBT refugees.\n\u201cFor many young people, playing has become a refuge to escape the taunts in real life,\u201d says a WebHallen spokesperson."}
