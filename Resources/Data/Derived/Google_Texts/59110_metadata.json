This has never been more evident than when you talk to people about Obamacare.\"\n\nObamacare exempts certain classes of people from its requirements, in effect creating separate classes of insurance coverage. \"Governor Quinn and the Democrat legislature created the Illinois Health Insurance exchange,\" Dillard said. \u201cIf they truly believe this is the best health plan for the citizens of Illinois, then they should be willing to be covered under the same health plan.\"\n\nDillard spent the day on Thursday at the ABC7/Daily Herald GOP forum held for the upcoming gubernatorial primary. All four candidates on the Republican side attended and participated, including Dillard. Also attending and participating were Bruce Rauner, Illinois State Treasurer Dan Rutherford and State Senator Bill Brady. The GOP gubernatorial primary that will be held on Tuesday, March 18 and the forum was held in Mount Prospect.\n\nIt was at the first meeting for all four GOP candidates of the year, as Rauner decided at the last-minute to attend as he had first declined this and most other forums.\n\nAccording to Chicago Sun Times reporter Natasha Korecki, both state Sens. Kirk Dillard of Hinsdale and Bill Brady of Bloomington spent the hour and a half forum hurling criticism at frontrunner Bruce Rauner, from accusations he clouted his daughter into a public high school in 2008 to having ties to convicted insider Stuart Levine.\n\nRauner enrolled his daughter into an \"elite\" Chicago Public School, Walter Payton College Prep. His daughter at first was rejected into enrollment at the school because her testing score did not meet the standard necessary. Rauner used his \"influence\" by picking up the phone and calling then Chicago Public School CEO Arne Duncan, as his daughter by passed some 7,000 other candidates for the coveted slot.\n\nRauner also has an \"unanswered question\" about his relationship with Stuart Levine. Rauner brushed off the questions and at one point he frustratingly said, \"It's been a beat-up-Brucey kind of morning\"\n\nGreg Hinz of Crain's Chicago Business uncovered this relationship between Rauner and Levine earlier this year and is still looking for an answer. That was ten months ago and it is likely not going away. The question: \"How can Mr. Rauner be trusted to clean up corrupt Springfield when he won't fully explain how and why Mr. Levine made $25,000 a month trying to get government business for a company owned in part by Mr. Rauner?\"\n\nRauner has had a rough couple of weeks in the campaign, having added another public relations staffer. The Rauner consulting team has been struggling of late in its messaging. Brought on board to the Rauner team yesterday is Lance Trover, a longtime veteran of Illinois politics who most recently has worked for U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL), the state's highest ranking elected Republican reported Greg Hinz of Crain's Chicago Business.\n\n***\n\nSend John Presta an email and your story ideas or suggestions, johnpresta@att.net.\n\n***\n\nSources for story:\n\nChicago Sun Times story by Natasha Korecki\n\nChicago Business - Political fixer Stuart Levine\n\nChicago Sun Times - Natasha Korecki, Stuart Levine star witness\n\nCapitol Fax - Rauner tries to walk it back\n\nChicago Sun Times - Voices - Newly surfaced video\n\nChicago Sun Times - Voices (Rauner video)\n\nCapitol Fax - Rauner kicks in another million bucks\n\nOther related pieces about Bruce Rauner:\n\nBruce Rauner's one unanswered question in the Illinois Republican gubernatorial primary\n\nBruce Rauner campaign in full-blown crisis mode on series of 'minimum wage' snafus\n\nBruce Rauner says he will lower Illinois minimum wage from $8.25 to $7.25 an hour\n\nBruce Rauner promotes charter schools for the rest of us, not good enough for his daughter\n\nBruce Rauner raises $4 million in fourth quarter, but can money buy him love\n\nBruce Rauner is the Mitt Romney of Illinois politics (Part 1)\n\nBruce Rauner is the Mitt Romney of Illinois politics (Part 2)\n\nBruce Rauner is the Mitt Romney of Illinois politics (Part 3)\n\n***\n\nMore Mr Grassroots:\n\nMrGrassroots on Facebook\n\nMrGrassoots on Twitter\n\nMrGrassroots on Allvoices", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "42.065380096436;-87.93537902832", "geo.placename": "Mount Prospect, IL", "description": "State Senator Kirk Dillard (R-Hinsdale) is running for governor of Illinois and he is calling for \"fairness on Obamacare benefits.\" Dillard told the Chicago Ele", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Examiner.com", "description": "Bruce Rauner, a GOP Gubernatorial candidate has flip flopped on his suggestion to lower the minimum wage in the state of Illinois by $1.", "title": "Kirk Dillard calls on Illinois politicians for 'fairness on Obamacare benefits'", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/ea/40/ea409e86b52771a804c2710c8ffc2d85.jpg?itok=jkibl1bv", "video": {"width": 480, "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 401}, "type": "movie"}, "twitter": {"description": "State Senator Kirk Dillard (R-Hinsdale) is running for governor of Illinois and he is calling for \"fairness on Obamacare benefits.\" Dillard told the Chicago Election Examiner in an email yesterday tha", "creator": "@MrGrassroots", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/10/c1/10c177c548c59372bc2041c80f1a8250.jpg?itok=A5FJp7aS", "title": "Kirk Dillard calls on Illinois politicians for 'fairness on Obamacare benefits'", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2014-01-17T04:51:05-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "ICBM": "42.065380096436, -87.93537902832", "keywords": "Elections, Kirk Dillard, Bruce Rauner", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-17T04:51"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "State Senator Kirk Dillard (R-Hinsdale) is running for governor of Illinois and he is calling for \"fairness on Obamacare benefits.\"\nAlso attending and participating were Bruce Rauner, Illinois State Treasurer Dan Rutherford and State Senator Bill Brady.\nThe proposal made by Senator Dillard and fellow State Senator Dave Syverson (R-Rockford) would require state Constitutional Officers and state lawmakers to carry the same standard health insurance benefits that citizens are now required to carry under Obamacare.\nRauner enrolled his daughter into an \"elite\" Chicago Public School, Walter Payton College Prep.\n\"Governor Quinn and the Democrat legislature created the Illinois Health Insurance exchange,\" Dillard said."}
