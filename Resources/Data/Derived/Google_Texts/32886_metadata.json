Closures and consolidations will again set the tone for hospitals in 2014. New York City hospitals need fewer beds\u2014and fewer employees, too.\n\n\n\nThis isn't news to New Yorkers who have witnessed the death of St. Vincent's Hospital and other recent bankruptcies. Hospitals have been struggling with reimbursement cuts for years. But in 2014, a convergence of trends will accelerate consolidations and closings.\n\nReducing hospitalizations\n\nOne trend is the way insurers are paring their network of hospitals and doctors under Obamacare. Low-priced health plans sold on the new insurance exchange are less costly because they offer a limited choice of providers, often only a quarter of the number in more traditional insurance policies. Some hospitals will find their patients steered elsewhere.\n\n\n\nInsurers and companies that pay employee health care costs have -realized they \"don't need a phone book of providers,\" said one hospital executive. \"That is a revolution. Hospital utilization is dropping because the plan benefits are changing.\"\n\n\n\nAnother factor that will drive down hospitalization in 2014 is an ambitious new plan by New York state to cut the rate of avoidable hospitalizations by 25% over five years. That means shifting care from institutional settings to outpatient clinics and other alternatives.\n\n\n\nThe economic payoff will be huge. State officials believe health care spending will fall $500 million annually if the initiative, funded by federal money the state hopes to secure shortly, is successful.\n\n\n\nSince 2003, 17 New York City hospitals have closed. Workers from those institutions were largely absorbed by hospitals expanding their outpatient operations. Hospital employment in the Bronx, where Montefiore Medical Center has built a large network of primary and ambulatory care clinics, rose 1.3% from 2000 to 2012. But health care experts believe that growth is unsustainable, given the new trends.\n\nLayoffs ahead\n\nThe fall in hospital employment may begin in early 2014. Mayor Bill de Blasio may try to keep Brooklyn's money-losing Long Island College Hospital open, but the Cobble Hill facility filed a notice of mass layoffs with the state Department of Labor, specifying that 1,442 employees could lose their jobs between Jan. 21 and Feb. 3.\n\n\n\nLikewise, bankrupt Interfaith Medical Center had been set to fire 1,545 workers late last month until the state promised funding to keep the hospital open through March 7.\n\n\n\nMount Sinai Health System cut 70 positions\u2014a fraction of its 35,000 employees\u2014shortly after its merger with Continuum, but the possibility remains that more consolidation could lie ahead.\n\n\n\nIn November, the hospital outlined in a statement the goal of forming \"an integrated health care system that provides exceptional services to all our patients. Right-sizing our workforce is part of this process.\"\n\nSign Up for Health Pulse Brought to you by Crain's New York Business, Health Pulse is a subscription-only website focused on the business of health care.
