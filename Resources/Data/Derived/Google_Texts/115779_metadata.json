His graduate studies include law at the University of Michigan, literature (concentration in Shakespeare) at Oxford, moral education at Harvard, and a doctorate in economics under the guidance of Hans F. Sennholz, who earned his doctorate under the famed Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises. Hendrickson is a Contributing Editor to St. Croix Review and themoralliberal.com and sits on the Council of Scholars of the Commonwealth Foundation in Pennsylvania. His three most recent books are: Famous But Nameless: \"Lessons and Inspiration from the Bible's Anonymous Characters,\" \"God and Man on Wall Street: The Conscience of Capitalism\" (with Dr. Craig Columbus), and \"Problems with Piketty: The Flaws and Fallacies in 'Capital in the Twenty-First Century.'\"\n\nPeggy Noonan\u2019s weekly column in last Saturday\u2019s Wall Street Journal was entitled, \u201cSocialism Gets a Second Life.\u201d It was about the rising popularity of Bernie Sanders, the self-avowed \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d and what explained his popularity among younger voters.\n\nIt all made sense until near the end of the article, where Noonan wrote: \u201cDo you know what\u2019s old if you\u2019re 25? The free-market capitalist system that drove us into a ditch.\u201d\n\nWhoa, time out! What \u201cfree-market capitalist system\u201d are you referring to, Ms. Noonan? You\u2019ll get no argument from me about the \u201cditch\u201d part. Indeed, we have suffered through a multi-year economic funk that has left many young Americans on the outside looking in. But to write that it was a \u201cfree-market capitalist system\u201d that produced these justly lamented conditions is an egregious error.\n\nOur current economic system is anything but \u201cfree-market capitalist.\u201d Under the last two presidents, annual federal spending ballooned from $1.86 trillion in George W. Bush\u2019s first year in office to $3.75 trillion in the last year \u2014 enough to raise the national debt from $5.7 trillion to $19 trillion today.\n\nThe housing and financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 resulted from political interference with free markets. (A few lowlights: the Federal Reserve held interest rates artificially low; the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and G.W. Bush used regulatory pressure to induce financial institutions to issue mortgages without verifying creditworthiness; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued loads of risky mortgage-backed securities that went bad.)\n\nSince then, we have not embraced freer markets, but instead have increased government intervention and made markets less free.\n\nThe unjust TARP bailout was followed by President Barack Obama\u2019s non-stimulating \u201cstimulus\u201d federal borrowing and spending of additional hundreds of billions of dollars. The Fed essentially suspended the market prices \u2014 interest rates \u2014 that coordinate present with future production with its prolonged zero-interest rate policy. Key industries have been brought further under the control of the federal government \u2014 health care via Obamacare; energy via EPA throttling of coal, Interior Department resistance to drilling for oil on public lands, subsidies for green boondoggles, etc.; the financial industry by Dodd-Frank\u2019s unaccountable Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; the home mortgage industry via the nationalization of Fannie and Freddie; the semi-nationalization of the college loan market.\n\nGovernment regulation continues to increase and now costs Americans nearly $2 trillion per year. The highest taxes in the world on corporate profits drive some companies offshore and contribute to a pervasive anti-business climate that has brought us to the worrisome condition of businesses closing at a faster rate than they are opening, thereby reducing job opportunities. \u201cFree markets\u201d? Not even close.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that progressives resort to Orwellian Newspeak \u2014 calling an economy bludgeoned and weakened by massive government intervention \u201cfree markets\u201d \u2014 as a technique for unfairly discrediting markets and providing false rationalizations for more government control, but when The Wall Street Journal editorial crew lets them get away with it and, even worse, lends credibility to the lie, it\u2019s no wonder that kids don\u2019t know better than to latch on to Bernie Sanders\u2019 utopian socialist nonsense. (Indeed, as TheBlaze recently reported, many Sanders supporters can\u2019t begin to define socialism, but that\u2019s no excuse for our side not defending free-market capitalism from mischaracterizations.)\n\nWe have an uphill challenge ahead of us, but we need to explain to young people that the economy has struggled because President Obama has repeatedly attacked markets and waged economic warfare against the middle class that would have made Karl Marx proud, and that electing Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton would be to partake of more of that economically poisonous brew. If it\u2019s change that young people crave, then try free-market capitalism. That\u2019s the approach we haven\u2019t tried for too long a time.\n\nMark Hendrickson is Fellow for Economic and Social Policy with the Center for Vision & Values at Grove City College.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
