Ron Wyden, struck a decidedly collaborative note during a discussion hosted by RealClearHealth.\n\nJay Khosla, policy director and chief health counsel for the Finance Committee under Hatch, and Elizabeth Jurinka, chief health policy adviser for Wyden on the committee, told an audience near Capitol Hill that a draft bill to improve care and check Medicare spending growth \u201cis the objective\u201d following at least 80 meetings with stakeholders and more than 500 formal comments from interested parties since the spring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping sooner rather than later we can have a discussion draft,\u201d Khosla said during a panel discussion focused on Medicare.\n\nJurinka (pictured, with Carl Cannon and Jay Khosla, right) called the six-month endeavor, which is the brainchild of two seasoned senators determined to probe the complexities and vulnerabilities of chronic care programs and how they impact Medicare, \u201ca huge opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together.\u201d\n\nHatch and Wyden want to know how to improve quality of care for chronic medical conditions, as well as how to curb the growth in Medicare spending as aging baby boomers challenge the existing system. The task is more daunting than it appears because many so-called \u201ccoordinated care\u201d health programs fail to overcome the many physical, financial and mental health hurdles faced by chronically ill elderly patients, according to physicians, health providers and economists.\n\nAccording to federal data, 46 percent of all Medicare spending currently goes to beneficiaries diagnosed with six or more chronic health conditions. A growing population of Americans living with more than one complex condition is a seismic policy challenge. In traditional fee-for-service Medicare, supporting \u201cvolume\u201d of care when it comes to chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer\u2019s transforms an aging America into a fiscal time bomb over the long term. Helping such a significant population of ill Americans at lower federal costs and with better wellness outcomes is the puzzle.\n\nThe political sensitivities associated with altering Medicare, and lessons derived from coordinated care initiatives already encouraged by the Affordable Care Act, are familiar to every lawmaker in Congress and to all the presidential candidates vying to succeed President Obama.\n\nWhat has been gingerly percolating as a bipartisan policy exploration aimed at delivering care differently -- evolving within the collegial confines of the Finance Committee -- could easily become a political pi\u00f1ata as soon as a draft bill moves into the sunshine.\n\nFor that reason, Khosla and Jurinka offered scant clues about potential policy fixes their respective bosses may propose at the end of their information-gathering exercises.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that if we kind of build it the right way, we\u2019ll have the right outcome,\u201d Khosla said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a partisan issue,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a cost issue. It\u2019s a health care issue.\u201d\n\nHe said Washington\u2019s policy controversies often burn hottest over \u201chow you pay for things.\u201d For that reason, he said Hatch believes \u201cthe whole idea of making chronic care better is not for us to spend more money, but how to make sure things are running more efficiently and you\u2019re realizing savings from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a bill to be a Christmas tree,\u201d Khosla continued.\n\nJurinka said the committee is mindful of the requirement that the Congressional Budget Office must estimate the federal savings and costs inherent in any proposed or enacted legislation. To do that, CBO needs reliable data, not hypotheses.\n\n\u201cIf there is just more care, that will be a challenge,\u201d she said, pointing to CBO\u2019s requirement to \u201cscore\u201d the ramifications of proposed legislation on the nation\u2019s fiscal trajectory.\n\nMedicare, the federal health program that benefits 55 million people, consumes 14 percent of the nation\u2019s total budget. Average annual growth in total Medicare spending was 4.1 percent from 2010 to 2014, compared with 9 percent between 2000 and 2010. The slower climb in spending was realized despite a larger population of Medicare beneficiaries and rising health care costs elsewhere during the same period.\n\n\u201cIt puts the onus on the member offices and the stakeholder groups to say, `Yes, we know that this is evidence-based and will be better for patients,\u2019 and at the end of the day, that\u2019s what we\u2019re really hoping for,\u201d Jurinka said of the Senate process to date.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America\u2019s rapidly aging population and the projected costs of millions of people struggling with multiple chronic illnesses may spawn bipartisan legislation \u201csooner rather than...", "title": "Senate Panel May Have Draft Medicare Bill Soon | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/11/06/senate_panel_may_have_draft_medicare_bill_soon.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/329075_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "America\u2019s rapidly aging population and the projected costs of millions of people struggling with multiple chronic illnesses may spawn bipartisan legislation \u201csooner rather than...", "title": "Senate Panel May Have Draft Medicare Bill Soon | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Senate Panel May Have Draft Medicare Bill Soon | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "aging,spending,Medicare,Congressional Budget Office,Senate Finance Committee,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "Average annual growth in total Medicare spending was 4.1 percent from 2010 to 2014, compared with 9 percent between 2000 and 2010.\nAccording to federal data, 46 percent of all Medicare spending currently goes to beneficiaries diagnosed with six or more chronic health conditions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping sooner rather than later we can have a discussion draft,\u201d Khosla said during a panel discussion focused on Medicare.\nThe slower climb in spending was realized despite a larger population of Medicare beneficiaries and rising health care costs elsewhere during the same period.\nMedicare, the federal health program that benefits 55 million people, consumes 14 percent of the nation\u2019s total budget."}
