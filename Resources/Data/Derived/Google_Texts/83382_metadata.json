Nine months ago, I found myself at a Hunger Games-themed party thrown by Tea Party Patriots during the middle of CPAC. A ballroom of the titanic Gaylord National Resort\u2014part of a waterfront faux-city built by D.C. suburban wealth and the promise of legalized gambling\u2014was taken over by people dressed as Effie Trinket and Seneca Crane.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEverybody got the joke. Washington, right across the river, was a perfect analogue to the decadent Capitol in the Suzanne Collins books. \u201cWhile the elites in D.C. prosper and play political theatre, the people of the country live in a reality that is the result of the long-term madness they have created,\u201d wrote Tea Party Patriots co-founder Mark Meckler in the run-up to the party. \u201cOut here in the provinces, things aren\u2019t going so well.\u201d\n\nMeckler was fairly late to join the textual analysis party. At least since the publication of the final book, and definitely since the first Hunger Games film was released, readers have debated the allegory of impoverished Districts against the Capitol. Is it a Tea Party parable? Is it a Marxist fantasy of the proletariat\u2019s final battle?\n\nIn 2013, either theory would do. Americans are rarely in love with our government, but rarely have we despised it like we do right now. A December 5-8 Gallup poll found that 72 percent of us consider \u201cbig government\u201d the greatest threat, the highest in 48 years of polling. Even 56 percent of Democrats were on board with the panic. Only 21 percent of those asked were afraid of \u201cbig business,\u201d the lowest number in 30 years.\n\nSo far this hasn\u2019t put a damper on the CEO bodyguard industry, but it\u2019s given us a new class of black hats in the movies. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is on track to be the year\u2019s biggest-grossing film, overtaking Iron Man 3. The superhero trilogy had been about a capitalist who breaks away from the government defense-contracting racket. That was dropped in round three. It was up to Olympus Has Fallen, the more somber and ridiculous of this year\u2019s two assault-on-the-White House movies, to make a villain out of a Secret Service agent who\u2019d become a\u2014shudder\u2014private contractor. Back in the Iron Man series, the new danger was a jealous madman who can create dangerous super-powers at his think tank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHis plan nearly succeeds\u2014partly because the government commandeers a spare Iron Man suit, gives it to a fairly competent soldier, and then blunders into traps and ruses that let it fall into the hands of terrorists. And they\u2019re abetted by a corrupt vice president. (I\u2019m arguably spoiling a twist here, but the movie makes a common mistake by casting Miguel Ferrer, a character actor who only ever plays weasely villains, as the veep.)\n\nIt was like this all over the blockbuster and near-blockbuster charts. In Star Trek: Into Darkness, every threat emanated from a violent government official or botched government project, all in order to fool the people of Earth into militarizing Starfleet. Pacific Rim and World War Z were lessons in how risk-averse, paranoid bureaucrats can ruin everything. In each film, leaders too scared to actually \u201ccancel the apocalypse\u201d build massive walls meant to hold it off.\n\nDoes that work? Of course it doesn\u2019t work. Plunging recklessly into suicide missions, avoiding the orders from above\u2014that\u2019s what works. World War Z gave us the added agita of callous soldiers kicking the family of a lost hero off a safe cruiser and into a refugee camp, even though the hope of mankind had been tethered to his quest, and the deal was that his family would be protected. Government: Is there anything it can\u2019t screw up?\n\nApparently, nope! At the art house, Dallas Buyers Club presented the most meddlesome and accidentally murderous federal bureaucrats since that EPA agent from Ghostbusters. Ron Woodroof, given unforgettable gangly life by Matthew McConaughey, becomes an outlaw smuggling drugs from Mexico and Japan and gets collared by an FDA that\u2019s in the pocket of big pharma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat really makes the FDA plotline click is the casting. The vindictive FDA agent, McConaughey\u2019s Javert, is played by Michael O\u2019Neill. Google his name: You\u2019ll find a character actor most recognizable from his years as a Secret Service agent on The West Wing. Watching O\u2019Neill try his damnedest to kill AIDS patients, I kept thinking of T.A. Frank\u2019s essay about the \u201chate-watching\u201d that Washington was now providing Americans in a whole slew of shows: Scandal, Veep, House of Cards, Alpha House. Frank compared them to Aaron Sorkin\u2019s show, which \u201cmade public policy fashionable,\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t hate Washington,\u201d and surmised that this was a unique quirk of the 1990s golden age that we didn\u2019t appreciate until it ended.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to it. The West Wing portrayed a Democratic president at merry war with a Republican Congress and conservative country. President Jed Bartlett gave amazing speeches, but never notched up any big domestic policy wins. He won a shutdown and got an assault weapons ban passed, but\u2014and hey, no offense\u2014so did Bill Clinton.\n\nThe government has tried to do much more since then. It\u2019s lurched into two wars that went worse than promised, it\u2019s built a surveillance network we\u2019re not allowed to know about, and it passed that 100-year dream of liberalism, the Affordable Care Act. That hasn\u2019t launched well, either. At the moment, more people put this on the government\u2014what a surprise, blowing it again\u2014than on any complications with the private sector. The insurance industry, which was reliably loathed for years, is not being blamed for higher premiums or canceled plans. Government regulators are. They can\u2019t even run a website!\n\nBut they can get rich. Articles about the unexpected affluenza of D.C. have popped up and gone viral several times this year. A city previously known for Marion Barry\u2019s security tape and a horrifying murder rate is now hated for its success, which seems unrelated to performance. The movies are following along. In Catching Fire, the champions of District 12 head to an opulent party at the presidential mansion and have more than enough to eat. One of the perfumed handlers offers a pink, bubbly beverage that will let them purge and gorge again.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "From Star Trek to\u00a0Catching Fire, Hollywood Went Anti-Government in 2013", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "Being surrounded by conservative activists in fanciful Panem make-up is the sort of memory that sticks with you.
