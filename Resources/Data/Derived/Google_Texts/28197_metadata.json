The progressive activists are modeling themselves after the \u201cMoral Monday\u201d movement in the neighboring North Carolina, calling their protests \u201cTruthful Tuesdays.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruthful Tuesdays\u201d began in January, when South Carolina\u2019s new legislative session began. Like the protests in North Carolina, which sprung up in response to a wide range of attacks perpetrated by the GOP-controlled legislature, Truthful Tuesdays has a broad progressive agenda. Activists are focused on voting rights, public education funding, and Medicaid expansion.\n\nThis Tuesday, protesters assembled at the entrance to the South Carolina State House garage. They held signs proclaiming \u201cExpand Medicaid,\u201d\n\n\u201cMorality is not Partisan,\u201d and \u201cSHAME.\u201d Eleven individuals took steps forward to block cars from entering the garage, which is what prompted their arrest. They\u2019ve been charged with misdemeanors, and their court date is set for later this month.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) has refused to accept generous federal funds to extend Medicaid coverage to additional low-income people in her state, despite the fact that the expansion of the public insurance program is a central tenet of the health reform law. The fight over Medicaid expansion has been drawn on mostly partisan lines, as Republican lawmakers continue to dig in their heels against Obamacare.\n\nBut there are steep consequences to rejecting the expansion. States are losing out on billions of dollars in federal funding, and about 5.8 million impoverished Americans are being left without any access to affordable insurance. Researchers from Harvard recently estimated that as many as 17,000 people will die directly as a result of their states refusing to expand Medicaid. The states that won\u2019t expand Medicaid are compromising their residents\u2019 access to everything from HIV treatment to mental health care.\n\nBrett Bursey, the director of the South Carolina Progressive Network, believes that this act of civil disobedience was necessary to draw attention to the dire stakes. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to educate enough people in the state as to just the insensitive cruelty of these politicians turning down our own tax money, $1.4 billion this year,\u201d Bursey told the Post and the Courier. \u201cThey are killing our neighbors and somebody has to stand up.\u201d\n\nOne of the protesters who was arrested, an engineering student named Shawn Crowe, is a self-described \u201clife-long Republican.\u201d But he said that the GOP is making health care into a partisan issue, and pushing for the Medicaid expansion is \u201cthe human thing to do.\u201d Another one of the demonstrators was a retired United Methodist pastor, and was handcuffed while wearing his clerical collar.\n\nBursey says there will be more \u201cTruthful Tuesday\u201d protests in the future. A similar effort is also getting off the ground in Georgia. People of faith, community leaders, and social justice leaders from several Southeastern states have been partnering with the activists who spearheaded North Carolina\u2019s protests to expand the grassroots strategy.\n\nAnd even outside of the \u201cMoral Monday\u201d movement, Americans across the country are protesting their lawmakers\u2019 decision to reject Medicaid expansion. This type of activism is particularly well-organized in areas like Texas, where forthcoming gubernatorial races are turning Medicaid into an election issue. Pennsylvania activists have also staged their own creative demonstrations, and one man recently confronted Gov. Tom Corbett (R-PA) to ask him how many more people have to die before he agrees to expand the public insurance program.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Progressive activists are expanding the Moral Monday movement to pressure Southeastern states to expand Medicaid.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Progressive activists are expanding the Moral Monday movement to pressure Southeastern states to expand Medicaid.", "title": "\u2018Truthful Tuesday\u2019 Protesters Arrested In South Carolina After Demanding Medicaid Expansion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/06/3369511/truthful-tuesday-medicaid-protests/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/truthful-tuesday.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Progressive activists are expanding the Moral Monday movement to pressure Southeastern states to expand Medicaid.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/truthful-tuesday-321x214.jpg", "title": "\u2018Truthful Tuesday\u2019 Protesters Arrested In South Carolina After Demanding Medicaid Expansion", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/truthful-tuesday.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/truthful-tuesday.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-06T10:40:44+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e32\"", "article_summary": "Health \u2018Truthful Tuesday\u2019 Protesters Arrested In South Carolina After Demanding Medicaid Expansion CREDIT: AP Photo/Jeffrey Collins Truthful Tuesday protesters demonstrating against South Carolina's decision not to expand MedicaidEleven South Carolina residents were arrested this week after participating in an act of civil disobedience against their state\u2019s rejection of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nAnd even outside of the \u201cMoral Monday\u201d movement, Americans across the country are protesting their lawmakers\u2019 decision to reject Medicaid expansion.\nActivists are focused on voting rights, public education funding, and Medicaid expansion.\nThe fight over Medicaid expansion has been drawn on mostly partisan lines, as Republican lawmakers continue to dig in their heels against Obamacare.\nThis Tuesday, protesters assembled at the entrance to the South Carolina State House garage."}
