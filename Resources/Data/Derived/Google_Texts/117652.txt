Unskilled workers in America have seen their wages drop so low in recent decades that they often can't provide adequately for their children. They are playing by the rules, but still losing the game.

But they have one thing going for them: Obamacare.

Since the law took effect just over two years ago, 20 million people have gotten insurance coverage, according to data from the White House. And a fresh study from the New York Times shows us who these people are.

You see them every day. They are the cashiers, the janitors, the dishwashers, the hairdressers and the maids who change the sheets in hotel rooms. Hispanics, who have the lowest rates of coverage, made huge gains, as did legal immigrants.

All this points to the core challenge facing Republicans who want to repeal Obamacare. Would they throw these 20 million people back into the emergency rooms, where their coverage could drive them into debt or bankruptcy?

Would they allow insurers to begin dropping people with a history of diabetes, cancer and other pre-existing conditions? Would they retract the Medicaid expansion and let states worry about all this? (New Jersey is savings $150 million this year in reduced charity care payments to hospitals, thanks to Obamacare.)

Republicans have no realistic plan for these people, as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) acknowledged a few months ago. In 19 states Republican governors even turned down money to expand Medicaid coverage for low-income families. Could they make their priorities any more clear?

Obamacare needs to be expanded, not repealed. Republicans are sounding the bugle call even as their horses are facing precisely the wrong direction.
