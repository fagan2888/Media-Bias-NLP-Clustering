He's gone so far as to call the Koch brothers' actions \"un-American\" and accused Republicans of being \"addicted to Koch.\"\n\nStill, Tuesday's speech -- or rant -- had a certain edge. Perhaps it's because the Koch brothers are now funding an organization in Nevada to run ads targeting Reid himself, though he refuted such a suggestion. \"There have been times in my life I've been a little afraid,\" Reid said of the venture. \"But I'm not afraid of them.\"\n\nMaybe Reid was just taking a certain delight in the morning's news that a reported 7 million Americans have chosen health plans through the Obamacare exchanges. Or maybe he was trying to pre-frame the House GOP budget -- which he called a \"Koch budget\" -- that was being unveiled shortly after he finished speaking. Either way, a certain gleeful antagonism was apparent throughout his speech. The Huffington Post broke down the transcript below:\n\nThe various ways Reid described the Koch brothers:\n\n\"Moguls\" (twice)\n\n\"Oil barons\" (three times)\n\nThe various ways Reid described the Koch brothers' political network:\n\n\"Puppet organizations\"\n\n\"Kochtopia\" (twice)\n\nThe various ways Reid described the Koch brothers' actions:\n\n\"unscrupulous acts\"\n\n\"false, misleading, fear-mongering ways\"\n\n\"everything they do is so selfish, so self-centered\"\n\n\"the gall of these two brothers is staggering\"\n\n\"brainwash\"\n\n\"Attempt[ing] to rig democracy and hand it over to a couple of power-hungry tycoons\"\n\nKeep in mind, this all happened in less than 10 minutes and Reid is a bit of a slow talker.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Harry Reid Harry Reid\n\n1 of 25 Harry Reid WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 11: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), speaks to reporters after attending the weekly Democrat policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on March 11, 2014 in Washington, DC.
