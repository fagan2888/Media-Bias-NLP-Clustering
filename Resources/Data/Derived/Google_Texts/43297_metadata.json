That\u2019s up from less than a third in 2008, the survey said.\n\nThe increased focus on seeking alternatives to institutional care comes as the United States undergoes a dramatic demographic shift toward an older population. One response has been the rise of grass-roots efforts to create supportive communities, such as \u201cvillages,\u201d designed to meet the daily needs of older people.\n\nThe survey of 618 agencies also found that their role has expanded to meet the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s goal of reducing the nation\u2019s medical expenses by minimizing repeat hospital admissions. The survey, which was released Wednesday, suggests that the agencies have become key players in the ACA\u2019s Care Transitions Program, which is designed to reduce costs by improving follow-up care for Medicare beneficiaries after their discharge from the hospital.\n\nLocal aging agencies, increasingly in partnership with private health-care companies and managed-care providers, now devote more efforts to ensuring that those patients remain healthy after returning home. Their intervention might be as simple as inspecting the homes of people who have been hospitalized for repeated falls to remove hazards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing hospital readmissions being of high priority,\u201d said Mary Kaschak, a senior program manager at the association who led the survey. \u201cOne, it\u2019s a huge expense. And two, consumers and patients don\u2019t want to go into the hospital continuously. So what Area Agencies on Aging are doing is providing that support at home.\u201d\n\nThe survey also found that the agencies now serve a broader population than ever, including offering services for veterans and people under 60 who are disabled or chronically ill.\n\nArea Agencies on Aging are part of a nationwide network of providers set up by the Older Americans Act, a landmark law enacted in 1965 to provide financing for a range of services for the elderly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The focus on alternatives to institutional care comes amid rapid growth of the U.S. elderly population.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/freddy.kunkle", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The focus on alternatives to institutional care comes amid rapid growth of the U.S. elderly population.", "title": "Efforts to enable Americans to age in place are expanding, survey shows", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/efforts-to-enable-americans-to-age-in-place-are-expanding-survey-shows/2014/11/01/43b11326-6153-11e4-91f7-5d89b5e8c251_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@KunkleFredrick"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/efforts-to-enable-americans-to-age-in-place-are-expanding-survey-shows/2014/11/01/43b11326-6153-11e4-91f7-5d89b5e8c251_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health elderly aging Affordable Care Act hospiital readmissions Medicare Obamacare Older Americans Act village Area Agencies on Aging National Association of Area Agencies on Aging", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/freddy.kunkle"}, "eomportal-uuid": "43b11326-6153-11e4-91f7-5d89b5e8c251", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health elderly aging Affordable Care Act hospiital readmissions Medicare Obamacare Older Americans Act village Area Agencies on Aging National Association of Area Agencies on Aging"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb60\"", "article_summary": "Local aging agencies, increasingly in partnership with private health-care companies and managed-care providers, now devote more efforts to ensuring that those patients remain healthy after returning home.\nA new survey of hundreds of federally sponsored local agencies that assist aging Americans has found increased efforts to help the elderly remain in their homes as they grow older, a policy known as aging in place.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing hospital readmissions being of high priority,\u201d said Mary Kaschak, a senior program manager at the association who led the survey.\nOne response has been the rise of grass-roots efforts to create supportive communities, such as \u201cvillages,\u201d designed to meet the daily needs of older people.\nThe increased focus on seeking alternatives to institutional care comes as the United States undergoes a dramatic demographic shift toward an older population."}
