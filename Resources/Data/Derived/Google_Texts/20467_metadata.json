While the team neither dressed in pads nor hit \u2014 per guidelines in the collective-bargaining agreement \u2014 coach John Fox detected a heightened sense of intensity on the field compared to the opening day of camp Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting more competitive, and you like to see that,\u201d said Fox. \u201cWe\u2019ll start back in pads (Saturday). We haven\u2019t been in pads since February.\n\n\u201cOverall, that\u2019s ultimately how you play the game. Those evaluations become a little more important. In my experience, it really holds true in your \u2018fronts\u2019 \u2014 both offensively and defensively. We get out of the \u2018underwear\u2019 \u2014 we\u2019ve been in that since the offseason. It\u2019s always an exciting time.\u201d\n\nFox was asked about the progress of star linebacker Von Miller, whose season last year started with a six-game suspension and ended with a knee injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave that in medical people\u2019s hands,\u201d said Fox. \u201cI know he\u2019s a superb athlete \u2026 in my experience, they tend to heal pretty quickly. He\u2019s worked very, very hard \u2014 maybe harder than he\u2019s worked in his football career. All that work he\u2019s put into it sure will pay dividends.\u201d\n\nHas Miller progressed enough to land a cameo in the preseason?\n\n\u201cThat might be ideal,\u201d Fox said of the fourth-year, pass-rushing specialist, who sported a knee brace on his right knee during practice Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ll just adjust to what we get. We won\u2019t hurry it. We won\u2019t rush it. We\u2019ll be smart with it. So far, it\u2019s gone on schedule.\u201d\n\nAs for the offense, quarterbacks Peyton Manning, Brock Osweiler and Zac Dysert each saw a chance Friday to run the offense in full-speed, no-hitting drills.\n\nAs for the backup Osweiler, who also got the chance to holler out an \u201cOmaha\u201d during the scrimmage, Fox said:\n\n\u201cHe had a couple good stretches and series (Friday). I think he\u2019s definitely grown a lot since his rookie year. We\u2019ll get a chance to see how he does under pressure in game situations through the preseason.\u201d\n\nThe next practice \u2014 Day 3 of training camp \u2014 is twofold Saturday, and it will be the first practice during training camp in full pads. There is a morning practice slated for 8:50-11:30 a.m. In the evening, the Broncos will conduct the second of eight walkthroughs during training camp from 5:30-6:30 p.m.\n\nBecause of construction here at the team\u2019s Dove Valley headquarters, practices are not open to the general public \u2014 with the exception of three open practices at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nThe first of that trio of open practices at Mile High is Sunday from 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m. Each stadium practice is free and open to the public and includes free parking. Gates to the stadium Sunday will open to the public at 10:30 a.m.; parking lots will open at 8 a.m.\n\nThe other two open practices at Mile High: Wednesday and next Saturday, Aug. 2. The practice on Aug. 2 will be the Broncos\u2019 fourth annual \u201cSummer Scrimmage.\u201d\n\nWatch: Recap of Denver Broncos training camp Day 2\n\nOn if it\u2019s strange not having fans at practice, Fox said: \u201cIt is. As I mentioned (Wednesday), our guys are probably more disappointed about it than anybody, maybe even the fans.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got three opportunities to go down to Sports Authority. We\u2019ll miss them, but we have to deal with it. It\u2019s a safety issue here with the construction. We look forward to getting them back out here next year.\u201d\n\nOnce the Dove Valley renovation project is complete, the fan experience for training camp will see improvements in parking, viewing and rest rooms.\n\n\u201cThe improvements made to our facility will be spectacular and significantly enhance the fan experience for training camps at Dove Valley for years to come,\u201d said Broncos president and CEO Joe Ellis in a statement last spring.\n\nBryan Boyle: 303-954-1311, bboyle@denverpost.com or twitter.com/boyle", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "John Fox eager to see full pads after Broncos\u2019 first two days of camp", "title": "John Fox eager to see full pads after Broncos\u2019 first two days of camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/25/john-fox-eager-to-see-full-pads-after-broncos-first-two-days-of-camp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__broncos-camp-fox-manning-072514wpp1.jpg", "height": 523}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__broncos-camp-fox-manning-072514wpp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-25T13:51:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:00:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca965\"", "article_summary": "The practice on Aug. 2 will be the Broncos\u2019 fourth annual \u201cSummer Scrimmage.\u201dWatch: Recap of Denver Broncos training camp Day 2On if it\u2019s strange not having fans at practice, Fox said: \u201cIt is.\nThe second day of Broncos training camp got underway Friday, and along with the temperatures (upper 80s) rose the competitive nature of practice at Dove Valley.\nThe other two open practices at Mile High: Wednesday and next Saturday, Aug. 2.\nWe\u2019ll get a chance to see how he does under pressure in game situations through the preseason.\u201dThe next practice \u2014 Day 3 of training camp \u2014 is twofold Saturday, and it will be the first practice during training camp in full pads.\nWe look forward to getting them back out here next year.\u201dOnce the Dove Valley renovation project is complete, the fan experience for training camp will see improvements in parking, viewing and rest rooms."}
