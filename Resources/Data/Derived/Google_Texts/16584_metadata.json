On the heels of a debate performance in which he seemed defensive and argumentative toward the moderators and refused to rule out a third-party candidacy, Trump was interviewed by CNN\u2019s Don Lemon late Friday evening.\n\nRelated: Some in GOP Prepare to Dump Trump to Save the Party\n\nAmong other things, Trump criticized moderator Megyn Kelly of Fox News for what he claimed was especially aggressive questioning aimed at him in particular. Trying to illustrate how angry he perceived Kelly to be, Trump said, \u201cyou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her\u2026wherever.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics immediately leapt on the comment, claiming that he insinuated that Kelly was menstruating at the time of the debate and might have been overly emotional or reactive. Trump claimed he had meant no such thing, saying he had simply let the thought trail off without finishing it and would have said \u201cnose\u201d or \u201cears\u201d if he had thought it was important to finish the sentence.\n\nOn Saturday, though, Trump\u2019s protestations were buried under an avalanche of scorn from both the right and the left. Prominent conservative pundit Erick Erickson made a very public show of disinviting Trump from an event his Red State organization was holding over the weekend. Many noted the irony of Erickson, whose own history of making remarkably misogynistic comments is long and well documented, turning himself into the GOP\u2019s new arbiter of acceptable speech.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign put out a rambling press release that explained his version of events, called Erickson \u201ca total loser,\u201d and added that \u201conly a deviant\u201d would think Trump had been referring to Kelly\u2019s menstrual cycle.\n\nRelated: Trump \u2013 What Doesn\u2019t Kill Him Makes Him Stronger\n\nHowever, the dust-up dominated political news all day Saturday and was capped off by the revelation later in the day that Trump adviser and former Richard Nixon dirty-tricks specialist Roger Stone had left the campaign. (Trump said Stone was fired; Stone said he had quit.)\n\nThe next morning, Trump was unbowed. He did phone interviews with four out of the five major Sunday shows \u2013 notably absent in the lineup was Fox \u2013 and adamantly refused to apologize. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to apologize for,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press. \u201cWhat I said was totally appropriate.\u201d When informed of criticism, including some from his fellow Republican candidates including former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, he responded in typical Trump fashion.\n\nRelated: How Will the GOP Grow the Economy? The Candidates Weigh In\n\n\u201cCarly Fiorina? Give me a break. She\u2019s got zero chance.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, as he did after insulting Mexicans in his campaign launch speech, he repeatedly pointed out what he described as a strong history of helping women and made vague promises about how he would make things even better going forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do things for women that no other candidate will be able to do,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a great relationship with the women,\u201d he bragged to ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos.\n\nHe was even more expansive in talking to John Dickerson on Face the Nation.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Debate Performance Should Kill His Candidacy\u2026but Won\u2019t\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much into the whole thing of helping people and helping women,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be phenomenal to the women\u2026. I am going to be very much up on the whole issue of women\u2019s health. It\u2019s very important. To me it\u2019s vital.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on it went, on show after show. When interviewers agreed to set aside the specific Kelly controversy and ask about Trump\u2019s tone in general, and his reflexive need to personally attack any and all critics he vacillated between complaints about political correctness and outright falsehood.\n\n\u201cThis political correctness is just absolutely killing us as a country,\u201d he complained to Todd. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything. Anything you say today they\u2019ll find a reason it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fiorina Trumps Six other Candidates in the \u2018Happy Hour\u2019 Debate\n\nTodd pointed out that when someone criticizes Trump, \u201cyou go after them\u201d adding that he often tries to \u201cfind something in their physical appearance\u201d to mock or belittle.\n\n\u201cChuck, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Trump.\n\nI hear that sleepy eyes @chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press? I can't imagine what is taking so long! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2015\n\nTrump may live in his own reality, but as Todd would reveal later in the show, part of that alternate universe appears to be bleeding into our own. No major polls have been released since the GOP debate on Thursday, but on Sunday Todd unveiled an online poll sponsored by NBC that was taken over the two days following the debate, meaning the Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe result: Trump remains the leading Republican in the field, with 23 percent of the vote. His nearest rival in the post-debate poll trailed by 10 points.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After two days of withering criticism over his treatment of women, billionaire and Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump called in to four out of five Sunday talk show, denying that he had done anything wrong and promising that as president, \u201cI will be phenomenal to the women.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s Campaign, Leaking Oil, Rumbles Onward", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/09/Trump-s-Campaign-Leaking-Oil-Rumbles-Onward", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08092015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/09/Trump-s-Campaign-Leaking-Oil-Rumbles-Onward", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08092015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "After two days of withering criticism over his treatment of women, billionaire and Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump called in to four out of five Sunday talk show, denying that he had done anything wrong and promising that as president, \u201cI will be phenomenal to the women.\u201d", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: Trump\u2019s Debate Performance Should Kill His Candidacy\u2026but Won\u2019t\u201cI\u2019m very much into the whole thing of helping people and helping women,\u201d he said.\nTrump\u2019s campaign put out a rambling press release that explained his version of events, called Erickson \u201ca total loser,\u201d and added that \u201conly a deviant\u201d would think Trump had been referring to Kelly\u2019s menstrual cycle.\nOn Saturday, though, Trump\u2019s protestations were buried under an avalanche of scorn from both the right and the left.\nSaturday was probably the worst day the Trump campaign has experienced since the real estate billionaire and former reality television star announced in June that he would seek the Republican nomination for president.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do things for women that no other candidate will be able to do,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper."}
