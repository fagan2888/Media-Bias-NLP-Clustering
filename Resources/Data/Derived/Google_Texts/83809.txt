Moody County, SD

The high temperature has caused the concrete to buckle on Interstate 29 about a mile and a half south of the Trent exit.

The South Dakota Highway Patrol says that the concrete has buckled completely across the interstate going northbound. The rebar has been exposed in certain areas. Around six or seven vehicle received flat tires as a result.

Traffic is moving slowly and the Highway Patrol asks that those driving be cautious and drive slowly when in the area.

There is a crew on the way to repair the concrete and the Highway Patrol expects the Interstate to be repaired in the next few hours.
