Requiring manufacturer discounts to close the coverage gap for biosimilars, consistent with current law for branded drugs. This option would reduce federal spending by $800 million over 10 years, while increasing manufacturer costs.\n\n2. Creating a biosimilar tier that would reduce beneficiary costs for the biosimilar below that of the reference product. This would increase federal spending by $300 million over 10 years as a result of higher costs to the Part D benefit.\n\nRelated: 5 reasons to be concerned over proposed Medicare rule on biosimilar coding\n\n\u201cBased on Avalere\u2019s analysis, both options could increase use of biosimilars and would decrease consumer costs,\u201d the report said. \u201cPolicymakers should explore options to share the financial benefit of increased use of biosimilars for the government with consumers.\u201d\n\nAvalere included 6 reference products in its model, which account for the drugs with the highest spending in Medicare Part D that are likely to have biosimilars in the next 10 years. The analysis also assumed that biosimilars will have a list price of 25% below the price of the reference product, based on the current average cost per patient. The model does not account for discounts or rebates on either the reference product or the biosimilars.\n\nRead more: [BLOG]: 5 things you need to know about biosimilars", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Surprisingly, Medicare beneficiaries are likely to pay much more for biosimilars than the referenced brand medication, according to a new report.", "Description": "Surprisingly, Medicare beneficiaries are likely to pay much more for biosimilars than the referenced brand medication, according to a new report.", "og": {"url": "http://formularyjournal.modernmedicine.com/formulary-journal/news/biosimilars-pose-problems-medicare-beneficiaries", "site_name": "Formulary Journal", "description": "Surprisingly, Medicare beneficiaries are likely to pay much more for biosimilars than the referenced brand medication, according to a new report.\n\n\tWhile the Affordable Care Act (ACA) created an app", "title": "Biosimilars pose problems for Medicare beneficiaries"}, "DC.identifier": "http://formularyjournal.modernmedicine.com/node/420843", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.date": "2016-04-25", "last-modified": "Tue, 26 April 2016 18:11:49 GMT", "DC.creator": "Christine Blank, Contributing Editor", "DC.source": "Formulary ENews", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "Avalere Health, biosimilar drugs, biosimilar drugs cost, biosimilar drugs Medicare, biosimilars, Clinical News, Feature Articles, Medicare Part D", "emsContentType": "Biosimilars pose problems for Medicare beneficiaries", "DC.title": "Biosimilars pose problems for Medicare beneficiaries"}, "article_summary": "Surprisingly, Medicare beneficiaries are likely to pay much more for biosimilars than the referenced brand medication, according to a new report.\nThe model does not account for discounts or rebates on either the reference product or the biosimilars.\nCreating a biosimilar tier that would reduce beneficiary costs for the biosimilar below that of the reference product.\nThe analysis also assumed that biosimilars will have a list price of 25% below the price of the reference product, based on the current average cost per patient.\nRequiring manufacturer discounts to close the coverage gap for biosimilars, consistent with current law for branded drugs."}
