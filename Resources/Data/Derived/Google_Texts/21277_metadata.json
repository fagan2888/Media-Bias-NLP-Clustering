You yokels were just making too damn much of a fuss. The continuing revelations of Obamacare \u2014 its destructive effects, its gargantuan costs, its broken promises \u2014 create a din of their own.\n\nIf you\u2019re paying close attention, it\u2019s hard to keep up with the revelations. If you\u2019re not paying close attention, they\u2019re easy to miss. And we\u2019re still seeking to get to the bottom of certain secrets.\n\nThe Obama administration \u2014 Queen Seeb \u2014 had previously professed a goal of seven million Obamacare sign-ups during the initial open enrollment period. Are they standing by it? Robert Pear reports in today\u2019s New York Times regarding Sebelius\u2019s testimony before Congress: \u201c[S]he declined to say whether the administration was still committed to its original goal of enrolling seven million people in private coverage through federal and state exchanges by March 31.\u201d\n\nPear adds: \u201cMs. Sebelius reported Tuesday that 4.2 million people had selected health plans through the federal and state exchanges from October through February.\u201d\n\nOf those 4.2 million, how many have actually paid premiums to take out coverage? She\u2019s not saying.\n\nAnd of those 4.2 million, how many were previously insured? She\u2019s not saying.\n\nAs Peter Suderman observed this week: \u201cEven if we knew how many of the sign ups were paid enrollments, that would not tell us how many previously uninsured people were gaining coverage thanks to the law. Survey data suggests that the number is much smaller than the overall sign-up totals, perhaps just a quarter of all people signing up for coverage. But the bottom line is that we just don\u2019t know, because the administration is not systematically tracking that data.\u201d\n\nThese are among the deep secrets of Obamacare. Democrats who voted for this engine of destruction should be asked the questions on every opportune occasion.\n\nQueen Seeb appears to have redefined success downward. She now defines success as \u201cmillions of people having affordable health care\u201d through private insurance and Medicaid. But that assumes that the millions counted among those who have \u201cselected plans\u201d didn\u2019t have them before. Queen Seeb begs the question that needs to be asked on every opportune occasion.\n\nGoing at this question from another direction, Robert Tracinski asks: \u201cWhat was a the point of Obamacare?\u201d Tracinski looks at shards of evidence dropped by sources such as Ezekiel Emanuel and draws inferences regarding the deep secrets of Obamacare. We\u2019re going to have to stay on the case.\n\nQueen Seeb assures us that the policies offered through the Obamacare exchanges provide \u201caffordable health care.\u201d Do they?\n\nThe Federalist reports that at a Spanish-language town hall at the Newseum last week, el presidente was asked a question from a man who wanted to buy Obamacare for a family of three but couldn\u2019t afford it. The individual said he makes about $36,000 per year, and the minimum Obamacare insurance price for the policy he needed was about $315 per month. \u201cI think that\u2019s too much for me,\u201d the man said, according to an English translation of his question.\n\n\u201cIs the Affordable Care Act really affordable?\u201d the moderator then asked Obama. The answer is obscure, seen as through a glass darkly. Obama messes with Texas (and Florida) and takes issue with with the poor choices made by citizens who value their cable television access and cell phone service more than Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Nancy Pelosi famously advised us that we had to pass Obamacare to find out what was in it, away from the din of political controversy.
