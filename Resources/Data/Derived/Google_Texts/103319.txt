British indie group Alt-J scored their first ever number one album with the newly-released "This is all yours", the follow up to their 2012 debut "An Awesome Wave". Veteran U.S. singer-songwriter Barbra Streisand's "Partners" held on to second spot in the album chart, while Sam Smith also remained unmoved in third place with "In the Lonely Hour"

"Wanted on Voyage" by George Ezra rose to fourth, while Leonard Cohen's "Popular Problems" debuted in the charts in fifth position.
