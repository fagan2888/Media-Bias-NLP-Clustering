I\u2019m convinced they never again will allow a coveted player to remain with the team beyond the trading deadline if he can be an unrestricted free agent on July 1. They did that with Paul Stastny \u2026 and they got burned.\n\nIt\u2019s very clear \u2014 and this will affect Ryan O\u2019Reilly, among others, moving forward \u2014 that Sakic and Roy are sincere when they speak of a \u201cstructure,\u201d and it\u2019s about more than money. It\u2019s about buying in, being committed, wanting to be here and backing it up. The Avalanche has displayed the commitment to the model with lucrative long-term extensions, and will try to avoid even getting into the Stastny position again.\n\nSakic can\u2019t get too huffy. In August 1997, he agreed to a front-loaded, three-year, $21 million offer sheet from the Rangers. The cash-short Avalanche ownership of that era had to scramble to be able to write the initial $15 million check. Sakic was a restricted, not unrestricted, free agent.\n\nFour years later, Roy, Sakic and Rob Blake agreed to long-term deals with Stanley Cup champion Colorado a few hours before they could hit the market as UFAs. Blake had joined the Avalanche in February 2001 after the Los Angeles Kings realized they wouldn\u2019t be able to re-sign him before he was a UFA. The Avalanche did.\n\nBut Sakic\u2019s and Roy\u2019s perspectives are different now.\n\nThe day before the NHL trading deadline in March, Stastny and I chatted in Chicago. It seemed almost certain that he would enter the offseason with the chance to become a UFA on July 1. But he said he hoped to stay with the Avalanche for the rest of the season and beyond.\n\n\u201cYou can obviously go somewhere and get more money somewhere else,\u201d Stastny said. \u201cBut if you have something good and you want to stick with it, that hometown discount is obviously something that everyone\u2019s aware of and is important to do. You want both sides to be happy. You don\u2019t want to (mistreat) the team and you want the team to be put in a good situation where they can kind of compete down the road as well.\u201d\n\nThe \u201chometown\u201d issue came into play, but that meant St. Louis, where Paul moved when he was 7 years old and his father, Peter, joined the Blues.\n\nStastny got the best of both worlds: a) his real hometown, rather than Denver, where he played 10 seasons with the University of Denver and with the Avalanche; and, b) a raise, from the $6.6 million he made the previous five seasons with Colorado, to $7 million for the next four seasons with the Blues.\n\nIf the team making the outlandish offer was anyone other than St. Louis, Stastny might have accepted a Colorado offer that was less than he could have gotten elsewhere and been back. But the point is, the Avalanche \u2014 meaning Sakic and Roy \u2014 gauged the situation and decided it was worth the risk.\n\nTrading Stastny at the deadline in a remarkable season would have been ripped as sending the \u201cwrong\u201d message. But I doubt Sakic and Roy will worry about that again.\n\nColorado is nudging up toward the NHL salary cap, which was inevitable when the extensions kicked in. But with attendance down, this team also has been operating on a \u201cbudget\u201d the past few seasons. Ownership has accepted the increasing payroll, especially since the playoff flameout can\u2019t obscure the progress in the past year.\n\nSo, again, the issue here isn\u2019t just money. Sakic and Roy, among the best in the game as players, worked the system themselves. But they believe they are building something, including a culture that involves an acceptance of a generous but \u201cfair\u201d salary hierarchy within the cap system. In that sense, \u201cstructure\u201d is synonymous with \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nThanks to the Stastny Lesson, I\u2019m convinced that from now on, it\u2019s going to be \u2026\n\nYou\u2019ll prove that you\u2019re with us.\n\nOr we\u2019ll see that you\u2019re not.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Colorado Avalanche won\u2019t repeat the Paul Stastny situation", "title": "Frei: Colorado Avalanche won\u2019t repeat the Paul Stastny situation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/06/frei-colorado-avalanche-wont-repeat-the-paul-stastny-situation/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__20140707_B1_SP07FREIp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__20140707_B1_SP07FREIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T21:16:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:41:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In August 1997, he agreed to a front-loaded, three-year, $21 million offer sheet from the Rangers.\nBut the point is, the Avalanche \u2014 meaning Sakic and Roy \u2014 gauged the situation and decided it was worth the risk.\nFour years later, Roy, Sakic and Rob Blake agreed to long-term deals with Stanley Cup champion Colorado a few hours before they could hit the market as UFAs.\nThe cash-short Avalanche ownership of that era had to scramble to be able to write the initial $15 million check.\nThe Avalanche has displayed the commitment to the model with lucrative long-term extensions, and will try to avoid even getting into the Stastny position again."}
