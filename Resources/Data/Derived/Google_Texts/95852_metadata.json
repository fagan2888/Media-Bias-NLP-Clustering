The current ownership is seeking alternatives for the continuation of healthcare in the community though no plans for the future have been approved.\u201d\n\nThe hospital was purchased by S.C. Healthcare Investments LLC in 2013 from Barnwell County.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, there are only six patients admitted to the hospital, said CEO Michael Patterson. The hospital\u2019s 90 full-time and 28 part-time employees were notified starting Tuesday afternoon of plans to cease emergency room operations as of noon Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe will still take care of the patients until they are able to be moved or released,\u201d even past Thursday\u2019s deadline, Patterson said.\n\nPatterson said the final decision was made Monday. Employees were first notified at a meeting Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAfter rumors began circulating Tuesday afternoon, The People-Sentinel in Barnwell learned that county officials were not notified of the impending closure. Asked why, Patterson said he felt it was \u201cimportant to tell the employees first.\u201d\n\nEmployees will receive two weeks\u2019 severance pay. Patterson said retirement funds are in a 401(k) plan. He also said SC Works, the state employment agency, is being notified of the situation.\n\nAs to why the hospital is closing, the release stated, \u201cThere has been a decline in hospital volumes over the past years to the point that maintaining a full service hospital for the current demand from acute and emergency patients is not sustainable. The hospital has been operating with losses from operations despite efforts to improve efficiency, collections and the facility. In the most recent year, the hospital lost $2.5 million from operations due to a low patient census and uncompensated care.\u201d\n\nPatterson said that ambulance services responding to calls are required to take patients to the nearest hospital and that it will be up to them to determine which facility is nearest. Hospitals closest to Barnwell County include Allendale, Aiken and Orangeburg.\n\nPatterson said the state and licensing agencies have been notified.\n\nSouthern Palmetto Hospital, formerly Barnwell County Hospital, has served the Barnwell community for more than 60 years.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "BARNWELL, S.C. -- Southern Palmetto Hospital in Barnwell is shutting down -- but maybe only temporarily.", "title": "Barnwell hospital closing Thursday", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/2016-01-20/barnwell-hospital-closing-thursday", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/barnwell%20hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "Southern Palmetto Hospital, formerly Barnwell County Hospital, has served the Barnwell community for more than 60 years.\nHospitals closest to Barnwell County include Allendale, Aiken and Orangeburg.\nThe current ownership is seeking alternatives for the continuation of healthcare in the community though no plans for the future have been approved.\u201dThe hospital was purchased by S.C.
