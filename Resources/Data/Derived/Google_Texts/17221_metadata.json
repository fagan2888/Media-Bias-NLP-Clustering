In addition to presentations of HANYS\u2019 Community Health Improvement Award, Pinnacle Award for Quality and Patient Safety, and Distinguished Service Award, the Conference featured thought-provoking sessions on the transformation from fee-for-service reimbursement to population health management, the ever-changing healthcare marketplace, and the future of Medicaid in New York State. Presenters included Jason Helgerson, New York State Medicaid Director; Michael Irwin, Managing Director, Citigroup; and author and educator Ken Kaufman. Throughout the Conference, hospital and health system executives discussed the opportunities and challenges associated with the state\u2019s Medicaid waiver program, shifts in the healthcare marketplace to risk-based systems, new care models and incentives, and meeting community healthcare needs.\n\nHANYS Presents Distinguished Service Award to Bassett Healthcare CEO William Streck, M.D.\n\nHANYS President Dennis Whalen (left) presents the Distinguished Service Award to William F.

Streck, M.D., at HANYS\u2019 Annual Membership Conference. One of the longest-serving health system executives in New York State, with more than three decades leading Bassett Healthcare, Dr. Streck has also led the state\u2019s Public Health Council and Public Health and Health Planning Council. He is known for innovative healthcare design, delivery, and policy expertise. \u201cUnder Dr. Streck\u2019s visionary leadership, a single hospital in Cooperstown, with 70 physicians, has grown into a network of six affiliated hospitals, with 45 community- and school-based health centers, and more than 400 providers serving eight counties,\u201d said HANYS President Dennis Whalen. \u201cHe has redefined the role of a rural hospital by embracing new models for effective, efficient, and sustainable patient-centered care, while also significantly expanding access. This is a great example of a way to deliver healthcare in a challenging, rural environment with a widespread population with significant healthcare needs.\u201d Accepting his award, thanking all of his colleagues at Bassett and across the state, Dr. Streck told the audience they were fortunate to be engaged in the world of healthcare. \u201cIn our roles, we are able to be at the confluence of all the forces in our society, providing a service that is essential to all of our citizens,\u201d he said. Dr. Streck, who will be retiring this summer, added, \u201cIt is a remarkable privilege to have the opportunity to change so many things.\u201d He noted the progress in the healthcare field, and added \u201cWe have these difficult times, but we are here because we think we can do it.\u201d Since 1979, HANYS\u2019 Distinguished Service Award has recognized individuals who demonstrate extraordinary commitment to improving healthcare through service.\n\nHANYS Presents 2014 Pinnacle Awards\n\nHANYS' Board Chair Linda Brady, M.D., presents the Pinnacle Awards.

F.F. Thompson Health System\u2019s Use of Visual Management to Eliminate Hospital-Acquired Conditions initiative received HANYS\u2019 Pinnacle Award for Quality and Patient Safety for a Small Hospital.

By offering culturally-relevant education and programming, more than 530 older adults participated and reported increased physical activity, better understanding of chronic disease and symptom management, and decreased pain and fatigue. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital was awarded an honorable mention for WIN for Health, a hospital-community partnership supporting children with asthma and adults with diabetes through care coordination. This program has significantly reduced asthma-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and missed school days. Graduates of the diabetes program reported successful diabetes management, and most participants continue regular communication with their coaches after completion. The Community Health Improvement Award was established in 1997 to recognize outstanding initiatives focused on specific community health issues, with collaborations and quantifiable results. This year\u2019s nominees showcase a broad range of partnerships that extend far beyond the hospital walls, strategizing to meet New York State\u2019s Prevention Agenda goal of making our state the healthiest in the nation.

HANYS\u2019 President Dennis Whalen addresses the membership.\n\nIn his address to the membership at HANYS\u2019 Annual Membership Conference, HANYS President Dennis Whalen focused on the rapid pace of change facing healthcare leaders. \u201cChange is not new in healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are characteristics that have changed. We get change every day, from all directions.\u201d From questioning the fundamental way care is delivered, to the influence of communication, social media, expectations, and altered generational views\u2014he said patients are evolving into consumers. \u201cWho will be the Amazon of healthcare?\u201d Mr. Whalen challenged the audience. He noted the increased need for reasonable and useful transparency efforts, as more consumers make decisions based on online information. While extremely significant and transformative, Mr. Whalen emphasized that organizational reform efforts are experiments. The Affordable Care Act and Medicaid waiver do not have guaranteed outcomes. \u201cWe can all point to reform efforts in the past where we were assured of the outcome, but what everyone thought was the answer was not,\u201d he noted. However, he added, leaders must strive to make this experiment succeed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get into healthcare because it was easy,\u201d Mr. Whalen continued, \u201cwe did it because of the mission and importance of work. That should be our inspiration every day. Change is difficult, the work is hard, but we have spent our careers learning and being experts on how to assess the problem and solution.\u201d\n\nJason Helgerson Implores Hospital Leaders to Collaborate for Reform\n\nJason Helgerson speaks to HANYS\u2019 members.
