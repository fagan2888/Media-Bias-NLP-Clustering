Hydro blamed the website crash on heavy traffic as thousands of people in Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley tried to check the website\u2019s list and map of power outages.\n\nIt took until 10 p.m. on August 29 for BC Hydro to issue a list to media of power outages via a Twitter link. More than half-a-million residences and businesses lost power during the storm.\n\nBC Hydro paid CGI Information Systems and Management Consultants $2.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, according to the Crown corporation\u2019s financials.\n\nBC Hydro spokeswoman Simi Heer said CGI was awarded a three-year contract for \u201cthe sustainment work of BC Hydro\u2019s websites\u201d that was signed in May 2013. BC Hydro chose CGI over November 2012 bids from Sierra Systems Group, Horus Transformation Services Group and Capgemini Canada for the web platform sustainment services contract.\n\n\u201cThey maintain and prioritize all sustainment work with the direction of BC Hydro,\u201d Heer said.\n\nCGI Information Systems and Management Consultants is an Ottawa-based subsidiary of Montreal-headquartered CGI Group (TSX:GIB.A). CGI Group claims a global workforce of 68,000 in 40 countries and reported 2014 revenue of $10.5 billion. The B.C. government\u2019s public accounts for the year ended March 31, 2015, show CGI billed taxpayers $26.3 million.\n\nCGI Federal, another CGI Group subsidiary, was hired in 2011 for US$93.7 million to build and operate the HealthCare.gov health insurance registration portal. Its ill-fated launch on October 1, 2013, which was plagued by crashes, delays and other technical glitches, was a major embarrassment to U.S. President Barack Obama, who made health-care insurance reform a cornerstone of his 2012 re-election campaign.\n\nTestimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee by CGI Federal senior vice-president Cheryl Campbell on October 23, 2013, revealed that HealthCare.gov underwent just two weeks of testing before its launch.\n\nCampbell said it was the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that decided to go live, but she conceded that CGI did not recommend a delay. Between 2011 and 2013, CGI Federal had US$2.3 billion in contract and task order awards with more than two-dozen arms of the U.S. government.\n\nCGI and the Obama administration mutually parted ways in January 2014, and Accenture, which runs BC Hydro\u2019s back office functions, was hired on a 12-month contract.\n\nIn a statement issued at the time, CGI spokeswoman Linda Ororisio said: \u201cWe are proud that more than 400 CGI employees worked around the clock from October through December to deliver a consumer experience that works for a vast majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nMore than a year earlier, the Ontario government\u2019s eHealth division cancelled a six-year, $46 million contract with CGI in September 2012 for an online diabetes registry. The ministry had already spent $24.4 million internally on the project.\n\nAccording to the Ontario auditor general\u2019s 2012 annual report, \u201ceHealth acknowledged that the arrangement to pay the vendor only after successful completion of the contract has traded away much of the province\u2019s control over the project\u2019s design, progress and delivery time in exchange for price certainty.\u201d\n\nShawn Derby, CGI\u2019s senior-vice president for Western Canada, did not respond to an interview request.\n\n\u201cCGI is one of many vendors involved with IT and Internet at BC Hydro,\u201d said CGI spokesman Sebastien Barange, who referred BIV to Heer.\n\n@bobmackin", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business In Vancouver", "description": "Ottawa-based CGI Information Systems contracted to maintain Hydro website that crashed during weekend windstorm", "title": "BC Hydro website contractor related to company that oversaw troubled ObamaCare rollout", "url": "http://biv.com/article/2015/9/bc-hydro-website-contractor-related-company-oversa/", "image": "http://www.biv.com/media/filer_public/ea/37/ea372910-8a2f-4fd1-860e-a32dff4cdd82/screen_shot_2015-09-01_at_85726_am.png", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bivnews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc61c\"", "article_summary": "It took until 10 p.m. on August 29 for BC Hydro to issue a list to media of power outages via a Twitter link.\n\u201cCGI is one of many vendors involved with IT and Internet at BC Hydro,\u201d said CGI spokesman Sebastien Barange, who referred BIV to Heer.\nCGI Group claims a global workforce of 68,000 in 40 countries and reported 2014 revenue of $10.5 billion.\n\u201cThey maintain and prioritize all sustainment work with the direction of BC Hydro,\u201d Heer said.\nBC Hydro paid CGI Information Systems and Management Consultants $2.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, according to the Crown corporation\u2019s financials."}
