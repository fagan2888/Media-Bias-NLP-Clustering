This type of bacteria is good for warding off sicknesses such as the flu, diarrhea, and other related health issues. And when there is not enough of this bacteria in a person\u2019s gut, they become more prone to disease \u2014 both men and women alike.\n\nResearch leader Sonia Gonzalez from University of Oviedo\u2019s Department of Functional Biology and colleagues from the Instituto de Productos L\u00e1cteos de Asturias-CSIC asked 38 healthy adults regarding their diet and measured the amount of bacteria that was present in their stool. \u201cA negative association was found between the intake of pectins and flavanones from oranges and the levels of Blautia coccoides and Clostridium leptum,\u201d the study authors wrote. \u201cBy contrast, white bread, providing hemicellulose and resistant starch, was directly associated with Lactobacillus.\n\nHowever, this research contrasts what many nutrition and health experts have advised on eating white breads. A recent study published by Spanish researchers showed white bread is, in fact, less healthy than whole grain bread. \u201cThe issue is that white bread is made with highly refined flour, which is rapidly absorbed as sugar,\u201d said Professor Miguel Martinez-Gonzalez, The Independent reported. \u201cEssentially it is equivalent to a high consumption of sugar. The problem is similar to what we see with soft drinks, their sugars are rapidly transformed into fat an organism.\u201d Also, due to the refining process and how it\u2019s made, white breads are also lower in fiber, which can lead to constipation in those who are not mindful of consuming a sufficient amount of the nutrient.\n\nWhile Martinez-Gonzalez and her team might have found a small group of people where white bread helped, this research is still minor and inconclusive. Martinez-Gonzalez also found people who ate three slices of white bread per day were 40 percent more likely to gain weight as compared to those who just ate one slice. Whole grain bread on the other hand was not linked to weight gain or obesity.\n\nThere are many other ways to increase the amount of probiotics in your system besides bread, such as eating yogurt or taking a probiotic supplement. Also, stay away from killers of good bacteria, such as antibiotics, cigarettes, and alcohol.\n\nSource: Gonzalez S, Cuervo A, Valdez L et al.
