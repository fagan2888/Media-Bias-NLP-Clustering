Bedard is an executive at Apple Rehab, the nursing home business in question. The word Weingarten used time and again was \u201cpretext.\u201d\n\nWeingarten asked if Bedard thought Rowland's work was just for show. \"Not for a split second,\" Bedard responded.\n\n\u201cPretext, or real work?\u201d he asked about strategies regarding unions.\n\n\u201cDid you think that instruction was a pretext or not?\u201d he asked about instructions for paying Rowland.\n\nWeingarten asked about Foley's desire to have a meeting with Rowland. \u201cDid you take that to be a pretext in any way, shape or form?\u201d\n\nEach time, Bedard said Rowland\u2019s work was real. He described meetings and email exchanges on topics including the government's plans to close nursing homes.\n\nWeingarten asked if Bedard thought Rowland\u2019s work was just for show. \u201cNot for a split second,\u201d Bedard responded.\n\nThe government alleges that the former Republican governor and convicted felon worked on the 2012 congressional campaign of Lisa Wilson-Foley, but that he was paid for that work through a bogus consulting agreement with the nursing home business of Wilson-Foley\u2019s husband, Brian Foley.\n\nBrian Foley has already testified that while Rowland may have done \u201creal work\u201d for his company, his intent was always to pay the former governor through the company to have him work on his wife\u2019s campaign. Foley has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and is cooperating with the government.\n\nJurors have already heard from people who worked on the 2012 congressional campaign of Lisa Wilson-Foley, including one-time campaign manager Chris Covucci, who said he left the campaign in part because of concerns about the arrangement with Rowland. They also heard from Apple Rehab executives who also had concerns about the Rowland arrangement once they learned about it.\n\nOn Monday, Rowland\u2019s attorneys told the court that they may have a relatively short witness list. One question is whether Rowland will be on it. The answer to that is still unknown.\n\nWithout the jury present, Weingarten threw a bit of a courtroom bombshell.\n\nThen, in a lengthy hearing in front of Judge Janet Bond Arterton, but without the jury present, Weingarten threw a bit of a courtroom bombshell. He said he \u201cjust learned\u201d over the weekend about a conversation between Brian Foley and Brian Bedard. In that conversation, Foley apparently told Bedard that there was no deal between him and Rowland.\n\n\u201cMr. Foley, among other things...told Mr. Bedard there was never a deal with Mr. Rowland, there was never a quid pro quo, and he would never testify to that,\u201d Weingarten told the court.\n\n\u201cThis could not be more fundamental,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe have a situation where [on one hand] the government\u2019s star witness says, \u2018I committed a crime with John Rowland. And we have testimony now that, on numerous occasions, he said to his CEO, \u2018I did not.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe question is whether to the defense could get testimony to that effect from Bedard. The government objected, and the court agreed.\n\n(Later, before the jury was brought in after lunch, lawyers fought again over whether to allow Bedard to be questioned as to that conversation with Foley. After extensive argument, the judge called the situation \u201ca mess,\u201d and instructed Rowland's lawyers to move on.)\n\nWhen Bedard returned, he underwent a long, tense, and dramatic questioning led by prosecutor Liam Brennan. Throughout, despite saying he made campaign contributions, despite saying he went to a few campaign events, despite conceding he met with Rowland and Republican strategist Chris Healy, and despite saying he \u201cvaguely\u201d remembered seeing Rowland\u2019s draft contract language that dealt with the 2012 campaign, Bedard said he never thought Rowland's arrangement at Apple was related to the campaign.\n\n\u201cAnd you never...thought that this contract was maybe about politics?\u201d Brennan asked him.\n\n\u201cNever once,\u201d Bedard said.\n\nThis report includes information from the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "One of the main questions for the jury in the case of former Governor John Rowland is this: was his consulting contract with a nursing home business the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/john-rowland-got-paid-what-job", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201404/Rowland.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One of the main questions for the jury in the case of former Governor John Rowland is this: was his consulting contract with a nursing home business the", "title": "John Rowland Got Paid, But For What Job?"}, "story_id": 348971872, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jeffcohenwnpr"}, "author": "Jeff Cohen, Tucker Ives", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "John Rowland Got Paid, But For What Job?"}, "nid": 28599, "datePublished": "2014-09-16", "keywords": "courts, corruption, The Daily, governors, crime, politicians, campaigns", "wordCount": 719, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Weingarten asked about Foley's desire to have a meeting with Rowland.\n\u201cWe have a situation where [on one hand] the government\u2019s star witness says, \u2018I committed a crime with John Rowland.\nThe word Weingarten used time and again was \u201cpretext.\u201dWeingarten asked if Bedard thought Rowland's work was just for show.\n\u201cDid you take that to be a pretext in any way, shape or form?\u201dEach time, Bedard said Rowland\u2019s work was real.\nWeingarten asked if Bedard thought Rowland\u2019s work was just for show."}
