Yechieli had studied storm water runoff in the Sinai Desert for a master\u2019s degree. He knows how it flows.\n\nSpread the Word\n\n\u2022 Email this article to friends or colleagues\n\n\u2022 Share this article on Facebook or Twitter\n\n\u2022 Write about and link to this article on your blog\n\n\u2022 Local relevancy?

It could be used to flush the toilets and help better the students\u2019 future ecologically.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw this, I calculated how much rain there could have been and figured out that the school roof could supply six months of water to the school. I turned to the principal and she said, \u2018Good idea,\u2019 and referred me to some funds. I got the funding and the next year I built the first system in the country,\u201d he tells ISRAEL21c.\n\nThat was 15 years ago. Now, more than 120 schools later and heading a new company called Yevul Mayim, Yechieli is helping the nation of Israel collect rain.\n\nBy day, he teaches science at several schools near Jerusalem. By afternoon, and whenever else he can, Yechieli works with students and teachers to set up rainwater collection systems on the roof. He often does this on his own dime.\n\nSaves 100 days of water\n\nIt only rains for about half the year in Israel. But this is enough to collect about 100 days\u2019 worth of water at schools, Yechieli estimates.\n\nWith an initial capital expense of about $10,000, it takes about seven or eight years to pay back the investment in water savings, but that investment is worth gold.\n\nAnother winning aspect of his low-tech design is several small catchment bins, instead of pouring all the rainwater into a huge tank. The smaller bins act as filters. Yechieli also developed a way to drain off the sand and debris from the bottom so the sum result is clean and tasty water.\n\nHe is against patenting the idea on principle.\n\nThe Yuval Mayim system is built with the kids, and they monitor it every day. Beyond the gallons of water saved, the children learn to notice unusual leaks in the system, saving damage from occurring. They even report leaky toilets.\n\nYechieli says that one school spotted a leaky pipe that, left unrepaired, could have caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage underground.\n\nThe result of water education hits home to Yechieli, an environmentalist.\n\n\u201cThe need for Israelis to conserve water is going down the drain now that we have desalinated water,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople will just keep using more and more in their gardens, while the CO2 production from desalination will grow steadily. Not to mention marine pollution or the fact that we pour into the sea twice as much as we desalinate.\u201d\n\nPeace begins with water\n\nHis projects have peace appeal, too. Yechieli has done projects that bring together Israeli Arabs and Jews, Israelis and Jordanians from schools with rainwater harvesting systems.\n\nSo influential has Yechieli been in the Israeli education world that he is now dealing with policy-makers on how to manage the 20 percent of rainwater that would otherwise flow to the sea.\n\nAt first, when he tested the waters of using collected rainwater in toilets, city engineers were opposed. They didn\u2019t want the headaches of managing and overseeing new infrastructure, and they worried that there might be some mixture between clean drinking water and unpurified rainwater.\n\nHowever, the idea finally got a rubber stamp of approval.\n\n\u201cThe major issue here is those kids,\u201d says Yechieli. \u201cWhen they grow up [and work] in influential places in government or wherever, they will be better citizens of this country.\u201d\n\nHe believes schools are a place to educate and to change awareness. There are now schools in Israel, thanks to Yechieli\u2019s chutzpah, that are installing rainwater catchments and toilet intakes from the beginning of construction.\n\nRaining buckets in Africa\n\nAnd word has spread beyond Israel. Tag International flew Yechieli to Kenya to help build a system to provide water savings to some 600 villagers who had no running water. People were drinking from ditches, yet they had tin roofs that could collect rainwater year round.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have money and they don\u2019t have ideas. Even when USAID tried to help, the ideas didn\u2019t stick. If you don\u2019t include the people in the project, they won\u2019t care about it,\u201d says Yechieli.\n\nIn addition to continuing the project with Kenyan officials, Yechieli got funds from the Jewish National Fund to develop a rainwater catchment system at Kampala University in Uganda.\n\nThe university spends a whopping $15,000 a month on water despite being surrounded by lakes. Because the water sources are polluted, it takes an enormous amount of energy to purify the water.\n\nIsrael\u2019s \u201crain man\u201d thinks he can help. He is going in November to assess the needs of the project.\n\n\u201cI would imagine that by spending $30,000 they can save half the cost of water bills for the rest of their lives,\u201d Yechieli estimates.\n\nYuval Mayim operates on a shoestring budget, with just two employees: Yechieli and Paul Lichtenstein. They are based in Jerusalem, and no doubt business will pick up as the first rains of Israel\u2019s winter season begin to fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Science teacher Amir Yechieli has a side business showing schools how to capture and reuse the rainwater that collects on their roofs.", "application-name": "ISRAEL21c", "og": {"site_name": "Israel21c", "description": "Science teacher Amir Yechieli has a side business showing schools how to capture and reuse the rainwater that collects on their roofs.", "title": "Israel\u2019s \u2018Rain Man\u2019 conserves school water", "url": "http://www.israel21c.org/israels-rain-man-conserves-school-water/", "image": {"width": 668, "identifier": "http://www.israel21c.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kenya-children.jpg", "height": 363}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@israel21c", "image": {"src": "http://www.israel21c.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kenya-children.jpg"}, "description": "Science teacher Amir Yechieli has a side business showing schools how to capture and reuse the rainwater that collects on their roofs.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Israel\u2019s \u2018Rain Man\u2019 conserves school water"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "fb": {"app_id": 648089708658550}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/fav/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=1010", "news_keywords": "Yuval Mayim, rainwater collection, Amir Yechieli, Environment, Activism, Eco-Living, Social Action, Back to school, Water technologies,"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhen I saw this, I calculated how much rain there could have been and figured out that the school roof could supply six months of water to the school.\nBut this is enough to collect about 100 days\u2019 worth of water at schools, Yechieli estimates.\n\u201cThe need for Israelis to conserve water is going down the drain now that we have desalinated water,\u201d he says.\nTag International flew Yechieli to Kenya to help build a system to provide water savings to some 600 villagers who had no running water.\nBecause the water sources are polluted, it takes an enormous amount of energy to purify the water."}
