That\u2019s not so in the rest of the country,\u201d Dr. Paul Reiss, a Williston family practice physician, told Vermont Watchdog.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a place here in Vermont where we have about 20 percent independents, yet in the rest of the country 50 to 60 percent are independent practice.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reiss, the dwindling number of independent doctors in Vermont is due in part to underpayment from government health care programs.\n\n\u201cYou get paid for the work you do if you participate with Medicaid, but they pay you considerably less than commercial payers like Blue Cross or MVP, and typically less than Medicare as well. So for the same services you get less.\u201d\n\nReiss said underpayment is making it difficult for doctors in Vermont to balance their budgets, hire support staff and fund basic operations.\n\nDr. Ernest Bove, a Rutland urologist who has served patients for 29 years, said underpayment from Medicare and Medicaid is hurting specialists, as well.\n\n\u201cReimbursement rates make it very difficult for a specialist practice to survive in Vermont. That\u2019s why physicians are joining hospitals and becoming employees. They can\u2019t run a business anymore,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cReimbursements have been flat for years and have even gone down in many instances. And your expenses keep going up. I estimate a 5 percent cycle of inflation every year in terms of electrical costs, which are already high, and I\u2019m paying $3.50 for heating oil, so that\u2019s high. But the reimbursement rate remains flat. Plus your employees need a raise. You just can\u2019t stay alive. That\u2019s why people are leaving.\u201d\n\nMichael Tanner, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told Vermont Watchdog that Medicaid\u2019s average reimbursement rate to doctors is 72 cents on the dollar. Medicare is slightly higher at around 80 cents on the dollar.\n\n\u201c(Medicare) is slightly better than Medicaid right now. But under Obamacare, if everything goes as predicted, Medicare will reimburse less than Medicaid within 10 years.\u201d\n\nFor many doctors across Vermont, Medicare and Medicaid patients comprise a significant portion of the total clientele. Bove said 75 percent of his patients come from Medicaid or Medicare. The numbers just don\u2019t work, he said.\n\n\u201cIf I was 10 years younger, I would have left Vermont a long time ago to go someplace else to practice,\u201d Bove said.\n\nMeanwhile, hospitals, which will serve as the backbone of Vermont\u2019s single-payer system, also encounter underpayment but recoup their losses through privileged negotiations with the state\u2019s two major insurers.\n\n\u201cIf (hospitals) are not being paid by Medicaid, they can demand more from Blue Cross and MVP to make up for that deficit,\u201d Reiss said.\n\n\u201cIn independent practice \u2014 whether primary care, specialty care, physical therapy or chiropractor \u2014 you can\u2019t make that up by going to the commercial payers and demanding more, because they\u2019ll just say no. In fact, most independent practitioners in this state are being paid considerably less for the same exact services hospital-employed physicians are being paid for because of the clout of the hospitals, because we have a monopolistic hospital system. The hospitals can just demand a fee increase every year from Blue Cross.\u201d\n\nWhereas independent practitioners operate on razor thin margins, the hospital systems are well funded \u2014 they\u2019re able to buy land, build new things and fund projects, Reiss said.\n\nWhat does this mean for Vermont, which plans to put everyone into a single government-run system?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to create a (doctor) shortage,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cIt\u2019s increasing demand without increasing supply. You don\u2019t have to be an economic genius to know what happens if you have greater demand and no change in supply.\u201d\n\nBove agreed, saying it would be difficult to recruit specialty physicians such as urologists, orthopedic surgeons and ophthalmologists. He predicted specialists would see a \u201cnet migration out of Vermont.\u201d\n\nReiss said the recent closing of Green Mountain Urology is the model of what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cGreen Mountain Urology fell apart, and the doctors were offered positions at Fletcher Allen (hospital) instead. So the only independent option for urology services in Chittenden County is gone. You can only get urology services through Fletcher Allen.\u201d\n\nWhile Reiss said the cost of urology services may have doubled as a result, his biggest worry is that consumer choice is about to disappear in Vermont.\n\n\u201cThe real fear is that with single\u2013payer comes single provider, meaning there is one mega delivery system run by the hospitals. And that takes away all the choice consumers will have with where they get their care, because there will be only one provider of care \u2014 just like having one utility company,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat will be your only choice, because it will dominate the market, and you won\u2019t have the ability to switch your health care.\u201d\n\nContact Bruce Parker at bparker@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Physicians say Vermont\u2019s move towards a single-payer health care monopoly is driving independent doctors out of business and eliminating patient choice.", "title": "Doctors: Health care monopoly driving them out of business - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/DoctorsQuit.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:59+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/160743/vermont-health-care-monopoly/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "ObamaCare", "published_time": "2014-07-23T04:00:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Physicians say Vermont\u2019s move towards a single-payer health care monopoly is driving independent doctors out of business and eliminating patient choice.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/DoctorsQuit.jpg"}, "title": "Doctors: Health care monopoly driving them out of business - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Physicians say Vermont\u2019s move towards a single-payer health care monopoly is driving independent doctors out of business and eliminating patient choice."}, "article_summary": "But physicians in Vermont say the state\u2019s move towards a single-payer health care system is driving independent doctors out of business and eliminating patient choice.\nBy Bruce Parker | Vermont WatchdogSingle-payer advocates promise high-quality low-cost health care for all.\nSo the only independent option for urology services in Chittenden County is gone.\n\u201cIn independent practice \u2014 whether primary care, specialty care, physical therapy or chiropractor \u2014 you can\u2019t make that up by going to the commercial payers and demanding more, because they\u2019ll just say no.\n\u201cThe health systems have caused it to be nearly impossible from a financial standpoint to stay in private practice."}
