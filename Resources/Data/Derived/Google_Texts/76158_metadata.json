Information pulled from the Biennial Report on Blood-Borne Disease Prevention Program shows that 4,090 dirty needles were collected between 2007 and 2008. In 2012, however, almost 69,000 needles were collected.\n\nInterestingly enough, diseases that can be transmitted by blood have gone down in Shasta County.\n\nHIV has remained static, standing at about 10 cases a year.\n\nCases of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C have drastically declined.\n\nThere were 17 cases of Hepatitis B in 2007, just one case in 2013 and none in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThere were seven cases of Hepatitis C in 2008, and none in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "A doctor has declared the once feared needle exchange program a success at the Shasta County Board of Supervisor\u2019s meeting Tuesday.", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "KRCR", "og": {"site_name": "KRCRTV", "description": "A doctor has declared the once feared needle exchange program a success at the Shasta County Board of Supervisor\u2019s meeting Tuesday.", "title": "Needle exchange program declared a success", "url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/needle-exchange-program-declared-a-success/25386822", "image": "http://www.krcrtv.com/image/view/-/25386908/medRes/2/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/15a1orsz/-/Hope-Van.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/needle-exchange-program-declared-a-success/25386822", "site": "@krcr7", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 326090907430922}, "keywords": "Redding health news", "google-site-verification": "gTTyxbmKN17E5sKQVjUGk8TIpxo_XoD5X2_F3PXfucg", "news_keywords": "Redding health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd514\"", "article_summary": "REDDING, Calif. -A doctor has declared the once feared needle exchange program a success at the Shasta County Board of Supervisor\u2019s meeting Tuesday.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t advertise in any way, there\u2019s no PSA, it\u2019s all word of mouth,\u201d Dr. Deckert said.\nThe project allows intravenous drug users to exchange a dirty syringe for a clean syringe twice a week at Shasta Community Health Center\u2019s Hope Van.\nThere were 17 cases of Hepatitis B in 2007, just one case in 2013 and none in 2011 and 2012.\nCounty Health Officer Dr. Andrew Deckert reports on the Blood Borne Disease Prevention Project every two years."}
