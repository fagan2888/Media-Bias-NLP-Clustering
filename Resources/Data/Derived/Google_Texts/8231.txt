A waitress who picked up the tab for two National Guard members furloughed due to the government shutdown got more than she ever expected in return.

Sarah Hoidahl, a 21-year-old single mother, was working at a Ruby Tuesday in Concord, New Hampshire last week when two soldiers stopped in for lunch, according to the local ABC network.

“They were looking through the menu and trying to decide what to get, and she had mentioned something about the furlough and said ‘we’re not getting paid,’ and I thought, oh jeez,” Hoidahl told WMUR 9.

I was just thinking to myself and I thought, you know what, I’m going to buy their food today,” she continued. “It’s good karma – do something nice for someone else.”

After they had finished their meal, she not only picked up their tab, but added a note on the back of their check expressing her gratitude for their service:

The reaction Hoidahl got from the two women was more than she expected — little did she know that her act of kindness would capture the nation’s attention.

“I came out, and they were out front waiting for me and just, instantly, came up to me and said ‘Sarah’ and they hugged me,” Hoidahl said. “Their reaction was, worth everything – I thought I didn’t do this huge thing – I just bought you lunch but thank you!”

The New Hampshire National Guard posted a picture of Sarah and a copy of her note on their Facebook page, WMUR 9 reported.

The response has been overwhelming.

“I think the most moving thing I saw on Facebook was people saying there should be more people like me in the world,” Hoidahl told WMUR. “That really got to me.”

In stark contrast to the shameful actions of politicians in Washington, D.C., Sarah Hoidahl is what America is really all about.
