The Steelers made a trade for a veteran cornerback Saturday, sending a conditional fifth-round pick in the 2016 draft to the Philadelphia Eagles for Brandon Boykin.

Boykin, a 5-foot-10, 185-pounder entering his fourth NFL season, has played in 48 games and recorded seven interceptions, including six in 2013. He is a former fourth-round pick out of the University of Georgia.

The trade could signal that second-round draft choice Senquez Golson has a serious shoulder injury, or at the very least one that will keep him out for much of training camp. Golson opened training camp on the physically-unable-to-perform list and has not been activated.

According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Boykin voiced his displeasure with his role in Philadelphia in June when he said it was “getting real old” that he was not a starter.

It’s unclear whether Boykin will get that opportunity with the Steelers. William Gay and Cortez Allen have been the starters since minicamp in June. Antwon Blake has been the nickelback.

The Steelers also drafted Doran Grant in the fourth round, but he apparently is not ready to assume a major role.

According to Pro Football Focus, Boykin was among the highest-rated cornerbacks in the league last season at No. 19.
