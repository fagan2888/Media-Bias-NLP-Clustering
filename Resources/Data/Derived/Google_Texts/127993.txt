The New York State Department of Health (DOH) and Division of the Budget (DOB) released the March 2014 Medicaid Global Spending Cap report, indicating that Medicaid spending finished below the global cap in state fiscal year (SFY) 2013-2014. This is the third straight year since the cap was instituted in 2011 that spending ended the year below the projected spending levels.

Medicaid spending finished $39 million under the $16.421 billion cap, though an additional $75 million in savings under the cap was already used in this year’s final budget agreement to pre-pay expenses in the current year (SFY 2014-2015), for a total of $114 million in savings under the cap in SFY 2013-2014.

The $114 million in total savings is a result of:

lower utilization of services ($108 million savings);

lower state operations costs ($50 million savings);

higher savings associated with the state takeover of local Medicaid administration ($11 million savings); offset by

lower than expected enhanced federal Medicaid matching funds associated with the Affordable Care Act (-$55 million).

Medicaid enrollment reached a total of 5,697,529 at the end of the fiscal year, representing a net enrollment increase of 446,451, including 494,000 people who signed up for Medicaid through the New York State of Health marketplace.

The Medicaid global cap for the current year (SFY 2014-2015) is $16.96 billion. This year’s final budget included changes to the global cap, including a global cap “dividend” to share savings with providers and plans if spending finishes below the global cap levels; and additional detail in the monthly global cap reports, including more information on price, utilization, projected enrollment changes, and other initiatives, with a description of the current and future year impact on a variety of categories of spending. Similar to this past year’s adopted budget, a portion of the savings anticipated to accrue this year is expected to be used for state financial plan relief. Contact: Nick Henley
