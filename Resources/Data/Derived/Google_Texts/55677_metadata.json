Officials released the prices on Tuesday.\n\nIn Georgia the state is divided into 16 insurance regions, and the premiums differ quite a bit.\n\n\"Atlanta is one of the lower cost regions. In Southwest Georgia, the premiums could be as much as 40 percent higher for the same individual,\" said Bill Custer, a health insurance expert at Georgia State University.\n\nFor example, a person between the ages of 26 and 35 could pay 316 dollars a month in Atlanta. That same person would pay 4 dollars more in Macon, and up to a 150 more in southwestern Mitchell County.\n\nCuster saidthose premiums are before any tax credit is applied. A person with a higher income doesn\u2019t have access to a tax credit. But once a tax credit is applied the rate would get lower.\n\nPeople in Georgia will buy insurance through the federal exchange because state officials declined to set up their own.\n\nEnrollment starts Oct. 1 and runs through March.", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "Obamacare Premiums Vary Across Georgia", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "We now have a sense of what people in Georgia will pay for health insurance through the new healthcare exchange run by federal government.
