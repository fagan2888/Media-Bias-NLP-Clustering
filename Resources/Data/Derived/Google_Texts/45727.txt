A record amount of people turned out to vote in the Republican Caucus in Sedgwick County.

The party expected less than 10,000 people so they only printed 10,000 ballots, but by Noon on Saturday they were printing additional ballots.

Many came to the caucus because they felt their vote mattered.

"Kansas finally is relevant in republican politics. Up to this point there has always been a established candidate that is the lead and then Kansas could vote for whichever conservative candidate they wanted to that wouldn't win," said Kyle Lang.

Lang was first in line to the caucus.

The 2012 Republican Caucus in Sedgwick County saw 5,000 people. Organizer estimate that the 2016 Republican Caucus in Sedgwick County could exceed 12,000 people.

A line of voters quickly formed after 8 a.m. The line wrapped around the caucus location at Century II. Many waited four hours or longer to vote.

Voting was suppose to end at 2 p.m. but the line was so long that anyone stuck in line that still did not vote by that time was allowed a late entry.

Candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz both spoke at the event.
