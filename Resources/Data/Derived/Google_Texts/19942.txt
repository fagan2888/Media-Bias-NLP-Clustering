Ballots are here! Now is our chance to demand truth in food labeling, by requiring that foods that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs) be labeled as such. It is not a ban on GMOs, but simply another requirement for food labels to include.

I would like to point out that 1996 represents the tipping point year for a dramatic upswing in many of our country's serious health problems, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, autism, etc. Coincidentally, 1996 was the year GMOs were first introduced. Now almost 95 percent of many of our biggest crops such as corn, soy, and canola are grown using GMO seed, many of which are sterile.

Monsanto profits on both ends, by requiring that farmers buy new seed every year rather than using the centuries-old method of seed saving, and by selling them more and more glyphosate (aka the herbicide Round Up) so they can drench their crops, thus poisoning both our soils and our bodies.

We can stop the madness! Let's join the 64 other countries around the world that already require GMO labeling. Their food prices did not go up, and neither did their bad health outcomes.

Let's make 2014 the year we turn things around here in Colorado. After all, we have a right to know what is in our food.
