A non-binding letter of intent was signed last week and now the two non-profit systems will begin a 90-day due process period.\n\n\n\nKathleen Kinslow\n\nThis past May, Abington Health and Jefferson Health System merged into a single system that became the second-largest in the Philadelphia area. The new system now includes five hospitals, 19,000 employees, 13 outpatient and urgent care centers, and physician practices across Philadelphia, Montgomery and Bucks Counties in PA, and Camden County, NJ.\n\nThe Aria acquisition would add three acute care hospitals totaling 485 beds, nearly 4,000 employees and a medical staff of more than 1,000, along with a network of outpatient centers and physician offices in Northeast Philadelphia and Lower Bucks County.\n\nAria Health CEO and President Kathleen Kinslow says the deal would be a membership substitution that would not involve an exchange of cash, although the new system would take on Aria's assets and debts. \"The only cost is going to be the legal and consultant fees,\" she says. \"We have very little debt. Our debt-to-cap is only about 16%. We have a very strong balance sheet and little debt.\"\n\nKinslow says Aria began its strategic review two years ago to determine if it needed a partner. \"At the end of that process it was determined that because of changes in the Affordable Care Act and movement across the country in the consolidations we were seeing that it would be optimal for our organization, to be able to live our mission, that we should seek a partner as well.\"\n\n\n\nFinances were a factor, but not the driving factor in determined whether or not to seek a partner, she says.\n\n\"We had a troublesome year in fiscal 2013 and 2014. Most of that was based on revenue cycle management,\" Kinslow says. \"We did a financial turnaround plan and we were able to improve the efficiencies of operation as we entered a revenue cycle process. We opened a new emergency room so we have been able to reverse that trend. We saw an increase in market share of about 8% and our volume year-over-year has been up 5%, which has certainly improved the financials.\"", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Aria Health CEO and President Kathleen Kinslow says finances are not the driving factor, rather, the deal is about \"how can we be effective with population health and moving from volume to value.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b1c\"", "article_summary": "Jefferson Health as entered negotiations for the acquisition of Aria Health System in a deal that could be finalized by mid-2016, the two Philadelphia-area health systems have announced.\nKathleen KinslowThis past May, Abington Health and Jefferson Health System merged into a single system that became the second-largest in the Philadelphia area.\nBusiness Roundup: Aria Health, Jefferson Sign Merger LOIAria Health CEO and President Kathleen Kinslow says finances are not the driving factor, rather, the deal is about \"how can we be effective with population health and moving from volume to value.\"\nKinslow says Aria began its strategic review two years ago to determine if it needed a partner.\nFinances were a factor, but not the driving factor in determined whether or not to seek a partner, she says."}
