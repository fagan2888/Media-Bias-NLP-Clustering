The legislation would amend the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which currently provides the insurance industry with an exemption from the federal antitrust laws for conduct that is \u201cthe business of insurance,\u201d is \u201csubject to state regulation,\u201d and does not constitute \u201can act of boycott, coercion or intimidation,\u201d (15 USC 1013), by removing the exemption for health insurers and medical malpractice insurers. Notably, the bill would not eliminate the exemption with respect to other lines of insurance, and is similar to McCarran repeal bills that Representative Conyers has introduced in prior sessions of Congress. Representative Conyers has previously stated that his bill would \u201cend the mistake Congress made in 1945 when it added an antitrust exemption for insurance companies.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, on January 22, Representative Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who was a practicing dentist for many years, introduced similar McCarran repeal legislation, entitled the \u201cCompetitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2015\u201d (H.R. 494). Representative Gosar\u2019s bill would only eliminate the exemption as to health insurers. In introducing his legislation, Representative Gosar stated that \u201cSince the passage of Obamacare, the health insurance market has expanded into one of the least transparent and most anti-competitive industries in the United States,\u201d and that there is \u201cno reason in law, policy or logic for the insurance industry to have a special exemption\u201d from the antitrust laws.\n\nBoth H.R. 99 and H.R. 494 have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further action. Whether these bills will gain traction this Congress remains to be seen, but the fact that the bill has supporters on both sides of the aisle certainly increases the chances that the legislation will, at a minimum, be considered by the House Judiciary Committee (which failed to take up similar legislation in the 113th Congress).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Early into the 114th Congress, multiple bills have already been introduced that would repeal the insurance industry\u2019s limited antitrust exemption granted by the McCarran-Ferguson Act", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/congress-begins-renewed-efforts-to-repeal-insurer-s-antitrust-exemption", "site_name": "The National Law Review", "type": "article", "description": "Early into the 114th&amp;nbsp;Congress, multiple bills have already been introduced that would repeal the insurance industry&amp;rsquo;s limited antitrust exemption granted by the McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 US", "title": "Congress Begins With Renewed Efforts to Repeal Insurer\u2019s Antitrust Exemption"}, "keywords": "legal, business, government, antitrust, insurer, McCarran-Ferguson Act", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "legal, business, government, antitrust, insurer, McCarran-Ferguson Act"}, "article_summary": "On January 6, Representative John Conyers (D-Mich.) introduced the \u201cHealth Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2015,\u201d (H.R.\nTuesday, March 3, 2015Early into the 114th Congress, multiple bills have already been introduced that would repeal the insurance industry\u2019s limited antitrust exemption granted by the McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 USC 1011 et seq.).\nRepresentative Gosar\u2019s bill would only eliminate the exemption as to health insurers.\nNotably, the bill would not eliminate the exemption with respect to other lines of insurance, and is similar to McCarran repeal bills that Representative Conyers has introduced in prior sessions of Congress.\n494 have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further action."}
