PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — A rally was staged today outside 30th Street Station, in West Philadelphia, calling on elected officials in Washington, DC to repeal the 2.3-percent tax on medical devices instituted by the Affordable Care Act.

Among the Republican US congressmen on stage in support of the repeal of that component of Obamacare was Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.).

“We’ve got to stop it!” he said. “We appreciate your support. Let’s cut the tax.”

He was joined by fellow Pennsylvania GOP congressmen Charlie Dent and Ryan Costello.

The rally was organized by Pennsylvania Bio, a statewide trade association representing the life sciences industry.

The organization’s president and CEO says the tax is a job-killing, innovation-stifling mistake by Congress and President Obama, and they want a recall of that piece of the Affordable Care Act.
