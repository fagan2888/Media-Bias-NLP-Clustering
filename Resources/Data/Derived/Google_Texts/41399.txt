Two men were arrested after refusing to comply and getting into a physical altercation with a Florida Highway Patrol trooper early Sunday morning.

According to a report, a trooper saw a car traveling at a high rate of speed and squealing its tires. The car entered a 7-Eleven gas station on US-41 at Littleton Road in North Fort Myers at around 12:16 a.m.

Once in the parking lot, the trooper confronted the driver, identified as 22-year-old Jose Crismatt, as he exited his vehicle.

Crismatt ignored the trooper. Meanwhile, a second vehicle, driven by 20-year-old Alexander Crismatt, pulled into the same parking lot.

The trooper told Alexander Crismatt not to interfere with the traffic stop and to leave.

Alexander Crismatt refused and both men approached the trooper in an aggressive manner; which led to a physical altercation.

Jose Crismatt was arrested on scene. Alexander Crismatt fled the scene in his vehicle, but later turned himself in to authorities.

Both men were charged with battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest.

The trooper suffered minor injures, but was not taken to the hospital.

The incident is under investigation.
