Joe Donnelly addresses a Jefferson-Jackson Day reception Saturday at the home of Mayor Sue Murray and her husband Dave.

Joe Donnelly, making his first official visit to Greencastle since his 2012 election, and John Dale, trying to score his own upset victory and head to Washington to represent Putnam County and the rest of the 4th District in the U.S. Congress.\n\nDonnelly asked the group, \"Who are we as Democrats?\"\n\n\"We are inclusive,\" he suggested, \"and we are the party that looks to the future.\"\n\nNationally, he said, the party has been about creating job opportunities and investing in infrastructure while pioneering affordable health care for all Americans.\n\nAnd Hoosier Democrats, the senator said, embrace \"making our young people feel welcome in their hometown.\" That's no matter what path they may have chosen or who they may have chosen to travel it with, Donnelly assured.\n\nGreencastle, he said, epitomizes that Hoosier spirit. \"You have such a magic combination here in this town,\" he said. \"This is just a time where you look around and say, 'Greencastle has cracked the code. Putnam County has cracked the code.'\n\n\"You have a wonderful university and a great, growing downtown.\"\n\nPutnam County Democrats not only had a chance to hear from a sitting U.S. senator Saturday afternoon as Sen. Joe Donnelly (above, left) visits Greencastle Saturday but also from District 4 U.S. House of Representatives candidate John Dale (left photo) during the Jefferson-Jackson Day reception.

Health care costs have risen at their lowest rate in 40 years.\"\n\nDiabetics \"can actually get health care\" now, he said, even hearing a couple of personal stories from within the room about Hoosiers receiving health care coverage for the first time in 20 years or more.\n\nThe senator acknowledged that the argument over the health care system persists in Washington, but added, \"We all agree, let's fix it. Let's make it better so it works for everybody.\"\n\nMeanwhile, first-time candidate John Dale, who won the May Democratic primary in Indiana's 4th District by defeating Putnam County resident Jeff Blaydes and three others, will be challenging incumbent Republican Todd Rokita for his U.S. House seat in the fall.\n\nA Western Boone High School teacher and wrestling coach, Dale brought his \"John Dale on the Trail\" district tour to town Saturday, asserting his belief that Congressman Rokita is \"putting his own interests first\" before those of fellow residents of Indiana's 4th District.\n\nDonnelly chats with Putnam County Chairman and Greencastle City Council President Adam Cohen while local resident Teresa Batto listens intently prior to the senator's remarks at the annual party fundraiser.
