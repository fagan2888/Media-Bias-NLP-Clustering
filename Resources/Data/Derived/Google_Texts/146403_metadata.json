I now just cannot wait to get started.\u201d\n\nDi Maria\u2019s transfer fee breaks the previous British record of 50 million pounds (then $81 million), set in 2011 when Fernando Torres joined Chelsea from Liverpool. Four players \u2014 Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Suarez and James Rodriguez \u2014 have cost more than Di Maria in world football, while Zinedine Zidane moved from Juventus to Madrid for a similar fee in euro terms in 2001.\n\n\u201cAngel is a world-class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cThere is no doubting his immense natural talent. He is a tremendously fast and incisive left-footed player who puts fear into the most accomplished defense.\n\n\u201cHis dribbling skills and his ability to take on and beat opponents are a joy to watch. He is an excellent addition to the team.\u201d\n\nThe left-footed Di Maria, who can play anywhere across the midfield, will provide United with an injection of pace and technical ability in that area. Both attributes were lacking last season under David Moyes, when the team slumped to a seventh-place finish in the Premier League, and in the first two games of this season under Van Gaal.\n\nIt is also a statement by United that the club can attract one of the world\u2019s most talented players despite not being in the Champions League this season. United isn\u2019t even playing in the Europa League.\n\nCritics say Van Gaal hasn\u2019t addressed the team\u2019s biggest weakness \u2014 a defense that lost three pillars in Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra this summer and has looked vulnerable in a 2-1 home loss to Swansea and a 1-1 draw at Sunderland in the two games so far in the Dutchman\u2019s reign.\n\nBut it is the kind of marquee signing United fans have been craving. The prospect of Di Maria linking up with attacking trio Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata is an enticing one as the team bids to return to the league\u2019s top four and get back in the Champions League.\n\nDi Maria was man of the match in last season\u2019s Champions League final against Atletico Madrid and one of Argentina\u2019s best players at the World Cup in Brazil until he hurt his thigh in the quarterfinal win over Belgium, forcing him to miss the semifinal and final.\n\nHe joined Real Madrid from Benfica in 2010, when he was an out-and-out winger. At Madrid last season, coach Carlo Ancelotti also played him as a central midfielder. Under contract until 2018 at Madrid, Di Maria faced increased competition in midfield following the signings of Rodriguez and Toni Kroos, and had been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nLeft back Luke Shaw, central midfielder Ander Herrera and defender Marcos Rojo are the other players to have moved to Old Trafford this summer in deals worth around 70 million pounds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 26-year-old Di Maria joined on a five-year contract, taking United's spending to about 130 million pounds ($215 million) in the summer transfer window as England's most successful club seeks to revive its fortunes under new manager Louis van Gaal.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The 26-year-old Di Maria joined on a five-year contract, taking United\u2019s spending to about 130 million pounds ($215 million) in the summer transfer window as England\u2019s most successful club seeks to revive its fortunes under new manager Louis van Gaal.", "title": "Angel Di Maria signs with Manchester United, leaving Real Madrid", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/26/angel-di-maria-signs-manchester-united-leaving-rea/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/26/ap784410424795.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/26/ap784410424795.jpg", "title": "Angel Di Maria signs with Manchester United, leaving Real Madrid", "description": "The 26-year-old Di Maria joined on a five-year contract, taking United's spending to about 130 million pounds ($215 million) in the summer transfer window as England's most successful club seeks to re", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, Louis Van Gaal, Madrid"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fb0\"", "article_summary": "Under contract until 2018 at Madrid, Di Maria faced increased competition in midfield following the signings of Rodriguez and Toni Kroos, and had been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain.\nMANCHESTER, England \u2014 Manchester United broke the British transfer-fee record by signing Angel Di Maria from Real Madrid for 59.7 million pounds ($99 million) on Tuesday, extending a summer spending spree that was sparked by its most disappointing season in a generation.\nHe is an excellent addition to the team.\u201dThe left-footed Di Maria, who can play anywhere across the midfield, will provide United with an injection of pace and technical ability in that area.\nSEE ALSO: Frank Lampard retires from England international duty\u201cI have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Spain and there were a lot of clubs interested in me, but United is the only club that I would have left Real Madrid for,\u201d Di Maria said.\n\u201cAngel is a world-class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player,\u201d Van Gaal said."}
