Bernie Sanders \u2013 preferring to keep her\n\nrhetoric focused on Trump by implying a need to unite against him.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about what\u2019s at stake \u2026 even if I weren\u2019t running for president, I would be doing everything I could to make sure the\n\npresumptive nominee in the Republican Party never gets near the White House,\u201d Hillary said.\n\nHillary spent some of her speech highlighting the work of some local politicians, such as Sen. Barbara Boxer, who accompanied Hillary to the stage at about 4:15 p.m. Friday.\n\nBoxer, who was hosting a private fundraiser for Hillary with Sen. Dianne Feinstein later in the day, said Oakland was full of support for\n\nHillary.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to search hard to see any votes for what\u2019s his name \u2026 he\u2019ll wish he was back in Trump Tower,\u201d Boxer said.\n\nIn speaking of Boxer later, Hillary said she\u2019d be \u201cbe calling her a lot\u201d for her expertise if she were to be elected president.\n\nHillary also mentioned Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who had made a speech shortly before Hillary took the stage.\n\nSchaaf, like Boxer, shied away from attacking Sanders in her speech but did say the country needed \u201cnot just a leader that has great and\n\nbeautiful ideas but has the grit \u2026 and the know-how to get them done.\u201d\n\nThe only time Hillary brought up Sanders, whose supporters gathered in small numbers outside the venue and chanted the senator\u2019s name to those exiting after the event concluded, was to attack his goal for eliminating higher education costs after touting her plan.\n\n\u201cMy esteemed opponent has a plan for what he says will be free (college),\u201d Hillary said. \u201cIf you read the fine print \u2026 it\u2019s free for\n\neveryone, even billionaires.\u201d She also claimed that she was the \u201conly candidate on either side who (promised to) not raise middle class taxes, period.\u201d\n\nShe mentioned that the next president should \u201cfollow the example of California\u201d and raise the federal minimum wage, though she did not specify whether it should match the state\u2019s minimum wage of $15, effective 2023, as Sanders has argued.\n\nOn a variety of issues, Hillary tied her own vision for the presidency to that of President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWe have to finish the work the president started on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Hillary said to a resounding cheer, before the jeers came when she added, \u201cTrump says he\u2019s going repeal it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019d replace it with because it\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t like to hear,\u201d she added.\n\nShe said she was proud of Obama\u2019s economic record, but admitted, \u201cwe have to go further.\u201d She mentioned high-paying jobs, investments in\n\ninfrastructure and women\u2019s issues as areas that need improvement. And she took every opportunity to contrast her own vision with\n\nthat of Trump\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think much of equal pay for women, because of course he doesn\u2019t think much of women,\u201d she said.\n\nStressing disparities in foreign policy ideas between her and Trump, Hillary said the country was facing a \u201cmake-or-break election\u201d in\n\nchoosing the next Commander in Chief.\n\n\u201cSome of what I\u2019m hearing from Trump is quite concerning,\u201d she said, referencing discussions about allowing countries have nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cHe talks about it as if it\u2019s some real estate deal.\u201d\n\nShe winded down her speech with a series of vows that were met with roaring applause, such as battling money in politics and the gun lobby.\n\nAfter leaving the venue, Hillary was scheduled to attend two sold-out fundraisers in San Francisco before continuing on the campaign\n\ntrail.\n\nNow it can be told: @HillaryClinton makes surprise stop at her NorCal office in #Oakland to thank volunteers pic.twitter.com/8LXbrXUtWn \u2014 Doug Sovern (@SovernNation) May 6, 2016\n\nFriday\u2019s visit to the Bay Area is the continuation of a California campaign swing for Clinton. On Thursday, the frontrunner spoke in East Los Angeles, where she took swipes at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and his stances on immigration.\n\nSeveral protesters heckled Clinton during her Southern California appearance, while 100 people protested outside on a variety of issues.\n\n\u2022 ALSO READ: Central Valley School Vandalized With Pro-Trump Graffiti On Cinco De Mayo\n\nAs of Friday, Clinton had 2,205 delegates and superdelegates, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders has 1,401 delegates and superdelegates.\n\nDespite an uphill climb for the Democratic nomination, Sanders has pledged additional staff in California and plans to make appearances in Sacramento and Stockton next week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One month before the California primary, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton visited a school in Oakland Friday afternoon.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/05/06/hillary-clinton-campaign-visit-oakland-la-escuelita/", "image": {"width": 768, "secure_url": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/a-hillary-rally.jpg?w=768", "identifier": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/a-hillary-rally.jpg?w=768", "height": 432}, "type": "article", "description": "One month before the California primary, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton visited a school in Oakland Friday afternoon.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Makes Campaign Visit In Oakland"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/a-hillary-rally.jpg?w=768", "title": "Hillary Clinton Makes Campaign Visit In Oakland", "site": "cbssf", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "One month before the California primary, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton visited a school in Oakland Friday afternoon."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of SF", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS San Francisco", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "hillary clinton, campaign 2016, oakland", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/73943609873d357bc6a7462619ad7be9?s=16", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Campaign 2016, Oakland"}, "article_summary": "Stressing disparities in foreign policy ideas between her and Trump, Hillary said the country was facing a \u201cmake-or-break election\u201d inchoosing the next Commander in Chief.\nHillary also mentioned Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who had made a speech shortly before Hillary took the stage.\nBoxer, who was hosting a private fundraiser for Hillary with Sen.
