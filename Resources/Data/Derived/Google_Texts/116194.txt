This is the sugar-laden reality we’re living in: The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that it’s issuing new guidelines aimed at keeping the definition of “honey” applicable only to pure honey.

Not honey-plus-sugar. Not honey-plus-corn syrup. Just honey.

Because apparently, that’s not what’s been happening. From the Associated Press:

The agency said enforcement action is possible against U.S. food businesses or importers if companies try to cut those sweeteners into real honey and do not label the product correctly. If those sweeteners are added, the label should read “blend of sugar and honey” or “blend of honey and corn syrup.” The FDA regularly detains honey imports and tests them after finding drug residues and unlabeled added sweeteners.
