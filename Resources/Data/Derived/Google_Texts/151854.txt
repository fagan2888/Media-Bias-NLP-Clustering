THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The former president of Ivory Coast must stand trial on charges of crimes against humanity allegedly committed during the months he clung to power after losing elections, a panel of judges at the International Criminal Court ruled Thursday.

Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo is charged with orchestrating violence carried out by his supporters after Ivory Coast’s 2010 elections. He denies wrongdoing.

Prosecutors say he is responsible for murders, rapes, persecution and inhumane acts against supporters of his political rival — now president — Alassane Ouattara, during five months of violence when Gbagbo refused to accept defeat.

A panel of three judges said in a majority ruling there is “substantial grounds to believe” Gbagbo committed the crimes he is charged with. No trial date has been set.
