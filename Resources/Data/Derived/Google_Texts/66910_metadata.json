The row over social issues also obscured strong support for the measure\u2019s core provisions aimed at combating sex slavery.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cHelp is finally on the way for the thousands of enslaved victims who suffer unspeakable abuse in the shadows,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re relieved we can finally say it will pass today.\u201d\n\nWhen the bill hit the Senate floor, Democrats raised objections after failing to notice the abortion restrictions in committee. Things got heated when McConnell tied passage of the bill to Loretta Lynch\u2019s confirmation vote and Democrats lambasted Republicans for holding up the president\u2019s pick to head the Justice Department.\n\nBut after several rounds of breakneck negotiations over the past week, both parties agreed to move past the embarrassing episode by compromising on a rewrite of the abortion language.\n\nThe legislation offers new resources to human trafficking victims, increases fines on the promoters of sex slavery, creates block grants for juvenile trafficking victims and gives law enforcement new tools to combat the trafficking trade. Those components have consistently drawn support from all 100 senators; it was only the bill\u2019s abortion restrictions that produced a tense, partisan floor fight.\n\nIn the initial version of the bill, money for victims came from fines, not the government\u2019s general fund. But the fine money was subject to Hyde amendment prohibitions on spending federal dollars on abortions, which Democrats worried was an expansion of Hyde\u2019s reach.\n\nThe solution reached by party leaders was to funnel money into the restitution account from two streams: Fines on traffickers for legal services and from the general fund for health care, where it\u2019s already subject to the Hyde abortion restrictions.\n\nSenators admitted that the bill hadn\u2019t changed much from its initial, non-controversial form, and most lawmakers were eager to move on.\n\n\u201cThis is called democracy. It\u2019s all about the end result. We couldn\u2019t get it passed and now we\u2019re going to pass it,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nThe compromise and the descriptions of the legislation by party leaders elicited contrasting responses from abortion activists, with Planned Parenthood praising Democratic leaders\u2019 for holding the line on the Hyde amendment and NARAL Pro-Choice America panning the compromise because it \u201cstill denies the most vulnerable women necessary access to vital health services.\u201d The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List backed the compromise.\n\nParty leaders also drew contrasting lessons from the debacle. Democrats said they\u2019ve proven to McConnell that when they stick together the GOP will get nothing, while McConnell said his unusual tactic of linking Lynch\u2019s nomination to the trafficking bill was ultimately successful and he had no regrets.\n\nBut members of the rank and file said the idea of sorting winners and losers from the ugly conflict was impossible. The biggest lesson learned might be that social issues like abortion can still cripple the Senate \u2014 and cause a high-profile nomination to languish weeks longer than it otherwise would have.\n\n\u201cPeople had strong principled feelings about it. No one was sitting around going: \u2018We\u2019ve got a strategy to make them look bad,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). \u201cWe just stood our ground. And unfortunately Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination was a victim of that process, which it never should have been.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The vote is 99-0.", "title": "Senate passes trafficking bill, paves way for Lynch vote", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/senate-passes-trafficking-bill-loretta-lynch-vote-117245.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/01/20150401_loretta_lynch_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Senate,Eric Holder,Loretta Lynch,Attorney General,Human Trafficking,Department Of Justice", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The vote is 99-0.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2aa4\"", "article_summary": "Senate passes trafficking bill, paves way for Lynch vote The unanimous 99-0 vote belied much of the drama behind the legislation.\nThe legislation offers new resources to human trafficking victims, increases fines on the promoters of sex slavery, creates block grants for juvenile trafficking victims and gives law enforcement new tools to combat the trafficking trade.\nThe Senate passed a bill aimed at combating human trafficking on Wednesday afternoon, putting to rest six weeks of gridlock over abortion politics and clearing the way for Loretta Lynch to be confirmed as the next attorney general.\n\u201cWe\u2019re relieved we can finally say it will pass today.\u201dWhen the bill hit the Senate floor, Democrats raised objections after failing to notice the abortion restrictions in committee.\nIn the initial version of the bill, money for victims came from fines, not the government\u2019s general fund."}
