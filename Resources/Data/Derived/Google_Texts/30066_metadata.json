Please reconsider your actions and rescind this resolution.\u201d\n\nCurrent students also registered their dissatisfaction with the resolution, saying the resolution does not represent the student body as a whole.\n\n\u201cAs much as I hope that their decision gets vetoed and that the administration will take some accountability for allowing such a controversial issue to be voted on in the first place, I also hope that people will stop generalizing us and saying that they will refuse to hire UCI students or that the generous donations of our alumni will fall, or even worse that we are not proud Americans. The majority of us would be proud to stand out there and wave the flag ourselves if need be,\u201d another commenter said.\n\nThe UCI administration issued a statement saying \u201cthis misguided decision was not endorsed or supported in any way by the campus leadership, the University of California, or the broader student body.\u201d\n\nStudent-body President Reza Zomorrodian also publicly opposed the legislation, leading the Executive Cabinet of student government to convene on Saturday to veto the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe fundamentally disagree with the actions taken by ASUCI Legislative Council and their passage of R50-70 as counter to the ideals that allow us to operate as an autonomous student government organization with the freedoms of speech and expression associated with it,\u201d the executive cabinet said in a statement. \u201cIt is these very symbols that represent our constitutional rights that have allowed for our representative creation and our ability to openly debate all ranges of issues and pay tribute to how those liberties were attained.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "33.683947;-117.794694", "description": "(CNN) -- Student leaders at the University of California-Irvine vetoed a resolution on Saturday that would have banned hanging flags of any nation, including America's Stars and Stripes, in the lobby of student government offices, amid widespread criticism from students and alumni.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "ab9b95eb1a995697f3c88253f276fa87"}, "og": {"site_name": "fox8.com", "description": "(CNN) \u2014 Student leaders at the University of California-Irvine vetoed a resolution on Saturday that would have banned hanging flags of any nation, including America\u2019s Stars and Stripes,\u2026", "title": "American flag ban vetoed by student leaders at University of California at Irvine", "url": "http://fox8.com/2015/03/08/american-flag-ban-vetoed-by-student-leaders-at-university-of-california-at-irvine/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/american-flag-e1336488884478.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwjw.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/american-flag-e1336488884478.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox8news", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox8news"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324686068", "fb": {"pages": 74758790293}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/ea8bceb705ffdd1b50e02de092ee74b4?s=16", "application-name": "fox8.com", "ICBM": "33.683947, -117.794694", "keywords": "news, veto of american flag", "google-site-verification": "RrRVvAvDXFfRHU6-TtZJh28fqDSaZbTLz1xSvv0udQ8", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Fox8NewsCleveland", "published_time": "2015-03-08T19:06:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-08T19:06:08+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Fox8NewsCleveland"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0ef\"", "article_summary": "Please reconsider your actions and rescind this resolution.\u201dCurrent students also registered their dissatisfaction with the resolution, saying the resolution does not represent the student body as a whole.\n(CNN) \u2014 Student leaders at the University of California-Irvine vetoed a resolution on Saturday that would have banned hanging flags of any nation, including America\u2019s Stars and Stripes, in the lobby of student government offices, amid widespread criticism from students and alumni.\nThe majority of us would be proud to stand out there and wave the flag ourselves if need be,\u201d another commenter said.\nThe Legislative Council of the Associated Students of the University of California, Irvine\u2019s passed the resolution, \u201cFlags and decoration adjustment for inclusivity,\u201d in a 6-4 vote Tuesday with the stated intention of creating a \u201cmore inclusive\u201d environment.\n\u201cAs a military veteran, American citizen and taxpayer, I find this piece of \u2018legislation\u2019 highly offensive,\u201d a commenter said on the ASUCI \u2018s Facebook student page, in one of the more mildly worded complaints."}
