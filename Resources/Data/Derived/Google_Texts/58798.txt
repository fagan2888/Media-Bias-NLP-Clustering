Health Paul Ryan: Budget Deal Will Allow House To Focus More On Obamacare Repeal CREDIT: Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI)

On NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday, House Budget Chair Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Budget Chair Patty Murray (D-WA) extolled their bipartisan budget deal, which will spare the nation from more government shutdowns over the next two years. But Ryan also suggested that it will help the House GOP’s never-ending attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Asked by host David Gregory about how Obamacare could possibly survive given that one poll showed 50 percent opposition, Murray told a story about a woman she recently met with a 29 year old son with a disability. With her son now able to obtain insurance thanks to the law, the mother explained, she is able to sleep at night for the first time in a long time. As people see the law implemented, Murray explained, they would like it more.

Ryan responded that that America needs to get rid of the law and that the GOP would replace it with something that prevented discrimination based on preexisting conditions — but one that would not require a “government takeover.”

The unsuccessful 2012 vice presidential nominee then argued that this budget deal will allow the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to focus more on getting rid of Obamacare:

RYAN: On our side of the aisle, we like the fact for the economy, no shutdowns. We also don’t want to have shutdown drama so we can focus on replacing Obamacare, so we can focus on showing better ideas and what this is coming in. Cause we don’t think people like this law and we don’t think it’s gonna get any more popular. We don’t agree on this. So each of us gets something out of this that we think is good.

Polling has consistently shown that voters do not support a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But Ryan and the House Republican majority has already voted more than 40 times to repeal the healthcare reform law.
