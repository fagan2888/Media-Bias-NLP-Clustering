Both senators are clearly interested in becoming the 2016 nominee, and the New York Times reports that they're more than willing to backstab the other to make it happen. This isn't too surprising, but that doesn't mean it won't be fun to watch these two grandstanders duke it out.\n\nAccording to the Times, Cruz threw a punch this summer, when he told a room full of Republican donors that Paul \"can never be elected president...because he can never fully detach himself from the strident libertarianism of his father, former Representative Ron Paul of Texas.\" Cruz's comments got back to Paul, \"touching off anger and resentment.\" Paul's team now reportedly refers to Cruz as \"the chief of the wacko birds\" (credit: John McCain.) And, like many others, Paul \u2014 who voted with Cruz during his suicide mission defund Obamacare \u2014 has privately complained that the effort was \"futile\" and \"damaging\" to the GOP.\n\nMeanwhile, the Times reports that Paul is trying to establish himself as less wacko bird by hanging out with mainstream Republican donors while also attempting to endear himself to Cruz's ultra-conservative base. At a recent meeting of evangelical pastors in Michigan, someone asked Paul, who was raised as an Episcopalian, to confirm that he would \"define [himself] as born again.\" He did, but at least one attendee still seemed to prefer Cruz, who attended the same gathering with his pastor father and \"is obviously born again.\" However, the day before, Paul's wife, Kelley, reportedly impressed the audience by \"talking in our kind of language.\" Don't be surprised to hear that same language coming out of Paul's mouth pretty soon.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "In fact, it doesn't really seem like they're buddies now.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "In fact, it doesn't really seem like they're buddies now.", "title": "Ted Cruz and Rand Paul Probably Won\u2019t Be Friends for Much Longer", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/cruz-and-pauls-friendship-probably-wont-last.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/02/02-paul-cruz.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In fact, it doesn't really seem like they're buddies now.", "creator": "@teamcaroline", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/02/02-paul-cruz.w190.h190.2x.jpg", "title": "Cruz and Paul\u2019s Friendship Probably Won\u2019t Last", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "its never too early to talk about 2016, politics, rand paul, ted cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "it's never too early to talk about 2016,politics,rand paul,ted cruz", "published_time": "2013-11-02T19:00:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, its never too early to talk about 2016, politics, rand paul, ted cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "Paul's team now reportedly refers to Cruz as \"the chief of the wacko birds\" (credit: John McCain.)\nBoth senators are clearly interested in becoming the 2016 nominee, and the New York Times reports that they're more than willing to backstab the other to make it happen.\nHowever, the day before, Paul's wife, Kelley, reportedly impressed the audience by \"talking in our kind of language.\"\nThis isn't too surprising, but that doesn't mean it won't be fun to watch these two grandstanders duke it out.\nDon't be surprised to hear that same language coming out of Paul's mouth pretty soon."}
