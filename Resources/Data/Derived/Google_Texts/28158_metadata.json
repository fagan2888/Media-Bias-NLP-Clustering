It may not be too much to say that, over the course of their careers, they made each other \u2014 and shaped the standards for modern art in the twentieth century. In the midst of the landmark international exhibition Matisse Picasso in 2003, many observers set the artists against each other, casting their rivalry as a \u201cchess game\u201d (Smithsonian) or a \u201cduel\u201d (New York Times). \u201cEach time I visited the show at the Tate,\u201d wrote the art historian John Richardson in Vanity Fair, \u201cacquaintances would come up and ask me whether I thought Matisse or Picasso was the winner. \u2018You idiot \u2014 you are missing the point,\u2019 I told one of them. \u2018The show is not a boxing match.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut what, then, to call it? \u201cAccording to most of the contributors to the catalogue,\u201d Richardson wrote, \u201cit is more of a dialogue, although, considering the number of sparks these two artists strike off of each other \u2014 sparks that illuminate so much in the work of both \u2014 the word \u2018dialogue\u2019 seems too tame.\u201d He finally suggested calling them \u201csecret sharers,\u201d after the short story by Joseph Conrad.\n\nThe trouble here isn\u2019t merely semantic. It actually represents a real conceptual challenge. To understand competition as a creative force, we can first look to its potential to spur us on and lead us to strange attachments with those we oppose, as with the sports rivalries between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, or Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. Basketball and tennis here serve as useful metaphors and reliable illustrations of finite games \u2014 discrete, measurable encounters, like elections or fights for market share. These contests articulate something essential about how people go toe to toe.\n\nYet, just as students must master algebra to take on calculus, we must grasp competition to look beyond it. Most creative work does not post to a scoreboard. Encounters that end with a winner and a loser are rarely the most interesting \u2014 even in sports. Any fan who has ever muttered, with a broken heart, \u201cWe\u2019ll get them next year,\u201d knows that any one matchup \u2014 no matter how much it matters \u2014 is embedded in an ongoing narrative.\n\nThe critical distinction, as developed by the philosopher James Carse, is between the finite game and the infinite game. \u201cA finite game is played for the purpose of winning,\u201d Carse wrote, \u201can infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.\u201d Where finite games follow predetermined rules, intended to eliminate players until one stands on top alone, infinite games are constantly adjusted so that both players can remain standing. Where finite games are impersonal and hew to established forms, infinite games are peculiar to their players and grow increasingly distinct. Finite games are like formal debate, where artificial constraints impose order. Infinite games are like the grammar of a living language, where organic growth magnifies complexity. Where finite games hinge on competition, infinite games operate at the intersection of competition and cooperation.\n\nMotivated as we are to spot enemies and define ourselves against them, these intersecting qualities can be hard to see. Consider the moment in 1997 when Steve Jobs returned to Apple and announced at Macworld Expo that he had negotiated a $150 million investment from Microsoft, settled lawsuits between the two tech giants, and pledged to make Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer the default web browser on Macintosh computers. Along with scant applause, boos and hisses rolled through the crowd; in one video, we see a man cover his face with his hands in amazed dismay. Microsoft had become, in the eyes of many Mac loyalists, the Evil Empire. To Apple\u2019s faithful, Jobs\u2019s announcement felt like Luke Skywalker kneeling before Darth Vader.\n\nBut Microsoft and Apple had long been more like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo \u2014 compatriots in an uneasy alliance. They were actually allies first. In 1978 the Apple II shipped with a version of BASIC software developed by Microsoft, tweaked by Apple, and given the mash-up name Apple-soft BAS IC. In 1983, Gates played along with a mock version of The Dating Game that Jobs hosted to celebrate the Macintosh, and Gates noted onstage that the next year he expected half of Microsoft\u2019s revenue to come from Macintosh applications.\n\nOnly later did their central competition emerge, over the market share for their distinct operating systems. Then, just as Microsoft seemed poised for a triumph, it stepped in to aid Apple, eschewing victory in one arena for broader benefits that included ongoing profits from its Mac software and a critical boost Apple could give it in its war against Netscape. (The browser wars appear quaint now but seemed critical at the time.)\n\nCoopetition in business \u2014 which the Financial Times defines as \u201ccombining the advantages of\u201d cooperation and competition to create \u201ca bigger market in complementary areas\u201d\u2014 is common. Think of multiple gas stations at the same intersection \u2014 the customers each station loses are more than offset by increased awareness of the product \u2014 or rival movie studios jointly financing a picture. Toyota and PSA Peugeot Citroe\u00c5Nn made a minicar together and marketed it under different names. Philips and Sony ran the R&D together to create the compact disc.\n\nBut the coexistence of cooperation and competition is more than institutional. It\u2019s basic to human relations and the human psyche. Everyone, the psychologist Elaine Aron explains, has two primary relational impulses: to link, or find common ground, and to rank, or establish hierarchical positions.\n\nEven this language may understate the universality of the phenomenon, because it suggests extremes of connection or opposition. But each quality may manifest in far more subtle ways. At bottom, cooperation is a tendency, wrote the author V. Frank Asaro, to \u201cunite, bind, attract, or be orderly or collective.\u201d Cooperation is often implicit, as when two people agree to play by the rules of a game or when people obey laws or customs. Competition, meanwhile, is any action contrary to others \u2014 any move to \u201cseparate, break apart, disunite, be chaotic, or become individualistic.\u201d Considered in this broad way, competition doesn\u2019t need to be a knockout punch or a lacerating attack. It could be a mischievous shove or a pointed criticism.\n\nMost members of pairs are in coopetition most of the time \u2014 though they may not know it. When I asked the novelist Sheila Heti if she felt competition with her creative partner, the painter and filmmaker Margaux Williamson, she wrote me: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Because we have different mediums. How does a writer compete with a painter?\u201d\n\nShe went on: \u201cBut I can be urged on to doing better work when I see that she\u2019s moving quickly in her work, or if her paintings are really great that week, then I can feel like I\u2019m falling behind or slacking off, and I want to do better in my work. I guess they call that \u2018healthy competition.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to \u2018beat\u2019 her but I don\u2019t want to fall behind.\u201d\n\nTwo things struck me in this response. First, comparison is a species of competition, insofar as it emerges from a sense of distinction and difference \u2014 the feeling of being stirred, provoked, swept along by a recognition of the other\u2019s separateness. William James calls this \u2014 I love the phrase \u2014\u201cthe emulous passion,\u201d and in an 1892 lecture to teachers, he enjoined them to take it seriously. \u201cThe feeling of rivalry,\u201d he said, \u201clies at the very basis of our being, all social improvement being largely due to it . . . The deepest spring of action in us is the sight of action in another.\n\nThe spectacle of effort is what awakens and sustains our own effort.\u201d Of course, he recognized that just as \u201cimitation slides into emulation, so emulation slides into Ambition; and ambition connects itself closely with Pugnacity and Pride.\u201d These five instinctive tendencies (\u201cthe ambitious impulses\u201d) can be hard to separate, he said, and he understood how pride and pugnacity ought be tempered. But even still, the potency of the feelings couldn\u2019t be ignored. \u201cPugnacity need not be thought of merely in the form of physical combativeness,\u201d James said.\n\nIt can be taken in the sense of a general unwillingness to be beaten by any kind of difficulty. It is what makes us feel \u201cstumped\u201d and challenged by arduous achievements, and is essential to a spirited and enterprising character. We have of late been hearing much of the philosophy of tenderness in education; \u201cinterest\u201d must be assiduously awakened in everything, difficulties must be smoothed away. Soft pedagogics have taken the place of the old steep and rocky path to learning. But from this lukewarm air the bracing oxygen of effort is left out. It is nonsense to suppose that every step in education can be interesting. The fighting impulse must often be appealed to. Make the pupil feel ashamed of being scared at fractions, of being \u201cdowned\u201d by the law of falling bodies; rouse his pugnacity and pride, and he will rush at the difficult places with a sort of inner wrath at himself that is one of his best moral faculties. A victory scored under such conditions becomes a turning-point and crisis of his character. It represents the high-water mark of his powers, and serves thereafter as an ideal pattern for his self-imitation. The teacher who never rouses this sort of pugnacious excitement in his pupils falls short of one of his best forms of usefulness.\n\nSheila Heti\u2019s description of \u201chealthy competition\u201d resonates with what James described here as a salutary pugnacity: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be left behind.\u201d But the critical point is that this sense of being roused and stimulated, this incitement of the \u201cfighting impulse\u201d that surely belongs in the category of ranking (\u201cI must not be left on the bottom\u201d) is also intricately entwined with the tendency of linking. My impression is that Heti\u2019s desire is not to get on top and stay there but to join her partner on a higher plane \u2014 or perhaps to go even higher, which would only spur on Margaux\u2019s emulous passions. This is the key play in the infinite game.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the fall of 1966, during a stretch of nine weeks away from the Beatles, John Lennon wrote a song on acoustic guitar. He was in rural Spain on the set of a movie called How I Won the War. He recorded his first demo there and a second in his home studio several weeks later. On November 24, he played it for the band and its engineers at the EMI Studios on Abbey Road in London. Four weeks later, after scores of hours of studio time, they had a final cut of \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever,\u201d and that\u2019s when Paul McCartney brought in the song that would become \u201cPenny Lane.\u201d\n\nIt was a practice, Paul said, of he and John \u201canswering each other\u2019s songs.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019d write \u2018Strawberry Fields,\u2019 \u201d Paul said, \u201cI\u2019d go away and write \u2018Penny Lane\u2019 . . . to compete with each other. But it was very friendly competition because we were both going to share in the rewards anyway . . . But it was this\u201d\u2014 Paul stretched his hands out so the fingers faced each other and put one above the other until both were over his head. \u201cWe\u2019d get better and better all the time.\u201d\n\nThe metaphor \u201canswering each other\u201d is apt, because John and Paul worked together \u2014 and opposed each other \u2014 like a great piece of dialogue. John\u2019s song was set in one of the most memorable spots of his childhood, the Strawberry Field orphanage, whose sprawling grounds he\u2019d often visited with his aunt Mimi or other kids in his gang. The song placed a narrator in situ, not just singing about a place but taking us there, singing from there, asking questions that had preoccupied him since he was five years old: whether life is real or a dream; whether he was alone in the world in his own \u201ctree\u201d; whether he was \u201chigh or low\u201d\u2014 above others or below them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Beatles, Apple and Microsoft, even Picasso and Matisse -- rivals made better and fueled by a great competitor", "author": "Joshua Wolf Shenk", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Beatles, Apple and Microsoft, even Picasso and Matisse -- rivals made better and fueled by a great competitor", "title": "I love you, I hate you, I need you!
