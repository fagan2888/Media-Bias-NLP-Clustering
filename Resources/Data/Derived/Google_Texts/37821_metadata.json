But Obamacare may be making these accounts more popular than ever (the law of unintended consequences at work). Here is what you need to know about HSAs, including the possible tax-saving impact on your 2014 Form 1040.\n\nGrowing popularity\n\nOpening up an HSA is the ultimate expression of taking responsibility for your own health-care costs instead of relying on your employer or the government. Plus, HSAs have some pretty nice tax advantages, which I will explain later.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Devenir (an HSA industry participant based in Minnesota), the number of HSA accounts reached 11.8 million at the midpoint of 2014, and HSA balances totaled $22.8 billion. These figures represented year-over-year increases of 29% and 26%, respectively. Health insurance plans were the leading driver of this trend, accounting for 31% of new account growth. Back in 2010, the Employee Benefit Research Institute reported that there were 5.7 million HSAs with account balances totaling $7.7 billion. So HSAs are obviously becoming more popular at a fairly rapid clip.\n\nThe benefits of exercise for all body types (2:10) Exercise has huge benefits to people even if they\u2019re overweight or obese.\n\nThe Obamacare effect\n\nWith the advent of Obamacare, health insurance plans are categorized as Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. Bronze plans have the highest deductibles and least-generous coverage and are therefore the most affordable. Platinum plans have no deductibles and cover much more, but they are also much more expensive.\n\nIn many cases, Obamacare has led to big premium increases even for those who prefer less-generous plans. For example, as an unmarried self-employed dude, I was paying $260 a month last year for a \u201cgrandfathered\u201d self-only policy with a $2,000 deductible and $5,000 out-of-pocket maximum. But my plan was canceled at the end of last year because it was not Obamacare-compliant. My new Obamacare-compliant Bronze plan costs $480 a month and has a $3,000 deductible and $6,450 out-of-pocket maximum. So I\u2019m paying 85% more for a plan that offers significantly less coverage. The only good news is that my current not-very-generous plan makes me eligible to open up and contribute to an HSA, which I intend to do. The resulting tax savings will partially offset the premium increase and the skimpier coverage. Lots of other folks are in the same boat as me, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a big factor in the growing popularity of HSAs.\n\nBasics on how HSAs work\n\nFor the 2015 tax year, you can make a deductible HSA contribution of up to $3,350 if you have qualifying self-only coverage or up to $6,650 if you have qualifying family coverage (anything other than self-only). For 2014, the magic numbers are $3,300 and $6,550, respectively. If you are age 55 or older as of yearend, the maximum deductible contribution goes up by $1,000. You can then take federal-income-tax-free HSA withdrawals to cover your eligible out-of-pocket medical costs.\n\nHowever, you must have a qualifying high-deductible health insurance policy (and no other general health coverage) to be eligible for the tax-saving HSA contribution privilege. For 2015, a high-deductible policy is defined as one with a deductible of at least $1,300 for self-only coverage or $2,600 for family coverage. For 2014, the minimum deductibles are $1,250 and $2,500, respectively. For 2015, qualifying policies can have out-of-pocket maximums of up to $6,450 for self-only coverage or $12,900 for family coverage. For 2014, the out-of-pocket maximums are $6,350 and $12,700, respectively.\n\nHSA deductible contribution basics\n\nIf you are eligible to make an HSA contribution for the tax year in question, you have until have April 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays) to open an account and make a deductible contribution for the earlier year. So if you had qualifying high-deductible coverage last year, you can take advantage by opening up an HSA and contributing to the account between now and April 15. Then you can claim your rightful deduction on your 2014 Form 1040. More good news: deductions are not phased out for those with high incomes.\n\nYou claim the HSA contribution write-off as an above-the-line deduction on page 1 of Form 1040, which means you don\u2019t have to itemize to benefit. Fill out IRS Form 8889, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), to figure your allowable deduction. You can find the form on the IRS website at www.irs.gov.\n\nWarnings: You cannot use HSA funds to reimburse yourself tax-free for medical expenses that were incurred before you opened the account. Also, if you take money out of your HSA for any reason other than to cover eligible medical expenses, you will owe federal income tax plus a 20% penalty tax. So you need to be sure you can afford to put money into the account and possibly leave it there for a while. If you are not sure, don\u2019t do it!\n\nHSA investment options and providers\n\nIn some important ways, HSAs are similar to IRAs. Both have the same contribution deadlines, both need an account custodian or trustee, and both can theoretically offer the same investment options (stocks, mutual funds, bonds, CDs, and so forth). That said, some HSA trustees may limit your investment choices to very conservative options, which is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nYou can find an HSA trustee with an Internet search. Some health insurance companies and brokerage firms have pre-arranged deals with HSA trustees. For example, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield has hooked up with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank to act as the trustee for their HSA-eligible policyholders. Vanguard customers can move funds into HSAs operated by a company called Health Savings Administrators. (This information is only offered as examples of what is available out there; I am not endorsing any of these outfits).\n\nThe last word\n\nIf the whole HSA deal strikes you as something the average Democrat in Washington would hate, you\u2019re right. When the Democrats controlled Congress in 2009 and 2010, there were noises about outlawing HSAs, and I was surprised that it didn\u2019t happen when Obamacare was enacted. Now, with the Republicans in charge of Congress, it appears HSAs will be around for a while. Consider taking advantage while you can.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP683_pfphon_MG_20131121171211.jpg", "height": 398}, "description": "The tax-saving impact of HSAs on your 2014 Form 1040.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Bill Bischoff", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The tax-saving impact of HSAs on your 2014 Form 1040.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-may-be-making-health-savings-accounts-more-popular-2015-02-10", "author": "Bill Bischoff", "parsely-title": "Obamacare may be making health savings accounts more popular", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-10T06:00:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The tax-saving impact of HSAs on your 2014 Form 1040.", "title": "Obamacare may be making health savings accounts more popular", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-may-be-making-health-savings-accounts-more-popular-2015-02-10", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP683_pfphon_MG_20131121171211.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP683_pfphon_MG_20131121171211.jpg"}, "article.id": "C49B2D28-B09A-11E4-85C9-70697EF1BF20", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1aa0\"", "article_summary": "The Obamacare effectWith the advent of Obamacare, health insurance plans are categorized as Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum.\nHowever, you must have a qualifying high-deductible health insurance policy (and no other general health coverage) to be eligible for the tax-saving HSA contribution privilege.\nI don\u2019t think the architects of Obamacare have much fondness for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).\nBut Obamacare may be making these accounts more popular than ever (the law of unintended consequences at work).\nFor 2015, qualifying policies can have out-of-pocket maximums of up to $6,450 for self-only coverage or $12,900 for family coverage."}
