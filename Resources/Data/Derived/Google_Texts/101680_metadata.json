And we are called to recognize and honor how critical every father is to that foundation,\u201d Obama said in a \u201cFatherhood speech\u201d in June of that year.\n\nBut in response to Bruce Jenner, a biological father of six, declaring he was actually female, Obama said, \u201cIt takes courage to share your story.\u201d Nothing was said about the impact such a bizarre declaration would have on one\u2019s children, or the condition of one\u2019s mental state to bring that about. Obama seemed to be endorsing genital mutilation as a way out of mental confusion or mental illness.\n\nObama\u2019s definition of family has certainly changed. Indeed, he was once in favor of marriage being between one man and one woman, and today he celebrates fatherless and motherless families. He lied about his commitment to traditional marriage in order to get elected. It was a big con, but only one of many deceptions from the candidate of \u201chope and change\u201d whose lasting legacy, as noted in Professor Paul Kengor\u2019s new book Takedown, could very well be cultural and not economic transformation. After all, parts of Obamacare could be repealed over time, and economic reforms could arrest our debt problem, which has accelerated under Obama. But restoring the traditional family is a mammoth undertaking that even Republican presidential candidates are generally afraid to talk about.\n\nSpeaking to the Apostolic Church of God in Chicago in that 2008 speech, Obama had quoted from the Bible and said to the congregation, \u201cif we are honest with ourselves\u201d they would have to admit that \u201ctoo many fathers\u2026[are] missing from too many lives and too many homes. They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men. And the foundations of our families are weaker because of it.\u201d\n\nBut the fact that \u201cBruce\u201d Jenner will go missing from that family is something that is now celebrated by Obama.\n\nIf Obama had told that black congregation that he would be a president who would go down in history as praising a man for dressing up like a woman, the audience would have probably laughed out loud, thinking it was a joke. Who could have anticipated that a man who once lectured the nation on the need for a strong father would later defend a father\u2019s decision to quit being one.\n\nAnother major deception from Obama was his claim that he never really had a father who was part of his life. In a 2013 Morehouse College address, he said, \u201cI was raised by a heroic single mom, wonderful grandparents\u2014made incredible sacrifices for me. And I know there are moms and grandparents here today who did the same thing for all of you. But I sure wish I had had a father who was not only present, but involved. Didn\u2019t know my dad. And so my whole life, I\u2019ve tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me. I want to break that cycle where a father is not at home\u2014(applause)\u2014where a father is not helping to raise that son or daughter. I want to be a better father, a better husband, a better man.\u201d\n\nFilmmaker Joel Gilbert says that Obama\u2019s comments about not having a father present in his childhood are 100 percent bogus, and that he had several fathers or father-figures.\n\nGilbert, director of the film, \u201cDreams from My Real Father,\u201d examines Obama\u2019s formative years and comes to the determination that the Communist Party member and suspected Soviet espionage agent, Frank Marshall Davis, was Obama\u2019s real biological father. He believes the Kenyan Obama was a \u201cfather in name only\u201d who was used to cover up an affair between Davis and Obama\u2019s mother. Gilbert added, \u201cObama\u2019s problem was not a lack of fathers, rather it was that his biological father became his ideological mentor and radicalized him into an anti-American ideology.\u201d\n\nWe broke the story in the U.S. that Davis was Obama\u2019s childhood mentor, a fact that The Washington Post still will not admit. Obama himself admits Davis \u201cschooled\u201d him on white racism. \u201cAll my research has indicated that Obama visited with Davis about three times per week during his entire youth from age 10 to 18,\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cDavis gave him money, taught him to drink whiskey, took him to strip clubs, and indoctrinated Obama during those formative years with his Communist view of the world.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Davis, however, Gilbert says Obama had other \u201cfathers\u201d or father figures. These included his grandfather, \u201cgramps,\u201d a constant father figure presence, and his adopted father, Lolo Soetoro, whom he stayed in touch with even after his mother divorced him. He adds, \u201cNever one to be without a father figure, Obama enlisted a [Frank Marshall Davis] carbon copy ideologue, whom he said \u2018was like an uncle.\u2019\u201d That was the notorious Reverend Jeremiah Wright, who functioned like a father to Obama after Frank Marshall Davis died. Like Davis, Wright was a vicious anti-American.\n\nThe idea that Davis is truly Obama\u2019s \u201creal father\u201d is certainly controversial and could only be solved definitively by DNA analysis. However, Gilbert recently interviewed Obama\u2019s half-brother, Malik Obama, who says that \u201cFrank Marshall Davis and Barack look alike,\u201d and that Barack does not look like his father, the Kenyan Obama. Comparison photos between Frank Marshall Davis and President Obama are indeed striking. Malik Obama says he would welcome a DNA test, and that this might explain why Barack dumped the Kenyan Obamas after he was elected President.\n\nOnce a strong proponent of the traditional meaning of Father\u2019s Day, in order to get elected to the presidency, Obama will now go down in history for demeaning this national celebration honoring fathers and fatherhood.\n\nConsider Barack Obama as the President who celebrated a man for acting and trying to look like a woman. At this rate, Father\u2019s Day cards will one day be sold in the \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d categories.\n\nThe impact on our young people from this presidential \u201cexample\u201d will be seen and felt in the years ahead: more sexual confusion, alienation from family, mental illness and suicides.\n\nThis is what progressive \u201cchange\u201d looks like.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "Obama had portrayed himself as a committed pro-family Christian who recognized the importance of male role models and fathers in the family structure.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Horrendous Father\u2019s Day Example", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7811068144_dd61720aec_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-18T20:19:57+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/obamas-horrendous-fathers-day-example/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "AIM Column", "published_time": "2015-06-18T20:19:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-18T20:19:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama had portrayed himself as a committed pro-family Christian who recognized the importance of male role models and fathers in the family structure.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Horrendous Father\u2019s Day Example", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/obamas-horrendous-fathers-day-example/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7811068144_dd61720aec_b.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19b5\"", "article_summary": "Consider Barack Obama as the President who celebrated a man for acting and trying to look like a woman.\nAt this rate, Father\u2019s Day cards will one day be sold in the \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d categories.\nComparison photos between Frank Marshall Davis and President Obama are indeed striking.\nThe idea that Davis is truly Obama\u2019s \u201creal father\u201d is certainly controversial and could only be solved definitively by DNA analysis.\nGilbert, director of the film, \u201cDreams from My Real Father,\u201d examines Obama\u2019s formative years and comes to the determination that the Communist Party member and suspected Soviet espionage agent, Frank Marshall Davis, was Obama\u2019s real biological father."}
