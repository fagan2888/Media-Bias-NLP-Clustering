In this case, he says this is a problem that he knew about and will be solved sometime in the future, absolving himself and his administration of all the problems he\u2019s caused in the meantime.\u201d\n\nByron York said the president\u2019s \u201copen door policy\u201d with his cabinet secretaries just isn\u2019t working. \u201cI think most management experts would say the president needs to seek out bad news, as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was his legacy law,\u201d Ham agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to look at this and go, \u2018How were you not watching this every step of the way and making sure that it went, at least, better than this.\u2019 And I think that was what many critics said when were going into Obamacare: \u2018This is quite a bit to bite off \u2014 are you sure you can handle it?\u2019 And it turns out, no, they couldn\u2019t. And that to me is a big problem that he\u2019s not taking responsibility for.\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
