Paris Hilton added to her fame for being famous when she purchased Mr. Amazing, alleged to be the tiniest Pomeranian in the world at 2.5 inches tall and 11.6 ounces, and fired off an Instagram photo showing the dog in the palm of her hand.

Speaking of large, an Icelandic “truth commission” has determined that a video back in 2012 did indeed catch Lagarfljótsormurinn, a legendary lake monster, and so the government has to pay out about $4,000 in reward money for the “proof.” Scientists claim the video shows fishing gear caught in a stream that appears to be moving because of the optical illusion created by the running water.
