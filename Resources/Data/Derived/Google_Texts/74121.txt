Kentucky Launches New Website, Benefind, for Assistance Programs

The site, Benefind, can be used to apply for Medicaid, the Kentucky Children’s Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program.

People applying for SNAP and KTAP are required to complete an interview with the Department for Community Based Services in order to receive assistance.

Through the new site, individuals can also renew benefits, check benefit amounts, report changes, upload verification documents, check claim status, make claim payments and receive electronic notices.

Benefind replaces Kynect, the state health insurance exchange, as the portal to enroll in some of the state’s assistance programs. Gov. Matt Bevin has plans to dismantle Kynect by the end of the year, which means Kentuckians signing up for health care through a marketplace would have to use the federal exchange.

The state received $289.3 million from the federal government to establish Kynect.

Federal officials notified Bevin that the state would have to return $57.5 million in unused federal funds left over from establishing Kynect. The leftover money cannot be used for ongoing operations of Kynect, nor can it be used for information technology costs associated with transition to the federal marketplace.
