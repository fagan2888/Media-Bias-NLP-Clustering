LONDON (AP) — David Cameron’s supporters paint him as a principled but pragmatic politician with a huge capacity for quick thinking and grace under pressure.

Opponents depict the 48-year-old Conservative leader as a privileged smoothie who hates to break a sweat.

Cameron, who has been Britain’s prime minister since 2010, is fighting for his political life in Thursday’s election, which polls say is too close to call. If he fails to win a second term against Labour’s Ed Miliband, he will almost certainly be dumped as Tory leader.

“I think he would be less devastated than most people, just because he is more of a human being than most politicians,” said James Hanning, co-author of the biography “Cameron: Practically a Conservative.”

Cameron is often depicted in the press as the prime minister who likes to “chillax.” Observers have struggled to pinpoint what he believes in, and what has driven him to the top of British politics.

The son of a stockbroker, Cameron attended Eton, the country’s most elite boarding school, which counts Princes William and Harry among its alumni.

At Oxford University, he studied politics, philosophy and economics and was a member of the Bullingdon Club, a rowdy dining-and-drinking society with a reputation for drunken vandalism.

After graduating, Cameron began work as a researcher for the Conservatives and rose quickly through the party, with a spell in PR for TV company Carlton Communications.
