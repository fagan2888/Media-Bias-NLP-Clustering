According to the feds, D\u2019Souza had knowingly wiggled his way around the $5,000 individual donation limit in order to provide Wendy Long, a college friend who was running for the U.S. Senate in New York as the Republican nominee, some $20,000. His alleged method was extremely simple: He asked other friends to give Long a maximum donation of $5,000 and then reimbursed them later.\n\nD\u2019Souza is innocent until proven guilty, of course, but comments released on Thursday from his lawyer seemed to indicate that he won\u2019t be putting up too strenuous of a fight. \u201cSimply put, there was no \u2026 knowledge by the candidate that campaign finance rules may have been violated,\u201d said D\u2019Souza\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Brafman. \u201cHe and the candidate have been friends since their college days,\u201d Brafman added, \u201cand at worst, this was an act of misguided friendship \u2026\u201d As even the influential right-wing blogger and law professor Ann Althouse acknowledged, Brafman\u2019s statement \u201clooks pretty much like a confession that D\u2019Souza committed the criminal acts.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Souza was charged with two counts \u2014 one for making illegal campaign contributions and one for lying to the FEC \u2014 and if he\u2019s convicted for the maximum sentence for both, he could be looking at seven years in prison. I\u2019m not a lawyer, so I can\u2019t speak to the likelihood of such an outcome. I only bring up the potential incarceration time to emphasize the seriousness of D\u2019Souza\u2019s alleged transgression. This isn\u2019t jaywalking, or talking on a mobile phone while driving on the freeway.\n\nAs bad as this latest news is for D\u2019Souza, the unfortunate reality for the former Reagan administration policy analyst is that this entanglement with law enforcement is merely the latest in a long line of recent public failures. After spending much of the 1990s enjoying the financial and social benefits of being embraced by America\u2019s right-wing ecosystem \u2014 writing in conservative magazines, speaking at conservative events, taking positions within conservative think tanks, and selling lots of books about conservatism (and the evils of liberalism) to conservative audiences \u2014 D\u2019Souza\u2019s had a rougher go of it in the aughts.\n\nHe was never a mainstream figure, even during his \u201990s heyday, but sometime around the the latter-half of the 21st century\u2019s first decade, D\u2019Souza receded further and further toward the far-right fringe. If there was a single tipping point, it was probably the release of his execrable 2007 book, \u201cThe Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11,\u201d whose title tells you pretty much all you need to know. (It did give us this D\u2019Souza interview with Colbert, though, for which we can be grateful.) That was an argument so hostile and unreasonable, so suffused with a neurotic and tribalist hatred, that it more or less negated itself with its own silliness.\n\nD\u2019Souza\u2019s trip to rock bottom wasn\u2019t a straight line, however. It\u2019s true that he went from being a right-wing pundit with a whiff of intellectual seriousness about him to becoming just another run-of-the-mill far-right demagogue, albeit with a larger vocabulary than most. But as Sarah Palin or Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh could tell you, if you hit your marks and balance seething resentment with a carnival barker\u2019s flair, you can make good money on the far-right fringes. A lot of it, in fact.\n\nThus did D\u2019Souza add another talent to his repertoire, becoming a filmmaker with 2012\u2019s extremely successful \u2014 and utterly mendacious \u2014 \u201c2016: Obama\u2019s America,\u201d a pseudo-documentary that argued Kenyan anti-colonialism was the key to understanding the 44th president. For a political documentary \u2014 for any documentary not made by Michael Moore, really \u2014 the film was absolute gangbusters at the box office, raking in somewhere around $33 million. Liberals laughed at it, sure, but conservatives on the whole adored it, and even persuaded themselves that it would make an impact on the 2012 election, as was its clear intent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wingnuts obsessed with the culture war will always have a place (and credit card) for hucksters like Dinesh D'Souza", "title": "Far-right phony intellectualism: The secret of Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s success", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Wingnuts obsessed with the culture war will always have a place (and credit card) for hucksters like Dinesh D'Souza", "title": "Far-right phony intellectualism: The secret of Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s success", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/25/far_right_phony_intellectualism_the_secret_of_dinesh_dsouzas_success/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/dinesh_dsouza3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wingnuts obsessed with the culture war will always have a place (and credit card) for hucksters like Dinesh D'Souza", "title": "Far-right phony intellectualism: The secret of Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s success", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/dinesh_dsouza3.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016: Obama's America, Ann Althouse, Dinesh Dsouza, Editor's Picks, FEC, Matt Drudge, National Review, The Dailly Caller, The Enemy at Home, Wendy Long", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I only bring up the potential incarceration time to emphasize the seriousness of D\u2019Souza\u2019s alleged transgression.\n\u201cSimply put, there was no \u2026 knowledge by the candidate that campaign finance rules may have been violated,\u201d said D\u2019Souza\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Brafman.\nHis alleged method was extremely simple: He asked other friends to give Long a maximum donation of $5,000 and then reimbursed them later.\n(It did give us this D\u2019Souza interview with Colbert, though, for which we can be grateful.)\nD\u2019Souza\u2019s trip to rock bottom wasn\u2019t a straight line, however."}
