Like amnesty for illegals?\"\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nThere is no current legislation that gives amnesty to undocumented immigrants. It's still an ongoing debate on Capitol Hill. While not referenced in the the ad specifically, Pompeo has never voted in favor of amnesty because it has never been proposed as a law.\n\nThe ad continues, \"Obamacare? Mr. Pompeo voted seven times to fund it. I think it's gotta go.\"\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nAll of the votes Tiahrt is referencing are for appropriations bills that often prevented a government shutdown in 2011. They provided funding for a couple weeks at a time to federal agencies and departments, including Homeland Security, FEMA and Border Protection. Among the departments, is Health and Human Services, which administers and implements the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. But Obamacare is mandatory spending and would be funded regardless. There could have been money in these bills, though, that would have funded the Medicaid expansion in Obamacare.\n\nThe bills were all passed with Republican support, and the majority were supported by Kansas Republicans. Pompeo has been vocal from the beginning in his opposition to Obamacare.\n\nThe ad goes on to say, \"New air force tankers for Wichita. Pompeo voted no.\"\n\nThis needs clarification.\n\nThe ad references The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014. It is an omnibus spending bill that provides funding for a number of departments. Part of the legislation gives money to McConnell Air Force Base to prepare for the new tankers. However, this bill only addresses military construction for housing the tankers and has no impact on the decision to bring tankers to McConnell. The Air Force made the decision to bring the tankers last year.\n\nThe ad then says, \"He went Washington on us. EPA. NSA. The IRS.\"\n\nThis needs an explanation.\n\nThe ad doesn't reference any legislation or make any statements about Pompeo's position on an issue. He's just throwing out hot button issues being debated on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe ad ends with, \"Back in Kansas, we know garbage when we see it, and what to do with it.\"\n\nOverall, this ad is very misleading.
