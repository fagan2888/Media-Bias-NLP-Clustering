Tucson Boulevard is open again in both directions between East Broadway and East Tenth Street after closing for several hours due to a crash.

A car hit a power pole and there are no injuries, TPD Sgt. Pete Dugan tweeted.

Tucson Electric Power Co. representatives are on scene, according to Dugan.

There do not appear to be any power outages, according to the TEP outage map.

Dugan said alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the crash and that it seemed to be a genuine accident.
