Jack Conway runs for governor as an Obama liberal, with more vague promises. Sound familiar? Conway supported Obama on cap and trade; it\u2019s been called a national energy tax that could kill thousands of Kentucky jobs and hike our utility rates. Conway supported Obamacare, stating he would have been proud to vote for it.\n\nThough a copy of the committee\u2019s statement of organization is not yet publicly available on the state\u2019s registry of election finance, The organization describes itself as \u201ca project of the Republican Governor\u2019s Association\u201d on its website. The site, dedicated to attacking Democratic candidate Jack Conway, makes clear that this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race will center around many of the same the as last year\u2019s hot-button Senate battle, in which Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell and Democrat Allison Lundergan Grimes traded accusations of selling out Kentucky coal interests in the face of President Obama\u2019s environmental agenda.\n\nConway\u2019s opponent, Republican Matt Bevin, lost a largely self-funded campaign to McConnell in last year's Republican primary. He will have another shot at elected office November 3.\n\nIdrees Kahloon contributing", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Sunlight Foundation", "description": "New ads funded by the Republican Governors Association (RGA) will hit the Kentucky airwaves Wednesday, as an offshoot of the RGA ramps up the war of words in the state\u2019s toss-up gubernatorial election.
