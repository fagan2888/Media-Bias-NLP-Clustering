The ones polled by the magazine (with the help of a research firm) said the other black women they know tend to fall into positive categories like \u201cYoung Phenom\u201d or \u201cAcculturated Girl Next Door.\u201d But images of black women \u201con TV, in social media, in music videos and from other outlets,\u201d the survey found, were \u201coverwhelmingly negative,\u201d conforming to stereotypes like \u201cGold Diggers, Modern Jezebels, Baby Mamas, Uneducated Sisters, Ratchet Women, Angry Black Women, Mean Black Girls, Unhealthy Black Women, and Black Barbies.\u201d Related Story Oprah's Oscar Buzz and Hollywood's 'Sassy Black Lady' Problem Had it been included, last week\u2019s Saturday Night Live episode would have made the findings even starker. Scandal star Kerry Washington appeared in sketches as a nagging girlfriend; a sassy, eye-rolling assistant; and a rageful Ugandan beauty queen. There were no roles where her race and gender wasn\u2019t an issue. It was the opening sketch, though, that called the most attention to the fact that Washington\u2019s a black woman. In it, she played Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Beyonce, and the producers apologized to the actress for forcing her to undergo multiple wardrobe changes in one scene. The sketch was a mea culpa on the show\u2019s behalf, a way of addressing recent headlines pointing out that SNL hasn\u2019t had a black female on its cast for six years. That was a savvy move on creator Lorne Michaels\u2019s part. Kenan Thompson had ignited a firestorm by implying to TV Guide that he blames the lack of diversity on black female comedians\u2019 chops, saying, \u201cthey just never find the ones who are ready.\u201d The text that ran across the screen at the start of last week\u2019s episode said the producers \"agree that this is not an ideal situation and look forward to rectifying it in the near future.\u201d\n\nBut the focus on SNL\u2019s supposed inability to find black comediennes obscures the larger issue. The Kerry Washington episode, and the show\u2019s long history, suggests that Saturday Night Live just doesn't know what to do with black women. The roles it offers to them fall in line with much of the rest of popular media: stereotypical, demeaning, and scarce. The show\u2019s diversity problems go back to its very start. During the first season of SNL, which debuted in 1975, there were nine cast members, including three white women (Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman, Gilda Radner) and one black man (Garrett Morris). For the next five years, whenever a sketch called for a black woman, the part would be played by Morris in drag. Some of his celebrity impressions include Diana Ross, Ella Fitzgerald, and Tina Turner. In 1980, Eddie Murphy became the second black man to join, and Yvonne Hudson would be SNL\u2019s first black woman. Hudson only lasted for one season and never had any prominent or recurring characters. Instead, she played stereotypical, subservient black women; it was as if the writers didn\u2019t think she could convincingly play anything else. Hudson\u2019s various (and sometimes, uncredited) roles include a maid, a nurse, a slave, and a character listed on IMDB as simply, \u201cBlack Woman.\u201d Hudson was fired at the end of the season along with a slew of other cast members. SNL would go another five years before it would see its next black female cast member. Danitra Vance, who on the Season 11 premiere, was a classically trained Shakespearean actor who also performed at the famed Second City Theater. One of Vance\u2019s two recurring characters was a 17-year-old welfare mother who gave advice about pregnancy. In her debut sketch, Cabrini Green Jackson (Vance) introduced herself by saying, \u201cI'm 17 years old, and I have two children. I speak for teenage mothers \u2026 just-about-to-be-mothers, and \u2026 don't-wanna-be-mothers\u2014I been all three!\u201d while holding up an \u201cI Don\u2019t Want A Baby Coloring Book.\u201d A character straight from the hood, her name Cabrini Green references a famous housing project in north Chicago. In another sketch, \u201cThat Black Girl,\u201d Vance plays LaToya Marie, a black actress who will do anything to get famous, saying \u201cI'll finally be out of poverty, but I'm already out of ... integrity!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It&#39;s not that black women aren&#39;t ready for Saturday Night Live.\u00a0With its limited, stereotype-reinforcing roles, SNL doesn&#39;t seem ready for them.", "author": "Kerry Coddett", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "It&#39;s not that black women aren&#39;t ready for Saturday Night Live.\u00a0With its limited, stereotype-reinforcing roles, SNL doesn&#39;t seem ready for them.", "title": "The Real Problem With SNL and Casting Black Women", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/snlkerrywashington/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/the-real-problem-with-em-snl-em-and-casting-black-women/281280/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca38d\"", "article_summary": "The ones polled by the magazine (with the help of a research firm) said the other black women they know tend to fall into positive categories like \u201cYoung Phenom\u201d or \u201cAcculturated Girl Next Door.\u201d But images of black women \u201con TV, in social media, in music videos and from other outlets,\u201d the survey found, were \u201coverwhelmingly negative,\u201d conforming to stereotypes like \u201cGold Diggers, Modern Jezebels, Baby Mamas, Uneducated Sisters, Ratchet Women, Angry Black Women, Mean Black Girls, Unhealthy Black Women, and Black Barbies.\u201d Related Story Oprah's Oscar Buzz and Hollywood's 'Sassy Black Lady' Problem Had it been included, last week\u2019s Saturday Night Live episode would have made the findings even starker.\nAn Essence survey published last month revealed what many black women already know: Pop culture doesn\u2019t depict them accurately.\nIn 1980, Eddie Murphy became the second black man to join, and Yvonne Hudson would be SNL\u2019s first black woman.\nInstead, she played stereotypical, subservient black women; it was as if the writers didn\u2019t think she could convincingly play anything else.\nIt was the opening sketch, though, that called the most attention to the fact that Washington\u2019s a black woman."}
