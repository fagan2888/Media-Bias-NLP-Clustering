The Mary L. Nohl Fellowship is the most prestigious and competitive local award for individual artists in Milwaukee. The end of the fellowship year culminates in what amounts to a test for the seven artists â€” an exhibition.

The show is a gauge of where these artists are in their careers and what they accomplished with the time, resources and funds afforded by the fellowship, named after the Fox Point artist who died in 2001.

This year's exhibit showcases seven area artists: Danielle Beverly, Faythe Levine and Colin Matthes, who won in the established artist category, and Lois Bielefeld, Tyanna J. Buie, Brad Fiore and Paul Kjelland, who won in the emerging artist category.

The opening is Friday from 6 to 9 p.m. at Inova, 2155 N. Prospect Ave. There will be an exhibition walk-through with the artists at 7 p.m. The show is on view through Dec. 15.
