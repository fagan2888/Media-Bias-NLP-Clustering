She said she would discuss it with Mike Randol, director of KDHE\u2019s Division of Health Care Finance.\n\n\u201cWe need to have mitigating actions,\u201d Mosier said. \u201cWe are mitigating, but other ideas are welcome so that we can take care of people, because that\u2019s the ultimate goal.\u201d \u2018\n\nHobbled by a broken system\u2019\n\nMosier\u2019s words came as a relief to nursing home representatives frustrated by months of agency inaction as their members\u2019 bills pile up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very supportive of that idea,\u201d said Cindy Luxem, president and chief executive of the Kansas Health Care Association, which represents for-profit nursing homes.\n\n\u201cSomething just needs to happen. The folks in our homes are getting the care, but it\u2019s truly not fair. These folks have such a low margin anyway, and we\u2019re expecting these caregivers to do so much with so little.\n\nBasically people are looking the other way to say, \u2018We\u2019ll get you paid eventually.\u2019\u201d Deb Zehr, president and chief executive of LeadingAge Kansas, which represents nonprofit nursing homes, said her organization\u2019s facilities are for frail seniors who need around-the-clock care.\n\nDelaying admittance while they wait months for Medicaid applications to be processed results in suffering and even the possibility of death, she said.\n\n\u201cThe state needs to act immediately, but they are hobbled by a broken system and a backlog of 10,000 cases,\u201d Zehr said. \u201cThe only way to help seniors needing nursing care now is to grant presumptive Medicaid eligibility for those with pending cases, as well as to seniors applying for Medicaid before KDHE has the backlog cleared.\u201d\n\nNursing homes groups trace the Medicaid problems to June when the state began to use the Kansas Eligibility Enforcement System, or KEES, to process applications and renewals. Accenture, a state contractor, created KEES.\n\nAfter the system\u2019s long-delayed rollout, state workers who use KEES were forced to learn dozens of workarounds \u2014 some of them 10 or more steps long \u2014 to make it function.\n\nA backlog began to form, and after KDHE took over all eligibility processing last month it burgeoned to almost 10,000 applications.\n\nMedicaid in Kansas is a privatized program known as KanCare, and it serves mainly elderly and disabled Kansans and pregnant women and children. By last month, organizations that represent those groups reported that applications that used to take seven to 10 days to process were taking three months or longer.\n\nAnd some said Kansans who had been on Medicaid for years were being dropped with little or no warning because their renewals hadn\u2019t been processed. Nursing homes were hit particularly hard because many of their residents rely on Medicaid payments after they exhaust other funds.\n\nLuxem said some of the nursing home companies she represents have forwarded to her \u201ctremendous accounts receivable\u201d that she has shared with KDHE this week.\n\n\u201cThe folks at KDHE right now are really trying to be helpful, and actually we understand that maybe a few of the things are starting to get un-logjammed,\u201d Luxem said. \u201cBut it sure is a drag (that) we need to raise this kind of fuss just to get the system to work.\u201d\n\nReaching out to legislators\n\nAfter KDHE took over all Medicaid processing, Kansans who were having problems were told to call a single 800 number for the KanCare Clearinghouse, a KDHE outpost run by state contractor Maximus.\n\nBut individual Kansans reported hours-long wait times on hold and unreturned messages \u2014 the same problems a 2008 audit revealed about Maximus when it ran the children\u2019s health care program help line for the state.\n\nRay Flickner, who received about two weeks\u2019 notice that his 84-year-old mother\u2019s Medicaid was about to expire, said he received no help from the KanCare Clearinghouse until he contacted his state legislator, Rep. Mark Hutton, a Wichita Republican. His mother\u2019s Medicaid coverage since has been restored. \u201cI\u2019m glad I got it taken care of, but I worry about the other folks who don\u2019t know that\u2019s an option,\u201d Flickner said.\n\nHaylie Colby, a social worker at the University of Kansas Cancer Center, said she was successful in getting 64-year-old leukemia survivor Ellen Brannan\u2019s coverage restored only after enlisting the help of Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Mission Hills Republican.\n\nBut Colby is working with another patient from Wichita who needs a bone marrow transplant due to multiple myeloma and has been waiting on Medicaid coverage since August.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ready to proceed, but she doesn\u2019t have insurance so they can\u2019t, really,\u201d Colby said. \u201cMedically, she\u2019s ready to go.\u201d Colby welcomed news of a possible amnesty or presumed eligibility for nursing home residents.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s excellent, that\u2019s huge,\u201d Colby said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most vulnerable of all of us.\u201d\n\nSystem still an issue\n\nMosier said KDHE is bringing on more staff and redoubling its training to try to speed the Medicaid processing. Once KDHE gets caught up, she said the application process should improve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got an effort that we started in October in terms of eliminating the backlog,\u201d Mosier said.\n\n\u201cEliminating the backlog is what will solve many, if not all, of these issues.\u201d The agency\u2019s information technology experts and Accenture are working to make KEES more user-friendly. However, internal documents show that problems with the system continue.\n\nA document dated Jan. 25 provided to KHI News Service by an employee who works with the system and requested anonymity listed 67 \u201cDefect Resolutions\u201d stretched over five pages. Another release of fixes is scheduled for mid-February.\n\nIn an email sent Thursday to dozens of KDHE and Accenture employees, including Mosier, Jenifer Telshaw, KDHE\u2019s head of KEES production, outlined a problem that was keeping employees from accessing KEES and the document scanning software that feeds information into the system.\n\n\u201cWe have reports that staff cannot access KEES or ImageNow,\u201d Telshaw wrote.\n\n\u201cIt has been verified that KEES is available but it appears that there (is) a connection issue. We are currently investigating the issue and will let you know when the issue has been resolved.\u201d\n\nThe processing delays, while causing problems for Medicaid-eligible Kansans and their providers, have been a small revenue boon for the state at a time when budgets are tight.\n\nGov. Sam Brownback\u2019s supplemental budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 assumes $3 million in Medicaid savings \u201cas enrollment eligibility continues to lag since implementing KEES.\u201d Zehr said her organization had taken note of that budget provision and its implication that the issues with Medicaid processing could drag into 2017.\n\n\u201cIf the administration truly believes that these delays are going to last up to another 17 months, they will be saving money on the backs of humans in crisis,\u201d Zehr said.\n\nAndy Marso is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.
