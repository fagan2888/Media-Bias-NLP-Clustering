I felt like I started this year off a little sluggish. But now I\u2019ve got it turned up.\u201d\n\nAnd was this his last home game?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll still talk to my mother about that,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil that time comes \u2026 that\u2019s when we\u2019ll make the decision.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s getting late in the season, and CSU (5-5, 3-3 Mountain West) hasn\u2019t exactly played powerhouses the last two weeks, but the Rams and first-year coach Mike Bobo seem to have found an effective formula. Part of it is an increasingly effective working relationship between Higgins and sophomore quarterback Nick Stevens, who was 13-for-19 for 209 yards and four TDs against the Rebels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still doing what we\u2019ve been doing since Day One,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cJust throwing back shoulder after practice, the same thing I did with Garrett Grayson. It\u2019s all working out, we just have to give him time and hopefully things will keep clicking like they did tonight.\u201d\n\nAs they did at Wyoming the week before, the Rams ran the ball effectively with alternating backs. They judiciously picked spots to throw and make big plays in the passing game, including with Higgins, a 2014 consensus All-American as a sophomore. Until a lost Dawkins fumble late in the game, the Rams avoided the turnover plague, which had been a major problem through the first eight games. They piled up 534 yards of total offense and got just enough efficient work from their defense until a sloppy finish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be a little more balanced,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cI thought coming into this season our strength was in the receiving corps. But for whatever reason, we haven\u2019t been able to find a rhythm that we need to. We\u2019ve continued to always stress the running game. That\u2019s been very important to me since the day I got here. I believe that\u2019s the way you win championships, is being able to run the ball and play defense and I like where we\u2019re at running the ball.\u201d\n\nIt all enabled the Rams\u2019 seniors to walk off the field after their final home game in a celebratory mood. The Rams finish up the regular season at New Mexico and at Fresno State.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rashard Higgins stars as Colorado State defeats UNLV", "title": "Rashard Higgins stars as Colorado State defeats UNLV", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/14/rashard-higgins-stars-as-colorado-state-defeats-unlv/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-14T20:40:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-14T20:40:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 If this was Rashard Higgins\u2019 final home game as a Colorado State Ram \u2014 and it almost certainly was \u2014 he went out with a flourish Saturday night.\nWe\u2019ve continued to always stress the running game.\nHiggins smiled when asked about slightly diverting the spotlight from the Rams\u2019 seniors in the last game of their careers in Fort Collins.\nThey judiciously picked spots to throw and make big plays in the passing game, including with Higgins, a 2014 consensus All-American as a sophomore.\nThe Rams finish up the regular season at New Mexico and at Fresno State."}
