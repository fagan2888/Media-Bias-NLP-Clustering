JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Cedric Tyron Smallwood, 28, could face up to life in prison after a jury convicted him of armed robbery and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

In January 2008, officers responded to an armed robbery that had occurred at a food store on Moncrief Road.

The investigation revealed that a masked Smallwood entered the store, pointed a gun at the clerk and demanded money. He then stole $14,000 in cash and a gun from behind the register before fleeing the scene.

Smallwood was convicted of these charges in 2009 and sentenced to 65 years in prison. His case was later reversed on appeal due to evidence allowed at trial.

Smallwood now faces up to life in prison for this conviction. He will be sentenced the week of Dec. 11, according to the State Attorney's Office.
