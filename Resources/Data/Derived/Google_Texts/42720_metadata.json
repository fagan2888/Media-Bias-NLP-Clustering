Mangin Real Estate Institute.\n\nKeynote speaker Roger Ferguson, Jr., CEO of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association \u2013 College Retirement Equities Fund, addressed the importance of improving financial literacy among youth and praised the university for its decision to enhance its business programs because \u201cfar too many people lack the skills to navigate the economy.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a real reflection of how the university is maturing and developing, as well as Jersey City,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThe whole community can be proud of this expansion.\n\nThe School of Business will offer majors in accounting, finance, management and marketing. Before, the university only offered a general degree in business.\n\nNJCU president Sue Henderson said she wants to target risk management and financial technology, and the school is in the process of hiring instructors who have extensive experience in those areas.\n\nThe real estate institute, backed by a donation from former U.S. Rep. Frank J. Guarini, will provide a minor to the new business program and offer yearly seminars in the real estate business.\n\nThe institute is named for real estate developer Peter Mangin for his business and community efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to be in real estate in Jersey City,\u201d Mangin said before unveiling the sign for the new institute. \u201cI\u2019m glad to have my name on it.\u201d\n\nAfter the presentations, Henderson announced a scholarship for undergraduate business majors, named for Marilyn Ettinger, finance chairwoman, that will also boost the university\u2019s business efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s news to me. I was so surprised and delighted,\u201d Ettinger said. \u201cMy 25 years here have been great, but I have to acknowledge those who came before me.\u201d\n\nAmirose Ruge, a 28-year-old master\u2019s student, was among those sitting in the first row of the nearly 200-person crowd in the university\u2019s Gilligan Student Union multipurpose room.\n\n\u201cI was an undergrad here too, so it\u2019s really exciting to see all of the changes,\u201d Ruge said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see how it\u2019s now a school of business instead of a department and to see the first female president of the university present it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Vonecia Carswell/The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "jersey-city", "title": "New Jersey City University holds dedication ceremony for new School of Business and Peter G.
