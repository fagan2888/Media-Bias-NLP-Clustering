Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek or develop any nuclear weapons. This comprehensive solution would build on these initial measures and result in a final step for a period to be agreed upon and the resolution of concerns. This comprehensive solution would enable Iran to fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the NPT in conformity with its obligations therein. This comprehensive solution would involve a mutually defined enrichment programme with ractical limits and transparency measures to ensure the peaceful nature of the programme. This comprehensive solution would constitute an integrated whole where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. This comprehensive solution would involve a reciprocal, step-by-step process, and would produce the comprehensive lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions, as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\n\nRead the rest here.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Read the Joint Plan of Action agreed to by the P5+1 and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland on November 24, 2013.", "title": "Read the Text of the Iran Nuclear Agreement", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/24/read-the-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-agreement/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Read the Text of the Iran Nuclear Agreement", "description": "Read the Joint Plan of Action agreed to by the P5+1 and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland on November 24, 2013.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Read the Joint Plan of Action agreed to by the P5+1 and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland on November 24, 2013.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-24T23:21:41-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/24/read-the-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-agreement/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-42034", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Read the Joint Plan of Action agreed to by the P5+1 and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland on November 24, 2013.", "title": "Read the Text of the Iran Nuclear Agreement", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/24/read-the-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-agreement/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-42034", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-24T23:32:11-05:00"}, "article_summary": "PreambleThe goal for these negotiations is to reach a mutually-agreed long-term comprehensive solution that would ensure Iran\u2019s nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful.\nIran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek or develop any nuclear weapons.\nRead the Joint Plan of Action agreed to by the P5+1 and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland on November 24, 2013.\nThis comprehensive solution would constitute an integrated whole where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\nThis comprehensive solution would enable Iran to fully enjoy its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the relevant articles of the NPT in conformity with its obligations therein."}
