Now an old practice--one put in place to address the rising cost of medications, is becoming increasingly burdensome for doctors, patients and pharmacists.\n\nJanet Applfield wears gloves most of the day. It hurts to put on clothes, to wear shoes. Her skin is sensitive to the touch. Her fingernails and toenails are falling off. And she has a rash over most of her body. Applefield has plaque psoriasis, a condition characterized by severely dry skin that cracks, and flakes. She was taking a medication called Otezla prescribed earlier this year. But when Applefield lost her job, she lost her health insurance. And when she enrolled in Medicaid under the Stay well plan, she encountered problems:\n\n\u201cIt kept getting denied. I didn\u2019t understand why\u2014so I called the insurance company and they said basically you have to fail on the two cheaper drugs and Otezla is new drug.\u201d\n\nApplefield\u2019s doctor went back-and-forth with her insurance company, fighting to keep her initial prescription. But the company deemed her drug too expensive, and wanted her to try a different Medication\u2014that came with nasty side effects.\n\n\u201cKidney failure. And my father and brother both have kidney problems\u2014my brother is on dialysis. I kept trying to explain to them that these were not a good alternative, because I\u2019ll probably be dead. They really didn\u2019t care. Their thought was, that\u2019s the process and that\u2019s what we want you to do,\u201d she said.\n\nA physician\u2019s frustration\n\nGail Sadler is a family nurse practitioner who has been in practice for 15 years.\n\n\u201cStep therapy was started because it is cost effective. It\u2019s research-based. The pharmaceutical companies have definitely, through the years, said we need to do step A before Step B.\u201d\n\nSadler encounters step therapy conflicts daily, and says it\u2019s an issue for about half her patients. She says step therapy has been around for a while and it used to not be a problem. But within the past two years she\u2019s seen more problems with some patients getting the prescriptions they need.\n\n\u201cThe bad news with step therapy is you can have a patient who\u2019s on a certain medication and has been for 2-3 years, then suddenly their Medicare Part D changes, and it\u2019s not on that Medicare Part D\u2019s formulary. We have to start back over.\u201d\n\nCritics of step therapy characterize it as \u201cfail first\u201d in that it requires patients to try less expensive medications or treatments, have them fail, and then move on to more expensive methods. Most insurers have step therapy policies. But Sadler says that doesn\u2019t work for some patients. And she says even when an insurance company approves the more expensive treatment\u2014sometimes patients can\u2019t afford it.\n\n\u201cSo, we finally get this medication approved and I\u2019m so happy, and then the patient calls me from the pharmacy and says, \u2018thank you for getting this approved, but now I can\u2019t afford it. Its $230\u2019. So, in step therapy, we\u2019re not just looking at the medication... but thanks for allowing me to fill out all this paperwork, and now the patient can\u2019t afford the $230 a month.\u201d\n\nSadler attributes the downward pressure delays to the growing influence of the Affordable Care Act. In some ways she\u2019s pleased with the law\u2019s push toward getting more people insured\u2014and believes it\u2019s a noble cause. But she says it\u2019s also caused problems on the business side\u2014with networks shrinking, and more financial pressure on doctors and insurers try to control costs. She says the problems now emerging with step therapy are a symptom of that.\n\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to have that many people insured, you really have to watch your pennies. And to watch your pennies, one of the most expensive pennies goes to medications, oral medication, and oral medication failure.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s frustrated with the increasing demands placed by insurance companies on her practice. Now Florida lawmakers are getting involved.\n\nLegislative Intervention\n\nA move to crack down on insurance companies that reject doctor recommendations for prescriptions failed in the Florida legislature this year. A proposal by Republican Senator Don Gaetz of Niceville\u2014would have required insurance companies who reject a doctor\u2019s prescription\u2014to prove a medial reason for the denial. It would have set up a committee in the state department of health to hear appeals, and would have made insurance companies liable for severe side effects. Gaetz says he got involved after getting a phone call from a former employee, whose insurance company rejected her prescribed treatment.\n\n\u201cSo she called me because the insurance company apparently said, \u2018well maybe you should get Senator Gaetz to call us and ask for a personal favor we may consider it.\u2019 I thought that was highly inappropriate. Borderline unethical,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut the measure was opposed by the health insurers. Paul Sanford, an insurance lobbyist told Republican Senator Denise Grimsley the changes proposed to step therapy could raise costs, and that a determination of whether a treatment is medically necessary, should be left to experts. Responding to Sanford\u2019s criticism of the bill, Grimsley said the panel would be filled by healthcare experts. Sanford\u2019s response:\n\n\u201cI fully understand that, we just have a disagreement over who the expert is here,\u201d he said.\n\nGaetz\u2019 bill didn\u2019t get a hearing in the Florida House\u2014where legislative leaders there pushed their own version of healthcare reforms. Lawmakers are now on break from a heated fight over healthcare issues in the state. And Gaetz says in order for his step therapy proposal to get through the legislature\u2014it may have to be added to what\u2019s known as a train\u2014a series of proposals grouped together in one bill. But Sadler, says while she believes the step therapy system needs reform, she\u2019s not sure it should be done by the legislature:\n\n\u201cI would approach the insurance commissioner with it. I wouldn\u2019t approach our legislators because it\u2019s confusing and we shouldn\u2019t have them telling the insurance companies what they can and cannot do,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the insurance commissioner, who is in charge of the safety and efficacy of these policies\u2014the insurance commissioner needs to say if you want to sell your policy here, you need to unilateral across the board\u2026it would be the same for Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, United\u2014it would be the same regardless of if its purchased on the exchange, or from a fortune 500 company.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Florida\u2019s insurance commissioner has that authority. A few years ago, the Florida legislature passed a law largely taking away the commissioners authority to regulate health plans, as part of Florida\u2019s resistance to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMeanwhile Janet Applefield is now on a different medication. The side effects include liver failure and kidney damage. She has to get her blood taken every two weeks to make sure she\u2019s not experiencing those side effects. And notes her previous medication didn\u2019t have them. But the alternatives are also bad. Another proposed medication, an injection\u2014could have caused kidney failure, which runs in her family. She\u2019s frustrated. And angry:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a bad policy and it needs to be changed,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Applefield, step therapy is not a financial matter\u2014it\u2019s her life.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "As more people gain insurance under the Affordable Care Act, they\u2019ve been running into problems with medications and finding doctors.
