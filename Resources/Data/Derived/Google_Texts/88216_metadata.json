Rand Paul (R-Kent.), Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and \u201cInternet conspirators\u201d as people who contributed to the false narrative.\n\nThere were two Ebola-themed lies included in PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year\u201d poll that allowed readers to vote for their favorite, one of which came from Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.). He eluded to reports from the southern border of \u201cillegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as \u2026 Ebola virus.\u201d This received 3.5 percent of the reader vote.\n\nSecond was a comment from George Will. The political commentator claimed that Ebola could be transmitted by \u201ca sneeze or some cough.\u201d Only 2.7 percent of PolitiFact\u2019s readers chose this as the lie of the year.\n\nHowever, Obama\u2019s assertion that his position on immigration reform \u201chasn\u2019t changed\u201d received 8.6 percent of the reader vote in the poll, which is a good deal more than the 6.2 percent who voted for either of the Ebola lies.\n\nAlso under consideration for the title was Obama\u2019s claim that his reference to extremists as a JV team \u201cwasn\u2019t specifically referring to\u201d ISIS militants. This only won 1.9 percent of the reader vote.\n\nIn contrast, the largest proportion of readers \u2014 31.8 percent \u2014 cast their votes for Republican Lenar Whitney\u2019s statement that \u201cglobal warming is a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe PolitiFact editors select each year\u2019s winner based on the degree to which the lie \u201cinfiltrates conventional thinking.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, President Obama\u2019s \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep it\u201d lie about Obamacare won the top prize.\n\nUnlike PolitiFact, Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler, who runs the Fact Checker column, didn\u2019t let Obama get away with his ISIS JV lie.\n\nKessler suggested on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Tuesday that Obama\u2019s ISIS comment was the top lie of the year.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The PolitiFact editors selected \"exaggerations about Ebola\" as the biggest falsity of all of 2014, naming it over two of President Obama's major false statements.", "title": "Politifact names Ebola 'exaggerations' lie of the year over two...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 565, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/10/Ebola-NYC-Doctor_Dobs-565x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/12/16/politifact-names-ebola-exaggerations-lie-year-two-major-obama-blunders/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "reader-poll-lie-of-the-year", "published_time": "2014-12-16T11:39:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-16T12:55:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb22f\"", "article_summary": "Politifact names Ebola \u2018exaggerations\u2019 lie of the year over two major Obama blundersPolitiFact has chosen its \u201c2014 Lie of the Year,\u201d and surprisingly, it\u2019s only an exaggeration.\nKessler suggested on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Tuesday that Obama\u2019s ISIS comment was the top lie of the year.\nUnlike PolitiFact, Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler, who runs the Fact Checker column, didn\u2019t let Obama get away with his ISIS JV lie.\nThe editors selected \u201cexaggerations about Ebola\u201d as the biggest falsity of 2014, naming it over two of President Obama\u2019s major false statements.\nHe eluded to reports from the southern border of \u201cillegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as \u2026 Ebola virus.\u201d This received 3.5 percent of the reader vote."}
