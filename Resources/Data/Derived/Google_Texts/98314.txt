Headquartered in Macedonia, Ohio, TPC produces ruggedized wires and cable connectors used in a variety of industries, including mining, automotive, food & beverage, oil & gas and transportation. The transaction comes as more dealmakers predict an increase in manufacturing M&A.

Audax plans to make add-on acquisitions to TPC, according to a joint statement from TPC chief executive Steve Michalski and Audax co-CEO Geoffrey Rehnert.

BB&T Capital Markets advised TPC Wire & Cable. Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Paul Hastings LLP served as counsel to Audax and TPC, respectively.
