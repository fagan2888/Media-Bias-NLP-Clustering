In addition, the tax code needs to be reformed such that the tax rates for small business is lowered to 25%. \u201cWe need to make America fair for all businesses but especially for small biz,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush has said he would promote policies that would lift economic growth to a 4% growth rate (or GDP), well above the current 2% to 3% range anticipated for 2015.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBush said that a higher growth rate is possible if better quality jobs are created and the U.S. fixes a \u201cconvoluted tax code.\u201d He also called for repealing ObamaCare, saying it raises costs for business owners.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said the IRS should be eliminated.\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich was asked how Republicans can differentiate themselves from a Democratic challenger who argued Republicans are only out to help the rich. Kasich said Republican policies promote economic growth and \u201ceconomic growth is the key to everything.\u201d\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump, speaking broadly on the U.S. economy, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t win any more, we lose to China, we lose to Mexico. We need to turn it around.\u201d Trump also said he would repeal ObamaCare.\n\nResponding to a question targeting the four times Trump companies filed for bankruptcy protection, Trump said he only availed himself of U.S. law as any good businessman would.\n\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker defended his record of job creation in his state, saying he dramatically lowered the state\u2019s unemployment rate. He also called for reforming the tax code and easing regulations on businesses.\n\n\u201cI think most of us understand that people, not the government creates jobs,\u201d Walker said.\n\nOn the hot button issue of immigration, Walker said the issue impacted the broader economy and that the U.S. needs an immigration policy that \u201cgives priority to American working families\u201d and keeps wages high.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie, facing a question about his handling of the struggling New Jersey economy, said the state is now creating jobs under his administration, a dramatic turnaround from his predecessor.\n\nNeurosurgeon Ben Carson said he would scrap the current tax system and replace it with a system of tithing, the religious practice of donating a percentage of a household\u2019s earnings. \u201cWe need a significantly changed tax system,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS", "dcterms.modified":
