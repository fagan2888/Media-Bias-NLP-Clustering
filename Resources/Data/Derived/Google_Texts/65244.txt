Is Obamacare "unaffordable?" Michigan resident Julie Boonstra claims so in an ad sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, attacking Senate candidate Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.). The Post put the ad to the Truth Teller test. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)

In the run-up to the Academy Awards, we introduced Truth Teller for trailers. That was a new video fact-checking experience that answered the one question movie-goers have about films based on real life: How much of what’s on screen really happened?

Now we are expanding Truth Teller experience to political ads, starting with one of the many ads that have attacked President Obama’s signature legislative achievement — the Affordable Care Act. This particular ad, which features Michigan resident Julie Boonstra, earned Three Pinocchios from The Fact Checker. Now you can watch the ad and see which statements are true or false as they are being uttered.

Keep watching this space for a further expansion of Truth Teller.
