It looks like Ted Cruz will soon find himself in the same predicament as millions of other frustrated Americans:

"Ted Cruz, one of the loudest critics of Obamacare, will soon be using it for health insurance coverage." http://t.co/AjeRluiqj5

#Breaking : Ted Cruz is signing up for Obamacare, he tells CNN's Dana Bash. Obamacare is a law he has been on a crusade to kill.

More from CNN:

“We’ll be getting new health insurance and we’ll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we’ll be on the federal exchange with millions of others on the federal exchange,” Cruz said.

…

“I strongly oppose the exemption that President Obama illegally put in place for members of Congress because (Senate Minority Leader) Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats didn’t want to be under the same rules as the American people,” Cruz said, before repeating: “I believe we should follow the text of the law”

Cruz’s admission comes one day after CNN first reported that the senator would no longer have access to health benefits through his wife’s employer, Goldman Sachs. Heidi Cruz, a managing director at the firm’s Houston office, has gone on unpaid leave for the duration of the senator’s presidential campaign and will not have access to the company’s benefits during that time.
