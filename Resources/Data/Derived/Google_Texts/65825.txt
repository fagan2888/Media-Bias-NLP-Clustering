COLUMBIA, Mo. -

The University of Missouri announced Friday after it is no longer allowed to pay for graduate students' health insurance.

MU officials say this is because of changes in federal policy and the IRS' interpretation.

The IRS considers the school's student health insurance plan an individual market plan. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers are no longer allowed to give employees money so they can buy health insurance on the individual market.

MU says it became aware of the policy change three weeks ago and has been reaching out to other universities, working with human resources and trying to come up with alternatives to help offset the cost.

MU says it will give one-time fellowships to all qualifying graduate student employees
