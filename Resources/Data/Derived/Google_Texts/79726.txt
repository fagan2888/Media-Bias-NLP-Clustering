Bemis Expands Health Care Division with SteriPack’s Packaging Assets

Other recent similar acquisitions include Checkpoint Systems, Inmark Packaging and Optimum Plastics

Bemis Co. Inc. (NYSE: BMS) will buy SteriPack Goup’s medical packaging division for an undisclosed amount, as Bemis looks to expand its health care business.

The target produces medical packaging products such as bags and pill boxes. The acquisition includes operational facilities located in Florida, Ireland and Malaysia. Dublin, Ireland-based SteriPack says the sale will allow the company to focus on its contract manufacturing business, which offers product design, testing and manufacturing for medical device and pharmaceutical providers.

“This acquisition supports Bemis’ strategy to grow our health care packaging business,” says Bemis CEO William Austen who also adds that the purchase “will increase our capacity to meet the needs of the growing health care industry.” Bemis, located in Neenah, Wisconsin, is a packaging company that serves the health care, food and beverage and consumer sectors.

In other mid-market packaging deals, CCL Industries Inc. said it will add Checkpoint Systems Inc. (NYSE: CKP); Charter Nex Films Inc. purchased Optimum Plastics Inc.; and Quad-C made an investment in Inmark Packaging.
