But as Bush\u2019s campaign continues to lag, his backers are increasingly turning their frustrations over his floundering candidacy on the group, Right to Rise, and its inability to influence the race.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen donors and advisers to the candidate revealed a complicated picture of dissatisfaction with the group and its chief strategist, Mike Murphy. Few wanted to openly criticize the group or Murphy on the record, but many raised questions about the role they had played in the campaign.\n\nSome donors quietly worry about how the cash-rich group is spending its money, confounded by how few tangible results the tens of millions it has pumped into the race so far have yielded. Others have expressed dismay with negative advertisements Right to Rise has run and a 15-minute pro-Bush documentary that it produced.\n\nThe frustrations spilled into full view at a private meeting Friday at the Palace Hotel in New York between Murphy and roughly three-dozen donors. Barry Volpert, a partner at the private equity firm Crestview Partners, sharply questioned Murphy about ads his group had aired attacking Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Bush\u2019s chief rivals for the nomination.\n\nThe concern over the negative ads is shared by some donors who have long worried that if Bush does not win the nomination, such attacks could irreparably harm the eventual nominee. Volpert, who has associates supporting Rubio, specifically raised concerns about damaging him.\n\nThe exchange was the only contentious moment of the gathering, but the rebuke was representative of the growing turmoil between Bush supporters and Right to Rise, as well as a general sense of frustration and anger over what many Bush backers see as lost opportunities.\n\nSome in Bush\u2019s campaign wish that the group had done more over the summer to blunt attacks from Donald Trump, who depicted their candidate as \u201clow-energy,\u201d and to highlight Bush\u2019s record as governor of Florida. But Sally Bradshaw, a senior adviser to Bush, said she thought the group had handled its summer spending appropriately.\n\n\u201cI think a strong argument could be made that going on the air earlier than Labor Day would have been a terrific waste of money,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think that argument, if some are making it, is a little unnecessary armchair quarterbacking.\u201d\n\nThere is also a belief among some Bush loyalists that supporters of Rubio \u2014 who shares longtime friends and donors with Bush, his former mentor \u2014 are fanning rumors of dissatisfaction with Murphy and Right to Rise in a bid to muzzle the group before it can broadcast more attacks against Rubio. (Some of Bush\u2019s allies note pointedly that Rubio\u2019s own super PAC has aired negative ads against other candidates.)\n\nSome Right to Rise donors have been worried for months about attacking Rubio, especially after Right to Rise showed a video it had made portraying him as unelectable, because of his hard-line views against abortion, as an example of the type of tough ad Rubio would face in a general election.\n\nOthers who have given money to the group have argued that it has not gone far enough in attacking rivals like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Rubio, all of whom are vying with Bush for the same group of establishment-aligned voters, especially in places like New Hampshire. Right to Rise has been most aggressive in its criticism of Christie, focusing on his fiscal stewardship of the New Jersey and making subtle references to the George Washington Bridge scandal, which has helped slow Christie\u2019s climb in New Hampshire.\n\nBradshaw was quick to dismiss concerns that Right to Rise \u2014 which legally cannot coordinate with the Bush campaign \u2014 was going too far in its attacks on Bush\u2019s rivals.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that many of these same donors may have been concerned when Mitt Romney made the decision to take on Rick Perry or Newt Gingrich,\u201d she said, \u201cand I would just simply remind them this is a presidential campaign, not a beauty pageant.\u201d\n\nWhile many Bush supporters are surprised at the group\u2019s inability to help Bush rise out of single digits in the polls, others argue that this election cycle, with Trump dominating news coverage, is like no other, with outside money failing to tangibly help any candidate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the super PAC; it\u2019s not any outside donor,\u201d said Jay Zeidman, a Bush donor based in Houston who has raised money for the campaign. \u201cThis cycle is just unique in that money is not the driving factor here, and that\u2019s where you\u2019re probably getting a lot of the frustration.\u201d\n\nOr, as Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman who supports Bush, said, \u201cWe had all thought that the financial advantage would really move us ahead more.\u201d\n\nDonors and supporters have also been puzzled by the performance of Bush, whom they had expected to be a far more capable and nimble candidate than he has proved. Though he is forceful and freewheeling in town hall-style events, he struggles in debates \u2014 which are watched by millions \u2014 and remains uncomfortable with the often-angry rhetoric that has propelled Trump to the top of the polls.\n\nYet, partly out of loyalty and deep personal affinity, supporters view Bush more in sorrow than in anger.\n\n\u201cThere is clearly disappointment in the polls and there is obviously concern over the front-runners,\u201d said Mel Immergut, a venture capitalist and Republican fundraiser supporting Bush. But, he added, \u201cThis group is incredibly loyal, still absolutely has hope and is keeping the faith.\u201d\n\nIn addition to concerns about negative advertising, some donors questioned the rate at which the group was spending. Right to Rise has so far spent more than $50 million on ads, and has reserved more than $20 million before the March primaries, according to a review of advertising purchased. (Donors mocked, for instance, the large red billboards featuring quotations from Bush that the group erected in Des Moines).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of our work in support of Jeb, and will continue to work hard to see that he\u2019s elected,\u201d said Paul Lindsay, a Right to Rise spokesman.\n\nSergio Pino, the president of a home-building company in Florida and an old friend of Bush\u2019s who said he had donated more than $600,000 to Right to Rise, dismissed concerns about the group and its leadership.\n\n\u201cRight to Rise doesn\u2019t have the magic ball but they keep moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a lot of faith in Mike Murphy, that he\u2019s going to do what\u2019s right and, what\u2019s most important, not lie about it.\u201d\n\nThe arrangement between the campaign and the super PAC has always been fraught, from the vantage point of some of the candidate\u2019s allies. Murphy, Bush\u2019s longtime media adviser, is a witty and charismatic image maker who has become an increasingly controversial figure in the 2016 cycle. Though many view him as the maestro helping to prop up Bush as he flails, some worry he is getting carried away, burning his way through a $100 million haul.\n\nIn Iowa, Bush declined to weigh in on whether Murphy and Right to Rise were spending wisely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so busy I can\u2019t follow all of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Interviews with more than a dozen donors and advisers to the candidate revealed a complicated picture of dissatisfaction with the group and its chief strategist.
