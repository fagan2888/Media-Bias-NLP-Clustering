I\u2019m late,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nCerbone relies on his radar to catch speed violators. The device can read vehicles that are either coming or going away from the state trooper.\n\nBut it's not just speeders Cerbone is on the lookout for.\n\n\u201cSeat belts, a lot of erratic driving,\u201d he said, running down a list of violations.\n\nThe trooper is also constantly aware of anything that could be a safety hazard. When he spotted a tire in the middle of the road, he ran into traffic to retrieve it.\n\n\u201cWow, that was scary,\u201d he said after getting safely back into his cruiser. \u201cThat Buick there was coming close.\u201d\n\nLast year, 10 people died on North Carolina highways during the Thanksgiving holiday. Speed remains the leading cause of traffic collisions and fatalities in the state.\n\nCerbone said troopers aren\u2019t trying to ruin anyone\u2019s holiday with tickets. But their job is to keep people safe.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, we do have hearts,\u201d he said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-11-27 17:40:00", "description": "For the past five years, North Carolina State Trooper Marc Cerbone has spent most of Thanksgiving Day patrolling the interstates as holiday commuters rush to their destinations.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-27 18:42:05", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14226553|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the past five years, North Carolina State Trooper Marc Cerbone has spent most of Thanksgiving Day patrolling the interstates as holiday commuters rush to their destinations.", "title": "Trooper: 'We do have hearts' :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/trooper-we-do-have-hearts-/14226553/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/11/27/14226593/14226593-1417130418-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-27T17:40:00-05:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "For the past five years, North Carolina State Trooper Marc Cerbone has spent most of Thanksgiving Day patrolling the interstates as holiday commuters rush to their destinations.", "title": "Trooper: 'We do have hearts' :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/trooper-we-do-have-hearts-/14226553/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/11/27/14226593/14226593-1417130418-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf714\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBelieve it or not, we do have hearts,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat Buick there was coming close.\u201dLast year, 10 people died on North Carolina highways during the Thanksgiving holiday.\nThe device can read vehicles that are either coming or going away from the state trooper.\n\u201cThey want to go see people they haven't seen in a while.\u201dCerbone stopped one driver who was going 85 mph in a 70 mph zone.\nWhen he spotted a tire in the middle of the road, he ran into traffic to retrieve it."}
