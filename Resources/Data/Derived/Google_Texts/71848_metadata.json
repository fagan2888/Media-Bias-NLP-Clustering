Stanford University canceled it in 2014, and a showing of it brought public protests in Minneapolis.\n\nRELATED: Controversial Jackson Musical at Stanford University Canceled\n\nThe play was chosen for the Raleigh Little Theatre before the arrival of new artistic director, Patrick Torres, who began conversations with the Native Community.\n\nHe told the INDY that he saw no way to continue the production with Native support.\n\n\u201cNo matter how the play is executed, the Native American community feels that it comes at the expense of historical facts and atrocities that [Jackson] instigated against their ancestors and family. There was no accurate and clear way to engage them in the process; as an institution, we would be excluding them from the production,\u201d Torres told the INDY.\n\n\u201cNo matter how great the production was, what [the conversations] ultimately said was there was not a way to do it that is not potentially hurtful to them,\u201d Torres continued.\n\nIn 2012, ICTMN spotlighted Andrew Jackson as our top pick for worst U.S. president\u2014because he earned his \u201cIndian Killer\u201d nickname and was a major proponent of Indian removal.\n\nRELATED: Indian-Killer Andrew Jackson Deserves Top Spot on List of Worst U.S. Presidents\n\nThe satirical play makes Jackson a populist rock star and includes lyrics like: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take this country back for people like us.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Mathews, a performing arts professor at Washington University in St. Louis, doesn\u2019t feel the play glorifies Jackson. He told Slate that, \u201cBy the end of the musical, you\u2019re meant to ask yourself, \u2018Was Jackson actually the American Hitler?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Hitler comparison is brought up again by playwright Rhiana Yazzie of New Native Theater in an open letter published by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in June 2014. \u201cThe truth is that Andrew Jackson was not a rockstar and his campaign against tribal people ... is not a farcical backdrop to some emotive, brooding celebrity. Can you imagine a show wherein Hitler was portrayed as a justified, sexy rockstar?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Raleigh Little Theatre in North Carolina announced January 12 that it canceled its production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson scheduled for May.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/17/bloody-bloody-andrew-jackson-canceled-again-158713", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bloody-bloody-andrew-jackson_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "\u2018Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\u2019 Canceled Again"}, "abstract": "Raleigh Little Theatre in North Carolina announced January 12 that it canceled its production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson scheduled for May.Raleigh Little Theatre in North Carolina announced January 12 that it canceled its production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson scheduled for May.", "dc": {"title": "\u2018Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\u2019 Canceled Again"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/17/bloody-bloody-andrew-jackson-canceled-again-158713", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Andrew Jackson, Native American History, Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-01-17T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "\u2018Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\u2019 Canceled Again"}, "article_summary": "Raleigh Little Theatre in North Carolina announced January 12 that it canceled its production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson scheduled for May.\n\u201cThe truth is that Andrew Jackson was not a rockstar and his campaign against tribal people ... is not a farcical backdrop to some emotive, brooding celebrity.\nIn 2012, ICTMN spotlighted Andrew Jackson as our top pick for worst U.S. president\u2014because he earned his \u201cIndian Killer\u201d nickname and was a major proponent of Indian removal.\nThere was no accurate and clear way to engage them in the process; as an institution, we would be excluding them from the production,\u201d Torres told the INDY.\nRELATED: Indian-Killer Andrew Jackson Deserves Top Spot on List of Worst U.S. PresidentsThe satirical play makes Jackson a populist rock star and includes lyrics like: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take this country back for people like us.\u201dJeffrey Mathews, a performing arts professor at Washington University in St. Louis, doesn\u2019t feel the play glorifies Jackson."}
