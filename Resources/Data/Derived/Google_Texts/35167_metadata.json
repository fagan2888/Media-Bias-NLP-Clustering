One such example is the Vanderbilt Program in Interprofessional Learning (VPIL) that was established in 2010 with initial support from the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, and later from the Baptist Health Trust.\n\nTo learn about the challenges, successes, and surprises experienced by those who developed and lead IPE at Vanderbilt, I interviewed Linda Norman, dean of Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, Bonnie Miller, associate vice chancellor for Health Affairs and senior associate dean for Health Sciences Education at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Heather Davidson, director of Program Development for VPIL.\n\nPeter Buerhaus: What were the key challenges faced when you started IPE at Vanderbilt?\n\nLinda Norman: Although the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing had a history of trying to work together to develop IPE, we had never come up with a common and sustainable place to put IPE in our respective curriculums. Everything we had tried previously ended up as an add-on to the curriculum. We had numerous discussions about how to create IPE that would be meaningful to students and also contribute to clinical operations. Initially, we thought only of nursing and medicine but the more we examined the clinical situation, the more we realized that other health care providers were integral. So we looked at adding pharmacy and then social work. The challenge was to identify the place in the curriculum where our health professions students and interprofessional education would best fit.\n\nBonnie Miller: We did not want IPE to be a new requirement for all students, but rather, we hoped to figure out ways that IPE could help fill established requirements. For example, within the School of Nursing IPE would fulfill credits in community health, and in the School of Medicine IPE substituted for certain elective courses and now provides credit for a required course, Foundations of Healthcare Delivery (FHD). Not all of our students are required to participate in VPIL. The notion of having one program that would meet requirements for four very different professions was quite challenging.\n\nHeather Davidson: The challenge of integrating IPE into the curriculum also involved developing new roles for the initial VPIL faculty. Faculty representing each of the four health professions had to become liaisons between VPIL and their home professional school. Their work included negotiating the alignment of the home school\u2019s goals, objectives, competencies, credit requirements, etc. with the innovative vision of an IPE curriculum in order to eliminate the \u201cadd on\u201d effect for the program. They had to be creative when identifying where a VPIL experience could be substitutive and simultaneously nurture their own role as part of the interprofessional faculty team charged with creating a meaningful educational program that met IPE goals. The initial work at operationalizing the program had to be perceived as a \u201cwin-win\u201d by everyone involved. Therefore, faculty from different institutions had to tackle a unique challenge of supporting a curriculum that would hit their own needs as well as the needs of the IPE vision. Although their liaison role was vital in the early stages of design and implementation, it has continued to be extremely important as we have worked to make the program sustainable. Schools have gone through curriculum reform, shifting schedules and our own continual improvement.\n\nNorman: In the beginning we decided we were not going to let schedules stand in our way for getting IPE accomplished. We agreed that we would do whatever was necessary to have the students from four disciplines be together at the same clinic with the same team on the same day for a two-year period. We knew that IPE could be derailed by scheduling issues and failing to have common expectations, common competencies for the students, and faculty who were champions. We sought to overcome these challenges by engaging the academic administrators of each of the programs and obtain their buy-in before we started planning the curricula. We intentionally partnered with people who had the same level of commitment that we did, and were conscious not to let extraneous things get in the way.\n\nMiller: Logistics are formidable and can become a seemingly overwhelming obstacle when programs do not have the energy or will to overcome them. Without dedicated commitment at the ground level among the faculty members who are creating the program and key administrators supporting them, IPE won\u2019t happen.\n\nDavidson: We have used words like creativity, tenacity and flexibility to describe the characteristics of the people who are committed to IPE and have decision-making power at the different institutions. This was not a one time, \u201clet\u2019s design the program,\u201d and figure out all the logistics. Logistics is an enduring challenge as each school is continuing to improve itself, make curricula changes, and prepare for the implications of health reform.\n\nMiller: Even though these were start-up challenges, many of them have not completely gone away. We overcame them, but they continue to show up in a variety of different forms. It is not just the initial commitment but rather it is an ongoing commitment. To be sure, the fact that the Macy Foundation was interested in the program and provided a large grant has helped sustained our commitment and enthusiasm.\n\nNorman: Our commitment was also strengthened by the accrediting bodies for each of our disciplines who were looking closely at how we integrated IPE into the curriculum. Also, each of our academic professional organizations was urging the development of IPE. Another challenge we faced involved determining the level of the nursing, medical, pharmacy, and social work student that should be included in our IPE model. Should it be a new learner or a more experienced learner? As a group, we decided that the new learner was the best place to start. We had not seen anything in the IPE literature about using new learners; most IPE at the time involved more experienced learners. We wanted to provide IPE when students had not yet developed notions about their own discipline.\n\nDavidson: Choosing the clinic placement sites was also a challenge because so few clinics are actually thinking about IPE. Consequently, IPE was not going to be a \u201cnormal role modeling experience\u201d where students are precepted in clinic settings. We had to find clinics that were willing to take on a group of four students and clinical faculty willing to teach those students who were not from their own profession. This challenge has continued as we have expanded the number of students over the years.\n\nMiller: The things that should not be challenges actually become challenges, such as space. Even when you have staff and preceptors who buy into the idea, it turns out that having room for four extra learners in your clinic, with the required number of exam rooms, and the ability to manage and direct traffic, becomes a limiting factor.\n\nBuerhaus: Did you follow an existing model when establishing IPE at Vanderbilt?\n\nMiller: We were unaware of any IPE models designed for incoming students who were going to be based in clinics and would be expected to make meaningful contributions to patient care. There was a medical center retreat at Vanderbilt in 2008 that later led to the 2010 \u2018Beyond Flexner\u2019 article that was published in Academic Medicine. Several very important principles emerged from the retreat, namely that \u201call learners work, all workers learn,\u201d and that learning should be team-based, situated in an authentic context, and competency-based.\n\nNorman: In our earlier attempts at IPE, we tried the didactic course approach with nursing and medical students and used scenarios and role playing, but these did not seem to interest students or lead to meaningful engagement with students from other disciplines. This approach lacked authenticity.\n\nDavidson: Given that experience, we wanted our new IPE curricula to encourage students to go beyond acquiring knowledge, but to become more aware of their attitudes and promote their making behavioral change. We also wanted learning to be transformative, to provide students with an authentic environment where risky questions and issues could bubble up, and students could wrestle with questions for which there are no clear answers, but which are some of the root causes of the difficulties typically experienced in our health care delivery environment.\n\nBuerhaus: What are some of the successes of VIPL?\n\nMiller: The program has gone through internal curriculum revisions, major curriculum reform at the medical school, and a variety of different reforms and leadership changes at our partner schools of pharmacy and social work. Yet, VIPL has survived. Additionally, we have also been able to demonstrate that students can add value to the clinic. Students have been able to cross train, reconcile medications, conduct behavioral interviewing, perform motivational coaching, carry out process mapping, implement quality improvement projects, and redesign clinic space and function. We have proven that students are not just passive bystanders but that, even during the earliest stages of their education, they can add value to the clinic and to patient care. Importantly, VPIL has also helped students become systems thinkers.\n\nNorman: Unlike when we began the program, today we have a dedicated and engaged faculty who value interprofessional education and are working together from the clinical and academic sides to constantly improve the IPE experience. We now have faculty who have developed expertise in IPE.\n\nDavidson: I believe that students have also become relationship-based thinkers. I recently had a conversation with one of our third year medical students who said he did not realize that at the time he was in VPIL, but now that he has been in his clerkships, he realizes that 75 percent of what he does directly involves the relationships he has established with other individuals. He explained that VPIL gave him the opportunity to learn how to build good relationships with other disciplines. Students who come through the program have a broader and richer perspective of who is caring for people and the complexity of that work. We believe this is beyond the technical skills they are learning through their home curricula. And we see that they have strategies and content on how to relate to other professions to share with other members of their own \u201ctribe.\u201d\n\nNorman: I have received feedback from students who have completed the program who said, \u201cNow that I am out in the work world, I realize how much I benefitted from VPIL. It was an asset when I applied for a job and I was more confident and less hesitant to reach out to other disciplines.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: For more information on the IPE program at Vanderbilt such as student interaction and future development, see the full interview.\n\nBuerhaus: How do you see IPE developing across the country?\n\nNorman: IPE is spreading like a wildfire. Several years ago The Health Resources and Services Administration established the Center for Interprofessional Education, the Josiah Macy Foundation continues to provide vision and support innovations, and the Interprofessional Education Collaborative, among many other efforts, have fundamentally changed the health professional education landscape. A national IPE movement is well underway across the country.\n\nDavidson: We\u2019re seeing institutions assessing IPE models and eager to learn from others about how best to implement IPE in their institution. There is a tremendous amount of work to develop and operationalize IPE competencies. So much of IPE involves group dynamics. A key question for organizations to confront is to answer \u201cWhat are the barriers that keep us from working together?\u201d Instead of there being the physician tribe, the nursing tribe, and social work and pharmacy tribes, can we start looking at each other as one tribe caring for people?\n\nMiller: There will be tension. Much of the tension I believe involves redefining what the professions are, and what the workforce of the future needs to look like, and how each of the various professions will contribute.\n\nBuerhaus: What advice would you offer to those considering developing IPE?\n\nNorman: People will need to figure out what will work in their own organization. They\u2019ll need to assess their resources and be wary of thinking that they can take a model of IPE being done in another institution and simply adopt it.\n\nDavidson: If the organizational goal is to place students together in a clinic, they need to anticipate the need for faculty representing the different professions that will help navigate IPE education for the students. VPIL uses rotating faculty who are not billing clinicians and are not part of the clinic staff but are part of the educational program. These professionals help the students, as a team, navigate their learning experiences, keep the IPE focus on task, ask questions, debrief students, and work with clinical preceptors. We believe the program\u2019s rotating faculty is a very important part of our VPIL success. You cannot just place an IPE student team in a clinical environment, no matter how excited they are to have them, and then walk away.\n\nMiller: We\u2019re starting to see that as the students and clinic become comfortable with each other, the student team begins to \u201cown the clinic,\u201d and they need less guidance from the VPIL rotating faculty. IPE champions are really important at every level; you need the champions at the institution leadership level all the way to those at the implementation level. Identify the model that you think will work for your setting, and then identify who your champions will be. Do not make it too hard for them. And, of course, there is the resource issue: It is very frustrating for people on the ground floor trying to implement IPE when they do not have the resources needed to be successful.\n\nNorman: While creating IPE is a complex process, the outcomes for the students, faculty, and clinical area are well worth the effort. Organizations that embark on IPE need to devote the time and resources to have meaningful programs. IPE is an area within health care that is still in its infancy, and we can only anticipate that the types of IPE programs and related initiatives will grow exponentially in the next decade. There is a groundswell of support for IPE within health professions education that has not been present previously.\n\nBuerhaus: Thank you Linda, Bonnie, and Heather.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: For more information on the IPE program at Vanderbilt such as student interaction and future development, see the full interview.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/11/20/spreading-like-a-wildfire-interprofessional-education-the-vanderbilt-experience/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Spreading Like A Wildfire: Interprofessional Education \u2013 The Vanderbilt Experience"}, "description": "Spreading Like A Wildfire: Interprofessional Education \u2013 The Vanderbilt Experience | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Editor\u2019s note: For more information on the IPE program at Vanderbilt such as student interaction and future development, see the full interview.\nPeter BuerhausNovember 20, 2014Well before the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, efforts to expand interprofessional education (IPE) were beginning to change the mindset that permeated much of health professional education in the US.\nThe challenge was to identify the place in the curriculum where our health professions students and interprofessional education would best fit.\nSeveral years ago The Health Resources and Services Administration established the Center for Interprofessional Education, the Josiah Macy Foundation continues to provide vision and support innovations, and the Interprofessional Education Collaborative, among many other efforts, have fundamentally changed the health professional education landscape.\nwith the innovative vision of an IPE curriculum in order to eliminate the \u201cadd on\u201d effect for the program."}
