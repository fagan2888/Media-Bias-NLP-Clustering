ST. LOUIS, Oct. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Equifax Workforce Solutions, a leader in human resource, analytics and verification services, and a business unit of Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX), today announced that its Affordable Care Act (ACA) Management Platform, an advanced tool that enables HR departments to automate ACA compliance, has been selected for a 2014 Ventana Research Technology Innovation Award in the category of Business Innovation for Governance, Risk and Compliance. The company accepted the honor at a reception that took place at the Ventana Research Summit on Wednesday, October 22, 2014.

Selected for its highly innovative features, the ACA Management Platform is designed to help organizations comply with the employer mandate and avoid ACA-related fines. The platform quickly integrates benefits, payroll and HRIS data to provide forward-looking insight into eligibility, affordability and fine exposure. The platform also automates the distribution and fulfillment of IRS reporting requirements.

"Equifax Workforce Solutions understands the complexity of the ACA, which is why we developed a solution that simplifies ongoing management to help organizations navigate and comply with the legislation," said Mike Psenka, senior vice president, Workforce Analytics, for Equifax Workforce Solutions. "Since its launch, the ACA Management Platform has grown to manage ACA compliance for over 250 organizations representing 7.6 million employees. We are extremely honored to receive this award from Ventana Research, which recognizes the strength of our technology and our commitment to innovation."

"We would like to congratulate Equifax on winning this year's Ventana Research Technology Innovation Award in the category of governance risk and compliance (GRC)," said Stephan Millard, VP and Research Director, Ventana Research. "Equifax's ACA Management Platform contains many of the needed capabilities to help companies reduce overall risk and reduce risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, specifically the impending requirements of Affordable Care Act and the Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions, which our research shows as the two most important objectives of GRC projects."

In addition to accepting the award, Equifax Workforce Solutions participated in a panel discussion at the Ventana Research Summit. Speaking on the topic of maximizing employee experience with applications, Jason O'Leary, senior director of Product Delivery for Equifax, helped highlight the importance of technology innovation as part of the recruitment and hiring process.
