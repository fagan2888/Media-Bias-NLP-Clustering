He had a heart for the poor and the infirm. He knew that good health is the paramount possession and our legacy is the most important thing we leave behind.\n\nWinton died in 2008 at 79, about 25 years after he was struck with a blood cancer that nearly killed him early. He credited the extra years to the marvels of modern medicine as well as the \u201ccomplementary stuff\u201d that included diet, and spiritual and psychological training.\n\n\u201cMike had an interesting time doing it,\u201d recalled Penny Winton with a chuckle. \u201cAnd his doctors supported it.\u201d\n\nThe Wintons had the resources to explore and pursue complementary medicine, which increasingly has become mainstream around the country.\n\nGrateful for Mike Winton\u2019s ability to manage his disease, the Wintons, in consultation with friends and health advisers, opened Pathways for this community in 1988 in an old house near Uptown.\n\nThe Wintons invested several million dollars over the years, including a new building and gardens, so that at no cost, thousands of hurting people could learn to heal their bodies, minds and spirits from volunteer health professionals, therapists and others through a variety of health, wellness and nutrition programs, art therapy, energy healing, massage, meditation and reflection.\n\n\u201cEvery illness is a spiritual crisis and an opportunity for spiritual growth,\u201d Dr. Greg Plotnikoff of the Institute for Health and Healing once said of Pathways. \u201cThe best answers are often found rather than given. As Pathways supports the best of Western medicine, it provides multiple ways for finding answers that best fit one\u2019s experience.\u201d\n\nTim Thorpe, a former businessman who took over as executive director of Pathways in 2008, points to independent studies that Pathway\u2019s \u201cRenewing Life\u201d and other programs help participants coping with chronic illness or trauma shift from states of crisis to well being, better manage pain and anxiety and live with confidence.\n\nPathways, a complementary-medicine pioneer, also has demonstrated that it can be sustainable and help drive economical change in health care.\n\nThe Wintons instructed the board that their support, often up to half of the annual budget, wouldn\u2019t last forever, and it has slowly declined to less than $50,000 annually of an $800,000 budget, including about $350,000 worth of donated services from volunteer health providers.\n\nUnder Thorpe, Pathways has started to generate revenue from retreats and programs it offers through the likes of Fairview Health, Ebenezer senior housing and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Pathways also boasts a growing group of individual and institutional supporters.\n\nBefore he died, Mike Winton led a $1 million capital campaign to function as a Pathways reserve, \u201cso when Penny turns off the faucet or in case we hit a rough patch, that will help us get through lean years while we keep our mission intact,\u201d Thorpe said.\n\n\u201cPathways is a magical place,\u201d said Rhesa Schwartz, a Pathway\u2019s participant who suffered from the emotional pain of a divorce compounded by horrific back pain after she was hit in her vehicle by a drunken driver.\n\n\u201cI got physical and emotional work done at Pathways,\u201d said Schwartz, who now volunteers as a healing-touch provider. \u201cI\u2019ve been volunteering since 2007. Pathways helped me when I was feeling really alone and was in debilitating pain. It led me on the path to what I do now as an vocation.\u201d\n\nIn a discussion about philanthropy 15 years ago, Mike Winton said: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to write a check. It\u2019s quite another to really get your emotions involved. That\u2019s where the payoff is, in these relationships and with the people that are really impacted by some of the things we\u2019re involved in.\u201d\n\nMike Winton, one shrewd investor, would be happy that Pathways has provided a huge return on investment to so many people on what he would consider a pretty modest investment.\n\nMore information: www.pathwaysminneapolis.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Pathways, a complementary-medicine pioneer, has demonstrated that it can be sustainable and help drive economical change in health care.", "title": "St. Anthony: Investors' gift pays healthy dividends", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/st-anthony-investors-gift-pays-healthy-dividends/260491471/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08+623305+5Nealst052614.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08+623305+5Nealst052614.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Pathways, a complementary-medicine pioneer, has demonstrated that it can be sustainable and help drive economical change in health care.", "title": "St. Anthony: Investors' gift pays healthy dividends", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/st-anthony-investors-gift-pays-healthy-dividends/260491471/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08+623305+5Nealst052614.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08+623305+5Nealst052614.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Pathways, a complementary-medicine pioneer, has demonstrated that it can be sustainable and help drive economical change in health care."}, "article_summary": "Mike Winton, an accomplished Ivy Leaguer who served in the CIA in the 1950s, had confidence but not cockiness.\nThe late Mike Winton was a savvy investor who knew how to make money.\nIt led me on the path to what I do now as an vocation.\u201dIn a discussion about philanthropy 15 years ago, Mike Winton said: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to write a check.\nHe knew that good health is the paramount possession and our legacy is the most important thing we leave behind.\nGifts from the Wintons that ranged into the millions nurtured art museums, restored churches, built affordable housing and staked the United Way."}
