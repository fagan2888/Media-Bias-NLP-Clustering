What a tragedy! What a tragedy! What a tragedy!\u2019 exclaimed Ambassador Roble Olhaye of the African nation of Djibouti. \u201cDeepest condolences to his family, South Africa and the world at large. Everybody will be deeply saddened. We wish him peace. God bless his soul.\u201d\n\nMr. Olhaye\u2019s despair was shared throughout Washington\u2019s diplomatic community, as ambassadors struggled to find words to express their grief over the death South Africa\u2019s first black president, who served 27 years in prison in his fight against apartheid.\n\nPHOTOS: Nelson Mandela, anti-apartheid icon and statesman\n\nThe news struck hardest at the South African Embassy, where Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool recorded a message to his countrymen in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe meet with heavy hearts,\u201d he said. \u201cThis man who came out of prison liberated all of us from our inhumanity and from our worst selves.\u201d\n\nMr. Rasool announced that the Washington National Cathedral will hold a memorial service at 11 a.m. Wednesday. He urged those who want to attend to apply for tickets at saembassy.org.\n\nThe embassy, at 3051 Massachusetts Ave. NW, will hold open a book of condolences from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 7 to 8 p.m. through Tuesday.\n\nAFRICAN SKIES\n\nThe year was 1987. Nelson Mandela was in prison, and I was stepping off a plane in Johannesburg amid the dying whimpers of apartheid.\n\nThe policy of white-minority rule had kept blacks and other non-white South Africans as second-class citizens since 1948, when the descendants of Dutch settlers imposed the racial laws.\n\nBut conditions in South Africa\u2019s largest city showed cracks in the apartheid regime that would crumble by 1994.\n\nAlthough Johannesburg was legally segregated, many white landlords broke the law by renting to blacks. In the posh Sun Tower Hotel, blacks and whites shared drinks at the bar, but blacks could not stay overnight.\n\nI was one of several Washington Times editors and reporters on the trip, which took us to the crowded and violent black township of Soweto, where we passed row after row of slum housing. Our guides showed us a plush neighborhood of minimansions in the midst of the poverty, including one owned by Mr. Mandela\u2019s wife at the time, Winnie.\n\nWe also toured stunning Cape Town; the capital, Pretoria; the coastal city of Durban; and KwaZul, where we interviewed Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.\n\nMy thoughts often return to a walk around Johannesburg one night as a sign that things were changing. A colleague and I strolled into a black bar. No one took notice of the only two white men in the crowd. They were too busy dancing to music that had become controversial in the U.S.\n\nA year earlier, in 1986, folk singer Paul Simon defied global bans on cultural exchanges with South Africa and traveled there to record an album with several black bands. They included Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a highly regarded choral group virtually unknown outside of South Africa until Mr. Simon's \u201cGraceland\u201d album helped give them worldwide fame.\n\nAs we left the bar, the sounds of one of the songs followed us:\n\n\u201cJoseph\u2019s face was black as night / The pale moon shone in his eyes / His path was marked by the stars / in the Southern Hemisphere/ And he walked his days / under African skies.\u201d\n\nDIPLOMATIC TRAFFIC\n\nForeign visitors in Washington this week include:\n\nMonday\n\n\u2022 Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, a former deputy prime minister and minister of education of Malaysia; and Rosnani Hashim of the International Islamic University of Malaysia. They address the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\n\u2022 Embassy Row is published on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
