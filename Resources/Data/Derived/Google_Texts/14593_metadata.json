Sign up for a $62 two-month trial subscription today .\n\nNot-for-profit Blues plans \u201crepresent the backbone of the exchanges,\u201d but the majority of them are sustaining large losses in the public exchanges with margins that are worse than the levels reported by other insurance carriers, Credit Suisse analyst Scott Fidel wrote in a recent research note. The public exchange market will survive the loss of a dozen Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans (CO-OPs), but the exit of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans \u201cwould seriously threaten the continued existence of the public exchanges,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIncreased use of narrow networks combined with premiums that more accurately reflect the health risk of exchange enrollees could help Blues plans battle back from a difficult start on the exchanges.\n\nFull-year 2015 earnings among Blues plans are expected to show a deep decline after 23 of 35 Blues plan collectively reported an earnings drop of $1.9 billion for the first nine months of the year, largely due to their experiences on public exchanges. For 2016, however, earnings among Blues plans should rebound due to higher 2016 premiums, says Mark Rouck, a senior director at Fitch (see table, p. 8).\n\nHCSC\u2019s Losses Recede\n\nHealth Care Service Corp. (HCSC), which operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in five states, lost $1.5 billion on its individual Affordable Care Act (ACA)-compliant plans in 2015 \u2014 according to recent financial filings. After factoring in a $650 million premium deficiency reserve, the insurer lost $866 million last year on its ACA plans.\n\nAs of the end of 2015, HCSC\u2019s retail market membership, which includes on- and off-exchange individual policies, student health plans and temporary plans, was 1.7 million. The company is in the process of finalizing retail open enrollment figures for 2016, says spokesperson Mark Spencer. Based on the company\u2019s assumptions around changes in the marketplace, HCSC didn\u2019t record a premium deficiency reserve in 2015 for its 2016 retail business.\n\nWhile HCSC recorded a net loss of $66 million for 2015, that\u2019s substantially less than the $282 million loss reported for 2014. Overall, HCSC\u2019s total revenue increased more than 15% in 2015 to $35 billion thanks to administrative contracts with self-insured employers and using common accounting principles, says Spencer.\n\nHCSC sells QHPs through HealthCare.gov in Illinois, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas. The company pulled out of New Mexico\u2019s state-run exchange last summer after local regulators declined to approve an average 51.6% rate increase for the company\u2019s 2016 individual products. The Blues plan operator had about 35,000 exchange members in that state, (HEX 8/15, p. 1). HCSC also discontinued non-group PPOs in some states for 2016.\n\nAmong single-state Blues plans, some fared much better than others on the public exchanges. Harrisburg, Pa.-based Capital BlueCross, for example, saw overall net income plummet 904% during the first nine months of 2015. Florida Blue\u2019s net income, by contrast, soared more than 8,000% to $174 million, up from just $2 million in the first nine months of 2014, according to a Feb. 24 analysis from ratings firm Fitch Ratings.\n\nGoing into 2015, the Blues had more exposure in the exchanges than their publicly traded competitors. \u201cThe results weren\u2019t completely surprising,\u201d Rouck tells HEX. Blues plans typically operate statewide, while publicly traded companies can be more selective about the markets where they sell coverage. Moreover, Blues plans tend to operate in just one state, and generally have large market share. And single-state Blues plans tend to be not-for-profit, so their mission isn\u2019t necessarily to achieve a certain return or to satisfy shareholders, he adds.\n\nAlong with substantially higher rates for exchange-based plans sold by some Blues plans, some 2017 products might be built around tighter provider networks. The most successful publicly traded carriers were the ones that implemented narrow network products, Rouck says. But the idea of narrow networks runs counter to the wide networks and rich benefits typically associated with Blues plans, he notes.\n\n\u00a9 2016 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
