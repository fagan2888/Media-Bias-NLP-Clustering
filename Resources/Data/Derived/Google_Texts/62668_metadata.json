In the process, she infuriated Johnny Carson, the titanic TV star who had long supported her and, 20 years before, made her an overnight star.\n\nOr, put another way: In October 1986, Rivers made TV history as the first (and still only) woman to host a late-night broadcast talk show. She was the first face of the Fox network, headlining its first program, \u201cThe Late Show Starring Joan Rivers.\u201d She was a winner.\n\nAnd through getting fired after eight months on the air, then losing her husband to suicide three months after that, Rivers displayed epic fortitude. She picked herself up, recreated herself and renewed her career.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of Joan is that, despite the tragic loss of a friendship, of a show and of a husband, she was resilient. And after all that, she became part of pop culture once again \u2014 or more so than ever before,\u201d says Henry Bushkin, Carson\u2019s one-time legal adviser.\n\nIn retrospect, her flier in late-night TV should occupy only one, brief chapter in a long, storied career \u2014 a trailblazing run that ended Thursday, all too soon, days after Rivers, a dynamic 81, went into cardiac arrest at a doctor\u2019s office during a routine procedure. A private funeral is set for Sunday.\n\nWith \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d she took her place as one in a string of Carson\u2019s fallen challengers, who also included Joey Bishop, Merv Griffin, Dick Cavett and Alan Thicke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault,\u201d Rivers told the audience on her last \u201cLate Show,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 23 years. I\u2019m going to be in it another 23 years.\u201d\n\nShe did that and then some. But never again on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\u201d Rivers\u2019 debut appearance with Carson in 1965 propelled her into the national spotlight. And after dozens more appearances through the years, both as a guest and subbing for Johnny at his desk, she was named the show\u2019s first \u201cpermanent guest host\u201d in 1983.\n\nThen, unbeknownst to Carson, Rivers signed with Fox for a show to compete against him.\n\nBushkin, who then was among Carson\u2019s inner circle, recalls the day he learned about her deal.\n\n\u201cI got a call from a reporter \u2014 \u2018Did you know \u2026?'\u201d says Bushkin, who recently published \u201cJohnny Carson,\u201d a book about working with the legendary host. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, and I immediately called Johnny to let HIM know before he found out somewhere else.\u201d\n\nWhat was Carson\u2019s response to the news?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll edit it,\u201d says Bushkin. \u201cHe was very upset.\u201d\n\nDespite Rivers\u2019 attempts to smooth things over with her friend and mentor, Carson, who died in 2005, never spoke to her again. And his de facto blacklist seemed to last long after his retirement. Rivers returned to \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d only this year, when incoming host Jimmy Fallon welcomed her back to the same NBC studio where she had made her first appearance 49 years earlier.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For Joan Rivers, victory from loss in late night", "title": "For Joan Rivers, victory from loss in late night", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For Joan Rivers, victory from loss in late night", "title": "For Joan Rivers, victory from loss in late night", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/06/for_joan_rivers_victory_from_loss_in_late_night/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/joan-rivers-in-late-night.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For Joan Rivers, victory from loss in late night", "title": "For Joan Rivers, victory from loss in late night", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/joan-rivers-in-late-night.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Frazier Moore", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce803\"", "article_summary": "She was the first face of the Fox network, headlining its first program, \u201cThe Late Show Starring Joan Rivers.\u201d She was a winner.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Joan Rivers bombed in late night for the world to see, on an upstart network no one thought would last.\nBut never again on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\u201d Rivers\u2019 debut appearance with Carson in 1965 propelled her into the national spotlight.\nThen, unbeknownst to Carson, Rivers signed with Fox for a show to compete against him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault,\u201d Rivers told the audience on her last \u201cLate Show,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 23 years."}
