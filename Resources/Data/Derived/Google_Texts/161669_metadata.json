The official Santa mailbox will be available in the front lobby of the Reporter-Herald until Dec. 22 during business hours of 8 a.m.-12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.-5 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChildren are invited to submit their letters and all letters will be published in the newspaper before being sent on to Santa Claus.\n\nIn 1969, the children's Santa missives included:\n\n\"Dear Santa, I am five years old. May I have a Susy-Homemaker Easy Bake Oven. A Tinker Bell doll, a sink with cupboards, Jane West Doll with a chuck wagon and Jane and Cow Girl boots that are wite decorashons. Merry Christmas. Love, Heidi Kay Hagert.\"\n\nA girl named Heidi wrote this letter to Santa for the Dec. 5, 1980, Reporter-Herald newspaper. (From the archives / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\"I made a bad mistake on the other letter I sent you. If you already read the other letter it said may I have a Johnny lightning set - that was the mistake. I meant Johny lightning 500 may I have that. I have been waiting for 2 years. - Jerry Osborn.\"\n\n\"Dear Santa Claus, I'll see you at H.P. this Christmas. I hope you will get me a Beautiful Crissy. You are nice Santa. I cleaned my room and helped my cousins with the dishes. - Love Sherri Drewer.\"\n\n\"Merry Christmas. Dewey would like a electric train and tin man for Christmas. Please bring David a bicycle. Something for our cat named Fu and our dog named Sam. We love you. - Dewey and David Chandler.\"\n\n\"Dear Santa, I am six years old. I would like to have a football game. My little sister would like ants in the pants. - Love, Eddy and Mary Styvar.\"\n\nChildren at the end of the 1960s were after Hot Wheels, Rock-um Sock-um sets, something called \"Hoppity Hop,\" toy movie projectors, bikes, Johnny Lightning and Beautiful Chrissy Dolls.\n\nIn the early 1970s, it was Evil Kneivel, spirograph phonographs, wind-up cars, Tonka tractors, Baby Alives, Barbie Jet Planes and other Barbie accessories.\n\nAnd in the early 1980s it was Star Wars figures, remote control cars, roller skates, \"Cry Baby\" dolls, board games and matchbox cars.\n\nCraig Schmid, who retired from being a land surveyor, doesn't remember the letter he wrote to Santa in 1969, although he does remember wanting the \"Rock-um Sock-um\" robots and never getting the robots.\n\nHis letter said, \"I usually clean my bedroom and play with my little brother, mark, very nice. I want a new car and some airplanes and a rock-um-sock-ums robots. What do you want? How have you and rudolph been good?\"\n\n\"They were kind of cool. They were in a boxing ring and had a trigger mechanism and they would slug each other and if you hit them just right, their heads popped off,\" Schmid said in a Tuesday phone interview.\n\nHe has lived in Loveland since he was four years old and grew up with two older brothers and one younger.\n\n\"I have a lot of early memories fishing at Lake Loveland back when it was public,\" he said. \"My folks had a cabin at Red Feather Lakes and we used to go up there fairly regularly.\"\n\nHe said his favorite give as a child was a Schwinn 10-speed varsity bicycle when he was 15.\n\nJessica Benes: 970-669-5050 ext. 530, jbenes@reporter-herald.com, twitter.com/jessicabenes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_26998141/letters-santa-program-launches-again-at-reporter-herald", "modificationDate": "2014-11-23T15:32:57-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1123/20141123__23RHALettersSantaw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jessica Benes \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Digging into the Reporter-Herald archives reveals that the \"Letters to Santa\" program by the Reporter-Herald dates back to around 1969.
