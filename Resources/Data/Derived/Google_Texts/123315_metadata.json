The time to \u2018learn on the job\u2019 has come and gone, no?\n\nEli Lake has a post up today on how President Obama and his cultural nemesis, Kayne West, could complement each other \u2014 the president as a superb rap artist but a third-rate producer, and West as a much better producer than he is a rapper. From Lake:\n\nIf Barack Obama was in the hip hop business, he\u2019d be a rapper. His speeches inspire, his rhetoric soars and he exudes charisma. Obama however would not be a producer, a job that requires the skill to manage the egos of artists and pay attention to the details that can turn a rapper\u2019s lyrical vision into a downloadable single. DJ Premier or Pete Rock would have never allowed the Obamacare website to be unveiled before the bugs were worked out.\n\nThis is where Kanye comes into the picture. While Kanye is a rapper today, he made his mark at first as Jay Z\u2019s producer. Even though Kanye has sold millions of records, his lyrics never seem as natural or spell binding as many others in the game.*\n\nThe point: West is a magician behind the scenes, and if he and the president were to ever appear on an episode of \u201cIconoclasts,\u201d West could draw upon his particular skills to \u201cteach Obama how to better manage a project and [see] it through despite the opposition of those wishing him to fail,\u201d Lake writes.\n\nPerhaps unintentionally, this reinforces two related lessons of the Obama administration that the nation would be wise to remember in future elections: One, the presidency is not a job for someone who simply can orate really well, and two, being a chief executive doesn\u2019t lend itself much to \u2018learning as you go.\u2019\n\nRepublicans have hammered the first point from the first days of the Obama era. Rhetorical talent is a key attribute of any president \u2014 his words carry unmatched influence \u2014 but it is not a sole qualification for the gig. The person who speaks and spins politics in public without having to manage the policies he\u2019s defending is called the press secretary, not the president. \u201cPresident\u201d is not synonymous with Orator in Chief: a charismatic someone whose \u201cspeeches inspire\u201d and \u201crhetoric soars.\u201d Our nation\u2019s history is full of inspiring individuals whose words, written or spoken, have taken root outside the Oval Office: Gouverneur Morris, a Founding Father, prominent abolitionist and \u201cpenman of the Constitution;\u201d Sens. Daniel Webster and Robert Hayne, who staged the best true \u2018debate\u2019 in the history of the Senate; MLK, and on and on.\n\nTerrific lyricists and \u2018rappers,\u2019 all of them \u2014 and not one of them a producer.\n\nThe presidency is a job for a producer; an expert one. That\u2019s largely why President Obama has declined in popularity and effectiveness with the passing years of his administration, and it\u2019s a reminder of why presidents don\u2019t have endless time to ride with training wheels. Sure, the principal learns on the job every day \u2014 he has to, as the job makes the man, and the man doesn\u2019t make the job \u2014 but lack of management skill is an unacceptable deficiency, especially after re-election. This president has had nearly five years to show himself as a competent executive and has failed. The nation\u2019s healthcare system is in terrible upheaval, the executive branch is marred by scandal, and there\u2019s an evident lack of control behind all of it. Now is not the time to place a phone call to Kanye for advice.\n\nCampaigning and public speaking are for artists. Governing is for producers.\n\n\u2014\n\n* Debatable \u2014 Kanye can write egomania instead of lyrics, but he can also pen \u201cToo many Urkels on your team / That\u2019s why you\u2019re Winslow\u201d and pretty much all of \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d \u2014 but the metaphor is clear.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Eli Lake has a post up today on how President Obama and his cultural nemesis, Kayne West, could complement each other -- the president as a superb rap artist but a third-rate producer, and West as a much better producer than he is a rapper.
