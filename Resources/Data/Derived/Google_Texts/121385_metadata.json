This is definitely cooler than when we sequenced the tomato. Maybe even cooler than when we sequenced the cocoa tree. After all, the coffee bean, as the researchers duly note, is \u201ca valuable beverage crop due to its characteristic flavor, aroma, and the stimulating effects of caffeine.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot we could do with this kind of information.\n\nOver at the New York Times, Carl Zimmer discusses what the news means for our understanding of the evolution of the world\u2019s favorite drug. Caffeine, he writes, may have developed as a way to kill off competition by contaminating the soil. In low doses, it gives insects and animals a happy buzz, which some have theorized helps it to attract pollinators. And in high doses, it\u2019s toxic \u2014 a potential way of warding off pests. All three theories, says Victor Albert, one of the study\u2019s authors, may prove to be correct to some degree, but having the detailed genome may help scientists arrive at more definitive answers.\n\nThe Washington Post, on the other hand, is concerned about a potential next step: genetically modified coffee. One use for that would be to create caffeine-free coffee beans, eliminating the need to extract caffeine for decaf brews. We might also find ways to boost the beverage\u2019s healthful properties, like antioxidants, and minimize its more harmful characteristics. Another use \u2014 which could also be accomplished through improved breeding practices \u2014 would be to cultivate disease and climate change-resistant beans. It\u2019s hard to deny, after all, that this valuable beverage crop is going to need all the help it can get.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breakthrough could help protect the beloved beverage from climate catastrophe", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Breakthrough could help protect the beloved beverage from climate catastrophe", "title": "Scientists have sequenced the coffee genome", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/04/scientists_have_sequenced_the_coffee_genome/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_129339416.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Breakthrough could help protect the beloved beverage from climate catastrophe", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_129339416.jpg", "title": "Scientists have sequenced the coffee genome", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Scientists have sequenced the coffee genome", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, caffeine, Climate Change, Coffee, genome, GMOs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6c5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: caffeine, Climate Change, Coffee, genome, GMOs, Innovation News, Sustainability News, NewsIn what might be the biggest news, for some, since scientists sequenced the human genome, an international team of scientists announced Thursday that it has sequenced the genome of the Coffea canephora \u2014 also known as robusta, the bean that supplies about a third of the world\u2019s coffee.\nAnd in high doses, it\u2019s toxic \u2014 a potential way of warding off pests.\nOne use for that would be to create caffeine-free coffee beans, eliminating the need to extract caffeine for decaf brews.\nThe Washington Post, on the other hand, is concerned about a potential next step: genetically modified coffee.\nAll three theories, says Victor Albert, one of the study\u2019s authors, may prove to be correct to some degree, but having the detailed genome may help scientists arrive at more definitive answers."}
