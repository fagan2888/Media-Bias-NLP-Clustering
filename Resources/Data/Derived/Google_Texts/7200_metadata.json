Some of the tactics mirror the harassment that doctors faced in the 1990s before becoming the victims of violent and even fatal crimes.\n\nThe National Clinic Violence Survey is the first comprehensive nationwide review of the atmosphere at women\u2019s health clinics since 2010. Nearly 250 abortion providers across the country responded to the questionnaire with information about how anti-abortion harassment affects their patients and staff.\n\n\u201cThe most stunning result in the survey, really, is this surge in serious threats that are being carried out against providers nationwide,\u201d duVergne Gaines, the director of the National Clinic Access Project and one of the authors of the report, told ThinkProgress. \u201cThose threats have almost doubled since 2010.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: Feminist Majority Foundation\n\nGaines is particularly concerned about the uptick in the distribution of Old West-style \u201cWanted\u201d flyers that include doctors\u2019 photos and personal information. They\u2019re typically labeled with dire messages like \u201cKillers Among Us,\u201d \u201cWanted For Killing,\u201d and \u201cStop This Abortionist Now,\u201d and activists often distribute the leaflets in the neighborhoods where abortion providers live. While about 19 percent of clinics said their staff members were being targeted with flyers in 2010, that number rose to about 28 percent in 2014.\n\n\u201cThey are very much like the flyers used to target physicians in the 90s when they were being shot and killed. They profile their photograph, their name, their place of business\u2019 address, and often their own private residence,\u201d Gaines said. She described the posters as \u201calmost like putting a target on their back.\u201d\n\nPicketing doctors\u2019 private residences is one of the explicit strategies detailed in Closed: 99 Ways To Stop Abortion, the unofficial handbook instructing activists on how to end legal abortion in the U.S. Extreme groups like Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust often show up at the private homes of abortion providers, chalking messages like \u201cyour neighbor is a monster\u201d on the sidewalk and using megaphones to chant \u201cthis doctor kills babies.\u201d Some doctors are forced to alter their routes home from work to attempt to hide where they live.\n\nThe internet has also given rise to new forms of cyberstalking. About 18 percent of clinics reported that their staff\u2019s personal information and photos has been posted online, up from about 9 percent in 2010. Some abortion providers have found aerial photos of their private homes published on the internet. Prominent right-wing websites like AbortionDocs.org compile doctors\u2019 information in searchable databases, allowing abortion opponents to browse through phone numbers and addresses.\n\n\u201cI think the average legislator, and certainly the average citizen, has no idea what is really happening to the abortion providers who care for women\u2019s comprehensive reproductive health. If they did, they would be truly horrified,\u201d Gaines said.\n\nConsidering the fact that choosing to provide abortion services can put doctors\u2019 personal safety at risk, reproductive rights activists argue that government officials have a responsibility to prevent them from becoming targets solely based on their line of work. In addition to tracking incidences of threats and harassment levels at abortion providers, the National Clinic Access Project also works with law enforcement to prosecute right-wing activists.\n\nWhen these types of cases make it to court, Gaines said that juries are often quick to crack down on extremists. She recounted a case brought by a North Carolina provider who testified about being stalked, encountering protests at his private OB-GYN practice and at his personal home, and being the subject of \u201cWanted\u201d flyers. Gaines said that when the jury realized what was happening, they were \u201cabsolutely appalled\u201d and moved to convict. But doctors don\u2019t always feel comfortable speaking out like that, and local criminal statutes often aren\u2019t broad enough to apply in these cases.\n\nAdvocates want to strengthen the legal tools in this area \u2014 they\u2019re looking ahead to a forthcoming Supreme Court case that will hopefully help clarify what constitutes a \u201ctrue threat\u201d under the First Amendment \u2014 but they also think making doctors feel safer needs to involve a broader culture change.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a zero tolerance policy for violence against abortion providers in this country. Regardless of how people think about a woman\u2019s right to choose, violence is never warranted, and people can\u2019t try to justify acts of violence and terrorism,\u201d Vicki Saporta, the president of the National Abortion Federation (NAF), which also tracks data on clinic violence, told ThinkProgress last year.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Serious threats against doctors who provide abortion have almost doubled since 2010.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Serious threats against doctors who provide abortion have almost doubled since 2010.", "title": "The Disturbing Levels Of Stalking And Intimidation Plaguing Abortion Doctors", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/01/28/3615999/abortion-clinic-violence-survey/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/colorado.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Serious threats against doctors who provide abortion have almost doubled since 2010.", "title": "The Disturbing Levels Of Stalking And Intimidation Plaguing Abortion Doctors", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/colorado-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/colorado.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/colorado.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-28T09:04:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health The Disturbing Levels Of Stalking And Intimidation Plaguing Abortion Doctors CREDIT: AP Photo/Jack Dempsey Pro-life and pro-choice supporters face off in front of the State Capitol in DenverOver the past several years, there have been increasing levels of threats and intimidation aimed at doctors who provide abortion services, according to a new survey of abortion clinic violence published by the Feminist Majority Foundation.\nThe National Clinic Violence Survey is the first comprehensive nationwide review of the atmosphere at women\u2019s health clinics since 2010.\nNearly 250 abortion providers across the country responded to the questionnaire with information about how anti-abortion harassment affects their patients and staff.\n\u201cThere needs to be a zero tolerance policy for violence against abortion providers in this country.\nIn addition to tracking incidences of threats and harassment levels at abortion providers, the National Clinic Access Project also works with law enforcement to prosecute right-wing activists."}
