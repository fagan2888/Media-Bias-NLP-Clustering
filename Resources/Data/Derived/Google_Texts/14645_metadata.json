Those loans could come back to haunt you in your retirement years.\n\nA look at new data from two reports suggests that many aging baby boomer parents are having trouble paying back federal student loans taken out to send their children or even grandchildren to college.\n\nAs a result, many adults age 50 and older who had the best intentions of taking on the college tuition burden for family members have jeopardized their retirement nest eggs. Add credit card debt and mortgage payments to the credit list and the unintended consequences could be severe.\n\nInstead of light work and leisure time, many older adults may be dealing with damaged credit ratings and lower monthly Social Security benefits checks as the government deducts an amount off the top to recoup some of the balance owed on federal PLUS loans to parents.\n\nIn some cases, the road may lead to personal bankruptcy, although keep in mind that student loan debt generally cannot be discharged in the courts.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear from the data, however, is that increasingly, student loan debt is not just a young person\u2019s problem.\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s latest report on household debt covering the second quarter of 2014, the number of Americans age 50 and older with outstanding student loans had almost tripled to 2 million since 2005.\n\nThe report also said the debt among older people is up substantially to $43 billion through the second quarter from $8 billion in 2005.\n\nThe debt, which is a small percentage of the more than $1 trillion in student loan debt outstanding, was either from long-ago loans taken out by people to finance their own educations or more recently to pay for college degrees for their children or grandchildren.\n\nWhat\u2019s the message for parents?\n\nIt\u2019s natural to want to shoulder some of the college debt load for your student. But don\u2019t put your retirement savings at risk either, experts say.\n\nCompared with college grads in their 20s and 30s, older borrowers have less time to pay back loans if they get behind.\n\nIt\u2019s like the flight attendant telling you to put your own oxygen mask on first before tending to the kids.\n\nBefore taking out a college loan, consider the \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios and have a plan in mind for how long you\u2019ll take to repay the debt. Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of the Edvisors.com higher education website, offered this formula: \u201cParents should borrow no more for all their children than they can afford to repay in 10 years, or by the time they retire, whichever comes first.\u201d\n\nSteve Rosen,\n\nThe Kansas City Star", "article_metadata": {"description": "New data suggests that baby boomers are struggling to pay back loans taken out to send their children or grandchildren to college.", "og": {"description": "New data suggests that baby boomers are struggling to pay back loans taken out to send their children or grandchildren to college.", "title": "Kids\u2019 college loans jeopardize parents\u2019 retirement", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141012-kids-college-loans-jeopardize-parents-retirement.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141012-capntag.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/capntag.jpg", "height": 503}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-10-13T03:21:28Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-10-13T03:01:51Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Kids\\u2019 college loans jeopardize parents\\u2019 retirement\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141012-kids-college-loans-jeopardize-parents-retirement.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141012-capntag.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/capntag.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1976199\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-13T03:01:51Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"From Wire Reports\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141012-capntag.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/capntag.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-10-13T03:01:51Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8959\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s clear from the data, however, is that increasingly, student loan debt is not just a young person\u2019s problem.\nA look at new data from two reports suggests that many aging baby boomer parents are having trouble paying back federal student loans taken out to send their children or even grandchildren to college.\nIn some cases, the road may lead to personal bankruptcy, although keep in mind that student loan debt generally cannot be discharged in the courts.\nIt\u2019s natural to want to shoulder some of the college debt load for your student.\nCompared with college grads in their 20s and 30s, older borrowers have less time to pay back loans if they get behind."}
