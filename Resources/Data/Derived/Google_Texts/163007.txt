Businessman Donald Trump says he’d beat President Obama “so easily” if Mr. Obama ran for a third term and predicted that the president “would get creamed” if he ran again.

“I think he would fail miserably if he ran again,” Mr. Trump, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, said on Fox News’ “On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.” “I would beat him so easily.”

While in Africa this week, Mr. Obama was talking about the two-term limit on U.S. presidents and said that while he can’t run again, he thinks he could win if he did run.

Mr. Trump disagreed.

“Obama would get creamed if he ran again,” Mr. Trump said. “I would love to run against him. I would love to run against him.”

Mr. Trump said 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney is a “nice man — but he failed.”

“Whether he choked, I don’t know — something happened,” Mr. Trump said. “In the last month, it was almost like he locked himself in a cabin, he didn’t do anything. And I give Obama credit — he was on ‘Jay Leno,’ he was on ‘David Letterman,’ he was on the different shows, and he was out there.”

“And I’m saying to Romney’s people, why aren’t you guys doing television. … Why aren’t you doing something?” he said.

Mr. Trump also said former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton would have a hard time getting the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.

“When you get rid of hard drives, when you get rid of all of the things she got rid of, all these thousands and thousands of emails,” he said. “Remember this: General [David] Petraeus — they destroyed his life for doing much less than she did.”
