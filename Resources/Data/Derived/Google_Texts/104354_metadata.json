I didn\u2019t want to put their lives under the spotlight.\u201d\n\nA magic potion will get terrorists to talk. \u201cWell, the average person might understand it as truth serum. But there are ways where you decrease a person\u2019s conscious defenses and they\u2019d be much more willing to give up information.\u201d\n\nSyrian refugees are like rabid dogs. \u201cIf there is a rabid dog running around your neighborhood, you\u2019re probably not going to assume something good about that dog, and you\u2019re probably gonna put your children out of the way,\u201d he said, explaining why the U.S. shouldn\u2019t allow Syrian refugees in. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean that you hate all dogs by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d\n\nWho needs a war crime? \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna have rules for war, you should just have a rule that says no war. Other than that, we have to win.\u201d\n\nNo Muslims in the Oval. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that if you accept all the tenets of Islam that you would have a very difficult time abiding under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nIf they only had some guns. \u201cI think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance? Slavery. \u201cObamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside. \u201cThere is no war on women,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be a war on what\u2019s inside of women, but there is no war on women in this country.\u201d\n\nBeing gay is a choice \u2026 \u201c[b]ecause a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight\u2014 and when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d (Carson later apologized)\n\nThanks for the memories!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's what we'll miss now that he's out of the race.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Here's what we'll miss now that he's out of the race.", "title": "Let's Remember Ben Carson's Greatest Hits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/carson-1132x6701.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-04T18:53:27-04:00", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/lets-remember-ben-carsons-greatest-hits/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "Here's what we'll miss now that he's out of the race.", "title": "Let's Remember Ben Carson's Greatest Hits - Blue Nation Review", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/carson-1132x6701.jpg"}, "creator": "@bluenationrev", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Conservatives", "tag": "2016,Ben Carson", "published_time": "2016-03-04T18:32:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-04T18:53:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Here are some of the greatest hits:He\u2019s no lightweight, he once pulled a knife on someone.\nNeurosurgeon Ben Carson has dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination for president.\n\u201cObamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201dIt\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna have rules for war, you should just have a rule that says no war.\n\u201cThere is no war on women,\u201d he said."}
