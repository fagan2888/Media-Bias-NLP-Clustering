Look a little like HealthCare.gov?\n\nIn just a few weeks, millions of people will be heading to the federal site HealthCare.gov to shop for medical insurance when a new open-enrollment period begins. If some of those people wind up by mistake at HealthCare.com instead, well, Jeff Smedsrud is fine with that.\n\nSmedsrud is chief executive of HealthCare.com, which holds a seemingly invaluable piece of Internet real estate these days. And he\u2019s looking to make the most of it.\n\nWith enrollment in the individual health insurance market re-opening Nov. 15, Smedsrud wants people to direct their browsers to HealthCare.com, where they can shop and compare health plans. HealthCare.com--which compares itself to the travel search site Kayak--is touting a choice of 93,000 plans from about 180 insurers across the country, with the opportunity for consumers to enroll online, over the phone or with a licensed agent or broker.\n\nIf that sounds a lot like the government\u2019s official portal for purchasing health care, that\u2019s pretty much the idea. And it doesn\u2019t look that different from HealthCare.gov. Stock photography of smiling people? Check. The promise to help someone find the right insurance plan for them? Yes.\n\nBut health care advocates say there is the potential for massive confusion among consumers trying to find the government\u2019s official site. Users who wind up there by mistake could miss out on subsidies that most would receive if they were shopping on HealthCare.gov. And like HealthCare.gov last year, the HealthCare.com site has some kinks that it\u2019s still working out, including inaccurate information.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s disastrous roll out of the HealthCare.gov site, the Obama administration is promising that this year\u2019s enrollment process will be much smoother for consumers, although officials also caution it won\u2019t be perfect.\n\nThere are new challenges this year: Some premiums are expected to increase or tax credits may shrink, potentially leaving current enrollees with higher monthly payments if they don\u2019t shop around for a new plan. Only 11 percent of the uninsured even know that an open enrollment period is approaching next month, according to a recent survey.\n\nAnd this coming enrollment period will be half as long as the last one but with the possibility of twice as many people trying to purchase coverage in the insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s HealthCare.com. Users have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the HealthCare.com homepage to find a tiny disclaimer saying it\u2019s a private Web site that is not run by the government.\n\nLynn Quincy, who oversees health policy for Consumers Union, worries that shoppers on the Web site won\u2019t realize the distinction between HealthCare.com and HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cIf they mistakenly believe this is the government Web site, they may feel this is the complete list of plans available to them,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is also no way for consumers using the site to confirm that it\u2019s indeed showing people all their options--or even offering accurate information.\n\nA recent search on HealthCare.com yielded a list of catastrophic insurance plans, which offer the lowest premiums but the lowest level of coverage, and showed they were eligible for subsidies. But the ACA specifically doesn\u2019t make subsidies available for catastrophic plans.\n\nSmedsrud said he believes some people will come to his site because they don\u2019t want to deal with the federal Web site.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t definitively say how big this is, but we get traffic because some people don\u2019t want to go dot gov,\u201d he said.\n\nYet the user experience on HealthCare.com isn\u2019t exactly smooth. When a shopper selects a plan on the site, the page takes the user to a third-party Web page--from an insurance broker, for instance--that then shows a selection of plans at difference prices. It\u2019s not obvious which one matches with the original plan selected on HealthCare.com.\n\n\u201cWe currently do not have the technology to just display the plan the person wanted,\u201d said company spokeswoman Colleen McGuire. That won\u2019t be available to shoppers for at least the upcoming enrollment period, she said.\n\nThe site is also currently showing 2014 health plans, but the company said it will update with 2015 health plans before the enrollment period begins.\n\nThe story of HealthCare.com goes back to 2006, when Smedsrud\u2019s business partner purchased the domain at auction for about $2.3 million. Before this year, the site had just offered a directory of care providers that grew to 1.2 million listings. Then the company brought on Smedsrud as chief executive earlier this year to transform it into an online clearinghouse for health plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a Kayak-like model,\u201d said Smedsrud, invoking the same comparison that the Obama administration made for HealthCare.gov last year, before its failed rollout.\n\nSmedsrud, previously the president of the American Independence Corp. insurance company, said his HealthCare.com has been averaging 1 million unique visitors each month over the past year, with traffic spiking to 1.5 million in March \u2014 the last full month of open enrollment in 2014 individual health plans. Those visitors, however, only would have seen the directory of care providers. For this coming enrollment season, starting Nov. 15, they\u2019ll see health plans, as well.\n\nThat adds a new revenue source for HealthCare.com which already received advertising dollars for its provider directory. It will now also be paid by insurers and brokers for providing leads to potential new customers.\n\nSmedsrud said he hasn\u2019t heard anything from the Obama administration about his Web site. \u201cWe welcome the dialogue with them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do what they want us to do, which is to help people get insurance.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency overseeing the federal enrollment Web site, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe company said it will include in its offerings health plans from the state- and federal-run insurance marketplaces, or exchanges. There\u2019s no obvious way, though, for consumers to tell which plans are offered by the public exchanges, which are the only ones that can offer financial assistance to people who meet the law\u2019s income requirements. \u201cWe are having discussions about adding a label to determine the difference, however, in the future,\u201d said McGuire in an email.\n\nAlmost 9 in 10 people who signed up for insurance through HealthCare.gov in the first enrollment period received a federal subsidy. Smedsrud said his company\u2019s Web site is adjusting the language to make sure shoppers understand they must go through the government\u2019s enrollment portal to receive financial assistance.\n\n\u201cIt is always clear to me that you can only get a subsidy from a state or federal exchange, and I think consumers understand it, but my team is a step ahead of me in making it a bit more clear on our site,\u201d he said.\n\nThat view may be overly optimistic, though. Just slightly more than half of the uninsured don\u2019t even know financial assistance is available to purchase insurance, let alone where to get it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll this week.\n\nSmedsrud said his Web site is offering at least one service to make it more attractive to customers. It will make recommendations to customers of what type of health plan to buy, based on information like income and how much care they expect to use.\n\nIt turns out to be easy for people to get the Web site address correct for the government\u2019s health care portal. Just ask former boy bander Lance Bass, who was asked by the White House earlier this year to spread the word about the enrollment Website. Bass, famous for being the bass singer of pop group \u2019N Sync, mistakenly advised hundreds of thousands of his Twitter followers to visit HealthCare.org.\n\nOf course, Smedsrud\u2019s company owns that domain, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care advocates say there is the potential for massive confusion among consumers trying to find the government\u2019s official site.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Health care advocates say there is the potential for massive confusion among consumers trying to find the government\u2019s official site.", "title": "You\u2019ve heard of HealthCare.gov.
