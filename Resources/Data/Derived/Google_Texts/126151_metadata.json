From there, he was an AP English teacher at Fountain-Fort Carson High School for four years. He said he loved teaching and being in the classroom, but he wanted to transition from being a \"leader of students\" to a \"leader of teachers.\"\n\n\"I could tell very, very quickly in this age of school accountability that teachers like me were kind of getting pressed out of the system a little bit,\" he said. \"The innovative approach that I wanted to take to get kids to the goal \u2014 that art of teaching was being replaced with the science of teaching, and I wanted to preserve teachers like me and be in a position where I could allow teachers to get there but in a different way \u2014 but with accountability.\"\n\nMost recently, Pavlicek was principal of a K-6 grade school in the San Luis Valley. He and his wife, Kim, have two sons who attend first and fifth grade this fall. In his spare time, he enjoys competitive sports, fantasy football and spending time with his family. He played football into college, and he played rugby for the U.S. Junior National team for a year.\n\nIn addition to acting as assistant principal, Sprenger also will be the school's athletic director. He spent the last 11 years in Colorado Springs \u2014 the first nine were spent teaching fourth and fifth grades, then he spent a year as a teacher coach, and most recently, he was a dean of students for 750 pupils.\n\nAs an administrator, Sprenger said he plans do his job through a teacher's lens, helping to take obstacles away so they can focus on teaching.\n\nHe and his wife Lisa, have four children, the oldest of whom will attend kindergarten and fourth grade at Harrison this fall. The younger children are three and one. Outside of school, he enjoys musicals, community events, spending quality time with his family and being involved in his family's church.\n\nPavlicek and Sprenger said it's important that they each \u2014 along with their families \u2014 relocate to Ca\u00f1on City and fully immerse their lives in the local community.\n\n\"We're 100 fully percent committed,\" Pavlicek said. \"We are excited for where this journey is going to go.\"\n\nCarie Canterbury: 719-276-7643, canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28612053/harrison-k-8-school-welcomes-new-leadership", "modificationDate": "2015-08-10T10:45:34-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0809/20150809__19DRHARISONSCHOOLw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "John Pavlicek and Brian Sprenger both graduated from Colorado Springs' Doherty High School in 1999, but they really didn't know one another very well until they were hired as Harrison K-8 School's new administrative team.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:28612053:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-09T20:17:04-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28612053/harrison-k-8-school-welcomes-new-leadership", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0809/20150809__19DRHARISONSCHOOLw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "John Pavlicek and Brian Sprenger both graduated from Colorado Springs' Doherty High School in 1999, but they really didn't know one another very well until they were hired as Harrison K-8 School's new administrative team.", "title": "Harrison K-8 School welcomes new leadership"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "John Pavlicek and Brian Sprenger both graduated from Colorado Springs' Doherty High School in 1999, but they really didn't know one another very well until they were hired as Harrison K-8 School's new administrative team.", "title": "Harrison K-8 School welcomes new leadership", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28612053/harrison-k-8-school-welcomes-new-leadership", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0809/20150809__19DRHARISONSCHOOLw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-09T20:17:04-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-08-09T17:34:46-0600", "sailthru.title": "Harrison K-8 School welcomes new leadership", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Carie CanterburyThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0809/20150809__19DRHARISONSCHOOLw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-08-09T20:18:43-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4391\"", "article_summary": "\"We want to continue to move Harrison School forward and make it the best school it can be,\" said Pavlicek, the school's new principal.\nIn addition to acting as assistant principal, Sprenger also will be the school's athletic director.\nMost recently, Pavlicek was principal of a K-6 grade school in the San Luis Valley.\nSprenger said the school plans to embrace the community by welcoming parents, mentors, business owners and interested residents to actively be involved in student success.\nNew principal, assistant principal join schoolJohn Pavlicek and Brian Sprenger both graduated from Colorado Springs' Doherty High School in 1999, but they really didn't know one another very well until they were hired as Harrison K-8 School's new administrative team."}
