April 15 is the new dead­line to fin­ish Obama­care health in­sur­ance ap­plic­a­tions, ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials an­nounced Thursday.

“For those in line on the 31st, we en­cour­age con­sumers to fin­ish the pro­cess as soon as pos­sible,” Alicia Hartinger, spokes­wo­man at the Cen­ters for Medi­care and Medi­caid Ser­vices, said in an email. “They must com­plete their en­roll­ment by no later than the 15th for cov­er­age this year.”

The ex­ten­ded sign-up time frame has made in­sur­ance com­pan­ies nervous, as they fear a loose dead­line will al­low more cus­tom­ers to wait un­til their health ex­penses are high­er.

But the ad­min­is­tra­tion gran­ted some con­sumers more time to sign up for cov­er­age due to high traffic on Health­Care.gov dur­ing the days lead­ing up to the broad­er March 31 dead­line. Some were put in a queue or asked to come back later when there were few­er people try­ing to get their ap­plic­a­tions through the sys­tem. The fed­er­al on­line ex­change fielded more than 3 mil­lion vis­its on March 31.

Some people will qual­i­fy for ex­tra time to en­roll bey­ond the April 15 cut-off. Ac­cord­ing to guid­ance pos­ted on Health­Care.gov, people who con­tin­ue to have trouble with their ap­plic­a­tions qual­i­fy for a “spe­cial en­roll­ment peri­od” that could al­low them up to 60 days to sign up after the event.

And qual­i­fy­ing life events — such as los­ing a job, get­ting mar­ried, or hav­ing a baby — al­low Amer­ic­ans to sign up for health in­sur­ance out­side of the open en­roll­ment peri­od. Low-in­come and dis­abled per­sons who qual­i­fy for Medi­caid can also en­roll at any time.
