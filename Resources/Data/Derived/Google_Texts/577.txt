Iconic musician Bob Dylan recently opened up to AARP Magazine in a wide-ranging interview about his new album of Frank Sinatra covers and has now revealed he will give away the record for free to thousands of seniors.

Wondering Sound is now reporting that 50,000 of AARP’s subscribers will be chosen at random to receive a free copy of Shadows in the Night, which is composed entirely of Sinatra renditions.

In his first interview in three years, Dylan told AARP about the album, which will be released next month. “People talk about Frank all the time,” Dylan said. “He has this ability to get inside of the song in a sort of a conversational way. Frank sang to you – not at you. I never wanted to be a singer that sings at somebody. I’ve always wanted to sing to somebody.”

Dylan was asked by the seniors’ publication if he thought the album was “risky,” because some fans will say it will fail to match up to Sinatra, to which he replied:

Risky? Like walking across a field laced with land mines? Or working in a poison gas factory? There’s nothing risky about making records. Comparing me with Frank Sinatra? You must be joking. To be mentioned in the same breath as him must be some sort of high compliment. As far as touching him goes, nobody touches him. Not me or anyone else.

“Shadows in the Night” will officially be released on Feb. 3.
