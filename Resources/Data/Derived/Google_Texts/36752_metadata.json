He gets a bad rap because he sometimes disagrees with [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. But that\u2019s what friends do. Friends are honest and are going to disagree.\u201d\n\nAt the synagogue, Obama \u201cforcefully\u201d objected to criticism that his disagreements with Netanyahu shows a lack of support for Israel. Echoing those words, American Jews who watched the president speak insisted in interviews with The Daily Signal that defending Jews means criticizing Israel when necessary.\n\n\u201cIt was a very positive and reassuring address,\u201d said Howard Marks, as he clutched two bags of challah bread. \u201cThis president has helped Israel\u2019s security more than any other. The poor relationship he has with Netanyahu has hurt Obama\u2019s image. But there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around on both sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, allies disagree,\u201d Marks added. \u201cJust like we disagree with the French, and the British. Even within families, people disagree. At the end of the day, the alliance is strong and we have shared values that strongly bind us.\u201d\n\nThe American Jewish attendees felt that Obama didn\u2019t use the speech to convince them to back his Middle East policies\u2014though all who spoke with The Daily Signal support the president\u2019s push for a nuclear deal with Iran and for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nRather, they believe the president tried to strike a personal, emotional connection with his Jewish listeners.\n\n\u201cIt is precisely because I care so deeply about the state of Israel,\u201d Obama said, \u201cthat I feel a responsibility to speak out honestly about what I think would lead to long-term security and to the preservation of a true democracy in the Jewish homeland, and I believe that\u2019s two states for two peoples, Israel and Palestine living side-by-side peacefully.\u201d\n\nMiller, a lifelong Adas Israel congregant, agrees.\n\n\u201cFor Israel to thrive as a democracy, it has to be a two-state solution,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard. This is a dangerous neighborhood we are walking into.\u201d\n\nPatricia Levy, another attendee of the speech, cares \u201cdeeply\u201d about Israel and the Jewish community.\n\nShe has family, including a brother, who live in Israel, and when they talk, they rarely speak about the politics of Obama and Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cThe image of Israel is getting so torn apart in the world\u2019s view and it\u2019s upsetting,\u201d Levy said. \u201cBut [Obama] understands that fundamentally we are a good people. He knows that Jews value all human life and that we have Israel\u2019s back when it comes to their existence.\u201d\n\nLike the others, Levy believes there\u2019s room for disagreement in the U.S.-Israeli alliance. For instance, she believes that Israel should back off its settlement building in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky, delicate issue,\u201d Levy said. \u201cI feel that too many people say that because he [Obama] disagrees with Netanyahu, he is not a friend of Israel. I don\u2019t go that far. I think Netanyahu sometimes has been a bit of a d***. There\u2019s no clear solution.\u201d\n\nNowhere is that unclarity more true than over the best way to handle Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\nFor American Jews, hanging above the optimism surrounding Obama\u2019s commitment to them is a persistent worry regarding the unresolved Iran deal.\n\nObama sought to allay the anxiety.\n\n\u201cI will not accept a bad deal,\u201d Obama said. \u201c[Because] this deal will have my name on it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Marks acknowledged he\u2019s \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the possibility of Iran getting a nuclear weapon under the deal, though he\u2019s encouraged that Congress will have the authority to hold off on removing some sanctions.\n\nSamara Langsam, a student at Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Md., who attended Obama\u2019s speech with her grandmother, realizes that the result of the Iran nuclear deal will be especially relevant for her generation.\n\n\u201cDiplomacy needs to be tried before war,\u201d Langsam said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that Congress had a chance to debate it. A policy this important needs to be debated by many and not decided by one person.\u201d\n\nLevy, who wears a Star of David necklace, doubts she can trust Iran\u2019s anti-semitic regime.\n\nHer worries are especially profound considering the resurgence of anti-semitism in Europe.\n\nBut she trusts Obama and believes that if there were any other way, he would pursue it.\n\n\u201cIn theory, diplomacy is the right track,\u201d Levy said. \u201cMaybe he is being naive and idealistic. But I don\u2019t think anyone can do better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After President Obama spoke before an audience at a U.S. synagogue, American Jews who attended the speech defended the president's support to Israel.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After President Obama spoke before an audience at a U.S. synagogue, American Jews who attended the speech defended the president's support to Israel.", "title": "American Jews Defend Obama\u2019s Support to Israel", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ObamaJews.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PByRQa"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After President Obama spoke before an audience at a U.S. synagogue, American Jews who attended the speech defended the president's support to Israel.", "title": "American Jews Defend Obama\u2019s Support to Israel", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ObamaJews.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-05-22T16:16:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "President Obama, Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, two-state solution, Adas Israel, Palestinian, Iran, nuclear deal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1e2\"", "article_summary": "Echoing those words, American Jews who watched the president speak insisted in interviews with The Daily Signal that defending Jews means criticizing Israel when necessary.\nIn a step to reassure American Jews that he supports Israel, President Obama today became the fourth president to speak before an audience at a U.S. synagogue.\nFor American Jews, hanging above the optimism surrounding Obama\u2019s commitment to them is a persistent worry regarding the unresolved Iran deal.\nAfter the remarks, in which he called himself \u201can honorary member of the [Jewish] tribe,\u201d a crowdful of American Jews asserted they were happy to have him.\n\u201cI will not accept a bad deal,\u201d Obama said."}
