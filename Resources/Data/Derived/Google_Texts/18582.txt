Police have made an arrest in connection to the murder of a Wichita mother last week.

Capt. Doug Nolte said officers arrested a 26-year-old man for the murder of Ciera Ray. Her body was found last Thursday in her home in the 2400 block of North Green, near 21st and Grove.

Police said Ray's boyfriend returned from a business trip and found her dead. Her three-year-old daughter was inside the home.

Police said Ray had multiple injuries.

The suspect has been booked into the Sedgwick County Jail for first-degree murder. Police sources identified the suspect as 26-year-old Marvin Lee Gray, Jr.

Candice Ray is Ciera Ray's sister. She says Ciera recently reunited as friends with Gray. The two had known each other since they were kids.

"It never crossed my mind that he would do anything like that," said Ray. "He seemed like an alright guy."

Gray was previously convicted of aggravated battery and criminal damage to property in 2010.

The case will be presented to the district attorneyâ€™s office sometime early next week.

This is Wichita's 13th homicide of 2015.
