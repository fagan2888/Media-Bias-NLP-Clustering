Trapped behind the two trucks, you nurse some salty responses to that bumper-sticker query. You wonder if anyone has actually lodged a complaint against this driver at the Web address shown, or by calling the 800-number below it.\n\n\u201cDriver and fleet monitoring programs are designed to increase safety on our roadways by providing company owners and/or corporate fleet managers with an ongoing flow of feedback from the driving public,\u201d according the website of Fleetwatch Systems Inc., which runs the 1800HowsMyDriving.com program. \u201cAwareness of such feedback has been proven to be the single most influential factor when it comes to altering driver behavior, leading to drastic improvements in not only safe, but efficient driving.\u201d\n\nHow\u2019s My Care?\n\nHospitals have their own version of that feedback pipeline: HCAHPS \u2014 Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems. While an important indicator of institutional quality, with real financial ramifications, this structured survey has several drawbacks, notes Jared Hawkins, National Library of Medicine research fellow in biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nFor one thing, although it\u2019s given to all patients, HCAHPS has a relatively low response rate. This casts a shadow of selection bias on its scoring. What\u2019s more, months may pass before the findings are reported. Anyone looking for up-to-the-minute patient opinion about a hospital\u2019s quality has only stale data from which to work.\n\nBut there\u2019s another increasingly important, useful and much more timely gauge of hospital quality available in the tool box: social media.\n\nAlthough still scanty, research suggests that social media sentiment can provide valuable insights into comparative hospital performance. A study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine last October, for example, found that a sample of 315 U.S. hospitals with unplanned 30-day readmission rates lower than the national average (that\u2019s good) received better rankings from Facebook users on a five-star scale than 364 similar hospitals with higher-than-average readmission rates (that\u2019s bad). For every additional star a hospital was assigned by its Facebook raters, the hospital\u2019s odds of being in the low-readmission category rose by a factor of five.\n\nTweet, Tweet\n\nSome three-quarters of all adult Internet users now log on to one or more social media sites, according to the Pew Research Center. More than half read or post to Facebook, about a quarter to Twitter. As of last year, reported Hawkins and Boston Children\u2019s colleagues in a study published last October in BMJ Quality & Safety, \u201croughly half\u201d of all U.S. hospitals had opened a Twitter account.\n\n\u201cPatients routinely use Twitter to share feedback about their experience receiving healthcare,\u201d Hawkins and his team at Boston Children\u2019s observed. \u201cIdentifying and analyzing the content of posts sent to hospitals may provide a novel real-time measure of quality, supplementing traditional, survey-based approaches.\u201d See January's H&HN for more about Twitter as a patient satisfaction tool, and about other similar applications.\n\nProblem: Twitter posts worldwide (tweets) proliferate at a pace of 6,000 per second. That\u2019s more than 500 million per day. So, the first job was to figure out which U.S. hospitals were using Twitter \u2014 2,349 of them, it turned out, from among the 4,679 hospitals reporting 2012\u20132013 HCAHPS data. (The list of tweeting hospitals was compiled through a form of \u201cartificial\u201d artificial intelligence, Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk. It\u2019s an online crowd-sourced service that parts out myriad small tasks to freelance pieceworkers who earn pennies per task completed, to accomplish a large-scale job economically in jig time.)\n\nThen, every tweet concerning any of these hospitals during the one-year period ending Sept. 30, 2013, had to be plucked out of the massive flow. For this, the researchers used a network processing platform called DataSift, which identified a total of 404,065 applicable original tweets. But how many of those actually dealt with a personal hospital \u201cexperience\u201d?\n\nThis is where \u201creal\u201d AI came in. First, the researchers defined the concerns that could be considered experiential quality issues. They chose as parameters interactions with staff; treatment effectiveness; food, cleanliness, parking and money; errors; timing; and access to treatment. Then, to distinguish the salient tweets from more general chatter (like wishing a patient well, fundraising or PR), they brought to bear two AI hallmarks: machine learning and natural language processing.\n\nHuman curators compiled a library of terms by which a software program called TextBlob could be trained to read tweets and pick out those that dealt with patient experience. But the program also had to be taught to understand the adjectives, verbs and phrases that express a sentiment, and whether it\u2019s positive or negative. In other words, was the hospital being praised in the tweet or being panned?\n\nWhen Hawkins and the Boston Children\u2019s team had checked and validated the reliability of the automated readings, they found that about 9 percent of those 400,000-odd tweets \u2014 34,725 \u2014 were related to food, money, pain, room condition, wait time, communication with staff, discharge, medication instructions, side effects or general satisfaction. On average, kudos outweighed complaints. Again, Twitter sentiment aligned with 30-day readmission rates, although the correlation was weak. Still, favorable tweets tended to outnumber dings for hospitals with better clinical records.\n\nGet a Handle\n\n\u201cPeople think social media is more negative than positive,\u201d says Hawkins, \u201cbut that\u2019s not true. In general, there\u2019s a trend to the positive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although HCAHPS scores provide valuable feedback, Twitter and Facebook are also pretty good sources when it comes to hospital performance.", "csrf-token": "M7DH3PXZ7QNy8SACkcOfcr8DJPtxcpNS4JhXNJdcAQc=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/w/Weber_190x127.jpg?1461771668", "description": "Although HCAHPS scores provide valuable feedback, Twitter and Facebook are also pretty good sources when it comes to hospital performance.", "card": "summary", "title": "Social Media: A Nimble Way to Gauge Hospital Quality"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/w/Weber_190x127.jpg?1461771668", "type": "Article", "description": "Although HCAHPS scores provide valuable feedback, Twitter and Facebook are also pretty good sources when it comes to hospital performance.", "title": "Social Media: A Nimble Way to Gauge Hospital Quality"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "health care,hospitals,quality of care,social media, twitter", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But there\u2019s another increasingly important, useful and much more timely gauge of hospital quality available in the tool box: social media.\nAnyone looking for up-to-the-minute patient opinion about a hospital\u2019s quality has only stale data from which to work.\nGet a Handle\u201cPeople think social media is more negative than positive,\u201d says Hawkins, \u201cbut that\u2019s not true.\nAlthough still scanty, research suggests that social media sentiment can provide valuable insights into comparative hospital performance.\nHospitals have their own version of that feedback pipeline: HCAHPS \u2014 Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems."}
