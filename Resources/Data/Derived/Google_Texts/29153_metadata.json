Admit it, you neo-cons, paleo-cons, compassionates, country clubbers and decline-to-states: right now, in a just, moral, ordered universe, Mitt Romney should be President.\n\nHe was right on Iraq and Benghazi, right on healthcare, immigration, and Russia. But he was so mendaciously smeared that voters possessed the ludicrous mindset that Mitt didn\u2019t \u201ccare about someone like me.\u201d Feckless Republican operatives allowed data-mining splashed with voter fraud to seal the defeat.\n\nTwenty months later, numerous polls indicate significant voter remorse. This genuine sentiment has naturally provoked calls of \u201cRun, Mitt, Run!\u201d But, to other Republicans still traumatized by a loss that didn\u2019t have to happen, the grace and decency of the man are his ultimate disqualifiers for a coming 2016 cage match.\n\nThe positive argument for another run is, like the man, straightforward:\n\nThis is America \u2014 Everyone is supposed to have a Second Act.\n\nHe\u2019s unquestionably qualified \u2014 In addition to having been right, Mitt continues to display leadership and an articulate grasp of the current worrisome events.\n\nHe\u2019s popular \u2014 The polls say he can win.\n\nRedemption \u2014 His victory would deliver fairness and closure while rinsing away the acrid taste of unnecessary defeat.\n\nBut the naysayers also have excellent arguments:\n\nAs Mitt is the first to point out, he\u2019s already lost twice. America draws a paper-thin line between \u201cdetermined\u201d and \u201closer\u201d \u2014 the difference between a Ronald Reagan and a Harold Stassen.\n\nFor Mitt to run now, after categorically stating that he wouldn\u2019t, undermines one of his most attractive attributes \u2014 that of the congenitally honest straight-shooter.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the unfortunate CV item from Massachusetts: Just as the Apollo 13 capsule used the moon\u2019s gravity to slingshot back to earth, Republicans need \u201cObamacare\u201d to be the explosive negative force to hurtle \u2014 if not vomit \u2014 their candidates to victory. Easily revived, the false but effective comparison to \u201cRomneycare\u201d is an unnecessary and dangerous asteroid belt to yet again pass through.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s his religion and the problem some voters have historically had with it. Even though Mitt is currently polling remarkably well among those groups believed to have sat on their hands in 2012, the reticence to vote for a Mormon really can\u2019t be re-quantified until the votes are in \u2014 when it\u2019s too late.\n\nWhen presented as a binary yes/no choice, the Republican Party has an insoluble problem. Announcement of a third Romney campaign \u2014 or not \u2014 is guaranteed to disappoint approximately half the true believers, thus undermining the general election.\n\nFortunately, there\u2019s still a legitimate, credible finesse that can break the binary conundrum. With two strokes of the pen, the next President (who is not Mitt) can restore justice and deliver a modicum of vindication to both the Governor and his supporters without the angst of another political showdown. For the sake of both the Party and their own campaign, all potential Republican presidential candidates should affirm that, upon victory, their first cabinet decision will be to ask Mitt Romney to simultaneously head both the Treasury and HHS Departments.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s always tempting \u2014 and unrealistic \u2014 to play fantasy politics imagining one\u2019s own Dream Team sitting around the cabinet table counseling the President. Six years ago, some prominent thinkers declared that the new administration\u2019s cabinet would become, like the intellectually confident Abraham Lincoln\u2019s choices, another \u201cteam of rivals.\u201d That painfully unaware projection has long ago been dumped into the ash heap of historical speculation.\n\nThis \u201cSuper-Secretary\u201d dual portfolio is no such fantasy. And neither would it be a \u201cco-presidency\u201d as Gerald Ford\u2019s people cheekily envisioned for Ronald Reagan at the 1980 convention. Instead, the SuperSec assignment would allow Mitt to do what he knows and does best, arguably better than anyone on the planet: manage turnaround.\n\nMitt needs to turn around Obamacare into a market-based, consumer-friendly transparent system that takes care of the needy. He needs to turn around an economy whose disastrous previous eight years will only be understood in depth after today\u2019s liars leave office. To use the currently fashionable but bloodless phrasing, these are \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d challenges.\n\nAs SuperSec, his method would be the polar opposite of this president\u2019s claque of un-vetted, opaque, politicized \u201cczars.\u201d Rather, Mitt would approach the task using the rough-and-tumble of a public stock corporation, with goals, metrics, accountability, and communication. Can anyone doubt that at least some of his success at reincarnating the \u201902 Winter Olympics was simply the change of management culture from the corrupt international sports bureaucracy to an American can-do MBA-ism?\n\nIn 2015, the center-right voter base needs to go to the polls knowing that, no matter what firebrand is at the top of the ticket, they\u2019ll be getting best-in-class leadership on the critical domestic economic issues.\n\nWill Mitt accept? He seems to enjoy his current balance of work and family. But, he\u2019s a patriot. His ego is in check, atypical for a politician. He understands the urgency, and he\u2019s man enough to report without rancor to his \u201cboss,\u201d the President.\n\nThe offer would not be a \u201cdo-over of 2012.\u201d Rather, it would be an instruction to \u201cdo it like it\u2019s never been done before.\u201d If an enlightened, unthreatened President makes the offer, Mitt will be our first SuperSec. He won\u2019t have a choice.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f97\"", "article_summary": "He\u2019s unquestionably qualified \u2014 In addition to having been right, Mitt continues to display leadership and an articulate grasp of the current worrisome events.\nAdmit it, you neo-cons, paleo-cons, compassionates, country clubbers and decline-to-states: right now, in a just, moral, ordered universe, Mitt Romney should be President.\nThis genuine sentiment has naturally provoked calls of \u201cRun, Mitt, Run!\u201d But, to other Republicans still traumatized by a loss that didn\u2019t have to happen, the grace and decency of the man are his ultimate disqualifiers for a coming 2016 cage match.\nFor Mitt to run now, after categorically stating that he wouldn\u2019t, undermines one of his most attractive attributes \u2014 that of the congenitally honest straight-shooter.\nBut the naysayers also have excellent arguments:As Mitt is the first to point out, he\u2019s already lost twice."}
