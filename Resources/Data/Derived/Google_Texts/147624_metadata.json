I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nWhen new Officer Ashley Botello strode across the stage to get her diploma, her fianc\u00e9 Dat Truong shouted, \u201cWe love you, Ashley!\u201d\n\nBotello said she became a cop because she always wanted to serve the community where she grew up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited, but there also are just a little bit of nerves about going out on the streets,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore the new officers were issued diplomas and took their oaths, they were reminded of the seriousness and importance of their jobs.\n\nDenver Mayor Michael Hancock told the class they had been given something sacred \u2014 the public\u2019s trust.\n\n\u201cRemind yourself every day of the trust people have placed in you,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cThat badge means something to every one of us.\u201d\n\nChief Robert White used his speech to instill his policing philosophy.\n\n\u201cThe number one priority of a Denver police officer is to focus on the prevention of crime,\u201d White said. \u201cYou will learn if the community knows you and trusts you, they will become your greatest asset in preventing crime.\u201d\n\nThe new officers are needed in a department that has been stretched thin during the recession. It is just the third class in five years, so police commanders have been eager to bolster the ranks.\n\nIn 2008, the department had 1,540 officers; this year, it has about 1,326, according to a Denver auditor\u2019s report released earlier this month. The fewer officers led to longer response times, the auditor said.\n\nIn 2013, Denver voters passed a tax increase that would, in part, fund more officers.\n\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Noelle_Phillips", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "New Denver police officers excited to wear the badge", "title": "New Denver police officers excited to wear the badge", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/27/new-denver-police-officers-excited-to-wear-the-badge/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__new-denver-police-officers-sworn-inp1-1.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__new-denver-police-officers-sworn-inp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-27T12:44:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:45:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe number one priority of a Denver police officer is to focus on the prevention of crime,\u201d White said.\nAfter weeks of grueling training, 43 new Denver police officers are ready to patrol the city\u2019s streets.\nIn 2008, the department had 1,540 officers; this year, it has about 1,326, according to a Denver auditor\u2019s report released earlier this month.\nIn 2013, Denver voters passed a tax increase that would, in part, fund more officers.\nAs the son of a Denver police officer, Abeyta said he had wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps for \u201cas long as I can remember."}
