He evidently determined, though, that coming up with a list was necessary to prove that he, who ran as not one of them, is, indeed, one of them.\n\nIn one of the few campaign promises that he's kept \u2014 maybe the only one \u2014 Trump released the list after assuring the conservative faction of his wing that they'd be pleased with whomever he nominates.\n\nThe list, overall, is to the right of conservative.\n\nIt includes justices largely aligned with Trump's anti-Obamacare, anti-abortion and pro-Twitter views. The group includes men who don't seem to think much of women's contraception or the consequences of that. One of them called the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision \"a constitutional right to murder an unborn child.\u201d\n\nHere is the list, according to the Associated Press:\n\nSteven Colloton of Iowa \u2014 Colloton, a U.S. Circuit Court Judge certainly shares Trump\u2019s disdain for the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s ruled that Obamacare needs to do more to accommodate religious groups that don\u2019t want to provide contraceptive to their female employees.\n\n\u2014 Colloton, a U.S. Circuit Court Judge certainly shares Trump\u2019s disdain for the Affordable Care Act.

Allison Eid of Colorado \u2014 While she was appointed by a Democratic governor, Eid has leaned right as a justice on the Colorado state Supreme Court. She was once the lone dissenting voice on a ruling to freeze property taxes (instead of lowering them) to keep schools funded.\n\n\u2014 While she was appointed by a Democratic governor, Eid has leaned right as a justice on the Colorado state Supreme Court.

Raymond Gruender of Missouri \u2014 As a U.S. Circuit Court Judge, Gruender led a ruling that female employees do not have the right to insurance coverage for birth control, a decision that has been cited in the ongoing fight for contraceptives under Obamacare.\n\n\u2014 As a U.S. Circuit Court Judge, Gruender led a ruling that female employees do not have the right to insurance coverage for birth control, a decision that has been cited in the ongoing fight for contraceptives under Obamacare. Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania \u2014 Hardiman, a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, once held that a jail\u2019s policy of strip searching arrestees (no matter the offense) does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\u2014 Hardiman, a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, once held that a jail\u2019s policy of strip searching arrestees (no matter the offense) does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Raymond Kethledge of Michigan \u2014 It took almost two years to confirm Kethledge after being nominated to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Kethledge was originally nominated June 26 by George W. Bush, but the nomination lapsed when Congress adjourned its session. When he was nominated in March of 2007, two Michigan senators blocked his confirmation until June 24, 2008.\n\n\u2014 It took almost two years to confirm Kethledge after being nominated to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals.

Joan Larsen of Michigan \u2014 Larsen was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court in October of 2015 by Gov. Rick Snyder. She was once a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who held the vacant seat in the Supreme Court before his death.\n\n\u2014 Larsen was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court in October of 2015 by Gov.

Thomas Lee of Utah \u2014 As a member of Utah\u2019s Supreme Court, Lee has largely remained out of the spotlight. He offered a concurring opinion on a wrongful death case that an unborn fetus is a \u201cminor child.\u201d\n\n\u2014 As a member of Utah\u2019s Supreme Court, Lee has largely remained out of the spotlight.

Diane Sykes of Wisconsin \u2014 Trump has also name-dropped Sykes as a potential nominee. As a federal appeals judge, she was part of a ruling that the state of Indiana could not fully defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u2014 Trump has also name-dropped Sykes as a potential nominee.

The former George W. Bush staffer and current Justice on the Supreme Court of Texas has even used the 140-character platform to poke fun at Trump during this election.\n\nPresident Obama in March nominated Merrick Garland, a centrist whose selection was seen as an attempt at compromise with the Republican-controlled congress, to replace the late Antonin Scalia.\n\nWhile Garland has met with several members of the Senate \u2014 including some Republicans \u2014 a formal hearing and confirmation vote still seems unlikely. GOP leaders have voiced their opposition to confirming a new justice until the presidential race is over. Scalia's replacement could ideologically tilt the court, which is currently split 4-4 down party lines.\n\nBrendan Krisel contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Across America, US Patch", "description": "Trump has named who he would consider to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.", "title": "Donald Trump Releases List of 11 Hypothetical Supreme Court Justices", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/22859473/2016/05/T800x600/201605573cb205cb69c.jpg", "url": "http://patch.com/us/across-america/donald-trump-releases-list-11-possible-supreme-court-justices-0", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Politics & Government", "published_time": "2016-05-18T14:18:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-18T16:00:15-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Across America, US - Trump has named who he would consider to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Stras, an associate justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court, once clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\nShe was once a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who held the vacant seat in the Supreme Court before his death.\nHypothetical President Donald Trump on Wednesday released a list of hypothetical nominees to build a new hypothetical U.S. Supreme Court should he win a hypothetical matchup with hypothetical Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nBefore his appointment to the Minnesota Supreme Court, Stras was a faculty member at the University of Minnesota Law School.\nJoan Larsen of Michigan \u2014 Larsen was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court in October of 2015 by Gov."}
