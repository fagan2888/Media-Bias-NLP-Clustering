Officials are also facing calls to reform their snooping programs after a government-commissioned independent report concluded the existing oversight system was inadequate.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat all of these things with a pinch of salt,\u201d Conservative Party Member of Parliament David Davis told The Guardian about the Times story. \u201cYou can see they have been made nervous by [the oversight report]. We have not been given any facts, just assertions.\u201d\n\nDavis is one of two UK lawmakers who filed a lawsuit against the British government over a recent surveillance law that requires Internet companies to retain and decrypt user data at the government\u2019s request.\n\nGlenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who initially met with Snowden, published a response to the Times report, calling it as \u201cshoddy and unreliable as it gets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse, its key accusation depends on retraction-level lies,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Times story states: \u201cIt is not clear whether Russia and China stole Snowden\u2019s data, or whether he voluntarily handed over his secret documents in order to remain at liberty in Hong Kong and Moscow.\u201d\n\nSnowden initially went to Hong Kong to discuss his stolen intelligence files with journalists.\n\nGreenwald pointed out that Snowden \u201chas said unequivocally\u201d that he handed all his files over to journalists during those meetings, taking nothing with him to Moscow, where he now resides in exile.\n\nAlready, the Times has removed from the online edition a line about Greenwald\u2019s partner, David Miranda, being detained in late 2013 at Heathrow Airport in London after visiting Snowden in Moscow.\n\n\u201cDavid did not visit Snowden in Moscow before being detained,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cAs of the time he was detained in Heathrow, David had never been to Moscow and had never met Snowden.\u201d\n\nThe files Snowden leaked to journalists in 2013 set off two years of heated discussion in Washington over privacy, civil liberties and surveillance powers.\n\nCongress recently passed its first surveillance reform law, known as the USA Freedom Act, reining in some of the spying programs exposed by the Snowden documents.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The UK government is under pressure to explain a report that hackers cracked intel files.", "description": "The UK government is under pressure to explain a report that hackers cracked intel files.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The UK government is under pressure to explain a report that hackers cracked intel files.", "title": "Did Russia, China hack Snowden files?", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/244986-did-russian-and-chinese-spies-hack-snowden-files", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/snowdenedward_031014getty3.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/244986-did-russian-and-chinese-spies-hack-snowden-files", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-15T11:51-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-15T11:51:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/244986-did-russian-and-chinese-spies-hack-snowden-files", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The UK government is under pressure to explain a report that hackers cracked intel files.", "card": "summary", "title": "Did Russia, China hack Snowden files?"}, "dcterms.title": "Did Russia, China hack Snowden files?"}, "article_summary": "The British government is under pressure to explain a controversial report over the weekend that claimed Russian and Chinese hackers had cracked a secret cache of intelligence files held by government leaker Edward Snowden.\n\u201cDavid did not visit Snowden in Moscow before being detained,\u201d Greenwald said.\nCongress recently passed its first surveillance reform law, known as the USA Freedom Act, reining in some of the spying programs exposed by the Snowden documents.\nGreenwald pointed out that Snowden \u201chas said unequivocally\u201d that he handed all his files over to journalists during those meetings, taking nothing with him to Moscow, where he now resides in exile.\nSome have even suggested the article is a government plant to build support for an upcoming surveillance bill."}
