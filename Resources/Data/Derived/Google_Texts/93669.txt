The numbers are similar to the president’s approval rating, as reported in the survey. Fifty-one percent of Americans disapprove of Obama’s job performance, while 42 percent approve. More people disapprove than approve of Obama’s handling of the economy, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, international affairs and immigration issues.

A majority of registered voters — 54 percent — say their feelings for Obama will not be a factor in their vote in the upcoming November midterm elections. Twenty-seven percent say their vote will express opposition to the president, while 19 percent say it will express support.

The survey was conducted Sept. 4-7 with 1,001 adults on landlines and cellphones. The margin for error is plus or minus 3.5 points.
