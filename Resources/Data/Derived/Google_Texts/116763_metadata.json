She was under the impression that it was a safe, quiet place, but the burglaries caused her to keep her grandchildren from playing outside.\n\n\n\nDebra Darby, who lives in the neighborhood, said she\u2019s relieved to know that someone\u2019s being held responsible for causing so much trouble for families. She said she\u2019s heard complaints from people afraid to leave their homes because of multiple burglaries in the area.\n\n\n\nDarby said she\u2019d see the suspects lingering around homes and then notice them later in the day with power tools or other objects.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen them walking down the street with the TV,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nInvestigators are still working to recover stolen items and additional criminal charges are possible, according to a news release from TPD.\n\n\n\nMidvale Park recently hosted a National Night Out with the Tucson Police Department. Joe Miller, head of the neighborhood association, said it\u2019s important for the community to have a positive relationship with local law enforcement but he believes there\u2019s more that families can do to help combat crime.\n\n\n\nDarby admitted that she doesn\u2019t know her neighbors as well as she did when she first moved in nearly two decades ago, but that\u2019s no reason to ignore crime that\u2019s so close to home.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou still look out for your neighbor, whether you know them or not,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though you don\u2019t know them you\u2019re still going to be neighborly and watch out for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015.
