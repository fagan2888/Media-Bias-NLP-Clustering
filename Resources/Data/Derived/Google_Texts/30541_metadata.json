It's just an ongoing underpowered recovery \u2014 Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) April 4, 2014\n\nSenior Fellow Gary Burtless noted the good news in the report. \"For the first time since December 2007,\" he writes, \"private U.S. payrolls reached a new all-time peak.\" Despite this and some other good news, Burtless points out that:\n\npublic plus private payrolls remain more than 400,000 below their pre-recession peak. That\u2019s because government payrolls sank. In the 49 months that private-sector employment increased, public payrolls fell 627,000, or about 2.8%. Government employment remained unchanged in March, and public payrolls edged down 19,000 over the past year. A shrinking public sector is one of the headwinds slowing the job market recovery. Fortunately, this headwind seems to be weakening.\n\nUsing an alternative seasonal adjustment model published in the Brookings Papers on Economic Policy, Jonathan Wright of Johns Hopkins University calculates different monthly numbers, shown here, including 189,000 jobs in March.\n\nThe Hamilton Project continues to estimate the U.S. \"jobs gap\"\u2014the number of jobs that the U.S. economy has to create to return to pre-recession employment levels while absorbing the people who enter the labor force each month.\n\nThis number stands at 7.4 million jobs at the end of March 2014. According to the Hamilton Project, \"If the economy adds about 208,000 jobs per month, which was the average monthly rate for the best year of job creation in the 2000s, then it will take until September 2018 to close the jobs gap.\"\n\nVisit the updated Metro Monitor to see how the top 100 U.S. metro areas have fared in a range of economic indicators, including job changes from before the recession through the fourth quarter of 2013.\n\nHere is some of what Brookings experts are saying on Twitter:\n\nAnother month of slow, steady job market gains (if we avert our eyes from embarrassment of slumping gov't payrolls). http://t.co/eridWWdEqG \u2014 Gary Burtless (@GBurtless) April 4, 2014\n\nThe number of those working part-time for economic reasons increased by 200,000+ to 7.4 million in March \u2014 David Wessel (@davidmwessel) April 4, 2014\n\nEmployment growth was broadly based across industries.
