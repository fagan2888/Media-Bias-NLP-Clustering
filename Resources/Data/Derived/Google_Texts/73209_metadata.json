Family conflicts and other non-medical problems may raise a patient\u2019s risk of surgical complications, say the researchers of a new study of colon cancer patients at the Mayo Clinic. In fact, patients with poor quality of life were nearly three times more likely to face serious postoperative complications than those with normal or better quality of life. \u201cThis study suggests that quality of life can provide an early indicator for patients at risk of complications,\u201d wrote the authors in their published research.\n\nThat Was Then, This Is Now\n\nYears ago, cancer was considered a death sentence, pure and simple. With survival so extremely difficult, doctors focused on destroying the cancer by whatever means necessary to help patients remain alive. Today, survival in many instances of cancer is not only possible but highly probable, so doctors have a more nuanced approach to cancer care. Increasingly, physicians seek to help their patients preserve as normal a life as possible while undergoing treatment; with these more expansive hopes, doctors also have discovered how many psychological factors may influence survival rates. \u201cWe\u2019re understanding much better now that patients are not just a body with a disease,\u201d stated Dr. Juliane Bingener, a gastroenterologic surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and lead author of the new study. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole person with that, and everything plays together.\u201d\n\nTo investigate quality of life and the impact of mental attitude on a patient\u2019s health, researchers studied 431 colon cancer surgery patients. The researchers requested participants rate their quality of life, defined as more than just happiness and physical well-being, on a questionnaire probing their financial, spiritual, emotional, mental, and the social aspects of their lives. The researchers discovered 13 percent of patients had a quality of life deficit \u2014 a score of 50 or less on a 100-point scale \u2014 before undergoing surgery.\n\nSuch deficits caused a profound impact on patients' lives. Nearly three times as many patients with a quality of life deficit experienced serious post-surgery complications as those with a normal or good quality of life scores. Plus, patients with a postoperative complication spent 3.5 days longer in the hospital on average than those who didn\u2019t.\n\nPreventing complications by intervening with behavioral therapy or other assistance would likely cost much less than an ICU stay for an infection after major surgery, Bingener observed. Knowing that quality of life can be measured and worked with \"almost like blood pressure,\" Bingener asked in a press release, \u201cIf we understand before surgery that someone is in the red zone for quality of life, can we do something to help them cope with the new stress that\u2019s going to come, so they\u2019re better equipped to go through surgery?\u201d Though the elusive \"cure for cancer\" has not yet been found, cancer care has become quite sophisticated and only continues to evolve.Source: Bingener J, Sloan JA, Novotny PJ, Pockaj BA, Nelson H.
