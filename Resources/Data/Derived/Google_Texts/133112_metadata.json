Groups of this nature that existed before 1999, which includes the Christ Medicus Foundation, are exempt from mandates of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nAn estimated 300,000 Americans belong to such ministries, including the 1,250 in this Catholic one, Louis Brown, CMF CURO\u2019s director, said. It works in partnership with Samaritan Ministries International.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, 53 health care sharing ministries exist in the United States. Other faith-based nonprofits include Christian Healthcare Ministries, Liberty HealthShare, Medi-Share, and Samaritan.\n\n\u201cFor individuals that have to go and get their insurance in the marketplace, there are no alternatives that are consistent with Catholic and biblical teachings other than these health care sharing ministries,\u201d Brown said at the press conference.\n\nCMF CURO, which formally launched in January and is headquartered in Troy, Mich., was designed to provide that option for individuals or families who believe that Obamacare-mandated services such as contraception or abortion violate their religious beliefs.\n\nThe current Obamacare enrollment period began Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31.\n\n\u201cMillions of Catholics are making decisions about health care,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a really important story on multiple levels, especially as premiums are increasing and tax penalties [for opting out of Obamacare] are becoming a reality.\u201d\n\nUnder the CMF CURO model, which Brown is careful to explain is not health insurance, members share medical needs, pulling together when a member of the nonprofit must have emergency care.\n\n\u201cThe concept is basically taking the \u2018I\u2019m my brother\u2019s keeper\u2019 sort of seriously and saying, \u2018Look, rather than using insurance, we\u2019re going to take care of each other as part of this ministry,\u2019\u201d said Ed Haislmaier, senior research fellow in health policy in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Institute for Family, Community, and Opportunity. \u201cSo it\u2019s not insurance, and they\u2019re not taking on risk. [Members] don\u2019t have an obligation, but there is an expectation, which is voluntary and charitable.\u201d\n\nMost individuals in these ministries cover their own medical needs for minor conditions, Haislmaier said. It is only when members are diagnosed with a serious condition or face a medical bill they can\u2019t pay that they rely on peer-to-peer, person-to-person contributions.\n\nAs such, Brown said, the plan may not be the best option for individuals with pre-existing conditions. But, he said, members are pleased with their coverage.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of new things that are exciting that are going on in the United States, and particularly in the Catholic Church, that initially sound impossible,\u201d Brown said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation\u2019s only Catholic ministry to share health care costs expects a membership boost from the latest Obamacare open enrollment period.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The nation\u2019s only Catholic ministry to share health care costs expects a membership boost from the latest Obamacare open enrollment period.", "title": "With Open Enrollment, Health Sharing Ministry Looks to Grow", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/health-care-enrollment.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-04T19:15:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1iBhBeK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The nation\u2019s only Catholic ministry to share health care costs expects a membership boost from the latest Obamacare open enrollment period.", "title": "With Open Enrollment, Health Sharing Ministry Looks to Grow", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/health-care-enrollment.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2015-11-03T17:26:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T19:15:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Healthcare, affordable care act, ACA, health-sharing ministry, Christ Medicus Foundation, CURO"}, "article_summary": "According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, 53 health care sharing ministries exist in the United States.\nA health care sharing ministry is an organized, member-based group that shares medical costs.\nThe nation\u2019s only Catholic ministry to share health care costs expects to get a membership boost out of the latest Obamacare open enrollment period, which runs through January.\n\u201cMillions of Catholics are making decisions about health care,\u201d Brown said.\n\u201cFor individuals that have to go and get their insurance in the marketplace, there are no alternatives that are consistent with Catholic and biblical teachings other than these health care sharing ministries,\u201d Brown said at the press conference."}
