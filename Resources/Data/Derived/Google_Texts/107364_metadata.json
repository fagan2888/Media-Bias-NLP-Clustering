So, again, no increase in premium is not what we want, but it feels like it\u2019s a fairly minimal impact.\u201d\n\nCounihan added, \u201c[T]his is not unexpected in a marketplace, particularly one that\u2019s dynamic, like our own, that continues to expand. We enrolled roughly 13 million people, last year, of roughly 40%, or 5 million, were brand new customers. We\u2019ve got insurance companies that are expanding, like Cigna announced today. So, again, this is what you expect in a new and dynamic market.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "HealthCare.gov CEO: UnitedHealthcare's Departure From Most ACA Exchanges 'What You Expect'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "HealthCare.gov CEO: UnitedHealthcare's Departure From Most ACA Exchanges 'What You Expect'", "title": "HealthCare.gov CEO: UnitedHealthcare's Departure From Most ACA Exchanges 'What You Expect' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Counihan-420-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/04/20/healthcare-gov-ceo-unitedhealthcares-departure-from-most-aca-exchanges-what-you-expect/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "HealthCare.gov CEO: UnitedHealthcare's Departure From Most ACA Exchanges 'What You Expect'", "title": "HealthCare.gov CEO: UnitedHealthcare's Departure From Most ACA Exchanges 'What You Expect' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/Counihan-420-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "healthcare.gov, Kevin Counihan, obamacare,Breitbart TV, Obamacare,UnitedHealthcare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2016-04-20T19:48:32-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCounihan began by saying that while \u201cwe\u2019re still waiting to see\u201d the impact of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s departure, the company has \u201ca pretty small market share overall.\nSo, again, this is what you expect in a new and dynamic market.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\nWe enrolled roughly 13 million people, last year, of roughly 40%, or 5 million, were brand new customers.\nWe\u2019ve got insurance companies that are expanding, like Cigna announced today.\nSo, again, no increase in premium is not what we want, but it feels like it\u2019s a fairly minimal impact.\u201dCounihan added, \u201c[T]his is not unexpected in a marketplace, particularly one that\u2019s dynamic, like our own, that continues to expand."}
