The discussion took place at a New Canaan Republican Town Committee forum held at the Outback Teen Center.\n\nDemocrats like U.S. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), while acknowledging that health care reform has been highly contentious and experienced a number of problems in its implementation, point to more well-received elements such the insurance industry reforms the law enacted or reductions in the number of uninsured. The law, Himes said, is partly responsible for lower increases in health insurance premiums since it was signed into law.\n\nWhile Republicans call for the law\u2019s repeal, speakers at the forum also discussed what ought to replace it. \u201cRepublicans are not looking to deny medical care to needy citizens,\u201d said Kevin Moynihan, the committee\u2019s treasurer and a Town Council member. \u201cWe just believe there is a better way to do it than the invasive and ill-conceived Obamacare legislation.\u201d\n\nDr. Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, characterized the law \u2014 officially the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 \u2014 in no uncertain terms, calling it \u201ccorrupt\u201d and charging that it \u201cshreds your constitutional rights.\u201d Further, she claimed, Obamacare is just the kind of thing the Founding Fathers would have balked at.\n\nShe cited President James Madison, who said of the young American Republic, \u201cIt will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.\u201d Holding up a printed copy of the 2400-page legislation, McCaughey said, \u201cThat is Obamacare to a \u2018T.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe law should be replaced, she contended, with \u201ca 20-page bill in plain, honest English that members of Congress would actually read\u201d \u2014 perhaps containing things like the health insurance industry reforms that Democrats and Republicans agreed on in trying to find common ground in the run-up to the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nOne of Obamacare\u2019s main objectives was to accomplish those reforms, but speakers at the forum said they had been tainted by insurance companies\u2019 additions to the law. Health insurance reforms it contains include barring \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d as a reason to deny an individual coverage, elimination of lifetime coverage caps, establishing minimum coverage requirements such as preventive care, and allowing children to stay under their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26.\n\nPrivacy lost?\n\nMcCaughey touched on minimum coverage requirements, arguing that these force citizens \u201cto enroll in an essential benefits package.\u201d In order to avoid having to provide employees health coverage, she said businesses are hiring more part-time workers. \u201cWe\u2019re turning the United States into a part-time nation,\u201d McCaughey said.\n\nBut she also had a serious contention that Obamacare has set up a health information system where government and health insurers are monitoring physicians\u2019 decisions and effectively can take note of all that\u2019s said \u2014 or at least all that\u2019s reported \u2014between doctors and their patients.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against medical records, I\u2019m against government imposing penalties and protocols on physicians\u2019 decisions,\u201d McCaughey said. Also, she added, \u201cWe all confide things to our doctor that we wouldn\u2019t with anyone else,\u201d and that information should remain private.\n\nDr. Richard Amerling, a New York City physician and president-elect of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, added that electronic health records under Obamacare get in the way of doctors caring for their patients.\n\n\u201cThis is not about convenience or patient care. The electronic health record as it\u2019s being implemented under Obamacare distracts you,\u201d Amerling said. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there typing data into the computer when I could be talking to the patient. You have a right to not put your information on an electronic health care record.\u201d\n\nStarkly opposing views\n\nAmerling also argued that \u201cbest practices\u201d and \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d used as precedent for treatment under Obamacare are based on skewed data and result in care that is not in the best interest of patients. \u201cThey take a clinically meaningless result and massively amplify it,\u201d he said. \u201cEvidence-based medicine is really junk science.\u201d\n\nAmerling gave an example of statins, which are routinely prescribed for patients to lower cholesterol, claiming these drugs are stressed in treatment protocols more in the interest of pharmaceutical companies than patients. \u201cI can almost guarantee that none of you need these drugs or will benefit from them,\u201d he said.\n\nAmerling also assailed Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirements for health insurance with a very different take on the best value in health plans. The law, Amerling said, precludes purchasing \u201ca high-deductible, low cost plan that\u2019ll cover catastrophic costs and pay for your routine care yourself \u2014 it\u2019s a much better deal.\u201d\n\nA major talking point of congressional Democrats during the health reform debate was that such high-deductible plans essentially amount to no coverage at all, since they fail to cover routine and preventive medical care that could head off more serious health problems down the road. With these kinds of opposite-end views on particular elements of health care reform, it\u2019s left to be seen how Democrats and Republicans will find much agreement on the issue.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "New Canaan Advertiser", "description": "In an issue sure to be discussed in elections this year, Republican and medical leaders argued on Wednesday evening, June 4, that the health care reform la", "title": "New Canaan GOP forum: Replace Obamacare with \u2018honest English\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ncadvertiser.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2014/06/new-canaan-obamacare-gop.jpg", "url": "http://ncadvertiser.com/34102/gop-forum-replace-obamacare-with-honest-english/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NCAdvertiser", "section": "Lead News", "tag": "rtc", "published_time": "2014-06-13T06:32:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "New Canaan Advertiser", "description": "In an issue sure to be discussed in elections this year, Republican and medical leaders argued on Wednesday evening, June 4, that the health care reform la", "creator": "@ncadvertiser", "image": {"src": "http://ncadvertiser.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2014/06/new-canaan-obamacare-gop.jpg"}, "title": "New Canaan GOP forum: Replace Obamacare with \u2018honest English\u2019", "site": "@ncadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "In an issue sure to be discussed in elections this year, Republican and medical leaders argued on Wednesday evening, June 4, that the health care reform la"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc740\"", "article_summary": "The law, Himes said, is partly responsible for lower increases in health insurance premiums since it was signed into law.\nAmerling also assailed Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirements for health insurance with a very different take on the best value in health plans.\n\u201cRepublicans are not looking to deny medical care to needy citizens,\u201d said Kevin Moynihan, the committee\u2019s treasurer and a Town Council member.\nWhile Republicans call for the law\u2019s repeal, speakers at the forum also discussed what ought to replace it.\nWith these kinds of opposite-end views on particular elements of health care reform, it\u2019s left to be seen how Democrats and Republicans will find much agreement on the issue."}
