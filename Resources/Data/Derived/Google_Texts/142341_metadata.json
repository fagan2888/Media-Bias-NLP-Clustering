Paul Ryan and Donald Trump pledged Thursday to work together to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the fall general election \u2014 though the Republican House speaker again stopped short of formally endorsing his party's presumptive presidential nominee.\n\n3.

This time, the end came after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued a Tuesday injunction to halt the merger, acting on objections raised by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/27kf7H7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It\u2019s been quite a week in the world of news.
