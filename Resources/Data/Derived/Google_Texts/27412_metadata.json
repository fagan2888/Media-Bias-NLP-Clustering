It\u2019s an unfunded plan. We have $35 million for a billion-dollar project.\u201d\n\nThis is a project that even people generally skeptical of highway expansion should favor \u2014 since there is no real alternative to I-25 along the Front Range. And it is growing population, not more individual driving, that has produced time-devouring congestion.\n\nThat segment of I-25 is hardly the only stretch of highway that needs improvement simply to keep up with population growth. For example, although CDOT has pulled several rabbits from its hat to improve the I-70 mountain corridor, much more needs to be done there.\n\nUnfortunately, the recent legislative session failed to produce a plan to do something about highway funding.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jared Polis, whose district now includes Fort Collins, has said the federal portion of I-25 funding could be available in the next three to five years \u2014 but of course it won\u2019t do much good without major state investment, too.\n\nOn that score, according to The Coloradoan, Gov. John Hickenlooper last month told an audience in Fort Collins that \u201cwe\u2019d be able to have six lanes all the way from here to Colorado Springs\u201d if the General Assembly would agree to turn the state\u2019s hospital provider fee into an enterprise fund. That would free up $215 million a year, he said, which could be leveraged to cover the construction cost.\n\nA bill to create the enterprise fund was killed by Republicans in the state Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, a Republican bill to generate $3.5 billion in highway improvements by renewing the 16-year-old TRANS bonds died in the Democratic House. Critics of the measure, including CDOT, worried it would have taken too much from maintenance.\n\nThe critics had a point. But then so did House Minority Leader Brian DelGrosso of Loveland, Senate Bill 272\u2019s sponsor, who said a transportation tax hike is a hard sell and state leaders can\u2019t just sit on their hands. Without the TRANS bonds, Gov. Bill Owens\u2019 administration would never have been able to fund the T-REX I-25 expansion and a number of other state projects.\n\nWe continue to think the hospital provider fee qualifies as an enterprise fund, and should have been created as one in 2009. For that matter, given the success of TRANS bonds, it\u2019s hard to believe that some sort of bonding package acceptable to both parties can\u2019t be crafted for the 2016 legislative session.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have such large chunks of your population, your working public, that are spending 45 minutes a day in traffic,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for business, it\u2019s not good for people\u2019s family lives.\u201d\n\nForty-five minutes? Such an optimist.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado highways, stuck in neutral", "title": "Colorado highways, stuck in neutral", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/05/colorado-highways-stuck-in-neutral/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605__20150607_Z00_OP07E_NORTH25p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605__20150607_Z00_OP07E_NORTH25p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T12:33:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T10:51:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb406\"", "article_summary": "That segment of I-25 is hardly the only stretch of highway that needs improvement simply to keep up with population growth.\nBill Owens\u2019 administration would never have been able to fund the T-REX I-25 expansion and a number of other state projects.\nMeanwhile, a Republican bill to generate $3.5 billion in highway improvements by renewing the 16-year-old TRANS bonds died in the Democratic House.\nUnfortunately, the recent legislative session failed to produce a plan to do something about highway funding.\nA bill to create the enterprise fund was killed by Republicans in the state Senate."}
