Indeed. But there\u2019s something else going on here, and it\u2019s part of a larger pattern.\n\nI\u2019ve talked in the past about how negative views of Obamacare get propagated:\n\nIt goes like this: a lot of the untrue beliefs people have about Obamacare come not so much from outright false reporting as from selective reporting. Every suggestion of bad news gets highlighted \u2014 especially, of course, but not only by Fox, the WSJ, etc.. But when it turns out that the news wasn\u2019t really that bad, these sources just move on. There are claims that millions of people are losing coverage \u2014 headlines! When it turns out not to be true \u2014 crickets! Some experts claim that premiums will rise by double digits \u2014 big news! Actual premium numbers come in and they\u2019re surprisingly low \u2014 not mentioned.\n\nSomething similar applies to economic and market news. Cavuto spoke about the dip in stocks that took place in the very early days of the Obama presidency \u2014 which, not incidentally, led a lot of the usual suspects to declare that his policies had already failed \u2014 and about the decline in the past few weeks. Somehow no mention of what happened in between. Here\u2019s the full picture:\n\nPhoto\n\nIt would be interesting to poll Republicans about what happened to the stock market under Obama; my bet is that many, perhaps a majority, believe that it went down, thanks to this technique of only reporting the bad news.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160115081828, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 15, 2016", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Neil Cavuto and the Dynamics of Misinformation ( 20160115 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Only report the downs.", "title": "Neil Cavuto and the Dynamics of Misinformation", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/neil-cavuto-and-the-dynamics-of-misinformation/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Only report the downs.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 15, 2016", "article": {"published_time": 1452863908, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-01-15T13:19:36-05:00"}, "utime": 20160115131936, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160115, "pdate": 20160115, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Only report the downs.", "title": "Neil Cavuto and the Dynamics of Misinformation", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/neil-cavuto-and-the-dynamics-of-misinformation/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/neil-cavuto-and-the-dynamics-of-misinformation/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Neil Cavuto and the Dynamics of Misinformation", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Josh Marshall notes that during last night\u2019s debate Neil Cavuto seemed to imply that the financial crisis happened on Obama\u2019s watch without saying anything explicitly false.\nBut when it turns out that the news wasn\u2019t really that bad, these sources just move on.\nEvery suggestion of bad news gets highlighted \u2014 especially, of course, but not only by Fox, the WSJ, etc..\nBut there\u2019s something else going on here, and it\u2019s part of a larger pattern.\nI\u2019ve talked in the past about how negative views of Obamacare get propagated:It goes like this: a lot of the untrue beliefs people have about Obamacare come not so much from outright false reporting as from selective reporting."}
