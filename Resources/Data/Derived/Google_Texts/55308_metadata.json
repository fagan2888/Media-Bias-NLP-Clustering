People living in these areas rely on a knowledge base that has developed over hundreds and thousands of years, based on local plants and herbs, as well as spiritual beliefs.\n\nA new study examines how the changing environment may have an impact on traditional medicine around the world. In fact, \u201c[t]raditional medicine provides health care for more than half the world\u2019s population, with 80 percent of people in developing countries relying on these practices to maintain their livelihood,\u201d Dr. Haris Saslis-Lagoudakis, an author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cIt is a very important part of traditional knowledge.\u201d He went on to stress that changes in the environment may \u201cpose a threat to traditional knowledge.\u201d\n\nSaslis-Lagoudakis and his team of international researchers, led by the University of Reading in the U.K. wanted to discover how the environment impacts the use of medicinal plants in indigenous cultures. They focused their research in Nepal, located in the Himalayans, known for its cultural and biological diversity. \u201cBy understanding the relationship between environment and traditional knowledge, we can then understand how cultures have responded to changes in the environment in the past,\u201d Saslis-Lagoudakis said in the press release.\n\nThe research team examined 12 different ethnic groups from Nepal, studying their use of plants in traditional medicine. They measured the similarities in these cultures\u2019 medicinal floras, and how closely related the plants are, including their geographic separation. The team discovered, not surprisingly, that Nepalese cultures that were exposed to similar plants ended up developing the same kinds of traditional medicines. \u201cAlthough shared cultural history and borrowing of traditional knowledge among neighboring cultures can lead to similarities in the plants used medicinally, we found that plant availability in the local environment has a stronger influence on the make-up of a culture\u2019s medicinal floras,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nEssentially, and perhaps obviously, the environment significantly impacts the type of traditional medicine that is developed in different parts of the world. But perhaps more importantly, this also means that environmental changes can lead to disrupted ecosystems, a loss of plant species, and a \u201cpoorer natural environment,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThis will then affect what plants people can use around them.\u201d The authors state that we ought to be concerned about this, in order to prevent the loss of important medicinal information that has been passed down from generation to generation.\n\n\u201cThis knowledge is typically passed down from generation to generation, or it is \u2018borrowed\u2019 from neighbors,\u201d Saslis-Lagoudakis said. \u201cBecause of this borrowing, globalization can homogenize medicinal practices of different communities, leading to loss of medicinal remedies.\" He continued, \"Understanding the factors that shape traditional knowledge can provide the underpinnings to preserve this body of knowledge and predict its future.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "traditional medicine, traditional knowledge, nepal, changes in environment", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study examines the link between the environment and the use of traditional medicine in indigenous cultures, and points to the risk of environmental changes having a negative impact on traditional knowledge.", "title": "Changes In Environment Pose 'Threat' To Traditional Medicine Around The World", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/changes-environment-can-pose-threat-traditional-medicine-around-world-study-269275", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/13/traditional-medicine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study examines the link between the environment and the use of traditional medicine in indigenous cultures, and points to the risk of environmental changes having a negative impact on traditional knowledge.", "title": "Changes In Environment Pose 'Threat' To Traditional Medicine Around The World", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/changes-environment-can-pose-threat-traditional-medicine-around-world-study-269275", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/13/traditional-medicine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/13/traditional-medicine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-02-13T19:19:36-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-13T19:26:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study examines the link between the environment and the use of traditional medicine in indigenous cultures, and points to the risk of environmental changes having a negative impact on traditional knowledge."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6a3\"", "article_summary": "A new study examines how the changing environment may have an impact on traditional medicine around the world.\nEssentially, and perhaps obviously, the environment significantly impacts the type of traditional medicine that is developed in different parts of the world.\nHe continued, \"Understanding the factors that shape traditional knowledge can provide the underpinnings to preserve this body of knowledge and predict its future.\"\nThe research team examined 12 different ethnic groups from Nepal, studying their use of plants in traditional medicine.\n\u201cBy understanding the relationship between environment and traditional knowledge, we can then understand how cultures have responded to changes in the environment in the past,\u201d Saslis-Lagoudakis said in the press release."}
