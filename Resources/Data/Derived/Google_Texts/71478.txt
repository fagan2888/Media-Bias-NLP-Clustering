Syracuse, N.Y. -- Many New Yorkers who signed up last year for health insurance through the state health insurance exchange will soon receive forms in the mail they will need to complete their 2014 federal tax returns.

The state exchange is mailing more than 300,000 forms to New York households that had one or more family members who enrolled in a private health plan through the exchange during 2014.

ACR Health, a Syracuse nonprofit agency that helps people enroll in coverage through the exchange, is offering to answer questions consumers have about Form 1095-A.

People who enrolled in health plans and received financial assistance in the form of advanced payments of tax credits that lowered their monthly premiums need Form 1095-A to complete their tax returns. The tax credits were based on projected 2014 income and consumers must reconcile the amount of tax credits they received with their actual incomes. Consumers could owe money if their actual income turned out to be higher than projected or get a credit if their income was lower than projected.

People with questions about the new forms can call ACR at 800-475-2430.

The state health insurance exchange has answered frequently asked questions about Form 1095-A on its website.
