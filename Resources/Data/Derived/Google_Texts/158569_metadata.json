I\u2019m just not holding my breath.\n\nDespite a string of embarrassing and disheartening mistakes, the Obama administration does not have to worry about a suddenly resurgent Republican Party. The GOP has its hands full. Even with this year\u2019s primary season behind them, sharp divides between insurgents and establishment remain. The door is sliding closed on replacing Obamacare, and Republicans won\u2019t get another shot at running our foreign policy until at least 2017. Just because the president has lost the initiative does not mean the GOP has regained it.\n\nNow, Republicans are held captive by narratives, not just events. And the main narrative staring them down for the rest of Obama\u2019s term is \u201cobstructionism.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an old story, but this time it has some bite, because now, Republicans are obstructing themselves. What\u2019s more, they\u2019re doing it on what leading political and media figures want to be the next big marquee issue for sweeping, top-down reform.\n\nA critical mass of influential figures now demands the GOP act on immigration, one way or the other. And that means the House GOP.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has stalled on immigration with great vigor. This year, however, something\u2019s got to give. In the Senate, big-time personal politics forged a team of Republican egos that can\u2019t tolerate playing second fiddle to mere Representatives. They know that if there\u2019s no vote by August, immigration is dead for the year\u2014and the Senate will have to pass it again next year if it\u2019s ever to return. The pressure is on from the left, as well. Democrats have given activist groups their marching orders: \u201cTrain all your fire on House Republicans from now until August,\u201d as Politico sums them up.\n\nAs part of the Democrats\u2019 offensive, the Center for American Progress has dutifully whipped up a survey showing that almost half of Latino respondents would blame the GOP for Congressional inaction on immigration, while just 16 percent would blame Democrats.\n\nThose sorts of numbers are just the start of the House\u2019s troubles, as Majority Leader Eric Cantor knows all too well. This election year, he was caught in a withering crossfire of immigration criticism from right and left alike\u2014slammed for being pro-amnesty on the one hand and anti-reform on the other.\n\nThe justifiable concern this spectacle raises is that Republicans stand to lose no matter what they do. That same CAP poll puts a spotlight on the pitfalls: 45 percent of respondents said they\u2019d be more \u201cfavorable\u201d toward Republicans in general, and 61 percent more \u201copen\u201d to their ideas, if only the House GOP would \u201csupport immigration reform.\u201d\n\nLike many polls, CAP\u2019s was carefully tailored to encourage the results desired. But the dilemma for Republicans is clear enough. Chasing after mere favorability and openness is an unbecoming act of desperation. The nightmare scenario for the GOP is a marginally more GOP-friendly Hispanic population that still breaks strongly Democratic, cycle after cycle. And there\u2019s just no indication that, politically speaking, the Senate approach to reform will yield anything but that.\n\nWhat House Republicans need, but do not have, is a cohesive approach to immigration that can be stacked up against the Senate\u2019s. It\u2019s got to be an approach that doesn\u2019t go full remember-the-Alamo, like the grassroots\u2019 preferred approach, or full dollar-sign-eyes, like the Chamber of Commerce wing of the party. But it\u2019s also got to avoid the cloying, off-putting sentimentalism of the RINO wing that sees government as a salvific, nationalistic Santa Claus, bestowing the blessings of full American-ness on a people stuck in the \u201cshadows.\u201d\n\nNow would seem like a strange time for a dispassionate, de-politicized immigration solution to emerge from the House. But there\u2019s one waiting to be cobbled together, if only Boehner and company would think it through.\n\nIt would take shape in accordance with a three-step acknowledgement of the basic realities we confront on the issue. First, the \u201cillegal immigration crisis\u201d is over. Whether we keep border security about where it is or whether we ramp it up dramatically, there just isn\u2019t going to be the kind of massive influx that got us where we are today. A future economic boom might bump up the numbers, but right now they\u2019re around net zero\u2014a figure that has more to do with Mexicans and Mexico than it does with the U.S. economy.\n\nThat means, second, that we\u2019re dealing with a finite, specific population of undocumented immigrants. They\u2019re not going to clone themselves. Like all of us, they\u2019re going to get old, and they\u2019re eventually going to die. The political and legal problem posed by \u201cillegal immigration today\u201d is only going to get smaller over time. In fact, as we all know, the American-born children of those undocumented immigrants are all going to be citizens from Day One.\n\nAnd third of all, and in sum, the \u201cimmigration problem\u201d boils down to a far more specific and narrow situation than so many of us have allowed ourselves to think. Although the Obama administration has done an energetic job of deporting some people, there just isn\u2019t a strong enough consensus to kick out the finite population of undocumented. On the other hand, although a blanket amnesty is a far more elegant, enforceable, and principled policy than a patchwork of half-measures that plays favorites on the basis of ethnicity or education policy, there just isn\u2019t a strong enough consensus to deliver that outcome, either.\n\nSo one thing we know for sure is that we\u2019re not going to give the boot or give amnesty to the finite, specific population of undocumented immigrants who crossed the border illegally. And another thing we know is that birthright citizenship means we don\u2019t have to worry about their kids\u2019 status.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Some critics worry that reform would be like an on/off switch\u2014suddenly and irreversibly changing America forever. Others worry that reform would be the opposite\u2014a never-ending morass of bureaucracy, legalese, and special status, hardwiring yet more regulatory complexity and intrusive government into everything we do.\n\nBy focusing solely on the actual humans whose legal status needs to be finalized, however, we can act swiftly, safe in the knowledge that a policy tailored to them won\u2019t transform America or make implementation a permanent process.\n\nGive the undocumented some documentation, but not citizenship. Let them pay some back taxes. Let them learn English if they like. And let their American-born children be American citizens.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "immigration reform, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201406050945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "immigration reform, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The House GOPs Big Immigration Fail", "tags": "immigration_reform,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "It\u2019s still not too late for the House to put together a modest but meaningful immigration bill.
