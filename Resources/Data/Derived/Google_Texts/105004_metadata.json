It's been like this all season,\u201d said Kevin Durant. \u201cHe's a pioneer in my opinion.\"\n\nIt didn't end well. Bryant scored 13 points and then sat out the rest of the game.\n\n\"I tried to loosen up coming out of the locker room,\u201d explained Bryant. \u201cComing out, I couldn't move well at all, that and the fact we were losing by 40.\"\n\nBut now, it\u2019s time to reflect with only one game left on his journey.\n\n\"I spent most of my time to the connectivity that sports has to everything that surrounds us, so I think sports has a deeper connection to human nature,\" Bryant stated.\n\nThe Thunder players made sure to honor him in his last road game for his NBA career. Each one of them wrote personal reflections on their time playing against him and they honored him with a book before the game.\n\n\"It takes time for players to be able to do that and I think the biggest thing is to have those memories, especially very personal things,\" said Bryant.\n\n\"Heard he got a lifetime supply of Jordan's,\u201d Durant added. \u201cAll our guys wrote a little small message for him and hopefully he appreciates it.\u201d\n\nNow with one last game against Utah, fans got to see this legend's last ride and a legacy left.\n\n\"Feel really excited and very happy and looking forward to lacing them up one more time,\" said Bryant.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Monday night's Thunder-Lakers\u00a0crowd came from all over the world to see Kobe Bryant play his final road game.", "author": "Harold Kuntz", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/31706581/crowd-travels-from-all-over-to-see-kobe-bryants-final-road-game-in-okc", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10313749_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Monday night's Thunder-Lakers\u00a0crowd came from all over the world to see Kobe Bryant play his final road game.", "title": "Crowd Travels From All Over To See Kobe Bryant's Final Road Game In OKC"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10313749_G.jpg", "description": "Monday night's Thunder-Lakers\u00a0crowd came from all over the world to see Kobe Bryant play his final road game.", "card": "summary", "title": "Crowd Travels From All Over To See Kobe Bryant's Final Road Game In OKC"}, "wnreadableurl": "crowd-travels-from-all-over-to-see-kobe-bryants-final-road-game-in-okc", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2016/04/12", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS08", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d70\"", "article_summary": "The Thunder players made sure to honor him in his last road game for his NBA career.\nThe main attraction at the last Thunder home game was not the Thunder; it was the Lakers\u2019 Kobe Bryant.\nEach one of them wrote personal reflections on their time playing against him and they honored him with a book before the game.\n\"Feel really excited and very happy and looking forward to lacing them up one more time,\" said Bryant.\nTwo fans traveled all the way from Australia to see the future Hall of Famer."}
