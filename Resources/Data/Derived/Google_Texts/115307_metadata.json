Yesterday, Nobel Laureate, noted liberal economist, and New York Times op-ed columnist Paul Krugman stopped short of issuing what is becoming a standard disclaimer that he is not a corrupt Wall Street activist, but he did spend his 800 words hitting back at Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) critics; particularly those on the extreme left.\n\nKrugman took a fair amount of heat a week or so ago when he first defended \u201cObamacare\u201d and explained, as an acclaimed economist, why scrapping the President\u2019s signature healthcare reform law for an already dead attempt at Medicare-for-all socialized healthcare. Krugman, like most liberals understands that single payer is one means of insuring most Americans, but he is also realistic enough to comprehend that in this, and the foreseeable future, political environment socialized medicine will not reach fruition.\n\nWhat bothered Krugman, besides \u201cObamacare\u201d not receiving adequate funding, is that besides single payer\u2019s dead-before arrival chances, a fair amount of criticism is coming from the left. In fact, Krugman is puzzled why Senator Sanders is proposing \u201cre-litigating a hard-fought Democratic healthcare reform law for single-payer as a centerpiece of his campaign.\u201d Krugman rightly says that this fantasy has led \u201cto attacks on \u2018Obamacare\u2019 from wrong-headed liberals.\u201d Wrong-headed may be too strong a word for sensitive emoprogs; politically ignorant and angry may be a more apt adjective.\n\nKrugman did give the single payer proposal \u201ca fair hearing\u201d and noted that due to insufficient funding the ACA still leaves Americans uninsured. He also said that after a monumental battle, the biggest challenge for America is to address covering more Americans in a \u201cpolitical feasible way\u201d that also continues bringing down healthcare costs; costs that he claims are being controlled much better \u201cthan even reform advocates ever expected.\u201d Even Krugman \u201choping\u201d for more funding for \u201cObamacare\u201d is likely \u201cwrong-headed\u201d as long as Republicans control the House, but he does acknowledge it may take many years before Republicans agree to provide more funding for a healthcare system; any healthcare system.\n\nKrugman makes it clear that scrapping \u201cObamacare\u201d and going to a single-payer is a pipe dream and asserts that the people on the left joining Koch Republicans condemning the ACA are Senator Sanders\u2019 supporters. He wrote,\n\n\u201cA lot of what I hear from the left is not so much a complaint about how the reform falls short as outrage that private insurers get to play any role. The idea seems to be that any role for the profit motive taints the whole effort. The point is to help the uninsured, not to punish or demonize insurance companies.\u201d\n\nIt is worth reminding Americans that if private insurance companies were not part of \u201cObamacare,\u201d like they are part of Medicare and Medicaid, there would be no healthcare reform whatsoever. In fact, what seems lost on the \u201cEmoProg\u201d movement is that even with private insurance company involvement in \u201cObamacare,\u201d Medicare, and Medicaid, Republicans have spent the past nearly six years doing everything in their considerable power to get rid of not only Obamacare, but Medicare as well. One is just baffled beyond comprehension why anyone in America would think for a second that any Republican will ever support raising trillions in taxes to fund a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system; arguably a government socialized system when they want any healthcare system eviscerated.\n\nKrugman ended his screed with a valid complaint about the manner in which anyone defending the current system is \u201cdemonized\u201d by Sanders supporters. He wrote,\n\n\u201cOne unpleasant, ugly side of this debate has been the tendency of some Sanders supporters, and sometimes the campaign itself, to suggest that anyone raising questions about the senator\u2019s proposals must be a corrupt tool of vested interests.\u201d\n\nAs a campaign ploy, Krugman joins many Democrats in fearing that it is precisely the \u201ckind of tactic that will do harm in the general election and divide people who are essentially on the same side.\u201d And, Krugman fears, may quite possibly harm the long-term prospects of preserving what he considers \u201cthe single greatest achievement in social policy in decades.\u201d\n\nThis divisive ploy, and it is a ploy conservatives are aiding and abetting, is, like it or not, being promoted by the Sanders\u2019 campaign just as Krugman intimates. Don\u2019t believe it? When House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said raising taxes on the middle class to fund a single payer was not going to happen, Senator Sanders responded that anyone who does not embrace his \u201cpolitically inviable plan\u201d is \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\nDisingenuous means insincere and deceitful; typically by pretending to know less about something than one really does. Obviously, Nancy Pelosi was not being deceitful or pretending to know less than she really does; especially about the political environment she fought to enact a fifty year Democratic goal. For dog\u2019s sake even though Pelosi has wanted a single payer for thirty years, she was instrumental in helping push healthcare reform through considerable Republican and conservative Democrat opposition in the House in 2010. And, she knows that Americans, particularly Republicans, are not about to support massive tax hikes for socialized, government-provided, healthcare. But even that is not the point.\n\nIt is looking more and more like, according to Senator Sanders, not embracing \u201chis plan\u201d makes the likes of Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, Nancy Pelosi, House and Senate Democrats, myriad liberal websites and political experts all very insincere and deceitful Americans. That list also includes any American who has been conscious over the past three decades and aware that no Republican, and most Democrats, will not impose massive tax hikes on the rich and middle class to pay for socialized medicine; at least not in this decade or political landscape.\n\nBeing aware of that reality, and daring to vocalize it within earshot of a Sanders\u2019 supporter, does not make one deceitful, or a paid shill of the Kochs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, or Wall Street. What it makes them is pragmatists who have sat and watched Republicans do everything in their power to wipe out Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act, and now they are watching disgruntled \u2018liberals\u2019 join Republicans in criticizing and hoping to scrap something Krugman rightly called \u201cthe single greatest achievement in social policy in decades.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Krugman points out that with GOP control the House, it may take many years before Republicans agree to provide more funding for a healthcare system", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Krugman points out that with GOP control the House, it may take many years before Republicans agree to provide more funding for a healthcare system", "title": "Paul Krugman Strikes Back At Liberals Who Attack \u2018Obamacare\u2019", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/06/paul-krugman-strikes-back-at-liberals-who-attack-obamacare.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Krugman.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-06T17:53:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Commentary,Featured News,#Feelthebern,affordable care act,Bernie Sanders,Democrats,medicare,Nancy Pelosi,Obamacare,Paul Krugman,single payer,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2016-02-06T17:53:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-06T17:53:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "#Feelthebern, affordable care act, Bernie Sanders, Democrats, medicare, Nancy Pelosi, Obamacare, Paul Krugman, single payer"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b26\"", "article_summary": "What bothered Krugman, besides \u201cObamacare\u201d not receiving adequate funding, is that besides single payer\u2019s dead-before arrival chances, a fair amount of criticism is coming from the left.\nKrugman did give the single payer proposal \u201ca fair hearing\u201d and noted that due to insufficient funding the ACA still leaves Americans uninsured.\nAnd, she knows that Americans, particularly Republicans, are not about to support massive tax hikes for socialized, government-provided, healthcare.\nKrugman took a fair amount of heat a week or so ago when he first defended \u201cObamacare\u201d and explained, as an acclaimed economist, why scrapping the President\u2019s signature healthcare reform law for an already dead attempt at Medicare-for-all socialized healthcare.\nKrugman ended his screed with a valid complaint about the manner in which anyone defending the current system is \u201cdemonized\u201d by Sanders supporters."}
