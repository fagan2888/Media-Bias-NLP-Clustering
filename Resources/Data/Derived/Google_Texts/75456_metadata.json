A change in color in the glass panels will mark the water level of the 1937 flood.\n\nA stepped waterfall that's 40 feet at its widest point will narrow as water descends 155 feet into a reflection pool at the base of the light shard. It was redesigned to pay homage to the nearby Falls of the Ohio.\n\nThe waterfall, like the shard, will have LEDs that can be changed into a variety of colors, Waiz said.\n\nPlayground equipment is on site, but not ready to be used. Workers need to pour concrete and install rubberized matting, which likely will happen next week. Sod will also be added on the north side of park next month once electrical work is done to allow the sod to be irrigated, Waiz said.\n\nAnticipation of the new pathway spurred several new businesses, such as Pearl Street Treats near the foot of the ramp; Big Four Burgers in the former Third Base Tavern on Spring Street; Red Yeti Brewing Co. in a former furniture store on Spring; and Olive Leaf Bistro in part of the Sprigler building on Riverside Drive.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Jeffersonville fire and safety officials discuss changes after the opening of the Big Four ramp. Charlie White\n\nIndianapolis-based Flat 12 Bierwerks announced earlier this year it plans to open its first satellite taproom and brewery in the other part of the Sprigler building by early summer.\n\nWaiz said Red Yeti owners told him during a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday that business has been picking up.\n\nHe also said the city may look into adding electronic counters like the Louisville side uses to help determine exactly how many people use the bridge. Between last June when they were installed and February, more than 500,000 pedestrians and 75,000 cyclists used the ramp in Waterfront Park.\n\nThree of the four houses remaining in Jeffersonville's new park were moved to Pearl Street and the other will be moved soon, Waiz said.\n\nThe city still hasn't decided whether the houses will be sold, leased or kept. Regardless, Waiz said they add to the historical Rose Hill neighborhood people see coming to the park from Court Avenue.\n\nReporter Charlie White can be reached at (812) 949-4026 and on Twitter @c_write.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1k5heSS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Jeffersonville city engineer Andy Crouch returned Thursday to look for graffiti and any other damage, finding none.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Jeffersonville city engineer Andy Crouch returned Thursday to look for graffiti and any other damage, finding none.", "title": "Big Four Bridge boosts downtown business", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/05/23/big-four-bridge-boosts-downtown-business/9506161/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeffersonville city engineer Andy Crouch returned Thursday to look for graffiti and any other damage, finding none.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/24/andycrouch3.jpg", "title": "Big Four Bridge boosts downtown business", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Charlie White", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Charlie White", "title": "Big Four Bridge boosts downtown business", "author": "Charlie White", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/24/andycrouch3.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/24/andycrouch3.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/209496ef8e15ec974055f2b972cb017799a2d254/c=0-0-3264-2448/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/24/andycrouch3.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5366816a2be01ce320de9a1b7d4fcd3d9671846/c=0-306-3264-2142&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/24/andycrouch3.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-05-24T18:19:01.950000-04:00", "shorthed": "Big Four Bridge boosts downtown business", "articleid": 9506161, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd81f7b80aef18fc9ff3cd911b276728a9998bb7/c=0-306-3264-2142/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/24/andycrouch3.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ddfec6da1e1c49c540a50418fed8521c9471641/c=944-0-2321-2448/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/24/andycrouch3.jpg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/charlie.white1"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Charlie White,Big Four Bridge,Big 4 Bridge,Jeffersonville,Louisville,transportation,small business,fitness,exercise,walking"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95d5\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Jeffersonville city engineer Andy Crouch inspected the Big Four ramp for graffiti or other damage two days after it opened.\nJeffersonville city engineer Andy Crouch returned Thursday to look for graffiti and any other damage, finding none.\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Jeffersonville fire and safety officials discuss changes after the opening of the Big Four ramp.\nHe also said the city may look into adding electronic counters like the Louisville side uses to help determine exactly how many people use the bridge.\nRELATED: Indiana side of Big Four Bridge completedCity redevelopment and economic director Rob Waiz said Friday that new visitors so far seem to \"have been really good\" about using the ramp."}
