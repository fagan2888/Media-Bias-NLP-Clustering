(AP) \u2014 As if there weren\u2019t already enough humiliating elements to San Francisco\u2019s lopsided loss to its biggest rival on Thanksgiving night, owner Jed York weighed in on an effort he said \u201cwasn\u2019t acceptable.\u201d\n\nCassie Baalke, daughter of general manager Trent Baalke, called for offensive coordinator Greg Roman\u2019s ouster before quickly deleting her Twitter post and later closing the account altogether.\n\nTrent Baalke issued a statement Friday saying he and Cassie had apologized to Roman.\n\n\u201cMy daughter and I both regret that her feelings got the best of her after last night\u2019s game and that she chose social media as an avenue to express her feelings. We have apologized to Greg for this unfortunate matter,\u201d Baalke said. \u201cWhile disappointed, as a father I will use this as a teachable moment to help my daughter grow.\u201d\n\nJust when the 49ers had some nice momentum as they approached the season\u2019s final month, it all went away in a matter of four hours in a 19-3 loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s playoff hopes dwindled in the process.\n\n\u201cAny time you lose, it\u2019s a low point,\u201d wide receiver Anquan Boldin said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\n\nThe offense was awful. Quarterback Colin Kaepernick had one of his worst games as a pro. Richard Sherman and the Seattle Seahawks celebrated all over the home field that hardly offered much advantage when fans left in early.\n\n\u201cWe celebrate every play. Even when they get a catch and it\u2019s a great hit, we celebrate that. They didn\u2019t even understand that,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThey were getting frustrated that we were celebrating those plays, but that happens when you\u2019re a team and you\u2019re together.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for these downtrodden Niners? Coach Jim Harbaugh spoke about a \u201creboot.\u201d\n\nThe speculation is running rampant again that he might get the boot following season four of his $25 million, five-year contract he signed in January 2011.\n\nAny day-after thoughts would have to wait. Harbaugh isn\u2019t scheduled to address the media again until Monday, with players likely on Tuesday as is the team\u2019s regular schedule.\n\nThat\u2019s a long few days for team executives, coaches, players and fans to figure out what went so wrong.\n\nYork posted on Twitter in the waning moments: \u201cThank you (hashtag)49ersfaithful for coming out strong tonight. This performance wasn\u2019t acceptable. I apologize for that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "49ers emotionally reeling after embarrassing loss", "title": "49ers emotionally reeling after embarrassing loss", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "49ers emotionally reeling after embarrassing loss", "title": "49ers emotionally reeling after embarrassing loss", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/28/49ers_emotionally_reeling_after_embarrassing_loss/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/seahawks-49ers-football.jpeg16-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "49ers emotionally reeling after embarrassing loss", "title": "49ers emotionally reeling after embarrassing loss", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/seahawks-49ers-football.jpeg16-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "JANIE McCAULEY", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1f4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey were getting frustrated that we were celebrating those plays, but that happens when you\u2019re a team and you\u2019re together.\u201dWhat\u2019s next for these downtrodden Niners?\nThat\u2019s a long few days for team executives, coaches, players and fans to figure out what went so wrong.\nRichard Sherman and the Seattle Seahawks celebrated all over the home field that hardly offered much advantage when fans left in early.\nHarbaugh isn\u2019t scheduled to address the media again until Monday, with players likely on Tuesday as is the team\u2019s regular schedule.\nYork posted on Twitter in the waning moments: \u201cThank you (hashtag)49ersfaithful for coming out strong tonight."}
