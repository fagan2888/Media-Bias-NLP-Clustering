CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — A Colorado nonprofit group is helping a Cheyenne animal shelter trap feral cats so they can be spayed or neutered and then released.

The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports (http://bit.ly/1X9nCyj) Northern Colorado Friends of Ferals and the Cheyenne Animal Shelter are working together toward ultimately establishing a trap-neuter-return program in Cheyenne.

Feral cats are fixed and then released to prevent other cats from arriving in the area.

A Best Friends Animal Society grant is funding the pilot project.

Friends of Ferals director Leslie Vogt says workers brought traps to Cheyenne mobile home parks at the request of residents there.

Over a dozen cats were caught in March.

More are expected to be caught as temperatures warm up.
